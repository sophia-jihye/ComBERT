Production and Sales of Energy Saving Flow Control Equipment 

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s current principal business is the production and sales of energy-saving flow control equipment, and intelligent flow control equipment. This business accounts for the majority of the Company&#8217;s revenues.

&#160;

Pipeline transport is one of the basic modes of transportation together with rail transport, road transport, air transport and water transport. Water, gas, oil, and heat rely on various kinds of pipelines and pipe networks to be transported to end users. In the case of water pipelines, such systems are also used for public health and safety, and waste and flood control.

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The key to the efficiency and energy conservation of the pipeline transportation process is the valve and the flow control equipment. Having unique technology in this field, the Company has obtained four patents and holds fourteen utilization model patents in China for flow control devices, especially in the area of the bidirectional seal zero revelation installation system with its special characteristics. Using valves of this type can result in reduced energy consumption by 20% for customers compared to traditional valves. The reduced energy consumption thereby increases the efficiency of the pipeline system. It is widely used in the fields of electric power, hydro power, petroleum, and natural gas. The Company&#8217;s super intelligent flow-control device was awarded &#8220;Number One Energy Saving Valve of China&#8221; by the Chinese Energy Conservation Association. Our products are exported to the United States, Russia, Turkey, Italy, Bulgaria, South Korea, Vietnam, India, Thailand, South Africa, Iraq, and Afghanistan.

&#160;

The &#8220;M type high torque flow control device&#8221; providing for LXB project, the maximum output torque is 1.7 million N.m , 90 degrees of rotation and total ratio is 175:1. Not only improves the quality of product , but also reduces the cost such that has reached international advanced level.

&#160;

Another main business is the energy saving technology engineering and service, the Company will continue to develop comprehensive energy conservation and energy reduction equipment and services, and to pursue research development and improved manufacturing of flow control and clean energy related equipment.

&#160;

Energy Saving Reconstruction Projects 

&#160;

1. Energy Efficiency Retrofitting Projects on Industrial Boilers and Furnaces 

&#160;

Our business also focuses on the reconstruction of various industrial boiler/furnace systems with the objective of modernization and improvement in the overall efficiency of existing systems. Efficiency can be expressed in several ways, such as lower operating costs, reduced energy consumption, recapture of by-products which can be used for other purposes, and pollution reduction.

&#160;

China&#8217;s industrial boilers and furnaces are used mainly in the iron and steel, metallurgy, building materials, machinery manufacturing, chemical industry and other similar energy consumption industries. Their energy consumption accounts for about 10% of China&#8217;s total energy consumption. It is estimated that as many as half of the enterprises have outdated technology and equipment, and experience a significant waste of energy. Using our existing technology, we can reconstruct the boiler&#8217;s or furnace&#8217;s structure, its heat source system, combustion system, and control system, and thereby both improve the overall efficiency of the system and yield important conservation and pollution control benefits.

&#160;

One of the most important opportunities for the Company is to undertake projects that refurbish or reconstruct industrial boilers and create cogeneration opportunities for coal fired boilers. It is estimated that as many as 95% of the industrial boilers in China use coal as fuel. These types of industrial boilers are very inefficient because: most industrial coal burning boilers are traditional traveling grate boilers. Only a small portion of the coal fired boilers are equipped with advanced technology, such as pulverized coal combustion or circulating fluidized bed. Due to their combustion type and low thermal efficiency, traditional coal fired boilers emit more CO 2 and NOx, and they are typically under their manufacture rated operation life. Overall, it is estimated that these types of boilers are operating at about 60-70% of energy efficiency, which is approximately 20% below that of international best practice. The inefficiency, in part, results from their use of mixed sizes of coal particles in layer combustion. Among these types of boilers, about 60% of them are clockwise rotation boilers. The use of the differing sizes of the coal particles results in remarkable low combustion efficiency, due to poor ventilation and accumulation of dust which chokes the combustion. Therefore, coal is not totally burned and there is a loss of potential energy. The current methods of coal feed to the boilers and the current combustion cannot solve this problem. At present, there are approximately 0.3~0.4 million sets of traveling grate boilers in-use in China, the Company sees a significant opportunity to focus on boiler transformation technology and projects.

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s solution is to redesign and reconstruct elements of an existing boiler or boiler system to improve its overall performance and increase its optimization rates. This is done in a number of different ways, such as the following:

&#160;

The Company has mature technology and know-how to redesign and reconstruct elements of existing coal fired boiler and boiler system to improve their overall performance and optimize their energy efficiency and reduce their emissions. This can be done in a number of different ways, such as the following:

&#160;

a) Traditional boilers using pulverized coal or with a clockwise rotation chain grate system can be refitted with circulating fluidized bed combustion technology. This change has the benefit of allowing the boiler to improve the thermal efficiency while using low grade coal. The ash from the fluidized bed combustion system can be used for making building materials, which is a valuable by-product and reduces pollution output.

&#160;

b) The control system of a boiler can be either reconstructed or modified to improve the operations of the unit and system.

&#160;

c) The coal feeding system of a boiler can be altered to provide more efficient coal layer arrangement according to different volume and nature of the coal. As a result, combustion rate of coal can be remarkably enhanced in the retrofitted boiler . This technology can effectively improve fuel use efficiency and lower emission and operation cost.

&#160;

d) Another change that can be made to boilers is to improve the ventilation system by adding the right amount of fresh air and increase the turbulence based on computer aided calculation, which can result in increased fuel combustion efficiency and hence reducing the operating costs.

&#160;

e) One of the most important improvements that the Company seeks to introduce into existing and new boiler systems are methods to reclaim discharged water. The Company designs recovery equipment which permits recovery of significant amounts of the waste water used in a traditional boiler. This recovery can also improve the capture of pollutants by the boiler system.

&#160;

f) A boiler&#8217;s heat recovery can be improved, whether it is coal, natural gas or petroleum fueled. By-product heat can be used in a number of different ways, such as to create steam for other uses or localized heating of the factory. The capture and use of the residual heat reduces its emission into the atmosphere thereby reducing heat pollution. This can be an additional source of income or help reduce operating costs and pollution. 

&#160;

The Company is capable of designing and introducing steam thermal systems into existing systems with the effect of recovering the condensed water, eliminating the leakage losses due to faulty or worn steam trap valves and improving the heat preservation systems.

&#160; 

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

2. Motor Drive Reconstruction 

&#160;

In China, motor drive systems use about two thirds of the total electricity consumption of the country. About 90% of these motors are AC asynchronous motors. Nengfa Energy redesigns such systems to convert them so that they can be used for variable load fans and pumps through frequency conversion and speed regulation technology. Nengfa Energy focuses on the reconstruction and energy conservation of the fans of power station boilers, industrial furnaces and kilns, and the energy-saving pumps in the cold/hot water pipe system. As we analyze the whole industrial reconstruction projects, we can also provide power conservation reconstruction in solid material conveyor systems used in the mining, metallurgy, iron and steel industries.

&#160;

It is estimated that approximately 12% of China&#8217;s electric power consumption is for lighting. As one of the most important energy-saving projects, the Chinese government plans to distribute 150 million energy-saving lamps throughout the country during the &#8220;Eleventh Five Year Plan&#8221; period through a fiscal subsidy in an effort to replace inefficient incandescent lamps and other lighting products. The government also plans to reduce the consumption of power by changing the use of lighting through a rational distribution of public lighting, improving the quality of power consumption and introducing on-demand controls.

&#160;

3. Energy-Saving and Reconstruction of Steam Heat Energy System &#160;

&#160;

As a high quality source of secondary energy, steam is widely used in petroleum, petrochemical, chemical, paper making, brewing, tobacco, steel, pharmaceutical, packaging, machinery, and electronics among other industries. The total energy efficiency of steam is directly determined by the system&#8217;s energy efficiency. The characteristics of the steam and condensation system are highly complex, due to factors such as the need for a condensation traps and vacuum breakers, the damage from water hammer, corrosion of the heat exchanger and leakage, condensation, pollution and purification, steam consumption&#8217;s imbalance in winter and summer, steam consumption&#8217;s mismatching between high and low pressures, the flash steam problem, and steam leakage. For a long time, due to the irrationality of system design, the complexity of the system itself, the negligence of owners, the imprecision of management, and the deficiency of maintenance, the overall energy efficiency of steam systems in China is very low. Therefore, the Company believes there is a significant opportunity for energy savings in steam systems:

&#160;

1) Approximately 0.5 billion tons of standard coal is consumed annually in China, which is more than 1/3 of the total national consumption of fossil fuels of the country.

&#160;

2) The overall energy efficiency of steam systems in China is only approximately 30%, which is 25% lower than that of industrialized countries.

&#160;

3) The annual energy waste due to the low energy efficiency of steam systems is approximately 120 million ton of coal equivalent (tce), which is estimated to be worth over 120 billion RMB.

&#160;

4) The annual waste due to inefficient transportation and distribution of steam systems is approximately 180 million tce.

&#160;

5) Of the more than 1 million traps being used in steam systems in China, 60% of them have above average leakage, 30% of them have serious leakage, and only less than 10% work normally. The waste due to trap leakage is significant.

&#160;

6) Current condensation systems are generally designed in such a way as to be inappropriate to the system, resulting in the average recovery rate being less than 30% thus; causing large waste of heat energy and water.

&#160;

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Working with energy saving experts in steam systems in China, the Company has built a steam system department. This department has an R&#38;D and design team, which can provide energy conservation solutions for efficient and the long lasting energy saving results. Under normal conditions, the reduction of steam energy cost is generally between 10% and 25%.

&#160;

Our energy conservation solutions improve energy efficiency in steam systems in five principal ways, covering the entire process of the steam and condensation system: steam generation, steam transportation and distribution, steam consumption, and condensation recovery and condensation purification.

&#160;

1) Steam generation stage &#160;

Our energy saving measures include: using the boiler&#8217;s long-term stable heat sink resources to fully absorb low temperature waste heat and reduce fuel consumption; correctly designing the generator in order to reduce the steam consumption of the deoxygenizing process and increasing the efficiency of the boiler; controlling boiler blowdown and fully utilizing the waste heat of blowdown water; adjusting the steam load with steam accumulator; and improving the quality of steam.

&#160;

2) Steam transportation and distribution stage &#160;

Our energy saving measures include: designing the most economical flow speed of steam, reducing leakage, draining condensation correctly, filtering dirt and debris, reducing pressure drop loss, improving steam quality, and avoiding water hammer. The most serious problems to be addressed are water hammer, big drops in steam pressure, high steam humidity and low steam quality caused by errors in the design of the condensation trapping system.

&#160;

3) Steam consumption stage &#160;

In this stage, we improve the energy efficiency of the steam system by studying the difference in details between designed and actual steam consumption of each heat exchanger, and looking for the root causes of excessive energy consumption; consuming lower pressure steam as far as possible when meeting the process&#8217;s demands; equipping the system with a vacuum breaker and air valve in beehive heat exchangers; designing a condensation trapping system correctly to avoid waterlogging; controlling temperatures automatically in the heating process; installing a separator for steam and vaporous water in the inlet of important equipment to ensure steam quality; optimizing the condensation pipe system according to the residual pressure of each heat exchanger; and enhancing daily inspection and maintenance.

&#160;

4) Condensation recovery stage &#160;

In this stage, we improve steam efficiency by optimizing the overall condensation piping system and deploying decentralized, cutting-edge pressure pump recovery technology; comprehensive treatment on flash steam; comprehensive utilization of heat sink resources; and limit water hammer. The key to optimizing the overall condensation piping system is to identify different condensations according to the residual pressure as &#8220;strong&#8221;, &#8220;mainstream&#8221; and &#8220;weak&#8221;, thus minimizing the mutual interference between different residual pressures.

&#160;

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

5) Condensation purification stage &#160;

The Company&#8217;s &#8220;solvent impregnated resin oil desorption technology&#8221; can separate emulsified oil molecules and dissolved oil molecules from high temperature condensation directly through the resin&#8217;s lipophilicity and hydrophobicity. Before separation, &#8220;emulsification breaking&#8221;, &#8220;capturing&#8221; and &#8220;enriching&#8221; are completed automatically. When the oil molecules adsorbed in the face of the resin reaches a certain saturation level, the enriched oil will be separated from the resin as large oil-drops through the flow impact of condensation water inside the tank. After separation the oil-drops float into an oil-water separator and the off-oil resin will start to work automatically. In the oil-water separator the oils will separate from water automatically.

&#160;

Nengfa Energy&#8217;s condensation iron deprivation technology is called &#8220;Powder Ion Exchange Resin Coverage and Filtration Technology&#8221;.. We utilize this technology to separate excessive metal oxides, colloids and iron ion (Fe3+ &#38; Fe2+) from high temperature condensation. The technical principles are filtration, adsorption, and ion replacement; the processes are film formation, operating, toggling, back-washing and film formation again.

&#160;

We estimate the energy saving market for steam systems is very large in China. We believe the annual consumption of steam systems is approximately 0.5 billion tce. The overall energy efficiency of steam systems in China is only approximately 30%, which is 25% lower than well developed countries. The annual energy waste due to low energy efficiency of steam systems is approximately 120 million tce, which is worth over 120 billion RMB. If all the energy saving projects in steam systems were operated under a EPC (Energy Performance Contract) model, and the average profit were to equal three years of energy-saved we estimate, the value of the energy-saving market for steam system in China would be approximately 360 billion RMB.

&#160;

In addition to the patent protection that we seek, we also rely on the confidentiality of our operations, proprietary know-how and business secrets. Although we do not have formal agreements with our employees, we do consider our employees&#8217; work to be proprietary and owned by the Company. Where necessary, we will take steps to protect our intellectual property interests under the laws of the PRC. There can be no assurance that we will be able to enforce our rights if they are improperly taken by our employees or adopted by our competitors outside of sanctioned use and royalty agreements with the Company.

&#160;

Certain of our service offerings will not be patentable or otherwise be capable of being registered as intellectual property. Therefore, the Company will rely solely on such services being proprietary. As such the Company will have to rely on the services being more advanced or better than its competitors&#8217; offerings or rely on trade secret laws and protections. Such protections in the PRC are considered rather weak and are difficult if not impossible to enforce. Consequently, it may be possible for our competitors to obtain our information and to copy, adopt or adapt our methods, services and technical aspects to their own business with no assurance that we will be able to prevent them from using the intellectual property in competition with us.

The Company does not have any significant trademarks in use at this time. As our business develops, we will consider the advantage of developing specific trademarks for our products and services and have registered those marks with the PRC government authorities for trademark protection.

Markets and Customers 

&#160; 

The transport of water and fluid energy, such as oil, gas, steam and hot water depends on pipelines. The intelligent flow control device supplied by NF Energy is an important part in the fluid energy transportation systems. According to &#8220;the 12th Five-Year) National Strategic Emerging Industry Development Plan&#8221;, China will invest 4 trillion yuan in the next 5-10 years into the South-North Water Diversion Projects.. Since it was founded in 2006, the Company has supplied its products to many projects of this national water works, including the middle and northern Guangxi Xijiang River Water Diversion Project, Shenzhen Water Supply Project, Shanghai Water Diversion Project, and the 7 urban water supply projects in Liaoning Province, three curved water diversion projects in Dandong, and other major domestic water diversion projects. We have the best industry performance in water supply projects. At the same time, we also provide flow control devices and equipment for s upercritical thermal power plants and ultra-supercritical coal-fired power plants as well as domestic hydro power generation market which are dominated by China&#8217;s state-owned five big power groups. More than 80% of the Company&#8217;s annual revenues come from these markets and customers. 

&#160; 

In connection with its work on the water diversion project and some of the power plant projects, the Company has a preferred provider agreement with Nengfa Weiye Tieling Valve Joint Stock Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Tieling Valve&#8221;) under which Nengfa Energy is the preferred provider of the valves and other related flow control equipment that Tieling Valve requires in its own work on the water diversion project. The agreement is in the manner of a right of first refusal whereby Tieling Valve is obliged to offer supply opportunities to Nengfa Energy within its scope of product offerings and expertise, but Tieling Valve is not prohibited from developing other supply arrangements. Tieling Valve and Nengfa Energy have agreed to cooperate to develop and market their respective technologies, equipment, products and services for their respective and mutual benefit, and will work together to examine and expand their respective businesses. Under the agreement, each party retains full right to their respective intellectual property. The agreement terminates in 2021, but by its terms will automatically extend for additional one year terms unless notice of termination is given by one party to the other at least six months prior to the then termination date.

&#160;

The Company will focus its marketing to the wind power generation and the boiler/furnace industry through participation in and addressing government organizations and industry associations related to energy conservation and emission reduction. Marketing will also focus on equipment suppliers and end-users such as the larger and medium sized high energy consumption enterprises that provide or use the kinds of products and services that the Company currently offers or plans to offer. The focus will not only be to sell the products and services, but also to learn of the customer&#8217;s needs so that the Company can develop and adapt its products and services to the needs of its customer base. Another important aspect of the marketing strategy will be to participate directly in the consulting and reconstruction services of energy conservation projects organized by government agencies. Nevertheless, the Company plans to continue to participate in the bidding process for government projects, in an effort to enhance its market position.

The Company&#8217;s marketing and sales strategy also relies on the use of exclusive agents throughout China who act as marketing agents and after sale service providers. The Company currently has 23 exclusive distributing agents national wide. At certain times each year, the Company provides and organizes training sessions for these agents and their personnel. These sessions provide the Company with a valuable opportunity to gather feedback and to foster an exchange of technical ideas. These agents have agreements with the Company to sell NF flow control equipment and systems. The Company evaluates the performance of these exclusive agents annually, based on how well they achieve the annual sales target established by the Company. The Company typically will terminate its agreement with those agents that miss the sales targets for two consecutive years without good reasons.

&#160;

Raw Materials 

&#160;

The major raw materials for our production are pig iron, steel, copper, and plastic. We source our materials locally in China. Nengfa Energy is located in Liaoning Province which is China&#8217;s largest production base for iron and steel. We have stable long term supply arrangements for our principal raw material suppliers based on long standing business relationships. Since we are located close to the supplies of many of our essential raw materials, we enjoy price and transportation cost advantages over our competitors and competing users. Through our advanced technology and our management of raw materials, we are able to manage and improve our consumption rates of the raw materials we use in production, which results in lower operating expense and extension of our inventories.

&#160; 

Regulatory Compliance 

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s products are subject to regulatory standards and enforcement codes which typically require that these products meet stringent performance criteria. Standards are established by industry testing and certification organizations such as the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (A.S.M.E.), the Canadian Standards Association (C.S.A.), the Japanese Standards Association (J.S.A.), the International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials (I.A.P.M.O.), Factory Mutual (F.M.), and Underwriters Laboratory (U.L.). These standards are incorporated into state and municipal plumbing and heating, building and fire protection codes in China.

&#160;

We maintain stringent quality control and testing procedures at our manufacturing facility in order to manufacture products in compliance with code requirements. Our production management is certified to conform to the ISO 9001 standards by the Det Norske Veritas Management System.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The Company holds a leading position in the super diameter energy efficient flow control system market in China. The Company has an extensive competitive advantage over Chinese domestic manufactures in this field. Other manufactures that are focusing on the development of different and smaller valve products may enter this field. Our major potential competitor in this field is China Valve Technology.

&#160;

In the other areas of the Company&#8217;s business, there are many different competitors with differing focuses and strengths. To some extent, boilers and furnaces are specialized to particular industries and output requirements. This specialization engenders specialization in the design, manufacture and installation of new equipment and retrofit solutions. Therefore, there are many engineering and manufacturing companies that focus on certain types of boilers and furnaces resulting in a relatively fragmented market for these services. The same is true for the retrofit and reconstruction of other industrial systems for improved energy efficiency, as well as for the localized projects for energy conservation and biomass utilization, and similar projects. Therefore, the competition that the Company faces tends to be localized companies with no dominant players at this time.

&#160;

The utilization of gasified biomass energy is matured in China. Although the technology is widely used in China, it is still at a stage of individual household build gas digesters, rather with a large scale piped gas supply system. The county-city level gas supply project the Company concentrates on will generate a local area monopoly business operation. There is no direct competition in short term.

&#160;

We plan to compete based on our ability to address a wide spectrum of solutions in our various market areas. We believe our competitive advantages result from our patented technologies, our strategic relationships with engineering companies, our marketing and our business relationships. We plan to continue to expand these aspects of our business to further grow our core businesses and provide solutions for the energy savings and green energy projects. We intend to participate actively in the government sponsored projects and government contracting.

&#160;

Research and Development 

&#160;

The research and development expenses are to develop new products or new production technologies. The research and development expenses include the materials and labor costs, application fees for patents and significant improvements to existing products. We incurred $105,168 and $107,872 of research and development expenses in 2015 and 2014, respectively.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, there were 220 employees including 31 technical staff working in our subsidiaries located in China. We believe we have a good relationship with our employees.
