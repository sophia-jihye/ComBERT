Overview 

We are an immuno-oncology company developing novel therapies intended to activate a patient&#146;s immune system to fight cancer. Using our T cell-stimulating platform technologies, ImPACT &#174; (Immune Pan-Antigen Cytotoxic Therapy) and ComPACT TM (Combination Pan-Antigen Cytotoxic Therapy), we have generated several product candidates that we believe may be effective in treating certain forms of cancer. Our platform technologies address two synergistic mechanisms of action: activation of CD8+ T cells, or &#147;killer&#148; T cells; and T cell co-stimulation. We believe the use of these technologies has the potential to enhance patients' natural immune response against certain cancers. 

Using our ImPACT &#174; platform technology, we have developed product candidates that consist of live, genetically-modified, irradiated human cancer cells which secrete a broad spectrum of tumor-associated antigens (&#147;TAAs&#148;) together with a potent immune response stimulator called &#147;gp96.&#148; The secreted antigen-gp96/TAA complexes activate a patient&#146;s immune system to recognize and kill cancer cells that express the TAAs included in the product candidates, which we have engineered to address the most prevalent TAAs present in the &#147;tumor signature&#148; of a specific cancer.

Our ComPACT TM platform technology enables us to combine a pan-antigen T cell activating vaccine and a T cell co-stimulator in a single product, offering the potential benefits of combination immunotherapy without the need for multiple independent biologic products. Using ComPACT TM , we have engineered new product candidates that incorporate various ligand fusion proteins targeting co-stimulatory receptors (OX40, ICOS, 4-1BB) into the gp96-Ig expression vector, resulting in a single product candidate that includes both a pan-antigen T cell priming vaccine and a T cell co-stimulator.

Using our platform technologies, we produce product candidates from allogeneic cell lines selected to express the broadest array of commonly shared tumor antigens for a specified type of cancer. Unlike autologous or &#147;personalized&#148; therapeutic vaccine approaches that require the extraction of blood or tumor tissue from each patient and the creation of an individualized treatment, our product candidates are fully allogeneic, do not require extraction of individual patient&#146;s material or custom manufacturing. As a result, our product candidates can be mass-produced and readily available for immediate patient use. Because each patient receives the same treatment, we believe that our immunotherapy approach offers logistical, manufacturing and other cost benefits compared to one-off, patient-specific approaches. 

Using our ImPACT &#174; platform technology, we have developed HS-410 (vesigenurtacel-L) as a product candidate to treat non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (&#147;NMIBC&#148;) and HS-110 (viagenpumatucel-L), intended for use in combination with an anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor, as a potential treatment for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (&#147;NSCLC&#148;). To-date, we have administered in excess of 1,000 doses of HS-410 and HS-110 collectively in approximately 200 patients. We are currently conducting a Phase 2 trial of HS-410 in patients with NMIBC and a Phase 1b trial of HS-110, in combination with nivolumab (Opdivo&#174;), a Bristol-Myers Squibb PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor, to treat patients with NSCLC. Using our ComPACT TM platform technology, we have developed HS-120 as a potential treatment for NSCLC. We expect to file an Investigational New Drug, or IND, submission for our first ComPACT TM product candidate for non-small cell lung cancer (HS-120) in the second half of 2016.

&#160;

The table below summarizes our current product candidates and their stages of development: 

HS-410

HS-410 (vesigenurtacel-L) is a biologic product candidate comprising a cancer cell line genetically modified using our ImPACT &#174; technology platform to secrete a wide range of cancer antigens related to bladder cancer bound to gp96 molecules . We believe that HS-410 has the potential to activate a T cell mediated pan-antigen immune response that could be an effective treatment for patients with NMBIC.

We are currently conducting a Phase 2 trial evaluating HS-410 either alone or in combination with intravesical standard of care, Bacillus Calmette-Gu&#233;rin (BCG), for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC. The primary endpoint is one-year disease free survival. Heat completed enrollment for the Phase 2 trial&#146;s three randomized, combination arms and anticipates reporting topline efficacy, immune-response and safety data in the fourth quarter of 2016. 

On February 10, 2016, we announced that the U.S. FDA had lifted the partial clinical hold on our HS-410 Phase 2 clinical trial and that patient enrollment had resumed; clinical timelines were materially unchanged. On February 3, 2016, we announced that we had concluded that the cell line on which HS-410 is based, which is a prostate cancer cell line, had been previously misidentified as a bladder cancer cell line, that we had advised the U.S. FDA of this conclusion and that the U.S. FDA had placed our HS-410 Phase 2 clinical trial on partial clinical hold while they reviewed certain updated documentation provided by us related to the misidentification. The misidentification related to the origin of the cell line and not to the antigen profile or other characteristics of the cell line, which have been accurately characterized throughout the clinical development of HS-410. The partial clinical hold did not relate to concerns regarding the safety and efficacy of HS-410. All data generated and reported remained unchanged, including HS-410&#146;s positive safety profile, immune response and shared antigenic profile with patient tumors. Upon becoming aware of the misidentification, we amended all of the documentation necessary to correct the error, including the related investigator brochure, study protocol and informed consent form.

Due to the short duration of the clinical hold, we do not expect any material change in our clinical timelines. In addition, we do not expect that the misidentification will have any adverse effect on the future clinical development of HS-410. While our rights to the prostate cancer cell line are non-exclusive, we believe that our intellectual property portfolio, which we expect to be unaffected by the misidentification, will provide us with appropriate protection for the development and potential commercialization of HS-410 as described elsewhere in this form.

&#160;

In January 2016, we reported three-month interim data from the unblinded, monotherapy cohort of our company&#146;s ongoing Phase 2 trial of HS-410 for the treatment of NMIBC at the Phacilitate Immunotherapy World Conference. In the monotherapy arm, a series of weekly intradermal injections of HS-410 is being dosed as an alternative to BCG. Images of the bladder taken from several treated patients showed changes that resemble lymphoid (T cell rich) structures that we have observed in biopsy samples, which we believe indicates that HS-410 is generating an immune response as expected. Six out of seven patients in the 25-patient arm, who had reached the 3-month timepoint after treatment with HS-410 alone, remained recurrence free. One of those patients had carcinoma in situ ( CIS ) &#150; the patient population believed to be least responsive to BCG &#150; and that patient experienced complete response. 

In November 2015, we announced the results from our Phase 1 trial, evaluating the safety and immune response of HS-410, after surgery and treatment with BCG, in patients with high-risk NMIBC. In that trial, HS-410 exhibited a positive safety profile and was well-tolerated with no serious adverse events (SAEs) and no patients discontinuing the trial due to adverse events (AEs). 7 out of the 10 patients had no documented recurrence of cancer &#62;1 year after treatment. 3 out of 4 patients with CIS did not experience a recurrence one year after treatment. In the study subjects, HS-410 elicited a broad-based (polyclonal) expansion of patient T cells and a high level of CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Additionally, based on tissue samples taken from each patient, HS-410 shared 15 or more tumor antigens in common with those expressed on the patients' cancer cells, which we believe supports our belief that HS-410 has the ability to target a broad range of tumor antigens. These data confirm previous preclinical findings regarding the unique mechanism of action for HS-410. Moreover, third-party analysis of blinded samples from the trial demonstrated a strong correlation between baseline characteristics of TILs by T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing and clinical outcome. Specifically, the 7 patients who remained disease free after one year exhibited the greatest clonal expansion of intratumoral T cells (p-value 0.0126). 

In October 2015, we completed enrollment of our 75-patient, blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled arms of our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating HS-410 in combination with BCG in patients with high risk NMIBC. We are enrolling an additional 25 patients to evaluate HS-410 as a monotherapy in an unblinded, open-label arm of this same trial, and we anticipate completing enrollment of this arm in the first half of 2016. Our Phase 2 trial will examine safety, tolerability, immune response and preliminary clinical activity of HS-410. The primary endpoint is one-year disease free survival. We expect to report topline efficacy, immune-response and safety results in the fourth quarter of 2016. 

In March 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#147;FDA&#148;) granted Fast Track designation for HS-410 for the treatment of NMIBC. The Fast Track program is designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of therapies intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The advantages of Fast Track designation include actions to expedite development, including opportunities for frequent interactions with the FDA review team to discuss all aspects of developments to support approval and eligibility for priority review depending on clinical data at the time of Biologics License Application (&#147;BLA&#148;) submission. We believe that this designation will expedite our development of HS-410.

HS-110 

We are conducting a Phase 1b clinical trial evaluating HS-110 in combination with nivolumab (Opdivo&#174;), a Bristol-Myers Squibb PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor, to treat patients with NSCLC. The multicenter, open-label trial is expected to initially enroll 18 patients and is designed to accommodate cohort expansion up to 30 patients in total. The purpose of the trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of HS-110 in combination with nivolumab, an FDA approved anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor, in patients with NSCLC whose cancers have progressed after first-line therapy. Primary and secondary trial endpoints include safety and tolerability, immune response, overall response rate and progression-free survival. Top-line objective response rate and 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) data are expected by the end of 2016 for these first 18 patients. 

We also are conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating HS-110 in combination with low dose cyclophosphamide versus chemotherapy alone as a potential third-line or fourth-line treatment in patients with NSCLC. We completed enrollment of 66 patients in this study in September 2015. These patients will be followed for immune response and overall survival with data expected to be reported in the fourth quarter of 2016.

&#160;

The inventor of the ImPACT &#174; technology that we license reported results in February 2013 from a Phase 1 open-label, single center clinical trial of HS-110 in patients with advanced NSCLC. We believe the results provide clinical evidence that HS-110 is capable of generating anti-cancer immune responses. In the study, 18 patients were vaccinated, and 15 of the 18 vaccinated patients completed the first course of three planned courses of therapy. Two patients completed all three planned courses of therapy (defined as three, six-week treatment cycles). HS-110 showed no overt toxicity. There were no serious adverse events (SAEs) that were considered by the trial investigator to be treatment-related. Most of the adverse events (AEs) were reported as mild or moderate (grade 1 or 2) with the most frequent being injection site reactions and rash that were transitory and usually resolved in one to two weeks. We believe the results of this Phase 1 trial with HS-110 demonstrate that HS-110 is capable of generating a CD8-CTL IFN- &#947; immune response in patients with advanced NSCLC. Eleven of the fifteen patients (73%) who completed the first course of therapy with HS-110, exhibited a two-fold or greater increase in CD8 cells secreting interferon gamma (CD8-CTL IFN- &#947; ). The estimated median survival of these eleven patients was 16.5 months (95% CI:7.1-20.0). In comparison, the 4 patients who failed to show increased CD8-CTL IFN- &#947; responses survived 2.1, 2.3, 6.7, and 6.7 months, or a median survival of 4.5 months, which is consistent with the expected survival times in this patient population. In 7 of 18 treated patients tumor growth was stabilized, however no partial or complete tumor responses (e.g., reduction or disappearance of tumors) were observed in any of the 18 patients. The median one-year overall survival rate of patients in the study was 44% (95% CI:21.6-65.1), comparing favorably to a 5.5% rate based on published data from a 43-patient advanced lung cancer population. One of the late-stage lung cancer patients survived over four years since starting the therapy and another patient survived over three years since starting the therapy. These findings were consistent with multiple preclinical published studies on ImPACT &#174; therapy.

Additional Indications 

We continue to evaluate other potential indications for our ImPACT &#174; and ComPACT TM platform technologies. Specifically, using ComPACT TM , we have developed cell lines for several other cancers with the first product candidate being a second-generation therapy for non-small cell lung cancer (HS-120). Our decision to further pursue these product candidates or any additional product candidates other than our two lead product candidates will be based in part upon available funding and partnering opportunities. On February 18, 2015, we announced a collaboration with OncoSec Medical Inc. to evaluate the feasibility of OncoSec&#146;s ImmunoPulse in vivo electroporation technology for intra-tumoral delivery of gp96-Ig encoding DNA plasmids to activate specific immune responses against &#145;private,&#146; mutation-derived tumor neo-antigens. This collaboration is ongoing, and we expect to announce data demonstrating that intratumoral electroporation of ComPACT TM plasmid DNA leads to release of tumor specific neo antigens in the first half of 2016. 

ComPACT TM 

On June 15, 2015, we announced the development of a next-generation platform incorporating various T cell costimulatory ligand fusion proteins into the gp96-Ig expression vector. ComPACT TM combines a pan-antigen T cell priming vaccine and T cell co-stimulator in a single product, offering the potential benefits of combination immunotherapy in a single drug without the need for multiple independent biologic products. ComPACT TM has been engineered to incorporate various fusion proteins targeting co-stimulatory receptors (OX40, ICOS, 4-1BB), enabling the combination of two important immunotherapy pathways in a single drug. For our ComPACT TM platform technology, we expect to file an IND for our first ComPACT TM product candidate for NSCLC (HS-120) in the second half of 2016. 

ImPACT &#174; Therapy 

Our ImPACT &#174; therapy is a novel technology platform designed to educate and stimulate the immune system to combat specific disease targets, such as cancer cells. ImPACT &#174; utilizes live attenuated, human-derived, genetically-modified cells to generate an array of tumor associated antigens and secrete an essential immunostimulatory protein called &#147;gp96-Ig&#148;. The secreted proteins are designed to generate an immune response against cancer cells by mobilizing and activating a patient&#146;s own killer T cells to target a broad array of different tumor antigens with the goal of eliminating cancer cells. In contrast with other vaccine technologies that target only one antigen, ImPACT &#174; &#146;s pan-antigen approach may enable the body to induce and maintain an immune response against a broad array of tumor-specific proteins, by potentially providing a more robust and sustained immune response and limiting cancer cells&#146; ability to evade the immune system. We believe the clinical and preclinical results suggest that ImPACT &#174; generates anti-tumor immune responses capable of targeting and destroying tumors. We believe our novel, off-the-shelf, live cell therapy has the potential to be used to combat a wide range of cancers. We have leveraged our existing infrastructure by developing additional product candidates in areas where we can use our proprietary technology. Our success will depend on the clinical and regulatory success of our product candidates and our ability to retain, on commercially reasonable terms, financial and managerial resources, which are currently limited. To date, we have not received regulatory approval for any of our product candidates or derived any revenues from their sales. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will ever receive regulatory approval for any of our product candidates or derive any revenues from their sales.

&#160;

ImPACT &#174; &#160;/ ComPACT TM Platform Technologies Advantages: 

&#183; 

ImPACT &#174; therapy represents a cell-based product platform that functions as both an immune activator and an antigen-delivery vehicle. 

&#183; 

In addition, to our knowledge ImPACT &#174; is the only adjuvant currently in clinical development that is specific to CD8+ cytotoxic T cell immune responses, which we believe is especially important for developing therapeutics in oncology. 

&#183; 

Our therapies do not require an additional adjuvant . Some vaccines require the addition of another drug, called an adjuvant, to enhance their effectiveness. Adjuvants typically cause irritation at the injection site. HS-110, one of our product candidates, is itself an adjuvant, so we do not have to use additional adjuvants to generate and maintain an activated immune response, thereby limiting any injection site reaction to that caused by our own therapies. 

&#183; 

ComPACT TM represents a potential dual-acting immunotherapy, combining a pan-antigen T cell priming vaccine and T cell co-stimulator in a single product. 

&#183; 

To our knowledge, ComPACT TM represents the first dual-acting immunotherapy that provides more effective stimulation of CD8+T cells and higher rates of tumor rejection than are achieved with either individual administration of traditional vaccines, OX40 agonist antibodies, or combinations with OX40 agonist antibodies and traditional vaccines. 

The CD8+ cytotoxic T cell specific nature of our ImPACT &#174; &#160; and ComPACT TM platform technologies predict that they will be most useful in stimulating immune responses for diseases where actual cell-killing is an important part of the therapeutic effect. Cancer, which is a disease of mutated cells, naturally became the first area of focus. ImPACT &#174; &#160; and ComPACT TM applied to cancer therapies contrast in several critical ways to other cancer immunotherapy technologies: 

&#183; 

Both ImPACT &#174; and ComPACT TM platform technologies offer our ready-to-use approach which do not require any personalized manufacturing. We believe our therapeutic vaccines are easier and less expensive to manufacture than autologous vaccines because our therapeutic vaccines do not require the harvesting of blood and/or tumor tissue from each patient in order to manufacture a course of treatment. We believe this is highly advantageous because it can bring the logistics, manufacturing, cost and distribution of our therapeutic vaccines within the purview of traditional biopharmaceutical product channels and dramatically expand our pool of corporate partners. 

&#183; 

Both ImPACT &#174; and ComPACT TM platform technologies stimulate an immune response against the full antigenic repertoire of the cancer cells, not just one or a handful of antigens. Our ImPACT &#174; and ComPACT TM platform technologies are designed to combine broad antigen targeting of known and unknown tumor associated antigens complexed with a potent immune adjuvant. The activated immune response generated by our platform technologies may be useful in treating a wide range of cancers. 

&#183; 

There are no other allogeneic, cell-based vaccine technologies which provide a molecular transporter (gp96-Ig in the case of ImPACT &#174; and ComPACT TM ) to provide specific activation of a patient &#8217; s CD8+ T cells across MHC barriers.

Strategy 

Our objective is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company specializing in the development and commercialization of allogeneic, ready-to-use immunotherapies. Our platform technologies, ImPACT &#174; and ComPACT TM , are designed to address two synergistic mechanisms of action: robust activation of killer T cells and T cell co-stimulation to further enhance patients' immune response. We believe future cancer immunotherapy will involve multiple agents and our platform could work synergistically with other therapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors, which are designed to reverse tumor-induced immune suppression. We are focused on discovering, developing and applying our ImPACT &#174; and ComPACT TM platform technologies towards a number of disease indications. The key elements of our strategy are:

&#183;

Develop and obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates . We have completed enrollment for the randomized arms of our NMIBC Phase 2 trial evaluating HS-410 in combination with BCG. We expect to report topline efficacy, immune response and safety results in the fourth quarter of 2016. We are conducting a Phase 1b trial of HS-110 in combination with nivolumab (Opdivo&#174;), a Bristol-Myers Squibb PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor, to treat patients with NSCLC. Beyond NSCLC and bladder cancer - depending upon funding and partnering opportunities - we plan to initiate additional clinical trials and in some cases expand current clinical trials in these and other disease targets utilizing our ImPACT &#174; and ComPACT TM platform technologies.

&#183;

Maximize commercial opportunity for our ImPACT &#174; and ComPACT TM technology . Our current product candidates target large markets with significant unmet medical needs. For each of our product candidates, we seek to retain all manufacturing, marketing and distribution rights which should give us the ability to maximize the economic potential of any future U.S. or international commercialization efforts. We believe that we should be well positioned to successfully commercialize our product candidates independently or through United States and international corporate partnerships.

&#183;

Enhance our partnering efforts . We are continually exploring partnerships for licensing and other collaborative relationships and remain opportunistic in seeking strategic partnerships.

&#183;

Further expand our broad patent portfolio . We have made a significant investment in the development of our patent portfolio to protect our technologies and programs, and we intend to continue to do so. We have obtained exclusive rights to six different patent families directed to therapeutic compositions and methods related to our vaccine platform and preclinical development programs for cancer and have filed certain additional patent applications that are owned by us. Our ImPACT &#174; / ComPACT TM patent portfolio comprise eighteen issued patents and thirty-one pending patent applications. These patents and applications cover the United States, Europe, and Japan as well as several other countries having commercially significant markets.

&#183;

Manage our business with efficiency and discipline . We believe we have efficiently utilized our capital and human resources to develop and acquire our product candidates and programs, and create a broad intellectual property portfolio. We operate cross-functionally and are led by an experienced management team with backgrounds in developing and commercializing product candidates. We use project management techniques to assist us in making disciplined strategic program decisions and to attempt to limit the risk profile of our product pipeline.

&#160;

&#183;

Obtain additional grant funding . To more fully develop our ImPACT &#174; and ComPACT TM platform technologies and their application to a variety of human diseases, we plan to continue to seek and access external sources of grant funding on our own behalf and in conjunction with our academic and other partners to support the development of our pipeline programs. While we intend to work with our academic partners to secure additional grant funding, these partners have no obligation to work with us to secure such funding. We also intend to continue to evaluate opportunities and, as appropriate, acquire or license technologies that meet our business objectives.

&#183;

Continue to both leverage and fortify our intellectual property portfolio . We believe that we have a strong intellectual property position relating to the development and commercialization of our ImPACT &#174; and ComPACT TM platform technologies. We plan to continue to leverage our portfolio to create value. In addition to fortifying our existing intellectual property position, we intend to file new patent applications, in-license new intellectual property and take other steps to strengthen, leverage, and expand our intellectual property position.

Disease Targets and Markets 

The Oncology Market

The American Cancer Society estimates that 1.69 million people in the United States will be diagnosed with cancer in 2016. The lifetime probability of being diagnosed with an invasive cancer is 43% for men and 38% for women. It is projected that 595,690 Americans will die from cancer in 2016.

Despite continuous advances made in the field of cancer research every year, there remains a significant unmet medical need as the overall five-year survival rate for cancer patients diagnosed between 2004 and 2010 is an average of 68%. According to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, in 2011, cancer was the second leading cause of mortality in the United States (22.9%) behind heart disease (23.7%). The American Cancer Society estimates that one in four deaths in the United States is due to cancer.

The main treatments for cancer are surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. There are often, however, significant debilitating effects resulting from these treatments or lingering morbidity associated with these approaches to treatment of cancer. Our goal is to develop new treatments that can lengthen survival times and improve the quality of life of cancer patients and survivors.

Although there are a large number of patients, treatment and management of cancer is performed by a relatively concentrated pool of medical professionals. We plan to reach this prescriber base using a relatively small commercial infrastructure that we intend to develop in the future by either hiring internally, or partnering or contracting with one or more third-party entities with an established sales force. These development plans are dependent on our raising additional capital and/or receiving grant funding, the success of HS-110, and HS-410 and any technologies we might develop in the future and successful negotiation of commercial relationships, none of which we have completed to date. We believe, however, assuming the efficacy and safety of HS-110 and HS-410 and any other technology we might acquire, that our experienced management team will raise the capital and establish the commercial relationships necessary for success.

&#160;

Limitations of Current Cancer Therapies 

We believe current cancer treatment alternatives suffer from a number of limitations that impair their effectiveness in improving patient survival and overall quality of life including:

&#183;

Toxicity. Chemotherapeutic agents are highly toxic to the human body and very often cause a variety of significant and debilitating side effects, including, but not limited to, nausea and vomiting, bleeding, anemia and mucositis. Some targeted therapeutics have fewer systemic toxicities, but still typically have off-target effects such as gastrointestinal inflammation, severe skin reactions and breathing difficulties. These side effects limit a patient's ability to tolerate treatment and as such can deprive the patient of the potential benefit of additional treatments or treatment combinations that might otherwise destroy or prevent the growth of cancer cells. Once they become aware of the limited efficacy, limited increased survival and potentially significant toxicity of existing treatment alternatives, many patients diagnosed with terminal cancer choose to limit or forego therapy in order to avoid further compromising their quality of life. Patients with advanced stage cancer also often cannot tolerate cancer therapy, and certain therapies can hasten death as the patient's health further deteriorates from the therapy applied.

&#183;

Mechanism of action. While many current therapeutic approaches can be effective against specific targeted cells, the efficacy of these therapies in treating cancer over the long term generally is limited by the abundance and diversity of the cancer and tumor cells, which are believed to enable the targeted cells to adapt and become resistant to the current therapeutic approach over time.

&#183;

Short-term approach. Other than tumor removal in a surgical procedure, curing the cancer is often not the intent or a potential outcome of many current cancer therapies. Rather, increased survival time is the primary focus of many currently marketed and development-stage cancer therapeutics. In this regard, many cancer therapies show only a modest impact on the overall survival of the patients and only affect the length of time that passes after treatment begins and before the patient&#146;s disease worsens or the patient dies.

&#183;

Immune system suppression. A weakened immune system not only inhibits the body's natural ability to fight cancer, but also causes patients to become more susceptible to infections and other diseases. Current approaches to cancer treatment generally involve introduction of an agent, such as a chemical, an antibody or radiation, which causes cell apoptosis (programmed cell death) or inhibits the proliferation of all cells, including immune cells, which has the unintended consequence of indirectly suppressing the immune system.

Immunotherapy Overview 

Our ImPACT &#174; and ComPACT TM platform technologies are forms of immunotherapy. Immunotherapy involves administration of a therapeutic agent that enlists or boosts a subject&#146;s immune system in order to fight disease.

Commonly recognized successful examples of immunotherapy include prophylactic vaccines, such as, childhood immunizations against infectious diseases such as measles, mumps, and rubella. In these cases, usually weakened (attenuated) or inactivated viruses are injected into the body to educate certain immune system cells to recognize and remember small pieces of viral or bacterial proteins (antigens). If and when an individual is subsequently exposed to this same pathogen, the immune system will recognize these antigens immediately and mount a potent immune response to neutralize and eliminate the pathogenic threat.

Therapeutic vaccines, such as ImPACT &#174; and ComPACT TM -based product candidates, operate in a fashion similar to prophylactic vaccines except that therapeutic vaccines are administered after a particular disease is already present. In each case, the human immune system is educated and harnessed to recognize and fight the disease of interest. Cancer can be considered a failure of the immune system to effectively recognize and eliminate inappropriately dividing and multiplying (malignant) cells. Under ordinary circumstances the human immune system continuously monitors and eliminates inappropriately dividing cells. However, for reasons that are not entirely understood, under cancerous conditions the immune system fails to recognize malignant cells and such cells are permitted to inappropriately multiply, grow and metastasize to form tumors which can eventually become life threatening. Our therapeutic vaccines are designed to assist the immune system in identifying and eliminating malignant cells. Our approach involves activating strong T cell immune responses against cellular antigens that are characteristic of malignant cells with the goal of destroying the cancer expressing those antigens.

Immunotherapy is designed to stimulate and enhance the body&#146;s natural mechanism for killing cancer cells and virus-infected cells. Generally, immunotherapeutic approaches to treat disease can be separated into two distinct classes, passive and active, based on their mechanism of action.

Passive Immunotherapy : Passive immunotherapies generally consist of monoclonal antibodies directed at a single disease-specific enzyme or protein on the surface of the targeted cells with the goal of either killing the targeted cells or preventing them from dividing. Rather than stimulate or otherwise use the body&#146;s immune system to initiate the attack on the disease, the attack is made by the therapy which is produced ex vivo, or outside of the body. These therapies also are not usually personalized for the patient.

Active Immunotherapy : Active immunotherapies generally consist of therapies intended to trigger or stimulate the body&#146;s own immune system to fight disease. Active immunotherapies have no direct therapeutic action but rather contain antigens specifically designed to activate the patient&#146;s own immune system to find and kill the targeted cells that carry the same antigen. Active immunotherapies depend on the patient&#146;s immune system to seek out and destroy targeted cells or tumors. Most active immunotherapies utilize off-the-shelf antigens, known as &#147;defined&#148; antigens, rather than individualized, patient specific antigens, and are often paired with adjuvants, which are agents that generally activate the immune system cells to increase immune response.

Shortcomings of Immunotherapies : Both passive and active immunotherapy approaches have shortcomings, which include:

&#183;

Most active immunotherapies use normal, non-mutated, self-antigens which are typically poor at stimulating immune responses, even from healthy immune systems. In fact, the human immune system generally does not generate immune responses against self-antigens. Most passive and active immunotherapies also target one or only a few antigens, which increases the probability that infected cells will escape detection by the immune system and immunotherapy.

&#183;

Many active immunotherapies employ a single defined antigen so they are not effective against cancers which do not express that antigen.

&#183;

Most immunotherapies produce toxic effects resulting in damage to healthy tissues.

&#183;

Many patients may not be able to mount effective immune responses with immunotherapy due to tumor or virus induced immunosuppression of accessory cells such as CD4+ helper T cells, which are necessary for the immunotherapies to be effective but may be functionally impaired by the patient &#8217; s disease.

&#183;

It can be difficult to commercialize immunotherapies based on cells derived from individual patients in a cost-effective manner as a result of the added complexity, limited patient material for production of multiple doses, and the need to store and ship the individual doses.

&#183;

Immunotherapies that rely on defined, off-the-shelf antigens or a single targeted antigen may have limited effectiveness because even within the same type of cancer, the genetic makeup and distinct antigens of a tumor can vary significantly from patient to patient.

&#160;

Although many of the immunotherapies currently in clinical development have shown promising results, we believe that specific proprietary elements of the ImPACT &#174; and ComPACT TM platform technologies combined with a well-honed clinical strategy position Heat favorably in the marketplace.

Our Solution: ImPACT &#174; /ComPACT TM Therapy 

We believe our ImPACT &#174; and ComPACT TM therapies have a number of advantages over existing therapies. These advantages, elaborated below, may enable us to develop commercial products that extend the survival of, and improve the quality of life for, cancer patients:

&#183;

They are designed to fight cancer by activating the immune system against a wide variety of cancer antigens (both known and unknown). This has now been confirmed in patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer treated with HS-410. 

&#160;

&#183;

They are intended to continually secrete a wide variety of cancer-associated antigens, thus initiating a broad and sustained pan-antigen cytotoxic T cell attack against the targeted cancer. We believe this broad-based attack increases the probability of destroying the targeted cancer.

&#183;

They are designed to stimulate a natural immune response against specific cancer cells. We believe this may limit serious adverse events related to treatment.

&#183;

We believe that the novel mechanism of action, good tolerability and favorable safety profile will enable our ImPACT &#174; and ComPACT TM product candidates to have potential benefits across multiple disease stages and tumor types and in combination with other therapies.

&#183;

Our ImPACT &#174; therapy represents an agent that functions as both an immune activator and an antigen-delivery vehicle. To our knowledge, ImPACT &#174; is the only allogeneic cell-based technology platform currently in clinical development that is specific to CD8+ cytotoxic T cell immune response, which is especially important for developing therapeutics in oncology.

&#183;

Our ComPACT TM platform was developed using in-house expertise and is a platform that can provide a vaccine and a T cell costimulatory molecule in a single therapeutic. In preclinical studies, the ComPACT TM platform incorporating OX40 stimulation provided superior immune response and tumor rejection to what is seen with either OX40 agonist antibodies alone or in combination with traditional vaccines. 

&#183;

Our ImPACT &#174; and ComPACT TM platforms are off-the-shelf therapies and offer substantial manufacturing and cost advantages compared to autologous or &#8220; personalized &#8221; immunotherapies.

&#183;

We believe many patients for whom the risks associated with chemotherapy, BCG or other traditional agents are intolerable may be able to benefit from our ImPACT &#174; and ComPACT TM product candidates.

ImPACT &#174; TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM 

ImPACT &#174; Background 

Our ImPACT &#174; technology represents an &#147;off-the-shelf&#148; method to deliver cancer antigens complexed to heat shock proteins, or HSPs, to illicit an immune response. HSPs are used as a signaling mechanism by the immune system to identify mutated proteins (&#147;antigens&#148;), including those from tumor cells. Although always present within certain cells, HSPs are normally only released when cells die by necrosis or unnatural cell death (rather than apoptosis or natural programmed cell death) and upon release are recognized by the host&#146;s immune system. When a cell dies an unnatural death through &#147;necrosis&#148;, such as when it is infected and killed by a flu virus or other pathogen, the cell releases its contents into circulation setting off a molecular warning to the immune system thereby generating a rapid and potent immune response. Because HSPs very rarely leave cells, the immune system has evolved to recognize HSPs that have been released from dying cells as the sentries of a molecular alarm system. This characterizes the role of heat shock proteins as damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPS). Upon detection of HSPs, the immune system then directs an immune response against any foreign (pathogenic) proteins bound to the HSP at the time the cell that released it died.

HSPs have several functions including:

&#183;

Protecting tissues from pathogens by activating the immune system.

&#183;

Acting as a chaperone to:

o

Facilitate proper protein folding within the endoplasmic reticulum.

o

Enable proper function of toll-like receptors and the innate immune system.

o

Carry damaged proteins to intracellular garbage disposals to be degraded into peptides (short chains of amino acids &#8211; that are protein fragments).

&#160;

&#183;

Loading peptides onto another class of proteins known as MHC I molecules. MHC I molecules move to the cellular surface where they are monitored by the immune system.

&#183;

Directing antigen cross presentation for activation of CD8+ T cells toward tumor antigens. 

HSP gp96 is one of the most abundantly expressed proteins in the human body and is expressed by all cells. It is normally retained within cells in a compartment called the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it facilitates the folding of newly synthesized proteins so that they may perform their various tasks properly. Gp96 is particularly important in the process of detecting antigens as it is present in all cell types and, it is able to recognize all antigens. It also induces the immune system to activate CD8+ (&#147;killer&#148;) T cells which then seek out and destroy the cells that are marked by antigens. Gp96 is normally only contained inside the ER of cells, however when a cell dies an abnormal death through necrosis it breaks open and releases gp96 into the surrounding tissue microenvironment. ImPACT &#174; works by modifying the chemical structure of gp96 so that a cell can continuously secrete it into the extracellular space accompanied by the unique peptide that it is folding at the time without causing necrosis. This allows the immune system to seek out and destroy cells characterized with antigens before the body would otherwise have detected them.

ImPACT &#174; Technology Overview 

A limitation of utilizing gp96 as a cancer immunotherapy is that it is normally retained within cells by a small region called a &#147;KDEL sequence&#148; that acts like a &#147;leash&#148;, preventing gp96 from leaving the ER. Therefore, in order to utilize gp96 as a therapeutic, gp96 must either be purified from individual cells or engineered to be secreted from cells.

To overcome this limitation, a team of scientists led by Eckhard Podack, M.D., Ph.D., the Former Chairman of our Scientific Advisory Board and the inventor of this technology, deleted this KDEL sequence and replaced it with another sequence that causes the new fusion protein, called gp96-Ig, to be secreted from cells continuously. Multiple tumor cell lines were then made to express gp96-Ig, and as expected, secreted it continuously into the extracellular space in a complex with tumor antigens. Dr. Podack demonstrated that gp96-Ig vaccination effectively cross-presented tumor specific antigens to immune cells, led to expansion of Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTL) and the subsequent rejection of injected tumor cells. Importantly, these studies demonstrated that the secreted protein gp96-Ig maintained the critical characteristics of the native gp96 protein required to generate anti-tumor immune responses. 

Our ImPACT &#174; technology platform: 

&#183;

Effectively cross-presents tumor antigens and leads to cytotoxic killer T cell activation 

Published studies in mice showed that killer T cell activation was approximately 20 million times greater with ImPACT &#174; secreted gp96-Ig than with a corresponding gp96 protein injection. The modified cell secretes gp96 in a sustained release for several days after injection. This creates a sustained immune response. These data suggest that gp96-chaperoned peptides may represent the most efficient, robust pathway for presenting a cell&#146;s antigens to the immune system and activating killer T cells.

&#183;

Binds and presents all potential tumor antigens to the immune system simultaneously 

A single type of tumor might have multiple strains derived from numerous tumor cells. These different strains have different antigens, all of which are capable of initiating an immune response. By creating a vaccine from a tumor-cell line, we believe that ImPACT &#174; &#146;s technology can develop a therapy that shares many common features with patients&#146; tumors. We believe this &#147;blanket&#148; approach will provide each patient with a higher likelihood of a positive response to the therapy.

&#183;

Features killer T cell activation that is independent of CD4+ T cell help 

Animal studies have confirmed that our technology initiates a mechanism called cross-presentation that is critical to inducing tumor rejection. Importantly, it does this independently and successfully without additional CD4+ T cell (also known as a helper T cell) recruitment, which is typically required in a normal immune system response. This is particularly important in cancer and HIV because helper T cell activity is frequently impaired in these disease states.

&#160;

&#183;

May cause few side effects 

We believe our technology allows the body to recognize cancer as a foreign entity and uses the body &#8217; s natural immune mechanism to recognize and fight it. In doing so, we believe our product candidates will generate fewer side effects than conventional chemotherapy and that patients will be able to maintain a higher quality of life.

The distinguishing characteristics of ImPACT &#174; are:

(i)

While most other immunotherapy approaches target only a single antigen, our patented approach uses modified heat shock proteins to stimulate an immune response against multiple antigens contained within cancer cells (both known and unknown). Cancer cells express different antigens that can be used to initiate an immune response. Each ImPACT &#174; vaccine is created from a tumor-cell line that we believe expresses a wide array of those antigens most commonly expressed in a particular type of cancer. For our lung cancer trials, the cell line that was used and expressed the most favorable antigen profile for lung cancer was a lung cancer cell line and for our bladder cancer trials the cell line that was used and expressed the most favorable antigen profile for bladder cancer was a prostate cancer cell line. We believe this &#147;pan-antigen&#148; approach provides each patient with a higher likelihood of a response to the therapy.

(ii)

Our product candidates are made from &#147;off-the-shelf&#148; (allogeneic) cells and may therefore be less expensive to manufacture than patient-specific (autologous) vaccines . Our vaccines are mass-produced from a single source while other immunotherapy approaches require physicians to extract a patient&#146;s blood and/or cells, send them to a facility where a personalized vaccine is created, and then have them shipped back to the physician for injection into the patient.

(iii)

While competing companies are developing therapies that are both &#147;off-the-shelf&#148; and which target multiple antigens, our ImPACT &#174; technology is the only &#147;off-the-shelf&#148; (allogeneic) vaccine &#150; to our knowledge &#150; that directly induces &#147;cross-presentation&#148; to the CD8+ (&#147;killer&#148;) T cells, which are the cytotoxic arm of the immune system. Stimulating these CD8 (killer) T cells through &#147;cross-presentation&#148; has recently been shown to be critical to the induction of effective anti-tumor immunity. We believe our product candidates are able to leverage gp96 to serve as their own powerful immune stimulant (adjuvant) while other companies&#146; technologies rely on the use of a secondary adjuvant like GMCSF or Alum.

Our ComPACT TM Technology Platform 

The ComPACT TM technology platform was created in-house to take advantage of all aspects of the T cell activation platform and to build upon them. Because the future of cancer immunotherapy appears to be focused on drug combinations, it is valuable to conceive technologies where one drug may be re-purposed to do two things, rather than always relying on individual combinations of different single-function drugs. The need for this sort of innovation is highlighted by the recent approval of Nivolumab and Yervoy for patients with late stage melanoma. The price for this combination is upwards of $250,000 per course of therapy, not including the substantially increased ancillary costs associated with monitoring and treating the potentially fatal complications that are common with such a combination. ComPACT TM was designed to deliver the gp96-Ig vaccine molecule together with a T cell costimulatory fusion protein in a single compound. The first iterations of ComPACT TM included OX40L-Fc, 4-1BBL-Fc and ICOSL-Fc as the T cell costimulatory proteins, and due to preferential activity with the OX40L-Fc version of ComPACT TM , this compound has been prioritized for rapid clinical development. Interestingly, the activity of locally secreted OX40L-Fc from ComPACT TM provides a superior immune response and tumor rejection than what is seen with OX40 agonist antibodies. 

Our Product Candidates and Clinical Development Programs 

We have initiated development programs to target our ImPACT &#174; technology platform against a range of diseases, including non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and non-small cell lung cancer (&#147;NSCLC&#148;). In October 2015, we completed full enrollment of 75 patients in the blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled arms of our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating HS-410 either in combination with BCG, or HS-410 alone, in patients with high risk, NMIBC. We are enrolling an additional 25 patients to evaluate HS-410 as a monotherapy in an unblinded, open-label arm, and we anticipate completing enrollment in the first half of 2016. We began dosing NSCLC patients in combination with nivolumab in a Phase 1b protocol with our first therapeutic vaccine, HS-110, in the second half of 2015. The inventor of our technology platform had also completed a study in primates for the development of a therapeutic and prophylactic vaccine for the treatment and prevention of HIV. This study was fully funded by the NIH. The HIV trials were initiated by the primary inventor and to date have been funded by grants awarded to the primary inventor, which can be used at the discretion of the inventor. We have no funding obligation for such trials and the primary inventor is responsible for future development and research; nonetheless any research conducted by the primary inventor contributes to our body of research and we may choose to progress with any such research to further clinical trials and incorporate such research into our future development plans.

ImPACT &#174; INDICATIONS 

Bladder Cancer 

Disease 

In the United States, bladder cancer is the fourth most common type of cancer in men and the eleventh most common cancer in women. According to the National Cancer Institute, 1 in 42 men and women will be diagnosed with bladder cancer during their lifetimes, meaning more than half a million people are living with bladder cancer in the United States. In 2015, the American Cancer Society estimated 74,000 cases of bladder cancer will be diagnosed in the United States, and an estimated 16,000 deaths will occur. According to the American Cancer Society there are currently over 500,000 bladder cancer patients in the United States and thirty percent (30%) of the patients have muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) and seventy percent (70%) of the patients have NMIBC. Available treatments are currently not effective, in all patients, thus this remains an area of high unmet need. According to Park JC, et al. Clin Adv Hematol Oncol . 2014 Dec;12(12):838-45, lifetime treatment costs are $96,000 to $187,000 per individual per year in U.S.

Phase 2 Clinical Development 

Enrollment is complete for the 75 patients in the blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled arms of our Phase 2 clinical trial to examine safety, tolerability, immune response and preliminary clinical activity of HS-410 in patients with high risk, superficial bladder cancer who have completed surgical resection. We are enrolling an additional 25 patients to evaluate HS-410 as a monotherapy in an unblinded, open-label arm. The Phase 1 portion started treatment with HS-410 after standard intravesical bacillus Calmette-Gu&#233;rin (BCG) immunotherapy; the Phase 2 portion investigates one of two doses of HS-410 or placebo in combination with BCG or one dose of HS-410 as monotherapy. We anticipate including approximately 15-20 clinical sites in the United States with an enrollment period of 18-24 months. 

&#160;

In January 2016, we reported three-month interim data from the unblinded, monotherapy cohort of the company&#146;s ongoing Phase 2 trial of HS-410 for the treatment of NMIBC at the Phacilitate Immunotherapy World Conference. In the monotherapy arm, a series of weekly intradermal injections of HS-410 is being dosed as an alternative to BCG. Images of the bladder taken from several treated patients showed changes that resemble lymphoid (T cell rich) structures that we have observed in biopsy samples, which we believe indicates that HS-410 is generating an immune response as expected.

&#160;

&#160;

On November 6, 2015, we announced positive results from our Phase 1 trial, evaluating the safety and immune response of HS-410, after standard of care bacillus Calmette-Gu&#233;rin (BCG), for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC. These results are outlined below:

HS-410 exhibited a positive safety profile and was well-tolerated with no patients discontinuing the trial due to adverse events (AEs). Furthermore, no serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported, and 7 out of 10 patients had no documented recurrence of cancer &#62;1 year after standard of care surgery. Significantly, 3 out of 4 patients with carcinoma in situ (CIS), the patient population least responsive to standard of care, did not recur. HS-410 elicited a broad-based (polyclonal) expansion of patient T cells and a high level of CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Additionally, based on tissue samples taken from each patient, HS-410 shared 15 or more tumor antigens in common with those expressed on the patients' cancer cells, which we believe indicates HS-410's ability to target a broad range of tumor antigens for all patients treated to date. These data confirm previous clinical findings regarding the unique mechanism of action for HS-410 and for our ImPACT &#174; and ComPACT TM platform technologies. Moreover, third-party analysis of blinded samples demonstrated a strong correlation between baseline characteristics of TILs by T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing and clinical outcome. Specifically, the 7 patients who remain disease free exhibited the greatest clonal expansion of intratumoral T cells (p-value 0.0126). 

&#160;

&#160;

In October 2015, we completed full enrollment of 75 patients in the blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled arms of our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating HS-410 either in combination with BCG, or HS-410 alone, in patients with high risk, NMIBC. The Phase 2 trial will examine safety, tolerability, immune response and preliminary clinical activity of HS-410. The primary endpoint is one-year disease free survival. We are enrolling an additional 25 patients to evaluate HS-410 as a monotherapy in an unblinded, open-label arm, which we anticipate completing enrollment by the first half of 2016. We expect to report topline efficacy, immune-response and safety results in the fourth quarter of 2016. 

On March 5, 2015, we were notified that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#147;FDA&#148;) granted Fast Track designation for HS-410 for the treatment of NMIBC. The Fast Track program is designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of therapies intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The advantages of Fast Track designation include actions to expedite development, including opportunities for frequent interactions with the FDA review team to discuss all aspects of developments to support approval and eligibility for priority review depending on clinical data at the time of Biologics License Application (&#147;BLA&#148;) submission. We believe that this designation will expedite our development of HS-410.

Other Cancers 

We continue to evaluate other indications for our ImPACT &#174; and ComPACT TM platform technologies. Specifically, using ComPACT TM , we have developed cell lines for several other cancers with the first product candidate being a second-generation therapy for non-small cell lung cancer (HS-120). Our decision to further pursue these or any additional product candidates other than our two lead product candidates will be based in part upon available funding and partnering opportunities. 

Lung Cancer 

Disease 

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. According to the National Cancer Institute, in 2015, lung cancer was expected to account for 26% of all female cancer deaths and 28% of all male cancer deaths. An expected 221,200 people were diagnosed with lung cancer in the United States in 2015. Of these lung cancers, roughly 85% were expected to present as non-small cell lung cancer. Patients with advanced clinical stage IIIB/IV disease have a 5-year survival rate as low as 1-5%.

&#160;

Phase 1b Clinical Trial 

In May 2015, we initiated our Phase 1b clinical trial investigating the combination of our HS-110 therapeutic vaccine and nivolumab (Opdivo &#174; ), a Bristol-Myers Squibb PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor, to treat patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). HS-110 is our first product candidate in a series of proprietary ImPACT &#174; based immunotherapies designed to stimulate patient's own T cells to attack cancer. HS-110 is a biologic product comprising a lung cancer cell line that has been genetically modified using our ImPACT &#174; technology platform to secrete a wide range of lung cancer associated antigens bound to gp96 proteins and activate a T cell mediated pan-antigen immune response against the patient&#146;s cancer. This multicenter trial is evaluating the safety and efficacy of HS-110 in combination with nivolumab in patients with NSCLC whose cancers have progressed after first-line therapy. Primary and secondary trial endpoints include safety and tolerability, immune response, overall response rate and progression-free survival. This trial is expected to initially enroll 18 patients, and we expect to release top-line objective response rate and 6-month progression free survival (PFS) data on these first 18 patients by the end of 2016. 

Phase 1b HS-110/DURGA Trial Design 

Phase 2 Clinical Development 

Data from our Phase 2 randomized, controlled trial using HS-110 in combination with cyclophosphamide versus chemotherapy alone in third-line and fourth-line NSCLC patients is expected during the fourth quarter of 2016. This trial, which enrolled 65 patients is winding down to instead focus on combinations with checkpoint. The trial was structured as a multicenter randomized study to evaluate the immune response, safety and efficacy endpoints of HS-110 when administered weekly for 12 weeks in combination with low-dose cyclophosphamide in an induction period followed by monotherapy HS-110 every nine weeks during maintenance for up to one year. Patients randomized to the comparator arm were treated with one chemotherapy regimen until progression. Blood samples were taken to evaluate the immune response and their correlation to overall survival, and where considered appropriate by the investigator, patients are invited to consent for pre- and post-treatment biopsies for exploratory biomarker analysis. The primary endpoint was overall survival; secondary endpoints follow objective responses and immune response. 

&#160;

Phase 1 HS-110 Clinical Trial 

Background 

A Phase 1 clinical trial with HS-110 in patients with very late stage IIIB/IV NSCLC was undertaken by the inventor of the technology which we license at the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center with a total of 18 patients dosed, 15 of which completed the first course of three planned courses of therapy and were evaluated. Two of these 15 patients completed all three planned courses. The primary purpose of this trial was to evaluate safety of HS-110, while the secondary objectives were to study gp96-Ig specific immune responses and to monitor clinical progress. The patients were divided into 3 arms. Due to statistical and safety considerations and early termination of the study, the patients in the trial were not evenly divided among the three arms. Arm 1, which consisted of 11 patients, received 40 million cells every two weeks for 18 weeks, arm 2, which consisted of 4 patients, received 20 million cells every week for 18 weeks and arm 3, which consisted of 3 patients, received 10 million cells twice a week for 18 weeks. Three of the patients, who were late stage lung cancer patients, died before their immune response could be evaluated and were not included in the evaluation set at the end of the trial.

The Phase 1 trial was conducted under an investigator-sponsored IND and was fully funded by the NIH. The main criteria for inclusion were: (i) patients with histologically confirmed NSCLC stage IIIB, stage IV, or recurrent disease; (ii) at least one site of bi-dimensionally measurable disease; (iii) treated brain metastasis must be stable by CT scan or MRI for at least 8 weeks; (iv) patient must have received and failed at least two lines of therapy (one of them erlotinib); (v) age &#8805; 18 years; ECOG performance status 0-2; life expectancy &#8805; 3 months; and (vi) signed informed consent.

The median age was 67 years (range 38-86). HS-110 showed no overt toxicity. There were no serious adverse events (SAEs) that were considered by the trial investigator to be treatment-related. Most of the adverse events (AEs) were reported as mild or moderate (grade 1 or 2) with the most frequent being skin induration and rash that were transitory and usually resolved in 1 to 2 weeks.

We believe that the results of the Phase 1 trial with HS-110 demonstrate that HS-110 is capable of generating a CD8-CTL IFN- &#947; immune response in patients with advanced NSCLC. In 11 of the 15 patients (73%) that completed the first course of therapy with HS-110, there was a twofold or greater increase in CD8 cells secreting interferon gamma (CD8-CTL IFN- &#947; ). These patients also exhibited an estimated median survival of 16.5 months (95% CI:7.1-20.0). In contrast, 4 patients were immune non-responders and survived 2.1, 2.3, 6.7, and 6.7 months, or a median survival of 4.5 months, which is consistent with the expected survival times in this patient population. The protocol required that we look for such responses but, as is typical in immunotherapy, no partial or complete tumor responses were observed. The median one-year overall survival rate of patients in the study was 44% (95% CI:21.6-65.1). For comparative purposes, while there was a wide range of survival times, the one-year overall survival rate in a published one-year, 43-patient, advanced lung cancer population was 5.5%. One of the late-stage lung cancer patients survived over four years since starting the therapy and another patient survived over three years since starting the therapy. These findings were consistent with multiple preclinical published studies on ImPACT &#174; therapy.

HS-110 Safety 

We believe HS-110 showed no overt toxicity. There were no serious adverse events (SAEs) that were considered by the trial investigator to be treatment-related. Most of the adverse events (AEs) were reported as mild or moderate (grade 1 or 2) with the most frequent being skin induration and rash that were transitory and usually resolved in 1 to 2 weeks. The single grade 3 AE was in the &#147;Body as a Whole&#148; category (fatigue) and was rated as &#147;possibly&#148; related. There were no immune-related events with the vaccine or the vaccinations.

Skin reactions at the vaccination site were minimal and of short duration and there was no evidence of the generation of any autoimmune phenomena. In lieu of a dose escalation design, the design of the Phase I trial involved increasing the frequency of vaccination, while still retaining the total dose of vaccine cells administered. A more frequent vaccination schedule caused increased tumor rejection in preclinical models.

Positive Immunological Response 

In 11 of the 15 patients (73%) completing the first course of therapy with HS-110, there was a twofold or greater increase in CD8 cells secreting interferon gamma (CD8-CTL IFN- &#947; ) following vaccination.

CD8 IFN- &#947; response. Samples from 15 patients collected for immune response at baseline and after at least one course of vaccination were available for analysis of the CD8 IFN- &#947; response. 20,000 purified patient CD8 T cells were stimulated with vaccine cells for 40h in ELI-spot plates and the frequency of IFN- &#947; secreting cells determined + indicates first increase. Solid lines indicate immune response (IR+), dashed lines no response (IR &#8722; ).

Since NSCLC is known to be highly immunosuppressive, we believe that by overcoming tumor-induced suppression with frequent vaccinations as observed anecdotally in the Phase 1 study and the generation of an observed potent polyepitope specific CD8 CTL is encouraging and warrants further study.

&#160;

Clinical Response 

Seven of 15 patients completing the first course of therapy (39%; 95% CI: 17.3- 64.3%) achieved disease stabilization after the first course of vaccinations (6 weeks) and 8 patients had disease progression. While the protocol required that we look for such responses, as is typical in immunotherapy, no partial or complete tumor responses were noted in the study. Although clinicians and patients may perceive disease stabilization as beneficial, without a control arm the FDA does not consider it to be a clinical benefit for regulatory purposes. In order to obtain FDA approval, we will be required to show an improvement in progression-free survival (or, PFS) or overall survival (or, OS) when compared to a control arm in a randomized study. The Kaplan Meier estimate of median time to progression was 1.4 months (95% CI: 1.3-2.7), and the PFS rates at 1, 2 and 3 months were 88.9% (95% CI: 62.4- 97.1%), 38.9% (95% CI: 17.5-60.0%), and 11.1% (95% CI: 1.9-29.8%), respectively. Of note, two patients remained progression free for just over 7 months.

The typical median survival period for late-stage lung cancer is 4.5 months for patients who are not receiving any treatment. Two of the fifteen patients who completed the first course of therapy were followed for over 3 years and 4 years, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of median overall survival was 8.1 months (95% CI: 6.7- 18.2), and the 1, 2, and 3-year OS rates were 44.4% (95% CI: 21.6-65.1%), 19.0% (95% CI: 4.8- 40.3%), and 9.5% (95% CI: 0.8-32.1%), respectively. While these results may be encouraging, apparent differences in outcome between population-based survival estimates and treatment groups from a clinical study can arise from differences other than drug treatment. The reliability of such comparisons must also be considered in light of the unblinded nature of the study data at the time that the comparator was chosen. Moreover, the wide range of values in the 95% confidence intervals in our study suggests that the actual median survival times could lie anywhere in the reported intervals.

IR+: more than twofold increase in CD8 from baseline. IR &#8722; : no CD8 immune response. na: not assessed for immune response.

In 11 of the 15 patients (73%) completing the first course of therapy with HS-110, there was a twofold or greater increase in CD8 cells secreting interferon gamma (CD8-CTL IFN-y) following vaccination. In a non-prespecified analysis, the responders saw a threefold increase in median overall survival compared to the non-responders on the trial.

&#160;

Summary 

In summary, based on the results of this Phase 1 trial in 18 patients, we believe HS-110 showed no overt toxicity and appears to be capable of generating CD8-CTL IFN- &#947; immune responses in patients with advanced NSCLC. These results are encouraging and may be predictive of clinical benefit based on stabilization of disease, overall survival and the immune responder results.

Manufacturing 

We rely on third-party manufacturers to produce and store our product candidates for clinical use and currently do not own or operate manufacturing facilities. 

We have retained Lonza Walkersville, Inc. a vendor, which has begun manufacturing of HS-110 to be used in our Phase 2 and potential Phase 3 clinical trials. We entered into an eight-year Manufacturing Services Agreement, dated October 20, 2011, with the vendor (the &#147;Manufacturing Agreement&#148;). The Manufacturing Agreement provides that the vendor will manufacture products based on our ImPACT &#174; technology intended for use in pharmaceutical or medicinal end products, including, without limitation, products in a final packaged form and labeled for use in clinical trials or for commercial sale to end users in accordance with the terms and conditions of individual statements of work. The Manufacturing Agreement requires that we purchase a certain minimum percentage of our annual global product requirements from the vendor. The Manufacturing Agreement may be terminated by the parties upon mutual agreement, and by each party for a material breach by the other party that is not cured within the cure period, upon notice that a clinical trial for which product is being produced under the agreement is suspended or terminated or upon the other party&#146;s insolvency, dissolution or liquidation.

&#160;

The HS-110 used in the inventor&#146;s Phase 1, and in our Phase 2 clinical trial and HS-410 used in our Phase 1/2 clinical trial was and is currently manufactured under current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP. The vaccine is grown in large quantities, dispensed into individual doses, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and quality tested in compliance with FDA guidelines. The vaccine is irradiated, which is a commonly used attenuation process that eliminates the ability of the gp96-Ig-containing vaccine cell lines to replicate but allows them to continue secreting gp96-Ig for a period of several days. These batches of frozen, irradiated vaccine are stable for long periods of time, and are thawed immediately prior to administration to patients. Sufficient material to dose a subset of patients in the HS-110 Phase 2 study has already been produced, and preparations are underway to produce quantities required for trial completion and subsequent clinical trials. Sufficient material to complete the Phase 1 portion and part of the Phase 2 portion of the HS-410 Phase1/ 2 study has already been produced, and preparations are underway to produce quantities required for trial completion and subsequent clinical trials.

Competition 

The pharmaceutical industry and biologics industry are each highly competitive and characterized by a number of established, large companies, mid-sized companies, as well as smaller companies like ours. If our competitors market products that are less expensive, safer or more effective than any future products developed from our product candidates, or that reach the market before our approved product candidates, we may not achieve commercial success. Technological developments in our field of research and development occur at a rapid rate and we expect competition to intensify as advances in this field are made. We will be required to continue to devote substantial resources and efforts to our research and development activities. As a biotechnology company with cancer immunotherapy agents as lead product candidates, we compete with a broad range of companies. At the highest level, cancer immunotherapy can be seen as both a complement and a potential competitor to any oncology therapy, most notably chemotherapy, biologics and small molecule drugs. Not only do we compete with companies engaged in various cancer treatments including radiology and chemotherapy but we also compete with various companies that have developed or are trying to develop immunology vaccines for the treatment of cancer. Certain of our competitors have substantially greater capital resources, large customer bases, broader product lines, sales forces, greater marketing and management resources, larger research and development staffs and larger facilities than we do and have more established reputations as well as global distribution channels. Our most significant competitors, among others, are fully integrated pharmaceutical companies such as Eli Lilly and Company, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Merck &#38; Co., Inc., Novartis AG, MedImmune, LLC (a wholly owned subsidiary of AstraZeneca plc), Johnson &#38; Johnson, Pfizer Inc., MerckKGaA and Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC, and more established biotechnology companies such as Genentech, Inc. (a member of the Roche Group), Amgen Inc., Celgene Corporation, Gilead Sciences, Inc., and competing cancer immunotherapy companies such as Kite Pharma, Inc., Juno Therapeutics, Inc., Bluebird Bio, Inc., Transgene SA, Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc., NewLink Genetics Corporation, Agenus Inc., NovaRx Corporation, Aduro Biotech, Inc., Advaxis, Inc., ImmunoCellular Therapeutics, Ltd., Immunovaccine Inc., Oncothyreon Inc., Oxford BioMedica plc, Bavarian Nordic A/S, Celldex Therapeutics, Inc., Telesta Therapeutics Inc. and others, some of which have substantially greater financial, technical, sales, marketing, and human resources than we do. These companies might succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for competitive products more rapidly than we can for our products. In addition, competitors might develop technologies and products that are less expensive, safer or more effective than those being developed by us or that would render our technology obsolete. In addition, the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry is characterized by rapid technological change. Because our research approach integrates many technologies, it may be difficult for us to remain current with the rapid changes in each technology. If we fail to stay at the forefront of technological change, we may be unable to compete effectively. Our competitors may render our technologies obsolete by advancing their existing technological approaches or developing new or different approaches.

We expect to compete with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and our competitors may:

&#183;

develop and market products that are less expensive, more effective or safer than our future products;

&#183;

commercialize competing products before we can launch any products developed from our product candidates;

&#183;

operate larger research and development programs, possess greater manufacturing capabilities or have substantially greater financial resources than we do;

&#183;

initiate or withstand substantial price competition more successfully than we can;

&#183;

have greater success in recruiting skilled technical and scientific workers from the limited pool of available talent;

&#160;

&#183;

a more effectively negotiate third-party licenses and strategic relationships; and

&#183;

take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities more readily than we can.

&#160;

We expect to compete for market share against large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, smaller companies that are collaborating with larger pharmaceutical companies, new companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations.

Many major pharmaceutical companies have at least one immunotherapy drug or therapeutic in development, either directly or in partnership with a smaller biotech firm. Some of our competitors that are developing competitive immunology drugs and therapeutics include Merck &#38; Co. Inc., Genentech, Inc. (a member of the Roche Group); Bristol Myers Squibb Company; Transgene SA; Oxford BioMedica plc; NewLink Genetics Corporation; Celldex Therapeutics, Inc.; Pfizer Inc.; and Celgene Corporation.

The primary treatments for non-small cell lung cancer are surgery, radiation, chemotherapy and various combinations of each of these treatments. A large number of patients, particularly with advanced disease, are refractory to these treatments and are subsequently treated with a number of emerging biologic agents, including immunotherapy. Some examples of therapies commonly attempted with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC patients include: nivolumab (Opdivo), pembrolizumab (Keytruda), Alimta (pemetrexed), Avastin (bevacizumab), Tarceva (erlotinib), Gemzar (gemcitabine), Carboplatin, Taxol (paclitaxel), Taxotere (docetaxel), and Vinorelbine. It is unlikely that biologic agents will compete with more traditional therapies in the short-term, but many oncologists believe that such therapies will eventually become the mainstay of lung cancer therapy. None of these agents have proven particularly effective for stage IIIB/IV NSCLC patients, with the most effective therapies only increasing survival by a few months. As a result, we do not consider these agents to be direct competitors to HS-110 because they are likely to be given either in sequence or in conjunction with some of the agents listed. Furthermore, many patients cannot tolerate many of the chemotherapeutics listed. Thus, we believe if HS-110 has a positive safety profile (without observation of local or systemic toxicities, none of which have been seen to date), it is likely that HS-110 would be preferred both by physicians and patients in this stage of disease.

As previously stated we compete with other forms of cancer treatment such as biologic therapies in addition to immunology therapies. There are several biologic therapies in clinical development for NSCLC that have been identified as potential competitors to HS-110. In particular, a cell-based vaccine therapy, Lucanix, is in development by NovaRx. Lucanix has recently completed Phase 3 clinical trials and failed to reach the primary endpoint.

Our strategy is to emphasize what we believe to be our competitive advantages which are that the therapy will have less side effects than most other chemotherapies, will be available at lower prices than other therapies and will work on almost all types of cancer and not just one specific type.

Although all chemotherapy drugs have severe side-effects such as overall damage to the immune system, not only to cancerous cells, leading to hair loss, nausea and vomiting, and considerable pain, etc., the side effects from immunotherapy are typically reduced because immunotherapy works with the body&#146;s own immune response.

According to Schreiber et al, patient-specific vaccines are not more effective than off-the shelf vaccines in reducing tumors. Furthermore, patient-specific vaccines cost far more to produce than off the shelf (allogeneic) vaccines, where any donor tissue can be used. Immunotherapies are reported to cost in excess of $100,000 per year and we expect that our treatment will be less expensive.

License Agreements and Intellectual Property 

Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our products, formulations, processes, methods and other proprietary technologies, preserve our trade secrets and exclusive rights in our unique biological materials, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and in other countries. Our policy is to actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, the strongest intellectual property protection possible for our current product candidates ( ImPACT &#174; and ComPACT TM therapy) and any future product candidates, proprietary information and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents, both in the United States and abroad. However, even patent protection may not always afford us with complete protection against competitors who seek to circumvent our patents. See &#147;Risk Factors - Risks Relating to Our Business &#150; We have limited protection of our intellectual property.&#148;

&#160;

We will continue to depend upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors, none of which is patentable. To help protect our proprietary know-how, which is not patentable, and for inventions for which patents may be difficult to enforce, we currently rely and will in the future rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. To this end, we require all of our employees, consultants, advisors and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business.

License Agreements 

In July 2008, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with the University of Miami (the &#147;University&#148;) for intellectual and tangible property rights relating to our ImPACT &#174; technology. This license agreement was subsequently assigned to our subsidiary Heat Biologics I, Inc. which issued to the University shares of its common stock representing seven and one half percent (7.5%) of its common stock. The term of the license is the length of the last to expire patent, unless terminated earlier. The license agreement grants Heat Biologics I, Inc. exclusive, worldwide rights to make, use or sell licensed materials based upon the following patent-related rights:

&#183;

U.S. patent applications: Serial number 60/075,358 (the &#147; &#145;358 application&#148;) entitled &#147;Modified Heat Shock Protein-Antigenic Peptide Complex&#148; and filed on February 20, 1998; Serial number 09/253,439 (the &#147; &#145;439 application&#148;) entitled &#147;Modified Heat Shock Protein-Antigenic Peptide Complex &#148; and filed on February 19, 1999; serial number 11/878,460 (the &#147; &#145;460 application&#148;) entitled &#147;Recombinant Cancer Cell Secreting Modified Heat Shock Protein-Antigenic Peptide Complex&#148; and filed on July 24, 2007; and all U.S. patents and foreign patents and patent applications based on these U.S. applications; as well as all divisionals, continuations, and those claims in continuations-in-parts to the extent they are sufficiently described in the &#145;358, &#145;439, or &#145;460 applications of the foregoing, and any re-examinations or reissues of the foregoing (the &#147;GP96 Vaccine Technology Portfolio&#148;).

As consideration for the rights granted in the license agreement, the licensee is obligated to pay the University upfront license fees, additional yearly and milestone payments and a royalty based on net sales of products covered by the patent-related rights set forth above. More specifically, the licensee is obligated to pay the University (i) all past and future patent costs associated with the licensed patent-related rights; (ii) a license issue fee of $150,000; (iii) annual payments of $10,000 in 2010, 2011 and 2012, and $20,000 each year thereafter; (iv) a milestone payment of $250,000 by the earlier of May 31, 2017 or approval of a BLA for the lung cancer vaccine or for a cancer vaccine other than lung cancer; and (v) royalties equal to a percentage (in the low-to-mid single digits) of net sales of licensed products. The royalty rate is subject to reduction if additional license rights from third parties are required to commercialize licensed products. In the event of a sublicense to a third party, Heat Biologics I, Inc. is obligated to pay royalties to the University equal to a percentage of what it would have been required to pay to the University had it sold the products under sublicense itself. In exchange for additional consideration, the University agreed to postpone the payment due dates prior to February 2010 of this license agreement. All past patent costs have been fully paid.

In September 2014, we amended the license agreement in which the University of Miami agreed not to license the cell line to third parties while we are in good standing and in compliance of our patent license agreements with the University relating to our ImPACT &#174; platform. A patent for &#147;Modified Heat Shock Proteins-Antigenic Peptide Complex&#148; if issued from the pending patent applications, would expire in 2019 (worldwide), not including any patent term adjustments or extensions.

In February 2011, our subsidiary, Heat Biologics I, Inc., entered into four additional exclusive license agreements with the University. The terms of each of these additional licenses run until all the patent-related rights licensed therein have expired, unless terminated earlier. In these additional exclusive license agreements, Heat Biologics I, Inc. obtained exclusive, worldwide rights to make, use or sell products covered under the following patent-related rights:

&#183;

A patent for &#8220; Heat Shock Protein GP96 Vaccination and Methods of Using Same &#8221; , if issued from the pending applications, would expire in 2029 (worldwide), not including any patent term adjustments or extensions.

&#183;

U.S. patent application serial number 61/116.971 titled &#147;HIV/SIV Vaccine for the Generation of Mucosal and Systemic Immunity&#148; filed November 21, 2008 and PCT application number PCT/US2009/065500&#148; titled &#147;HIV/SIV Vaccine for the Generation of Mucosal and Systemic Immunity&#148; filed on November 23, 2009, and all U.S. patents and foreign patents and patent applications based on these U.S. applications as well as all divisionals, continuations, and those claims in continuations-in-parts (to the extent they are sufficiently described in the applications) of the foregoing, and any re-examinations or reissues of the foregoing (the &#147;HIV/SIV Vaccine Portfolio&#148;). A patent for &#147;HIV/SIV Vaccine for the Generation of Mucosal and Systemic Immunity&#148;, if issued from the pending applications, would expire in 2029 (worldwide), not including any patent term adjustments or extensions.

As consideration for the rights granted in these additional four license agreements, the licensee is obligated to pay the University certain upfront license fees, past and future patent costs and royalties based on net sales of commercialized products covered by the patent-related rights set forth above. No annual or milestone payments are required under any of these four additional license agreements. The upfront license fees for the Cancer Treatment Portfolio and the HIV/SIV Vaccine Portfolio license agreements are $10,000 and $50,000, respectively. No upfront license fees were required under the license agreements for the Allogeneic Cancer&#150;Based Immunotherapy and the Heat Shock Protein GP96 portfolios. Under each of these four additional license agreements, the royalties are equal to a percentage (in the low-to-mid single digits) of net sales of products covered by the patent-related rights in the respective license agreements. These royalty rates are subject to reduction if additional license rights from third parties are required to commercialize licensed products. In the event of a sublicense to a third party, Heat Biologics I, Inc. is obligated to pay royalties to the University equal to a percentage of what it would have been required to pay to the University had it sold the products under sublicense itself. Each of these additional license agreements also provides that the licensee will not have to pay more than the above-noted royalty rates and sublicense fees if more than one license from the University is required to sell products covered by the licensed patent-related rights. In exchange for additional consideration (including the requirement that Heat Biologics I, Inc. pay additional milestone payments of $25,000 before initiation of any Phase 3 clinical trials for products covered by any of the license agreements, and an additional payment equal to 18% annual interest on the amounts due or a note convertible into an equivalent value of shares in our Preferred Stock), the University agreed to postpone the payment due dates prior to February 2010 for each of these four additional licenses. 

All five of the above-described license agreements provide that the licensor has the right to terminate a subject license if the licensee has (i) not introduced, or at least used its best efforts to introduce, a licensed product in the commercial marketplace in the United States, European Union, or Japan by December 31, 2020; (ii) not otherwise exercise diligence to bring licensed products to market; or (iii) files, or has filed against it, a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Act, is adjudged insolvent, makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or has an unreleased or unsatisfied writ of attachment or execution levied upon it.

&#160;

In March 2014, our subsidiary, Heat Biologics I, Inc., entered into an additional exclusive license agreement with the University. The term of this license runs until all the patent-related rights licensed therein have expired, unless terminated earlier. In this exclusive license agreement, Heat Biologics I, Inc. obtained exclusive, worldwide rights to make, use or sell products covered under the University&#146;s interest in the following patent-related rights:

&#183;

U.S. Provisional Patent Application serial number 61/445,884 titled &#8220; Combined Cell Based Gp96-IG-SIV/HIV; Recombinant Gp120 Protein Vaccination For Protection From SIV/HIV &#8221; filed February 23, 2011 (the &#8220; &#8216; 884 application &#8221; ); PCT Application Serial No. PCT/US2012/26256 titled &#147;Combined Cell Based Gp96-IG-SIV/HIV, Recombinant Gp120 Protein Vaccination For Protection From SIV/HIV&#148; filed February 23, 2012 (the &#147; &#145;256 application&#148;); and all U.S. patents and foreign patents and patent applications based on these applications; as well as all divisionals, continuations, and those claims in continuations-in-parts (to the extent they are sufficiently described in the &#145;884 or &#145;256 applications) of the foregoing, and any re-examinations or reissues of the foregoing (the &#147;Combination HIV/SIV Vaccine Portfolio&#148;). A patent for &#147;Combined Cell Based Gp96-IG-SIV/HIV; Recombinant Gp120 Protein Vaccination For Protection From SIV/HIV&#148;, if issued from the pending applications, would expire in 2032 (worldwide), not including any patent term adjustments or extensions.

The patent rights in the Combination HIV/SIV Vaccine Portfolio are co-owned by the University and the National Institutes of Health (the &#147;NIH&#148;). Heat Biologics I, Inc. has only licensed the University&#146;s rights therein. The NIH&#146;s rights in this portfolio have not been licensed by Heat Biologics I, Inc. As consideration for the rights granted in this license agreement, the licensee is obligated to pay the University an upfront license fee, past patent costs, and royalties based on net sales on commercialized products covered by the patent-related rights set forth above. No annual payments are required under this license agreement. The licensee is obligated to make milestone payments under this license agreement as follows: $50,000 upon completion of a phase I clinical trial, $100,000 upon completion of a phase II trial, $100,000 upon completion of a phase III trial, and $100,000 upon acceptance of a BLA by the FDA or its foreign equivalent. Under this license agreement, the royalties are equal to a percentage (low single digits) of net sales of products covered by the patent-related rights. This royalty rate is subject to reduction if additional license rights from third parties are required to commercialize licensed products. In the event of a sublicense to a third party, Heat Biologics I, Inc. is obligated to pay royalties to the University equal to a percentage of what it would have been required to pay to the University had it sold the products under sublicense itself. This license agreement also provides that the licensee will not have to pay more than the above sublicense fees or a royalty in the low-to-mid single digits if more than one license from the University is required to sell products covered by the licensed patent-related rights. The licensor has the right to terminate this license if the licensee has (i) not introduced, or at least use its best efforts to introduce, a licensed product in the commercial marketplace in the United States, European Union, or Japan by December 31, 2023; (ii) not otherwise exercised diligence to bring licensed products to market; or (iii) files, or has filed against it, a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Act, is adjudged insolvent, makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or has an unreleased or unsatisfied writ of attachment or execution levied upon it.

Upon an uncured material breach of an obligation under any one of the above six license agreements by a party, the other party has the right to terminate that agreement upon 90 days notice or 30 days notice if the breach relates to payments due to the University. In the event of a termination, Heat Biologics I, Inc. will be obligated to pay all amounts that accrued prior to such termination. Each of the above license agreements also contains other customary clauses and terms as are common in similar agreements between industry and academia, including the licensee&#146;s agreement to indemnify the University for liabilities arising out of the negligence of the licensee, making the license grant subject to the Bayh-Dole act (35 U.S.C. 200 et seq.), the reservation of the licensor of the right to use the licensed intellectual property rights for its internal, non-commercial purposes, limitations/disclaimers of various warranties and representations, reporting and record-keeping requirements, and licensee liability insurance requirements.

Under the above-described license agreements with the University, we have obtained exclusive rights to six different patent families. The six patent families associated with our ImPACT &#174; platform are:

&#147;Recombinant cancer cell secreting modified heat shock protein-antigenic peptide complex.&#148; 

This family of patent filings relates to methods and compositions for enhancing an immune response. More particularly, the application describes the creation of a tumor cell therapy including a cancer cell that has been engineered to secrete a heat shock protein (gp96), and the use of such therapy to enhance an anti-tumor immune response. Within this family are eight (8) issued patents covering U.S., Australia, Canada, Japan and Europe (collectively validated in 28 countries), and one (1) pending U.S. application. Not including any patent term adjustments or extensions (e.g., for patent office delays or extensions/exclusivity periods provided for new drug approvals in the United States and some foreign countries), the term for patents in this family extends until 2019.

&#160;

&#147;Heat Shock Protein gp96 Vaccination and Methods of Using Same&#148; 

This family of patent filings also relates to methods and compositions for enhancing an immune response. It further describes: (a) how intraperitoneal gp96-Ig administration increases recruitment of innate immune cells into the administration site, mediates proliferation of dendritic cells (DCs) and CD8 cells, and activates natural killer (NK) cells; (b) that gp96-Ig-secreting cell vaccines are more effective when gp96-Ig is continuously released; (c) that frequent gp96 immunizations can overcome tumor-induced immune suppression and retards tumor growth; and (d) that B cell depletion can enhance gp96-Ig -mediated recruitment of NK cells and retention of DCs in the administration site. Within this family are one issued United States patent and one issued Australian patent, and one pending application each in Canada, Europe, Israel, and India. Not including any patent term adjustments or extensions, the term for patents in this family extends until 2029.

In July 2011, we exercised an option agreement with U.Mich and entered into a license agreement with U.Mich pursuant to which we are U.Mich&#146;s exclusive licensee and have the right to use, market, offer for sale, sell and/or sublicense materials and processes related to certain cancer cell lines. The term of the license is perpetual, unless terminated earlier by us or by U.Mich where U.Mich can only terminate for our material breach of this agreement. As consideration for the rights granted in the license agreement, we agreed to pay U.Mich up-front license fees and additional yearly and milestone payments. We also assumed under the license agreement responsibility for any infringement of third party rights caused by our use of the licensed materials. We paid an option fee of $2,000, a license issue fee of $10,000 and are obligated to pay an annual maintenance fee of $10,000 each year until the first commercial sale of a licensed product at which time the annual maintenance fee increases to $50,000. In addition, we are obligated to make milestone payments of $25,000, $50,000 and $75,000 upon completion of a Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 trial and $250,000 upon the first commercial sale of a licensed product and $350,000 upon annual net sales of $100,000,000 or more. The license agreements provide that the licensor has the right to terminate the license should we cease to carry on our business, fail to make a required payment or otherwise materially breach or default in our obligations under the license agreement following the giving of notice and an opportunity to cure any such breach. The license agreement provides that if we do not achieve the following milestones within the required period, U.Mich has the right to terminate the license agreement: completion of a Phase 1 clinical trial on or before January 1, 2015, a Phase 2 clinical trial on or before January 1, 2017, a Phase 3 clinical trial on or before January 1, 2019 and the first commercial sale of a product that includes the materials supplied by U.Mich on or before January 1, 2020. The license agreement also contains other customary clauses and terms as are common in similar agreements between industry and academia.

&#160;

In April 2011, we entered into an evaluation and biological material license agreement with ATCC to evaluate, use, market, offer for sale, sell and/or sublicense materials and processes related to various different cell lines. In October 2013 and March 2014, this agreement was amended to add additional cell lines in exchange for additional fees. The agreement with ATCC provides for an evaluation term of 12 months subject to two additional renewals, and a non-exclusive commercial use license upon termination of the evaluation period to utilize the products we obtain in the evaluation to develop, make, use and sell licensed products. The October 2013 amendment also increased the number of evaluation renewals to a total of five. The agreement with ATCC has a term of 40 years. We paid an evaluation fee and four renewal evaluation fees totaling $25,000, and are obligated to pay a $50,000 fee upon initiation of the commercial license and a less than 1% royalty based on sales of licensed products. In addition, we are obligated to make milestone payments of $15,000, $30,000 and $60,000 upon initiation of a Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 trial, respectively; and $200,000 upon receipt of marketing authorization. In December 2015, we amended this agreement with ATCC to add additional cell lines in exchange for additional fees. 

In September 2014, we entered into an exclusive license agreement for a multiple myeloma cell line with Professor Kenneth Nilsson in Sweden for the production, sale and use for immunotherapy, including the prevention or treatment of disease with substances, synthetic or biologic, that modulate the immune response and specifically exclude the use of the said cell line for discovery of any other therapeutics. The term of the license is perpetual, unless terminated earlier by us or by Professor Kenneth Nilsson where Profession Nilsson can only terminate for our material breach of this agreement. As consideration for the rights granted in the license agreement, we paid an up-front license fee of $5,000 and are obligated to pay an annual maintenance fee of $3,000 each year until the first commercial sale of a licensed product at which time the annual maintenance fee increases to $30,000. In the license agreement, we agreed to pay royalties equal to a one-tenth of low single digit percentage of net sales of licensed products. In addition, we are obligated to make milestone payments of $12,000, $20,000 and $40,000 upon completion of a Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 trial and $100,000 upon the first commercial sale of a licensed product and $200,000 upon annual net sales of $100,000,000 or more. The license agreements provide that the licensor has the right to terminate the license should we cease to carry on our business, fail to make a required payment or otherwise materially breach or default in our obligations under the license agreement following the giving of notice and an opportunity to cure any such breach. There are no timelines to achieve the above milestones. The license agreement also contains other customary clauses and terms as are common in similar agreements between industry and academia.

In August 2015, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Columbia University for an endometrial cancer cell line for the production, sale and use for all human healthcare applications. The term of the license is perpetual, unless terminated earlier by us or by Columbia University where Columbia University can only terminate for our material breach of this agreement. As consideration for the rights granted in the license agreement, we paid an up-front license fee of $7,500 and are obligated to pay an annual maintenance fee of $5,000 each year until the first commercial sale of a licensed product at which time the annual maintenance fee increases to $50,000. In the license agreement, we agreed to pay royalties equal to a one-tenth of low single digit percentage of net sales of licensed products. In addition, we are obligated to make milestone payments of $25,000, $40,000 and $75,000 upon completion of a Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 trial and $200,000 upon the first commercial sale of a licensed product and $500,000 upon annual net sales of $100,000,000 or more. The license agreements provide that the licensor has the right to terminate the license should we cease to carry on our business, fail to make a required payment or otherwise materially breach or default in our obligations under the license agreement following the giving of notice and an opportunity to cure any such breach. There are no timelines to achieve the above milestones. The license agreement also contains other customary clauses and terms as are common in similar agreements between industry and academia. 

With enhanced internal research and development capabilities, in 2015-2016, we filed five (5) provisional patent applications, one U.S. non-provisional application, and two (2) PCT applications relating to new technologies developed by the Company. Together, our ImPACT &#174; / ComPACT TM patent portfolio comprises eighteen (18) issued patents and thirty-one (31) pending patent applications. These patents and applications cover the United States, Europe, and Japan as well as several other countries having commercially significant markets.

Government Regulation 

&#160;

FDA Approval Process 

In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, (the &#147;FDC Act&#148;), and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Biological products used for the prevention, treatment, or cure of a disease or condition of a human being are subject to regulation under the FDC Act, except the section of the FDC Act which governs the approval of new drug applications, or NDAs. Biological products are approved for marketing under provisions of the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, via a Biologics License Application, or BLA. However, the application process and requirements for approval of BLAs are very similar to those for NDAs, and biologics are associated with similar approval risks and costs as drugs. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs or BLAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.

Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the United States typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease.

Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.

A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug or biologic to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practice, or GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.

The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB&#146;s requirements, or may impose other conditions.

&#160;

Clinical trials to support NDAs or BLAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug or biologic into healthy human subjects or patients, the product is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug or biologic for a particular indication, dosage tolerance, and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug or biologic and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug or biologic. A single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible.

After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA or BLA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA or BLA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA or BLA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product&#146;s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA or BLA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs and BLAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, currently exceeding $2,335,200, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved new drug application are also subject to annual product and establishment user fees, currently exceeding $110,370 per product and $569,200 per establishment. These fees are typically increased annually.

The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA or BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency&#146;s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs and BLAs. Most such applications for standard review drug or biologic products are reviewed within ten to 12 months; most applications for priority review drugs or biologics are reviewed in six to eight months. The FDA can extend these reviews by three months. Priority review can be applied to drugs that the FDA determines offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. For biologics, priority review is further limited only for products intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease relative to the currently approved products. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.

The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug or biologic products, or drug or biologic products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee &#150; typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts &#150; for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, is satisfactory and the NDA or BLA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug or biologic is safe and effective in the indication studied.

After the FDA evaluates the NDA or BLA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA&#146;s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA or BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or nine months depending on the type of information included.

An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug or biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA or BLA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug or biologic outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the product&#146;s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.

&#160;

Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or BLA or NDA or BLA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA or BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA or BLA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs or BLAs.

Post-Approval Requirements 

Once an NDA or BLA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs and biologics, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs and biologics may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling.

Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA or BLA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug and biologic manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subject entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.

Orphan Drugs 

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs or biologics intended to treat a rare disease or condition &#150; generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug or biologic and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA or BLA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biologic for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA or BLA application user fee.

Fast Track Designation and Accelerated Approval 

The FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs or biologics that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the fast track program, the sponsor of a new drug or biologic candidate may request that the FDA designate the candidate for a specific indication as a fast track drug or biologic concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the candidate. The FDA must determine if the drug or biologic candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor&#146;s request.

Under the fast track program and FDA&#146;s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug or biologic for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.

&#160;

In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A drug or biologic candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow the FDA to withdraw the drug or biologic from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.

In addition to other benefits such as the ability to use surrogate endpoints and engage in more frequent interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track product&#146;s NDA or BLA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA&#146;s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA or BLA is submitted. Additionally, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.

On March 5, 2015, we were notified that the FDA granted FAST Track designation for HS-410 for the treatment of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. We believe that this designation will expedite our development of HS-410.

Pediatric Information 

Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, NDAs or BLAs or supplements to NDAs or BLAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.

Additional Controls for Biologics 

To help reduce the increased risk of the introduction of adventitious agents, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing controls for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The PHSA also provides authority to the FDA to immediately suspend licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs, and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases in the United States and between states.

After a BLA is approved, the product may also be subject to official lot release as a condition of approval. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer&#146;s tests performed on the lot. The FDA may also perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products. As with drugs, after approval of biologics, manufacturers must address any safety issues that arise, are subject to recalls or a halt in manufacturing, and are subject to periodic inspection after approval.

&#160;

Biosimilars 

The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, creates an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be highly similar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. Biosimilarity sufficient to reference a prior FDA-approved product requires that there be no differences in conditions of use, route of administration, dosage form, and strength, and no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. Biosimilarity must be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and at least one clinical study, absent a waiver by the Secretary. A biosimilar product may be deemed interchangeable with a prior approved product if it meets the higher hurdle of demonstrating that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. No biosimilar or interchangeable products have been approved under the BPCIA to date. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the process by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation which are still being evaluated by the FDA.

A reference biologic is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product, and no application for a biosimilar can be submitted for four years from the date of licensure of the reference product. The first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against a finding of interchangeability for other biologics for the same condition of use for the lesser of (i) one year after first commercial marketing of the first interchangeable biosimilar, (ii) 18 months after the first interchangeable biosimilar is approved if there is no patent challenge, (iii) 18 months after resolution of a lawsuit over the patents of the reference biologic in favor of the first interchangeable biosimilar applicant, or (iv) 42 months after the first interchangeable biosimilar&#146;s application has been approved if a patent lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period.

Cell and Tissue-Based Biologics 

Establishments that manufacture cell and tissue-based products must comply with the FDA&#146;s current good tissue practices, or cGTP, which are FDA regulations that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of such products. The primary intent of the cGTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also include requirements for a unified registration and listing system, donor screening and testing, adverse reaction reporting, and labeling. 

Cell and tissue based products may also be subject to the same approval standards, including demonstration of safety and efficacy, as other biologic and drug products if they meet certain criteria such as if the cells or tissues are more than minimally manipulated or if they are intended for a non-homologous use. Products manufactured using the ImPACT &#174; technology meet this threshold and therefore are considered biological drugs. Manufacture of ImPACT &#174; products are subject to both cGTP and cGMP regulations for manufacturing quality. Marketing of these products in the United States will require FDA approval under the BLA pathway as discussed above.

Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information 

Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Our lung and bladder cancer trials have been registered on clinicaltrials.gov, which registration has been updated to reflect the recent discovery of the identity of the cell line used in our bladder cancer trial. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.

&#160;

Non-U.S. Regulation 

Before our products can be marketed outside of the United States, they are subject to regulatory approval of the respective authorities in the country in which the product should be marketed. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. No action can be taken to market any product in a country until an appropriate application has been approved by the regulatory authorities in that country. The current approval process varies from country to country, and the time spent in gaining approval varies from that required for FDA approval. In certain countries, the sales price of a product must also be approved. The pricing review period often begins after market approval is granted. Even if a product is approved by a regulatory authority, satisfactory prices might not be approved for such product.

&#160;

In Europe, marketing authorizations may be submitted at a centralized, a decentralized or national level; however, the centralized procedure is mandatory for the approval of biotechnology products and provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid in all European Union member states. There can be no assurance that the chosen regulatory strategy will secure regulatory approval on a timely basis or at all.

While we intend to market our products outside the United States in compliance with our respective license agreements, we have not made any applications with non-U.S. authorities and have no timeline for such applications or marketing.

&#160;

Research and Development 

&#160;

We have built an internal and external research and development organization that includes expertise in discovery research, preclinical development, product formulation, analytical and medicinal chemistry, manufacturing, clinical development and regulatory and quality assurance. We engage third parties on a limited basis to conduct portions of our preclinical research; however, we are not substantially dependent upon any third parties for our preclinical research nor do any of these third parties conduct a major portion of our preclinical research. Research and development expenses were $2.6 million and $2.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had a total of 25 employees, of which 24 are full-time employees and 1 is part-time. We believe our relationships with our employees are satisfactory. None of our employees is represented by a labor union. We anticipate that we will need to identify, attract, train and retain other highly skilled personnel to pursue our development program. Hiring for such personnel is competitive, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our key employees or attract, assimilate or retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business.

Legal Proceedings
