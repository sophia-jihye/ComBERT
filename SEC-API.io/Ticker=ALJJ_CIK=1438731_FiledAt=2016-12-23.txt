&#160;

&#8226; 

Staffing services. 

Faneuil&#8217;s customer contact employees undergo intensive training and development, followed by structured monitoring and assessments before they are certified to process customer contacts. Faneuil&#8217;s customer contact employees provide service delivery through multiple communication channels, including telephone, fax, email, web chat and face-to-face interaction. Additionally, Faneuil provides multi-lingual representatives to accommodate the communication needs of non-English-speaking customers, as well as the hearing-impaired. 

Employees 

Faneuil had 3,425 employees as of September 30, 2016 all located in the U.S. None of Faneuil&#8217;s employees are subject to any collective bargaining agreements. Faneuil considers its employee relations good. 

Customers 

Faneuil&#8217;s client portfolio includes both government and commercial entities nationwide, including several toll authorities, state agencies, municipalities, a publicly owned utility, two health benefit exchanges, one government agency that operates the major airports serving the Washington, D.C. area, and several other public and private entities. 

The percentages of Faneuil net revenues derived from its significant customers for the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:

Customer A represented 17.8% and 24.3% of ALJ&#8217;s consolidated net revenues for the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Contract 1 concluded in October 2016. In the normal course of business, the Company experiences contract turnover. The revenue reduction resulting from this contract conclusion has been replaced with a new customer. 

** 

Less than 10% of Faneuil net revenues.

Many of Faneuil&#8217;s customers are government agencies subject to contractual budgetary ceilings. State and local funding for these agencies are approved by the respective state legislature(s) each year. Depending on budgetary constraints, the contract values may be subject to change based upon ongoing legislative approval. 

Competition 

Faneuil&#8217;s primary competitors are other large providers of toll services, such as Xerox, AEComm and TransCore, Inc., as well as contact center operators such as Maximus and Alberta Health Services. In many cases, Faneuil is smaller and has less financial and personnel resources than its competitors. If Faneuil cannot compete effectively to win new business and retain existing clients, its operating results will be negatively affected. To remain competitive, Faneuil must continuously implement new technologies and expand its portfolio of outsourced services and may have to make occasional strategic adjustments to its pricing for its services.

Properties 

Faneuil leases all its properties with various locations throughout the United States for customer contact centers, walk-in retail, and administration. Corporate headquarters are located in Hampton, VA. Faneuil&#8217;s leased facilities comprise an aggregate of 

&#160;

approximately 249,000 squ are feet with leases that expire at various dates through December 2021. Faneuil believes the facilities under lease will be adequate for at least the next 12 months. 

Backlog 

&#160;

Faneuil&#8217;s backlog represents executed contracts for future services. The majority of Faneuil&#8217;s contracts are long-term and obligate Faneuil to provide services over multiple years. Faneuil&#8217;s backlog may not represent guarantees of services as some of our contracts, especially with government entities, allow for cancellation under certain instances. Faneuil adjusts backlog to reflect contract cancellations, deferrals and revisions known at the reporting date; however, future contract modifications or cancellations may increase or reduce backlog and future revenue.

The majority of the decrease as of September 30, 2015 compared to September 30, 2016 was a result of revenue recognized during the year ended September 30, 2016 from contracts included in Faneuil&#8217;s backlog at September 30, 2015.

&#160;

See &#8220;Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to our Business Generally and our Common Stock - We may not receive the full amounts estimated under the contracts in our backlog, which could reduce our revenue in future periods below the levels anticipated. This makes backlog an uncertain indicator of future operating results. &#8221;

Seasonality 

Faneuil experiences seasonality within its various lines of business. For example, during the end of the calendar year through the end of the first calendar quarter, Faneuil generally experiences higher revenues with its healthcare customers as the customer contact centers increase operations during the enrollment periods of the healthcare exchanges. Faneuil&#8217;s revenue from its healthcare customers generally decreases during the remaining portion of the year after the enrollment period. Seasonality is less prevalent in the transportation industry though there is typically an increase in volume during the summer months. 

Governmental Regulation 

Faneuil&#8217;s business is subject to many legal and regulatory requirements in the United States, covering such matters as data privacy, consumer protection, health care requirements, labor relations, taxation, internal and disclosure control obligations, governmental affairs and immigration. For example, Faneuil is subject to state and federal laws and regulations regarding the protection of consumer information commonly referred to as &#8220;non-public personal information.&#8221; For instance, the collection of patient data through Faneuil&#8217;s contact center services and medical device tracking services is subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, commonly known as HIPAA, which protects the privacy of patient data. These laws, regulations and agreements require Faneuil to develop and implement policies to protect non-public personal information and to disclose these policies to consumers before a customer relationship is established and periodically after that. These laws, regulations, and agreements limit Faneuil&#8217;s ability to use or disclose non-public personal information for other than the purposes originally intended. Many of these regulations, including those related to data privacy, are frequently changing and sometimes conflict with existing ones amongst the various jurisdictions in which Faneuil provides services. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in liability for damages, fines, criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity and restrictions on Faneuil&#8217;s ability to operate. Faneuil&#8217;s failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to Faneuil&#8217;s reputation in the marketplace, which could have a material adverse effect on Faneuil&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. Also, because a substantial portion of Faneuil&#8217;s operating costs consists of labor costs, changes in governmental regulations relating to wages, healthcare and healthcare reform and other benefits or employment taxes could have a material adverse effect on Faneuil&#8217;s business, results of operations or financial condition. 

&#160;

Management 

Faneuil is led by ALJ board member Anna Van Buren, who has served as Faneuil&#8217;s President and Chief Executive Officer since 2009, and previously served in executive roles at Faneuil since 2004. For additional information regarding Ms. Van Buren, see &#8220;Part III, Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance.&#8221;

Suppliers

Carpets has historically purchased materials from a small number of suppliers primarily to control the quality of the product and to capitalize on volume discounts. If these suppliers were unable to provide materials on a timely basis, Carpets management believes 

&#160;

alternative suppliers could provide the required materials with minimal disruption to the business. Historically, Carpets has never experienced any significant delay or shortage in the supply of materials.

Competition 

Carpets&#8217; primary competitors are other flooring, countertop and surround and cabinet providers in the Las Vegas area, such as Interior Specialist Inc. and Classic Flooring, as well as large box stores like Lowe&#8217;s, Home Depot and RC Willey. Carpets believes that its competitive advantages include a comprehensive and high-end quality solution for home builders for flooring, surrounds and cabinets, which provides them with a single point of accountability. Carpets also competes with discounted flooring companies like Cloud Carpet and Carpets Galore. 

Seasonality 

Carpets generally experiences seasonality within the home building business as the number of houses sold during the winter months is generally lower than other times during the year. Conversely, the number of houses sold and delivered during the remaining portion of the year increases in comparison. 

Employees 

Carpets had 142 employees as of September 30, 2016. None of its employees are subject to any collective bargaining agreements. Carpets considers its employee relations good. 

&#160;

Properties 

Carpets leases and operates five retail locations and one fabrication facility in and around Las Vegas, NV. Carpets corporate offices are also located in Las Vegas, NV. Carpets leased facilities comprise an aggregate of approximately 118,000 square feet with leases that expire at various dates through September 2021. Carpets believes the facilities under lease will be adequate for at least the next 12 months. 

Management 

Carpets is led by Steve Chesin, who has served as its Chief Executive Officer since 2007. For additional information about Mr. Chesin, see &#8220;Part III, Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance.&#8221; 

Phoenix Color Corp. 

Background 

Phoenix was originally incorporated in New York in 1979 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1996. We acquired Phoenix from Visant Corporation in 2015 for aggregate consideration of $88.3 million. 

Phoenix is a premier full-service, full-color printer with over 35 years of superior print experience. Drawing on a broad spectrum of materials and decorative technologies, Phoenix produces memorable, value-added components, heavily illustrated books and specialty commercial products. Book publishers generally design book components to enhance the sales appeal of their books. The production of book components requires specialized equipment, materials, and finishes and often demands high-quality, intricate work. As a result, many leading publishers rely on specialty printers such as Phoenix to supply high-quality book components. This same philosophy applies to labels, packaging, and specialty commercial products, where Phoenix&#8217;s customers require the knowledge and expertise of a printer that can enhance their products for sale into the commercial marketplace. Phoenix has been servicing the publishing industry within the United States since 1979 and has formed lasting relationships with many of the biggest names in book publishing. 

As a domestic manufacturer, Phoenix offers extensive, in-house digital pre-press capabilities and its technologically advanced UV printing platform supports an array of printing and finishing options. Phoenix&#8217;s innovative special effects include foil stamping, UV embellishments and laminations, as well as its trademarked products LithoFoil &#174; , MetalTone&#8482;, Look of Leather&#8482; and VibraColor&#8482;. 

Acquisition of Color Optics

On July 18, 2016, Phoenix acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities from AKI, Inc. (&#8220;AKI&#8221;) in respect of AKI&#8217;s Color Optics division (&#8220;Color Optics&#8221;) for an adjusted purchase price of $6.6 million cash. 

Color Optics is a leading printing and packaging solutions business servicing the beauty, fragrance, cosmetic and consumer-packaged goods markets. The purchase of Color Optics complements Phoenix&#8217;s current product offerings and will allow Phoenix to expand and diversify its product offerings by leveraging its existing core competencies.

The following is a summary of Color Optics revenue and earnings included in the Company&#8217;s consolidated statements of operations for the year ended September 30, 2016 ( in thousands ):

With its technologically advanced prepress and press operations as well as an array of finishing applications and innovative special effects, Phoenix is committed to producing memorable, value-added products. 

&#160;

Labels and Packaging 

In recent years, Phoenix has expanded into the label and packaging markets to leverage its unique printing and finishing capabilities as well as its trademarked special effects and extensive offerings of finishes and coatings. In 2014, Phoenix acquired the Brady Palmer Company, establishing its presence in the cut and stack label market. With the purchase of Color Optics, Phoenix strengthened its presence in the label and packaging markets. Phoenix is continuing to pursue growth in the folding carton and box wrap markets as well, and has invested in additional manufacturing capabilities and sales and marketing personnel to support these efforts. 

Employees 

Phoenix had 391 employees as of September 30, 2016, of which 12 are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. Phoenix considers its employee relations good.

Backlog

&#160;

Phoenix&#8217;s backlog represents executed contracts that contain minimum volume commitments over multiple years for future product deliveries. Phoenix includes only the minimum commitments as backlog. As Phoenix&#8217;s executed contracts mostly provide for minimum volume commitments rather than minimum revenue commitments, the actual revenue from such contracts may differ from our backlog estimates as total order volume from Phoenix&#8217;s customers may vary. Phoenix adjusts backlog to reflect estimated order volumes delivered by its customers based on historical experience known at the reporting date; however, future variations in order volumes by Phoenix&#8217;s customers may increase or decrease backlog and future revenue.

The majority of the increase as of September 30, 2016 compared to September 30, 2015 was a result of new contracts with volume commitments executed during the year ended September 30, 2016 slightly offset by revenue recognized during the year ended September 30, 2016 from Phoenix&#8217;s backlog at September 30, 2015. 

&#160;

See &#8220;Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to our Business Generally and our Common Stock - We may not receive the full amounts estimated under the contracts in our backlog, which could reduce our revenue in future periods below the levels anticipated. This makes backlog an uncertain indicator of future operating results. &#8221;

Seasonality 

There is seasonality to Phoenix&#8217;s business. Education book component sales (school and college) traditionally peak in the first and second quarters of the calendar year. Other book components sales traditionally peak in the third quarter of the calendar year. Book sales also traditionally peak in the third quarter of the calendar year. The fourth quarter of the calendar year traditionally has been Phoenix&#8217;s weakest quarter. These seasonal factors are not significant. 

Competition 

The printing industry in general, and the printing and manufacturing of books in particular, is extremely competitive. Over the past several years, there has been significant consolidation in the publishing industry, such that fewer publishers control a greater share of the market. Although there are still many small, independent publishers, they do not wield the leverage held by major publishing houses. Additionally, the printing industry has experienced a reduction in demand for trade books due to the impact of the e-book market and a reduction in textbooks due to lower state government funding, alternative product formats and digital distribution of content. 

Phoenix&#8217;s primary competitors in the printing and manufacturing of books and book components include, but are not limited to, LSC Communications, Coral Graphics, Quad Graphics and Worzalla. There is no reliable industry data available to determine Phoenix&#8217;s market share and position versus that of its competitors. With respect to book components, a portion of the products is produced by the book manufacturers and a portion by component printers. The dollar value of book components manufactured by the book manufacturers or by other component printers is unknown. Phoenix and Coral Graphics are the two primary trade book component manufacturers used by major publishers in the U.S. market. Most high-quality, heavily-illustrated and multi-colored books sold in the U.S. are produced outside of the U.S. Phoenix competes with Worzalla and several domestic book manufacturers for that portion that is produced domestically. 

Properties 

Phoenix owns its principal properties for corporate offices and production located in Hagerstown, MD. Phoenix&#8217;s owned facilities comprise an aggregate of approximately 276,000 square feet. Color Optics leases approximately 84,000 square feet in Rockaway, NJ. The lease expires in 2020. Phoenix believes its facilities will be adequate for at least the next 12 months.

Management 

Phoenix is led by our board member Marc Reisch, who serves as its Chairman and previously served as its Chief Executive Officer from 2008 to 2015. For additional information regarding Mr. Reisch, see &#8220;Part III, Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance.&#8221;
