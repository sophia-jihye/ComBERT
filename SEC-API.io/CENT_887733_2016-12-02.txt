BUSINESS 

Our Company 

Central Garden &#38; Pet Company (&#8220;Central&#8221;) is a leading innovator, marketer and producer, of quality branded products and distributor of third party products in the pet and lawn and garden supplies industries in the United States. The total pet food, treats and supplies industry in 2015 was estimated by Packaged Facts to have been approximately $50.8 billion in annual retail sales. We estimate the annual retail sales of the pet supplies and consumables and natural pet food markets in the categories in which we participate to be approximately $30.1 billion. The total lawn and garden consumables and decorative products industry in the United States is estimated to be approximately $25.0 billion in annual retail sales, including fertilizer, pesticides, growing media, seeds, mulch, other consumables and decorative products. We estimate the annual retail sales of the lawn and garden consumables and decorative products markets in the categories in which we participate to be approximately &#32; $17.6 billion . 

Our pet supplies products include products for dogs and cats, including edible bones, premium healthy edible and non-edible chews, super premium dog and cat food and treats, toys, pet carriers, grooming supplies and other accessories; products for birds, small animals and specialty pets, including food, cages and habitats, toys, chews and related accessories; animal and household health and insect control products; products for fish, reptiles and other aquarium-based pets, including aquariums, furniture and lighting fixtures, pumps, filters, water conditioners, food and supplements, and information and knowledge resources; and products for horses and livestock.

Leadership 

George C. Roeth became our President and Chief Executive Officer effective June 1, 2016. Mr. Roeth has been a director of Central since 2015. 

Investment Impairment 

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $16.6 million related to our investment in two joint ventures as a result of changes in marketplace conditions, which impacted the expected cash flows and recoverability of the investment. The impairment is included within Other income (expense). 

Debt Refinancing 

Note Offering &#32;- In November 2015, we issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 6.125% senior notes due November 2023 (the &#8220;2023 Notes&#8221;). The 2023 Notes are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis by each of our existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries which are borrowers under or guarantors of our senior secured revolving credit facility. We used the net proceeds from the offering, together with available cash, to redeem our outstanding 8.25% senior subordinated notes due March 1, 2018 (the &#8220;2018 Notes&#8221;) and pay fees and expenses related to the offering. As a result of our redemption of the 2018 Notes, we incurred incremental interest expense of $14.3 million in our fiscal 2016 first quarter, comprised of approximately $8.3 million related to the payment of the call premium, a one-time payment of overlapping interest expense for 30 days of approximately $2.7 million and a $3.3 million non-cash charge for the write-off of unamortized financing costs in interest expense. We expect our annual interest expense on the 2023 Notes going forward to be approximately $8.5 million less than under the 2018 Notes. 

Asset-Based Loan Facility Amendment - In April 2016, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement which provides up to a $400 million principal amount senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility, with up to an additional $200 million principal amount available with the consent of the Lenders if we exercise the accordion feature (collectively, the &#8220;Amended Credit Facility&#8221;). The Amended Credit Facility matures on April 22, 2021. 

DMC Acquisition 

In December 2015, we purchased the pet bedding and certain other assets of National Consumers Outdoors Corp., formerly known as Dallas Manufacturing Company (&#8220;DMC&#8221;), for a cash purchase price of $61 million. This acquisition is expected to complement our existing dog and cat business. 

Subsequent Events 

Segrest, Inc. Acquisition 

In October 2016 , we purchased Segrest Inc. for a purchase price of $60 million , of which $6 million is contingent upon future events. Segrest is the leading wholesaler of aquarium fish and is expected to strengthen our position in the aquatics category and provide the opportunity for synergies with our existing aquatics business. 

Veterinary Products Business 

In November 2016, we sold a small veterinary products division, which had sales of $8.6 million in fiscal 2016. The business was not profitable over the last several years. 

Competitive Strengths 

We believe we have a number of competitive strengths, which serve as the foundation of our business strategy, including the following: 

&#8226; 

Market Leadership Positions Built on a Strong Brand Portfolio . We are one of the leaders in the U.S. pet supplies market and in the U.S. consumer lawn and garden supplies market. We have a diversified portfolio of brands, many of which we believe are among the leading brands in their respective U.S. market categories. The majority of our brands have been marketed and sold for more than 25 years. 

&#8226; 

History of Innovative New Products and Customer Service . We continuously seek to introduce new products, both as complementary extensions of existing product lines and as new product categories. Over the last three years, we have received a number of awards for innovation, customer service and marketing. For innovation in 2016, the Pet segment received awards at both Global Pet Expo and Super Zoo in the reptile category for Zilla Turtle Trunk and in the aquatics category for Aqueon NeoGlow aquariums. Aqueon's OptiBright won Pet Product News Editor's Choice award and both Aqueon Jukebox 5 aquarium kit and Herptile Habitat Accessories for Zilla Turtle Trunk won the Pet Business Industry Recognition Award. Also in 2016, we won Best in Show at Global Pet for the the small animal category for Kaytee Critter Trail LED. In 2015, we received best new aquatic product at Global Pet Expo 2015 for the Aqueon Jukebox and a Product of the Year award s &#32;in 2014 for the Adams Flea and Tick Home Spray. For customer service in 2016, we received Lowe's Lawn &#38; Garden Supplier of the Year award. Also in 2016, at the Wal*Mart Lawn &#38; Garden Supplier Summit, Central was recognized for both e-commerce and collaboration. 

&#8226; 

Strong Relationships with Retailers . We have developed strong relationships with major and independent retailers, as well as e-commerce retailers, through product innovation, premium brands, broad product offerings, private label programs, proprietary sales and logistics capabilities and a high level of customer service. Major retailers value the efficiency of dealing with suppliers with national scope and strong brands. Our ability to meet their unique needs for packaging and point of sale displays provides us with a competitive advantage. Independent retailers value our high level of customer service and broad array of premium branded products. We believe these strengths have made us one of the largest pet supplies vendors to PetSmart, PETCO and Wal*Mart and among the largest lawn and garden supplies vendors to Wal*Mart, Home Depot and Lowe&#8217;s, as well as a leading supplier to independent pet and garden supplies retailers in the United States. 

&#8226; 

Favorable Long-Term Industry Characteristics . We believe the U.S. pet supplies market is expected to grow over the long-term due to favorable demographic and leisure trends. The key demographics bolstering our markets are the growth rates in the number of children under 18 and the number of adults over age 55. Households with children tend to own more pets, and adults over 55 are more likely to be &#8220;empty nesters&#8221; that keep pets as companions and have more disposable income and leisure time. According to the 2015-2016 APPA National Pet Owners Survey, the number of U.S. pet owners in recent years has reached record highs, with 79.7 million households, or 65%, owning a pet. 

&#8226; 

Sales and Logistics Networks . We are a leading supplier to independent specialty retailers for the pet and lawn and garden supplies markets through our sales and logistics networks. We believe our sales and logistics networks give us a significant competitive advantage over other suppliers. These networks provide us with key access to independent pet specialty retail stores and retail lawn and garden customers that require two-step distribution for our branded products facilitating: 

&#9702; 

acquisition and maintenance of premium shelf placement; 

&#9702; 

prompt product replenishment; 

&#9702; 

customization of retailer programs; 

&#9702; 

quick responses to changing customer and retailer preferences; 

&#9702; 

rapid deployment and feedback for new products; and 

&#9702; 

immediate exposure for new internally developed and acquired brands. 

We plan to continue to utilize our team of dedicated sales people and our sales and logistics networks to expand sales of our branded products. 

Business Strategy 

Our objective is to increase market share, revenue, earnings and cash flow by enhancing our position as one of the leading companies in the U.S. pet supplies and lawn and garden supplies industries. To achieve our objective, we plan to capitalize on our strengths and favorable industry trends by implementing the following key elements of our business strategy: 

&#8226; 

Balanced Organizational Change . We have adopted a balanced approach to improving profitability through a focus on increasing sales and improving margins, providing superior customer service and innovative new products while improving our operations and reducing costs. We expect to continue this balanced approach in the future and to continue to focus on profit, our customers, and eliminating inefficiencies. 

&#8226; 

Build Existing Brands . With our broad product assortment, strong brand names, strong sell-through and innovative products and packaging, we believe we can further strengthen our relationships with existing and new retailers, as well as e-commerce retailers, to increase shelf space and sales. Under our master branding strategy, we have consolidated certain brands and expanded others. At the same time, we are developing private label programs for key retailers to complement our proprietary brands, strengthen our relationships with key retailers and increase sales and profits. We believe that the strength of our major customers provides us with a solid foundation for future growth. We intend to gain market share in the home centers, mass market, grocery, specialty pet store and independent channels. We intend to add new retailers through marketing and sales personnel dedicated to these channels, as well as our innovative product introductions and packaging. We will continue to focus on using our sales and logistics network to emphasize sales of our higher margin, proprietary brands and to use efficient supply chain capabilities that enable us to provide retailers with high service levels and consistent in-stock positions. 

&#8226; 

Continue New Product and Packaging Innovation . We will continue to build and leverage the strength of our leading brand names by introducing innovative new products and packaging, extending existing product lines and entering new product categories. Our product strategy seeks to capitalize on fulfilling consumer needs, leveraging our strong brand names, utilizing our established customer relationships and continuing our history of product innovation. 

&#8226; 

Improve Profitability . We believe there are opportunities to improve our gross and operating profits through increasing sales of our innovative branded products, acquiring new private label business and reducing and leveraging our existing infrastructure. Although we focused more on achieving gross margin gains in the past several years, we have shifted our focus to concentrate more on overall profitability than on any specific gross margin targets. We have undertaken a number of initiatives to lower the cost of production, and believe success in doing so will allow us to gain additional sales and increase our profitability. 

&#8226; 

Pursue Strategic Acquisitions . We plan to continue to make selected strategic acquisitions of companies that complement our existing brands and product offerings. By leveraging our marketing, manufacturing and sales and logistics capabilities, we believe we can increase the sales and improve the operating efficiencies of the companies we acquire. We generally seek target companies with high quality and innovative product offerings, an experienced management team and historical and projected organic earnings growth. 

&#8226; 

Reduce Our Investment In Working Capital . We believe there are opportunities to reduce our investment in working capital over the long term by focusing on specific balance sheet metrics. In particular, we believe that the improvement in our fill rates as a result of tighter linkage between our businesses and supply chain will enable us to reduce our investment in inventory without compromising the level of the service we provide to our customers. During fiscal 2014 , we reduced our inventory level from $391.9 million &#32;to $326.4 million &#32;while maintaining high fill rates. Our inventory level at the end of fiscal 2015 &#32;and fiscal 2016 &#32;increased to $335.9 million &#32;and $362.0 million , respectively, as a result of acquisitions. Our inventory turns have continued to improve as a result of our focus on our working capital.

Pet Segment 

Overview 

We are one of the leading marketers and producers of pet supplies in the United States. In addition, our Pet segment operates one of the largest sales and logistics networks in the industry strategically supporting our brands. In fiscal 2016 , Pet segment net sales were $1,081.8 million &#32;and operating income was $119.9 million . 

Industry Background 

According to the Packaged Facts U.S. Pet Market Outlook, 2016 - 2017, the number of U.S. households with dogs or cats in 2015 increased to nearly 54% from a previous range of 51-53% since 2011. 

The pet industry includes food, supplies, veterinarian care, services and live animals. We operate primarily in the pet supplies segment of the industry. This segment includes: products for dogs and cats, including edible bones, premium healthy edible and non-edible chews, rawhide, toys, pet beds, pet carriers, grooming supplies and other accessories; products for birds, small animals and specialty pets, including cages and habitats, toys, chews, and related accessories; animal and household health and insect control products; products for fish, reptiles and other aquarium-based pets, including aquariums, furniture and lighting fixtures, pumps, filters, water conditioners and supplements, and information and knowledge resources; and products for horses and livestock. Packaged Facts estimates the pet supplies segment was $14.5 billion in revenue in 2014, up 2.5% from 2013. We also operate in the natural category of dog and cat food and treats and chews. 

We believe this industry growth is due in significant part to favorable demographic and leisure trends, which we expect to continue, albeit potentially at a slower rate due to a lower rate of growth in the broader U.S. economy. The key demographics bolstering the U.S. pet supplies market are the growth rates in the number of children under 18 and the number of adults over age 55. According to 2012 U.S. interim census data, approximately 41% of the population is 45 years or older. Households with children tend to own more pets, and adults over 55 are more likely to be &#8220;empty nesters&#8221; who keep pets as companions and have more disposable income and leisure time available for pets. In addition, many pet supplies products (e.g., dog and cat food, dog chews, bird food, grooming supplies, pest control, etc.) are routinely consumed and replenished. For example, as many as 87% of dog owners and 68% of cat owners regularly purchase some type of treat. 

The U.S. pet supplies market is highly fragmented with approximately 1,400 manufacturers, consisting primarily of small companies with limited product lines. The majority of these manufacturers do not have a captive sales and logistics network and must rely on us or other independent distributors to supply their products to regional pet specialty chains and independent retailers. According to Packaged Facts, pet supplies sales increased 14.9% from 2010 to 2014. Sales are expected to increase an additional 16% to $16.8 billion by 2019, indicating the strength of this category. 

The pet food and supplies industry retail channel also remains fragmented, with approximately 7,800 independent pet supply stores in the United States and only two national specialty retailers, PetSmart and PETCO. These two &#8220;pet superstores&#8221; have grown rapidly, and pet products have also become a growing category in mass merchandisers, discounters, grocery outlets and the e-commerce channel. PetSmart and PETCO typically offer the broadest product selection with competitive prices and a growing array of pet services. Mass merchandisers, supermarkets and discounters have historically carried a limited product assortment that features primarily pet food, but we believe these retailers are devoting more shelf space to meet increased 

consumer demand for premium pet supplies. Independent pet stores typically have a relatively broad product selection and attempt to differentiate themselves by offering premier brands and knowledgeable service. 

Proprietary Branded Pet Products 

Our principal pet supplies categories are dog and cat, aquatics, bird and small animal, wild bird feed and animal health products. 

Dog &#38; Cat. &#32;The dog and cat category, featuring the brands Nylabone, Four Paws, Cadet &#174; , Dallas Manufacturing Company (DMC), TFH Publications, Pet Select, Pet Love and Mikki &#174; , is an industry leader in manufacturing and marketing premium edible and non-edible chews, interactive toys, super premium dog and cat food, grooming supplies and pet-care print and digital content. 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Nylabone is made in the United States and has a strong history of developing innovative products such as NutriDent &#174; &#32;Edible Dental Brush Chews, as well as numerous other award-winning dog toys and healthy chews. 

&#8226; 

IMS is a manufacturer and supplier of a full-line of quality rawhide and other natural dog chews, and treats. 

&#8226; 

Four Paws Products include industry leaders in grooming and waste management products under the Wee Wee and Magic Coat Brands. 

&#8226; 

DMC, the industry-leading dog &#38; cat bed company and supplier to many of the largest retailers for private label and branded bedding. 

&#8226; 

TFH Publications is a globally recognized publisher of both pet books and an aquatics magazine. 

&#8226; 

Breeder&#8217;s Choice, featuring the Pinnacle &#174; &#32;and AvoDerm &#174; &#32;brands, is a manufacturer of natural pet food and treats. 

Aquatics. &#32;We are a leading supplier of aquariums and related fixtures and furniture, water conditioners and supplements, sophisticated lighting systems and accessories featuring the brands Aqueon, Zilla, Kent Marine, Coralife and Blagdon. In October 2016, we purchased Segrest Inc., the leading wholesaler of aquarium fish. 

Small Animal, Pet Bird &#38; Wild Bird Feed. &#32;We are a leading marketer and producer of supplies and pet food for pet birds, small animals and wild birds. We offer a full range of products including species specific diets, treats, habitats, bedding, hay and toys under the Kaytee &#174; , Forti-Diet and Critter Trail &#174; &#32;brands. Kaytee is one of the most widely recognized and trusted brands for birds and small animals. 

Animal Health. &#32;We are a leading marketer and producer of flea, tick, mosquito and other insect control products produced by Wellmark International and sold primarily under the Bio Spot Active Care &#8482; , Adams, Altosid, Pre Strike and Extinguish &#174; &#32;brand names. Wellmark is the only domestic producer of (S)-Methoprene, which is an active ingredient to control mosquitoes, fleas, ticks, ants and mites in many professional and consumer insect control applications. We also sell (S)-Methoprene to manufacturers of other insect control products, including Frontline Plus. In addition, through our Farnam operations, we are a leading manufacturer and marketer of innovative health care products for horses. Farnam&#8217;s portfolio of industry leading brands includes the Farnam umbrella brand, IverCare &#174; , Bronco &#174; , Super Mask &#174; &#32;II, Endure &#174; , Horseshoer&#8217;s Secret &#174; &#32;and Vetrolin &#174; . 

Sales Network 

Our domestic sales network exists to promote both our proprietary brands and third party partner brands. It provides value-added service to approximately 6,000 customers, the majority of which are independent specialty stores with fewer than 10 locations. This includes acquisition and maintenance of premium shelf placement, prompt product replenishment, customization of retailer programs, quick response to changing customer and retailer preferences, rapid deployment and feedback for new products and immediate exposure for acquired brands. The combination of brands in the network supplied in single shipments enables our independent customers to work with us on a cost effective basis to meet their pet supplies requirements. We also operate a sales and logistics facility in the United Kingdom. 

Sales and Marketing 

Our sales strategy is multi-tiered and designed to capture maximum market share with retailers. Our customers include retailers, such as club, regional and national specialty pet stores, independent pet retailers, mass merchants, grocery and drug stores, as well as the e-commerce channel. In addition, we also serve the professional market with insect control and health and wellness products for use by veterinarians, municipalities, farmers and equine product suppliers. Costco Wholesale accounted for approximately 10% &#32;of our Pet segment's net sales in fiscal 2016. PetSmart and PETCO are also significant customers. 

To optimize our product placement and visibility in retail stores, our focused sales resources are segmented as follows: 

&#8226; 

a sales organization operating by category and channel; 

&#8226; 

dedicated account teams servicing our largest customers; 

&#8226; 

a group of account managers focused on regional chains; 

&#8226; 

a geographic based group of territory managers dedicated to the independent retailer; and 

&#8226; 

a specialized group of account managers dedicated to the professional and equine markets. 

These sales teams deliver our marketing strategy that is consumer, brand and channel driven. We provide value creation with a focus on innovation, product quality and performance, premium packaging, product positioning and consumer value. We collaborate closely with our customers to identify their needs, jointly develop strategies to meet those needs and deliver programs that include print, broadcast, direct mail and digital execution. 

Competition 

The pet supplies industry is highly competitive and has experienced considerable consolidation coupled with the emergence of the e-commerce channel in recent years. Our branded pet products compete against national and regional branded products and private label products produced by various suppliers. Our largest competitors in most product categories are Spectrum Brands and Hartz Mountain. The Pet segment competes primarily on the basis of brand recognition, innovation, upscale packaging, quality and service. Our Pet segment&#8217;s sales and logistics operations compete with Animal Supply Co., Phillips Pet Food &#38; Supplies and a number of smaller local and regional distributors, with competition based on product selection, price, value-added services and personal relationships. 

Garden Segment 

Overview 

We are a leading company in the consumer lawn and garden market in the United States and offer both premium and value-oriented branded products. We market and produce a broad array of premium brands, including Pennington, The Rebels, AMDRO, Lilly Miller, Ironite, Sevin, and Over-N-Out. We also produce value brands at lower prices, including numerous private label brands. In addition, our Garden segment operates a sales and logistics network that strategically supports its brands. In fiscal 2016 , Garden segment net sales were $747.2 million &#32;and operating income was $70.3 million . 

Industry Background 

We believe that gardening is one of the most popular leisure activities in the United States. Although in the past, the Garden segment has been adversely impacted by fluctuations in input costs and weather, more recently the impact has been negligible. The Freedonia Group predicts that household participation in lawn and garden activities will rebound slightly through 2020. The key demographic bolstering our lawn and garden market is the growth rate in the number of adults over age 55 which is projected to increase from 88 million in 2015 to 99 million in 2020. This age group is more likely to be &#8220;empty nesters&#8221; and have more disposable income and leisure time available for garden activities. As the baby boom generation ages, this segment is expected to grow faster than the total population. According to 2012 U.S. interim census data, approximately 41% of the population is 45 years or older. We believe that this demographic should increase the number of lawn and garden product users. With more people gardening in their yards and the potential trends of food gardening and organic gardening, we perceive this market as staying intact and showing slow positive growth. We estimate the retail sales of the lawn and garden supplies industry in the categories in which we participate to be approximately $17.6 billion . &#32;We believe that the industry will continue to grow, albeit at a slow rate. 

Lawn and garden products are sold to consumers through a number of distribution channels, including home centers, mass merchants, independent nurseries and hardware stores. Home and garden centers and mass merchants typically carry multiple premium and value brands. Due to the rapid expansion and consolidation of mass merchants and home and garden centers, the concentration of purchasing power for the lawn and garden category has increased dramatically. We expect the growth of home and garden centers, such as Home Depot and Lowe&#8217;s, and mass merchants, such as Wal*Mart, to continue to concentrate industry distribution. 

Proprietary Branded Lawn and Garden Products 

Our principal lawn and garden product lines are grass seed, wild bird feed, insect control products, lawn and garden care products and decorative outdoor patio products. Our Pennington brand is one of the largest in grass seed, pottery and wild bird feed, and our Amdro brand is a leading portfolio of control products.

Sales Network 

Our sales and logistics network exists primarily to promote our proprietary brands and provides us with key access to retail stores for our branded products, acquisition and maintenance of premium shelf placement, prompt product replenishment, customization of retailer programs, quick responses to changing customer and retailer preferences, rapid deployment and feedback for new products, immediate exposure for acquired brands and comprehensive and strategic information. The network also sells other manufacturers&#8217; brands of lawn and garden supplies and combines these products with our branded products into single shipments enabling our customers to deal with us on a cost-effective basis to meet their lawn and garden supplies requirements . 

Sales and Marketing 

The marketing strategy for our premium products is focused on meeting consumer needs through product performance, innovation, quality, upscale packaging and retail shelf placement. The marketing strategy for our value products is focused on promotion of the quality and efficacy of our value brands at a lower cost relative to premium brands. Our customers include retailers, such as mass merchants, home improvement centers, independent lawn and garden nurseries, drug and grocery stores, and professional end users. Sales to Wal*Mart represented approximately 31% , 31% &#32;and 31% , sales to Lowe&#8217;s represented approximately 20% , 18% &#32;and 15% , and sales to Home Depot represented approximately 19% , 16% &#32;and 17% &#32;of our Garden segment&#8217;s net sales in fiscal 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. 

To maximize our product placement and visibility in retail stores, we market our products through the following four complementary strategies: 

&#8226; 

dedicated sales forces represent our combined brand groups; 

&#8226; 

retail sales and logistics network, which provides in-store training and merchandising for our customers, especially during the prime spring and summer seasons; 

&#8226; 

dedicated account-managers and sales teams located near and dedicated to serve several of our largest customers; and 

&#8226; 

selected independent distributors who sell our brands. 

Competition 

The lawn and garden products industry is highly competitive. Our lawn and garden products compete against national and regional products and private label products produced by various suppliers. Our turf and forage grass seed products, fertilizers, pesticides and combination products compete principally against products marketed by The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (&#8220;Scotts&#8221;). Scotts&#8217; dominant position in the lawn and garden industry is a significant competitive disadvantage for our garden products. In addition, Spectrum Brands is a strong competitor in yard and household insecticides. Our Garden segment competes primarily on the basis of its strong premium and value brands, quality, service, price and low cost manufacturing. Our Garden segment&#8217;s sales and logistics operations also compete with a large number of distributors, with competition based on price, service and personal relationships. 

Manufacturing 

We manufacture the majority of our branded products in 33 manufacturing facilities, located primarily in the United States. In addition, certain of our proprietary branded products are manufactured by contract manufacturers. We have also entered into an exclusive arrangement with a third party to manufacture one of our registered active ingredients, (S)&#8209;Methoprene, for use in that third party&#8217;s flea and tick control products. 

Purchasing 

We purchase most of our raw materials from a number of different suppliers. In addition, we purchase one of the raw materials used to manufacture (S)&#8209;Methoprene from a single source of supply. We maintain an inventory of this raw material (in addition to our (S)&#8209;Methoprene inventory) to reduce the possibility of any interruption in the availability of (S)&#8209;Methoprene, but a prolonged delay in obtaining (S)&#8209;Methoprene or this raw material could result in a temporary delay in product shipments and have an adverse effect on our Pet segment&#8217;s financial results. 

The key ingredients in our fertilizer and insect and weed control products are commodity and specialty chemicals, including urea, potash, phosphates, herbicides, insecticides and fungicides. 

The principal raw materials required for our wild bird feed operations are bulk commodity grains, including millet, milo and sunflower seeds, which are generally purchased from large national commodity companies and local grain cooperatives. In order to ensure an adequate supply of grains and seed to satisfy expected production volume, we enter into contracts to purchase a portion of our expected grain and seed requirements at future dates by fixing the quantity, and often the price, at the commitment date. Although we have never experienced a severe interruption of supply, we are exposed to price risk with respect to the portion of our supply which is not covered by contracts with a fixed price. 

In fiscal 2016, prices for some of our key inputs declined compared to fiscal 2015. Our fiscal 2016 and 2015 weighted average cost per pound for our primary bird feed grains decreased slightly. In fiscal 2014, prices decreased 32% compared to fiscal 2013. This followed a period where our commodity costs had increased for a number of years, including fiscal 2012 and 2013, when prices increased substantially. The recent decreases in commodity costs generally are reflected in lower prices to our retailers. 

Logistics Network 

Our distribution network consists of 29 facilities strategically placed across the United States, one facility in the United Kingdom and one facility in China to allow us to service both our mass market customers as well as our independent specialty retail stores for our branded products. This network also supports distribution of many other manufacturers&#8217; brands and combines these products with our branded products into single shipments, enabling us to serve our customers in an effective and cost efficient manner. 

Significant Customers 

Wal*Mart, our largest customer, represented approximately 15% , 16% &#32;and 17% &#32;of our total company net sales in fiscal 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. In addition, Lowe's, Home Depot, Costco, PetSmart and PETCO are also significant customers, and together with Wal*Mart, accounted for approximately 42% &#32;of our net sales in fiscal 2016 , 40% &#32;in fiscal 2015 &#32;and 41% &#32;in fiscal 2014 . 

Patents and Other Proprietary Rights 

Our branded products companies hold numerous patents in the United States and in other countries and have several patent applications pending. We consider the development of patents through creative research and the maintenance of an 

active patent program to be advantageous to our business, but we do not regard the holding of any particular patent as essential to our operations. 

In addition to patents, we have numerous active ingredient registrations, end-use product registrations and trade secrets, including certain technology used in the Wellmark operations for the production of (S)-Methoprene, which has been licensed from Novartis. This license is perpetual but non-exclusive. In addition, we have developed certain proprietary improvements relating to the synthesis of (S)-Methoprene. The success of certain portions of our business, especially our animal health operations, partly depends on our ability to continue to maintain trade secret information which has been licensed to us, and to keep both licensed and owned trade secret information confidential. 

Along with patents, active ingredient registrations, end use product registrations and trade secrets, we own a number of trademarks, service marks, trade names and logotypes. Many of our trademarks are registered but some are not. We are not aware of any reason we cannot continue to use our trademarks, service marks and trade names in the way that we have been using them. 

Employees 

As of September 24, 2016 , we had approximately 3,600 employees, of which approximately 3,400 were full-time employees and 200 were temporary or part-time employees. We also hire substantial numbers of additional temporary employees for the peak lawn and garden shipping season of February through June to meet the increased demand experienced during the spring and summer months. The majority of our temporary employees are paid on an hourly basis. Except for 41 employees at a facility in Puebla, Mexico, none of our employees is represented by a labor union. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good. 

Environmental and Regulatory Considerations 

Many of the products that we manufacture or distribute are subject to local, state, federal and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental matters. Such regulations are often complex and are subject to change. In the United States, all pesticides must be registered with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the &#8220;EPA&#8221;), in addition to individual state and/or foreign agency registrations, before they can be sold. Fertilizer products are also subject to state Department of Agriculture registration and foreign labeling regulations. Grass seed is also subject to state, federal and foreign labeling regulations. 

The Food Quality Protection Act ("FQPA"), establishes a standard for food-use pesticides, which is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from the cumulative effect of pesticide exposures. Under this Act, the EPA is evaluating the cumulative risks from dietary and non-dietary exposures to pesticides. The pesticides in our products, which are also used on foods, will be evaluated by the EPA as part of this non-dietary exposure risk assessment. 

In addition, the use of certain pesticide and fertilizer products is regulated by various local, state, federal and foreign environmental and public health agencies. These regulations may include requirements that only certified or professional users apply the product or that certain products be used only on certain types of locations (such as &#8220;not for use on sod farms or golf courses&#8221;), may require users to post notices on properties to which products have been or will be applied, may require notification of individuals in the vicinity that products will be applied in the future or may ban the use of certain ingredients. We believe we are operating in substantial compliance with, or taking action aimed at ensuring compliance with, these laws and regulations. 

Various federal, state and local laws, including the federal Food Safety Modernization Act (&#8220;FSMA&#8221;), also regulate pet food products and give regulatory authorities the power to recall or require re-labeling of products. Several new FSMA regulations became effective this past year and additional requirements will become effective in 2017. We believe we are in substantial compliance with all currently effective requirements and are taking steps to ensure that we are in compliance with all regulatory requirements going forward. 

Various local, state, federal and foreign environmental laws also impose obligations on various entities to clean up contaminated properties or to pay for the cost of such remediation, often upon parties that did not actually cause the contamination. Accordingly, we may become liable, either contractually or by operation of law, for remediation costs even if the contaminated property is not presently owned or operated by us, or if the contamination was caused by third parties during or prior to our ownership or operation of the property. With our extensive acquisition history, we have acquired a number of manufacturing and distribution facilities, and most of these facilities have not been subjected to Phase II environmental tests to determine whether they are contaminated. 

Environmental regulations may affect us by restricting the manufacturing or use of our products or regulating their disposal. Regulatory or legislative changes may cause future increases in our operating costs or otherwise affect operations. Although we believe we are and have been in substantial compliance with such regulations and have strict internal guidelines on the handling and disposal of our products, there is no assurance that in the future we may not be adversely affected by such regulations or incur increased operating costs in complying with such regulations. However, neither the compliance with regulatory requirements nor our environmental procedures can ensure that we will not be subject to claims for personal injury, property damages or governmental enforcement.
