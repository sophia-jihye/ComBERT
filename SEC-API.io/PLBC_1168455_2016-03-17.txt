 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

The Company . Plumas Bancorp (the &#8220;Company&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221;) is a California corporation registered as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and is headquartered in Quincy, California. The Company was incorporated in January 2002 and acquired all of the outstanding shares of Plumas Bank (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;) in June 2002. The Company&#8217;s principal subsidiary is the Bank, and the Company exists primarily for the purpose of holding the stock of the Bank and of such other subsidiaries it may acquire or establish. At the present time, the Company&#8217;s only other subsidiaries are Plumas Statutory Trust I and Plumas Statutory Trust II, which were formed in 2002 and 2005 solely to facilitate the issuance of trust preferred securities. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s principal source of income is dividends from the Bank, but the Company may explore supplemental sources of income in the future. The cash outlays of the Company, including (but not limited to) the payment of dividends to shareholders, if and when declared by the Board of Directors, costs of repurchasing Company common stock, the cost of servicing debt and preferred stock dividends, will generally be paid from dividends paid to the Company by the Bank. 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, the Company had consolidated assets of $599.3 million, deposits of $527.3 million, other liabilities of $29.5 million and shareholders&#8217; equity of $42.5 million. The Company&#8217;s other liabilities include $10.3 million in junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures and a $4.9 million note payable. These items are described in detail later in this section. 

&#160; 

References herein to the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; refer to Plumas Bancorp and its consolidated subsidiary, unless the context indicates otherwise. Our operations are conducted at 35 South Lindan Avenue, Quincy, California. Our annual, quarterly and other reports, required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) are posted and are available at no cost on the Company&#8217;s website, www.plumasbank.com , as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company files such documents with the SEC. These reports are also available through the SEC&#8217;s website at www.sec.gov . 

&#160; 

The Bank. The Bank is a California state-chartered bank that was incorporated in July 1980 and opened for business in December 1980. The Bank is not a member of the Federal Reserve System. The Bank&#8217;s Administrative Office is located at 35 South Lindan Avenue, Quincy, California. At December 31, 2015 the Bank had approximately $599 million in assets, $397 million in net loans and $528 million in deposits (including deposits of $0.8 million from the Bancorp). It is currently the largest independent bank headquartered in Plumas County. The Bank&#8217;s deposit accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the &#8220;FDIC&#8221;) up to maximum insurable amounts. 

&#160; 

The Bank&#8217;s primary service area covers the Northeastern portion of California, with Lake Tahoe to the South and the Oregon border to the North. The Bank, through its twelve branch network, serves Washoe county Nevada and the seven contiguous California counties of Plumas, Nevada, Sierra, Placer, Lassen, Modoc and Shasta. The branches are located in the California communities of Quincy, Portola, Greenville, Truckee, Fall River Mills, Alturas, Susanville, Chester, Tahoe City, Kings Beach and Redding; in addition, during December, 2015 the Bank opened a branch in Reno, Nevada. The Bank maintains sixteen automated teller machines (&#8220;ATMs&#8221;) tied in with major statewide and national networks. In addition to its branch network, the Bank operates lending offices specializing in government-guaranteed lending in Auburn, California and Scottsdale, Arizona and a commercial/agricultural lending office located in Chico, California. The Bank&#8217;s primary business is servicing the banking needs of these communities. Its marketing strategy stresses its local ownership and commitment to serve the banking needs of individuals living and working in the Bank&#8217;s primary service areas. 

&#160; 

With a predominant focus on personal service, the Bank has positioned itself as a multi-community independent bank serving the financial needs of individuals and businesses within the Bank&#8217;s geographic footprint. Our principal retail lending services include consumer, automobile and home equity loans. Our principal commercial lending services include term real estate, commercial and industrial term loans. In addition, we provide government-guaranteed and agricultural loans as well as credit lines. We provide land development and construction loans on a limited basis. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The Bank&#8217;s Government-guaranteed lending center, headquartered in Auburn, California with additional personnel in Truckee, California and Scottsdale, Arizona provides Small Business Administration (SBA) and USDA Rural Development loans to qualified borrowers throughout Northern California, Arizona, Oregon and Northern Nevada. During 2007 the Bank was granted nationwide Preferred Lender status with the U.S. Small Business Administration and we expect government-guaranteed lending to continue to be an important part of our overall lending operation. During 2015 proceeds from the sale of government-guaranteed loans totaled $29.4 million and we generated a gain on sale of $1.9 million. In 2014 proceeds from the sale of government guaranteed loans totaled $21.6 million and we generated a gain on sale of $1.4 million. 

&#160; 

The Agricultural Credit Centers located in Susanville, Chico and Alturas provide a complete line of credit services in support of the agricultural activities which are key to the continued economic development of the communities we serve. &#8220;Ag lending&#8221; clients include a full range of individual farming customers, small to medium-sized business farming organizations and corporate farming units. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, the principal areas to which we directed our lending activities, and the percentage of our total loan portfolio comprised by each, were as follows: (i) commercial real estate &#8211; 47.9%; (ii) commercial and industrial loans &#8211; 9.2%; (iii) consumer loans (including residential equity lines of credit and automobile loans) &#8211; 22.6%; (iv) agricultural loans (including agricultural real estate loans) &#8211; 9.9%; (v) residential real estate &#8211; 6.4%; and (vi) construction and land development &#8211; 4.0% . 

&#160; 

In addition to the lending activities noted above, we offer a wide range of deposit products for the retail and commercial banking markets including checking, interest-bearing checking, business sweep, public funds sweep, savings, time deposit and retirement accounts, as well as remote deposit, telephone and mobile banking, including mobile deposit, and internet banking with bill-pay options. Interest bearing deposits include high yield sweep accounts designed for our commercial customers and for public entities such as municipalities. In addition we offer a premium interest bearing checking account for our consumer customers. As of December 31, 2015, the Bank had 29,518 deposit accounts with balances totaling approximately $528 million, compared to 28,821 deposit accounts with balances totaling approximately $469 million at December 31, 2014. We attract deposits through our customer-oriented product mix, competitive pricing, convenient locations, mobile and internet banking, remote deposit operations and drive-up banking, all provided with a high level of customer service. 

&#160; 

Most of our deposits are attracted from individuals, business-related sources and smaller municipal entities. This mix of deposit customers resulted in a relatively modest average deposit balance of approximately $17.9 thousand at December 31, 2015. However, it makes us less vulnerable to adverse effects from the loss of depositors who may be seeking higher yields in other markets or who may otherwise draw down balances for cash needs. 

&#160; 

We also offer a variety of other products and services to complement the lending and deposit services previously reviewed. These include cashier&#8217;s checks, bank-by-mail, ATMs, night depository, safe deposit boxes, direct deposit, electronic funds transfers and other customary banking services. 

&#160; 

Through our offering of a Remote Deposit product our business customers are able to make non-cash deposits remotely from their physical location. With this product, we have extended our service area and can now meet the deposit needs of customers who may not be located within a convenient distance of one of our branch offices. 

&#160; 

Additionally, the Bank has devoted a substantial amount of time and capital to the improvement of existing Bank services, during 2009 we replaced our on-line banking service with a new state of the art product that greatly expands the features available to our customers. In addition we utilized this platform to add mobile banking services during the first quarter of 2010. During 2015 we enhanced our mobile banking services and began offering mobile deposit services. During 2010 Plumas Bank began offering a new Green Account which promotes protecting the environment, reducing clutter and making life simpler for the customer through technological advancements such as eStatements, online banking, and debit card usage. In 2011, we introduced a new product for our larger business customers which use repurchase agreements as an alternative to interest-bearing deposits. The balance in this product at December 31, 2015 was $7.7 million. Interest paid on this product is similar to that which can be earned on the Bank&#8217;s premium money market account; however, these are not deposits and are not FDIC insured. During the first quarter of 2012 we replaced our ATMs with new state of the art machines that are capable of accepting check and cash deposits without a deposit envelope. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The officers and employees of the Bank are continually engaged in marketing activities, including the evaluation and development of new products and services, to enable the Bank to retain and improve its competitive position in its service area. 

&#160; 

We hold no patents or licenses (other than licenses required by appropriate bank regulatory agencies or local governments), franchises, or concessions. Our business has a modest seasonal component due to the heavy agricultural and tourism orientation of some of the communities we serve. As our branches in less rural areas such as Truckee and Redding have expanded and with the opening of our Auburn SBA lending office and growth in our indirect automobile lending, the agriculture-related base has become less significant. We are not dependent on a single customer or group of related customers for a material portion of our deposits, nor are a material portion of our loans concentrated within a single industry or group of related industries. There has been no material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position as a result of federal, state, or local environmental regulation. 

&#160; 

Commitment to our Communities. The Board of Directors and Management believe that the Company plays an important role in the economic well being of the communities it serves. Our Bank has a continuing responsibility to provide a wide range of lending and deposit services to both individuals and businesses. These services are tailored to meet the needs of the communities served by the Company and the Bank. 

&#160; 

We offer various loan products which encourage job growth and support community economic development. Types of loans offered range from personal and commercial loans to real estate, construction, agricultural, automobile and Government-guaranteed loans. Many banking decisions are made locally with the goal of maintaining customer satisfaction through the timely delivery of high quality products and services. 

&#160; 

Recent Developments. On July 31, 2015 the Bank completed its acquisition of the Redding, California, branch of Rabobank N.A. The transaction included the acquisition of approximately $10 million in deposits. The branch, located at 1335 Hilltop Dr. in Redding, now operates as a branch of the Bank. The Bank has consolidated its Civic Center Drive branch into this new location. The Civic Center Drive facility was sold to an unrelated third party in December, 2015. In December, 2015 the Bank opened a new full service Branch located at 5050 Meadowood Mall Circle, Reno, Nevada. This is the Bank&#8217;s first branch location outside of California. Also in December, 2015 the Bank opened a SBA lending office in Scottsdale, Arizona. 

&#160; 

Capital Purchase Program - TARP - Preferred Stock and Stock Warrant. On January 30, 2009 the Company entered into a Letter Agreement (the &#8220;Purchase Agreement&#8221;) with the United States Department of the Treasury (&#8220;Treasury&#8221;), pursuant to which the Company issued and sold (i) 11,949 shares of the Company&#8217;s Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A (the &#8220;Series A Preferred Stock&#8221;) and (ii) a warrant (the &#8220;Warrant&#8221;) to purchase 237,712 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock, no par value (the &#8220;Common Stock&#8221;), for an aggregate purchase price of $11,949,000 in cash. 

&#160; 

On April 11, 2013, the Treasury announced its intent to sell its investment in the Bancorp&#8217;s Series A Preferred Stock along with similar investments the Treasury had made in seven other financial institutions, principally to qualified institutional buyers. Using a modified Dutch auction methodology that establishes a market price by allowing investors to submit bids at specified increments during the period of April 15, 2013 through April 18, 2013, the U.S. Treasury auctioned all of the Company&#8217;s 11,949 Series A Preferred Stock. The Company sought and obtained regulatory permission to participate in the auction. The Company successfully bid to repurchase 7,000 shares of the 11,949 outstanding shares. This repurchase resulted in a discount of approximately 7% on the face value of the Series A Preferred Stock plus related outstanding dividends. The remaining 4,949 shares were purchased at auction by third party private investors. On June 27, 2013 the Company repurchased 1,566 shares of the Series A Preferred Stock at $1,000 per share from certain of those third party private investors and on September 16, 2013 the Company repurchased 250 shares at $985 per share from another one of the third party investors leaving 3,133 shares outstanding as of September 30, 2013. On October 25, 2013, the Company repurchased the remaining 3,133 shares of the Series A Preferred Stock from a third party private investor for $3,101,670 plus accrued dividends of $30,453. This represents a discount of 1% from the liquidation value of the Preferred Stock. On May 22, 2013 the Company repurchased the Warrant from the Treasury at a cost of $234,500. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Trust Preferred Securities. During the third quarter of 2002, the Company formed a wholly owned Connecticut statutory business trust, Plumas Statutory Trust I (the &#8220;Trust I&#8221;). On September 26, 2002, the Company issued to the Trust I, Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures due 2032 (the &#8220;Debentures&#8221;) in the aggregate principal amount of $6,186,000. In exchange for these debentures the Trust I paid the Company $6,186,000. The Trust I funded its purchase of debentures by issuing $6,000,000 in floating rate capital securities (&#8220;trust preferred securities&#8221;), which were sold to a third party. These trust preferred securities qualify as Tier I capital under current Federal Reserve Board guidelines. The Debentures are the only asset of the Trust I. The interest rate and terms on both instruments are substantially the same. The rate is based on the three-month LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) plus 3.40%, not to exceed 11.9%, adjustable quarterly. The proceeds from the sale of the Debentures were primarily used by the Company to inject capital into the Bank. 

&#160; 

During the third quarter of 2005, the Company formed a wholly owned Delaware statutory business trust, Plumas Statutory Trust II (the &#8220;Trust II&#8221;). On September 28, 2005, the Company issued to the Trust II, Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures due 2035 (the &#8220;Debentures&#8221;) in the aggregate principal amount of $4,124,000. In exchange for these debentures the Trust II paid the Company $4,124,000. The Trust II funded its purchase of debentures by issuing $4,000,000 in floating rate capital securities (&#8220;trust preferred securities&#8221;), which were sold to a third party. These trust preferred securities qualify as Tier I capital under current Federal Reserve Board guidelines. The Debentures are the only asset of the Trust II. The interest rate and terms on both instruments are substantially the same. The rate is based on the three-month LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) plus 1.48%, adjustable quarterly. The proceeds from the sale of the Debentures were primarily used by the Company to inject capital into the Bank. 

&#160; 

The trust preferred securities are mandatorily redeemable upon maturity of the Debentures on September 26, 2032 for Trust I and September 28, 2035 for Trust II, or upon earlier redemption as provided in the indenture. 

&#160; 

Neither Trust I nor Trust II are consolidated into the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements and, accordingly, both entities are accounted for under the equity method and the junior subordinated debentures are reflected as debt on the consolidated balance sheet. 

&#160; 

Subordinated Debenture. On April 15, 2013 the Bancorp issued a $7.5 million subordinated debenture. The subordinated debt was issued to an unrelated third-party (&#8220;Lender&#8221;) pursuant to a subordinated debenture purchase agreement, subordinated debenture note, and stock purchase warrant. On April 16, 2015 the Company paid off the subordinated debt. 

&#160; 

The subordinated debt had an interest rate of 7.5% per annum and a term of 8 years with no prepayment allowed during the first two years and was made in conjunction with an eight-year warrant to purchase up to 300,000 shares of the Bancorp&#8217;s common stock at an exercise price, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, of $5.25 per share. Interest expense related to the subordinated debt for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 totaled $219,000, $756,000 and $541,000, respectively. 

&#160; 

Promissory Note. The Company has a $4.9 million note payable outstanding at December 31, 2015 with an unrelated commercial bank. In addition, the Company has the ability to borrow an additional $2.5 million from this same bank under a line of credit agreement. There were no outstanding borrowings on the line of credit at December 31, 2015. See &#8220;ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS &#8211; Financial Condition &#8211; Note Payable&#8221; for detail information related to these borrowing agreements. 

&#160; 

Business Concentrations. No individual or single group of related customer accounts is considered material in relation to the Bank&#39;s assets or deposits, or in relation to our overall business. However, at December 31, 2015 approximately 73% of the Bank&#39;s total loan portfolio consisted of real estate-secured loans, including real estate mortgage loans, real estate construction loans, consumer equity lines of credit, and agricultural loans secured by real estate. Moreover, our business activities are currently focused in the California counties of Plumas, Nevada, Placer, Lassen, Modoc, Shasta and Sierra and Washoe County in Nevada. Consequently, our results of operations and financial condition are dependent upon the general trends in these economies and, in particular, the residential and commercial real estate markets. In addition, the concentration of our operations in these areas of California and Nevada exposes us to greater risk than other banking companies with a wider geographic base in the event of catastrophes, such as earthquakes, fires and floods in these regions in California and Nevada. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Competition . With respect to commercial bank competitors, the business is largely dominated by a relatively small number of major banks with many offices operating over a wide geographical area. These banks have, among other advantages, the ability to finance wide-ranging and effective advertising campaigns and to allocate their resources to regions of highest yield and demand. Many of the major banks operating in the area offer certain services that we do not offer directly but may offer indirectly through correspondent institutions. By virtue of their greater total capitalization, such banks also have substantially higher lending limits than we do. For customers whose loan demands exceed our legal lending limit, we attempt to arrange for such loans on a participation basis with correspondent or other banks. 

&#160; 

In addition to other banks, our competitors include savings institutions, credit unions, and numerous non-banking institutions such as finance companies, leasing companies, insurance companies, brokerage firms, and investment banking firms. In recent years, increased competition has also developed from specialized finance and non-finance companies that offer wholesale finance, credit card, and other consumer finance services, including on-line banking services and personal financial software. Strong competition for deposit and loan products affects the rates of those products as well as the terms on which they are offered to customers. Mergers between financial institutions have placed additional competitive pressure on banks within the industry to streamline their operations, reduce expenses, and increase revenues. Competition has also intensified due to federal and state interstate banking laws enacted in the mid-1990&#8217;s, which permit banking organizations to expand into other states. The relatively large California market has been particularly attractive to out-of-state institutions. The Financial Modernization Act, which became effective March 11, 2000, has made it possible for full affiliations to occur between banks and securities firms, insurance companies, and other financial companies, and has also intensified competitive conditions. 

&#160; 

Currently, within the California towns in which the Bank has a branch there are 51 banking branch offices of competing institutions (excluding credit unions, but including savings banks), including 28 branches of 8 major banks. As of June 30, 2015, the FDIC estimated the Bank&#8217;s market share of insured deposits within the communities it serves to be as follows: Chester 65%, Quincy 55%, Alturas 65%, Fall River Mills 38%, Kings Beach 35%, Susanville 27%,Truckee 18%, Tahoe City 10%, Redding less than 1% and 100% in Greenville and Portola. 

&#160; 

Technological innovations have also resulted in increased competition in financial services markets. Such innovation has, for example, made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer customers automated transfer payment services that previously were considered traditional banking products. In addition, many customers now expect a choice of delivery systems and channels, including home computer, mobile, remote deposit, telephone, ATMs, mail, full-service branches and/or in-store branches. The sources of competition in such products include traditional banks as well as savings associations, credit unions, brokerage firms, money market and other mutual funds, asset management groups, finance and insurance companies, internet-only financial intermediaries, and mortgage banking firms. 

&#160; 

For many years we have countered rising competition by providing our own style of community-oriented, personalized service. We rely on local promotional activity, personal contacts by our officers, directors, employees, and shareholders, automated 24-hour banking, and the individualized service that we can provide through our flexible policies. This approach appears to be well-received by our customers who appreciate a more personal and customer-oriented environment in which to conduct their financial transactions. To meet the needs of customers who prefer to bank electronically, we offer telephone banking, mobile banking, remote deposit, and personal computer and internet banking with bill payment capabilities. This high tech and high touch approach allows the customers to tailor their access to our services based on their particular preference. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Employees. At December 31, 2015, the Company and its subsidiary employed 151 persons. On a full-time equivalent basis, we employed 134 persons. None of the Company&#8217;s employees are represented by a labor union, and management considers its relations with employees to be good. 

&#160; 

Code of Ethics. The Board of Directors has adopted a code of business conduct and ethics for directors, officers (including the Company&#8217;s principal executive officer and principal financial officer) and financial personnel, known as the Corporate Governance Code of Ethics. This Code of Ethics is available on the Company&#8217;s website at www.plumasbank.com. Shareholders may request a free copy of the Code of Ethics Policy from Plumas Bancorp, Ms. Elizabeth Kuipers, Investor Relations, 35 S. Lindan Avenue, Quincy, California 95971. 

&#160; 

Supervision and Regulation 

&#160; 

General. We are extensively regulated under federal and state law. These laws and regulations are generally intended to protect depositors and customers, not shareholders. To the extent that the following information describes statutory or regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statute or regulation. Any change in applicable laws or regulations may have a material effect on our business and prospects. Our operations may be affected by legislative changes and by the policies of various regulatory authorities. We cannot accurately predict the nature or the extent of the effects on our business and earnings that fiscal or monetary policies, or new federal or state legislation may have in the future. 

&#160; 

Holding Company Regulation. We are a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and are subject to the supervision of, and regulation by, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;FRB&#8221;). We are required to file reports with the FRB and the FRB periodically examines the Company. A bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary bank and, under appropriate circumstances, to commit resources to support the subsidiary bank. FRB regulations require the Company to meet or exceed certain capital requirements and regulate provisions of certain bank holding company debt. The Company is also a bank holding company within the meaning of Section 3700 of the California Financial Code. Therefore, the Company and any of its subsidiaries are subject to supervision and examination by, and may be required to file reports with, the California Department of Business Oversight (&#8220;DBO&#8221;). 

&#160; 

Federal and State Bank Regulation. As a California-chartered commercial bank with deposits insured by the FDIC, the Bank is subject to the supervision and regulation of the DBO and the FDIC, as well as certain of the regulations of the FRB and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;). The DBO and the FDIC regularly examine the Bank and may prohibit the Bank from engaging in what they believe constitute unsafe or unsound banking practices. 

&#160; 

Securities Regulation. The Company is subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, both as administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission. As a listed company on NASDAQ, we are subject to NASDAQ rules for listed companies. 

&#160; 

Capital Adequacy. The FDIC has risk-based capital adequacy guidelines intended to provide a measure of capital adequacy that reflects the degree of risk associated with a banking organization&#8217;s operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets, and transactions, such as letters of credit and recourse arrangements, which are reported as off-balance-sheet items. Under these guidelines, nominal dollar amounts of assets and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance-sheet items are multiplied by one of several risk adjustment percentages, which range from 0% for assets with low credit risk, such as certain U.S. government securities, to 100% for assets with relatively higher credit risk, such as business loans. 

&#160; 

A banking organization&#8217;s risk-based capital ratios are obtained by dividing its qualifying capital by its total risk-adjusted assets and off-balance-sheet items. The regulators measure risk-adjusted assets and off-balance-sheet items against both total qualifying capital (the sum of Tier 1 capital and limited amounts of Tier 2 capital) and Tier 1 capital. Tier 1 capital consists of common stock, retained earnings, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in certain subsidiaries, less most other intangible assets. Tier 2 capital may consist of a limited amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses and certain other instruments with some characteristics of equity. The inclusion of elements of Tier 2 capital is subject to certain other requirements and limitations of the federal banking agencies. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

In addition to the risk-based guidelines, the FRB requires banking organizations to maintain a minimum amount of Tier 1 capital to average total assets, referred to as the leverage ratio. For a banking organization rated in the highest of the five categories used by regulators to rate banking organizations, the minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets is 3%. It is improbable; however, that an institution with a 3% leverage ratio would receive the highest rating by the regulators since a strong capital position is a significant part of the regulators&#8217; ratings. For all banking organizations not rated in the highest category, the minimum leverage ratio is at least 100 to 200 basis points above the 3% minimum. Thus, the effective minimum leverage ratio, for all practical purposes, is at least 4% or 5%. In addition to these uniform risk-based capital guidelines and leverage ratios that apply across the industry, the FRB and FDIC have the discretion to set individual minimum capital requirements for specific institutions at rates significantly above the minimum guidelines and ratios. 

&#160; 

A bank that does not achieve and maintain the required capital levels may be issued a capital directive by the FDIC and/or the DBO to ensure the maintenance of required capital levels. 

&#160; 

In July, 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies approved the final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision&#8217;s capital guidelines for U.S. banks. The phase-in period for the final rules began on January 1, 2015, with full compliance with all of the final rule&#8217;s requirements phased in over a multi-year schedule. Under the final rules, minimum requirements increased for both the quantity and quality of capital held by the Company and the Bank. The rules include a new common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 4.5% and a common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. The final rules also raise the minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4.0% to 6.0% and require a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%. The final rules also implement strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments. 

&#160; 

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has adopted final amendments to the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement (Regulation Y, Appendix C) ( the &#8220;Policy Statement&#8221;) that, among other things, raised from $500 million to $1 billion the asset threshold to qualify for the Policy Statement. The Company qualifies for treatment under the Policy Statement and is no longer subject to consolidated capital rules at the bank holding company level.

&#160; 

Dividends. The Company&#39;s ability to pay cash dividends is dependent on dividends paid to it by the Bank and limited by California corporation law. Under California law, the holders of common stock of the Company are entitled to receive dividends when and as declared by the Board of Directors, out of funds legally available, subject to certain restrictions. The California general corporation law permits a California corporation such as the Company to make a distribution to its shareholders if its retained earnings equal at least the amount of the proposed distribution or if after giving effect to the distribution, the value of the corporation&#8217;s assets exceed the amount of its liabilities plus the amount of shareholders preferences, if any, and certain other conditions are met. 

&#160; 

It is the Federal Reserve&#8217;s policy that bank holding companies should generally pay dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year, and only if prospective earnings support the organization&#8217;s expected future needs and financial condition. Further, it is the FRB&#8217;s policy that bank holding companies should not maintain dividend levels that undermine their ability to be a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries. The Federal Reserve also discourages dividend payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels unless both asset quality and capital are very strong. 

&#160; 

The Bank is a legal entity that is separate and distinct from its holding company. The Company is dependent on the performance of the Bank for funds which may be received as dividends from the Bank for use in the operation of the Company and the ability of the Company to pay dividends to shareholders. Future cash dividends by the Bank will also depend upon management&#8217;s assessment of future capital requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Dividends from the Bank to the Company are restricted under California law to the lesser of the Bank&#39;s retained earnings or the Bank&#39;s net income for the latest three fiscal years, less dividends previously declared during that period, or, with the approval of the DBO, to the greater of the retained earnings of the Bank, the net income of the Bank for its last fiscal year, or the net income of the Bank for its current fiscal year. As of December 31, 2015, the maximum amount available for dividend distribution under this restriction was approximately $5,100,000. In addition the Company&#8217;s ability to pay dividends is subject to certain covenants contained in the indentures relating to the trust preferred securities issued by the Company&#8217;s business trust subsidiaries. 

&#160; 

The Community Reinvestment Act. The Community Reinvestment Act (&#8220;CRA&#8221;) requires that, in connection with examinations of financial institutions within its jurisdiction, the FDIC evaluate the record of the financial institutions in meeting the credit needs of their local communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of those institutions. These factors are also considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions and applications to open a branch or new facility. A less than &#8220;Satisfactory&#8221; rating would likely result in the suspension of any growth of the Bank through acquisitions or opening de novo branches until the rating is improved. As of the most recent report of examination the Bank&#8217;s CRA rating was &#8220;Satisfactory.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Transactions with Affiliates. Banks are also subject to certain restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Act on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, principal shareholders (including the Company) or any related interest of such persons. Extensions of credit must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not affiliated with the bank, and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. Banks are also subject to certain lending limits and restrictions on overdrafts to such persons. A violation of these restrictions may result in the assessment of substantial civil monetary penalties on the affected bank or any officer, director, employee, agent or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of that bank, the imposition of a cease and desist order, and other regulatory sanctions. 

&#160; 

The Federal Reserve Act and the FRB&#8217;s Regulation W limit the amount of certain loan and investment transactions between the Bank and its affiliates, require certain levels of collateral for such loans, and limit the amount of advances to third parties that may be collateralized by the securities of the Company or its subsidiaries. Regulation W requires that certain transactions between the Bank and its affiliates be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the Bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving nonaffiliated companies or, in the absence of comparable transactions, on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that in good faith would be offered to or would apply to nonaffiliated companies. The Company and its subsidiaries have adopted an Affiliate Transactions Policy and have entered into various affiliate agreements in compliance with Regulation W. 

&#160; 

Safety and Soundness Standards . The FRB and the FDIC have adopted non-capital safety and soundness standards for institutions. These standards cover internal controls, information and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, and standards for asset quality, earnings and stock valuation. An institution that fails to meet these standards must develop a plan acceptable to the agency, specifying the steps that it will take to meet the standards. Failure to submit or implement such a plan may subject the institution to regulatory sanctions. 

&#160; 

Federal Deposit Insurance . In addition to supervising and regulating state chartered non-member banks, the FDIC insures the Bank&#8217;s deposits, up to prescribed statutory limits, through the Deposit Insurance Fund (the &#8220;DIF&#8221;), currently $250,000 per depositor per institution. The DIF is funded primarily by FDIC assessments paid by each DIF member institution. The amount of FDIC assessments paid by each DIF member institution is based on its relative risk of default as measured by regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory factors. The Bank&#8217;s FDIC insurance expense totaled $333 thousand for 2015. 

&#160; 

Additionally, all FDIC-insured institutions are required to pay assessments to the FDIC to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation (&#8220;FICO&#8221;), an agency of the Federal government established to recapitalize the predecessor to the DIF. The Bank&#8217;s FICO assessments totaled $29 thousand for 2015. These assessments will continue until the FICO bonds mature in 2017. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The FDIC may terminate a depository institution&#8217;s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution&#8217;s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices that pose a risk to the DIF or that may prejudice the interest of the bank&#8217;s depositors. Under California law, the termination of deposit insurance for the Bank would result in a termination of the Bank&#8217;s charter. 

&#160; 

Interstate Branching. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;), authorized national and state banks to establish branches in other states to the same extent as a bank chartered by that state would be permitted to branch. Previously, banks could only establish branches in other states if the host state expressly permitted out-of-state banks to establish branches in that state. Accordingly, banks may now enter new markets more freely. 

&#160; 

Consumer Protection Laws and Regulations. The banking regulatory agencies are focusing greater attention on compliance with consumer protection laws and their implementing regulations. Examination and enforcement have become more intense in nature, and insured institutions have been advised to monitor carefully compliance with such laws and regulations. The Company is subject to many federal and state consumer protection and privacy statutes and regulations, including but not limited to the following: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (&#8220;ECOA&#8221;) generally prohibits discrimination in any credit transaction, whether for consumer or business purposes, on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age (except in limited circumstances), receipt of income from public assistance programs, or good faith exercise of any rights under the Consumer Credit Protection Act. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

The Truth in Lending Act (&#8220;TILA&#8221;) is designed to ensure that credit terms are disclosed in a meaningful way so that consumers may compare credit terms more readily and knowledgeably. As a result of the TILA, all creditors must use the same credit terminology to express rates and payments, including the annual percentage rate, the finance charge, the amount financed, the total of payments and the payment schedule, among other things. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, Regulation Z promulgated under the TILA includes new limits on loan originator compensation for all closed-end mortgages. These changes include, prohibiting certain payments to a mortgage broker or loan officer based on the transaction&#8217;s terms or conditions, prohibiting dual compensation, and prohibiting a mortgage broker or loan officer from &#8216;&#8216;steering&#8217;&#8217; consumers to transactions not in their interest, to increase mortgage broker or loan officer compensation. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

The Fair Housing Act (&#8220;FH Act&#8221;) regulates many practices, including making it unlawful for any lender to discriminate in its housing-related lending activities against any person because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, handicap or familial status. A number of lending practices have been found by the courts to be, or may be considered, illegal under the FH Act, including some that are not specifically mentioned in the FH Act itself. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (&#8220;HMDA&#8221;), in response to public concern over credit shortages in certain urban neighborhoods, requires public disclosure of information that shows whether financial institutions are serving the housing credit needs of the neighborhoods and communities in which they are located. The HMDA also includes a &#8220;fair lending&#8221; aspect that requires the collection and disclosure of data about applicant and borrower characteristics as a way of identifying possible discriminatory lending patterns and enforcing anti-discrimination statutes. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

The Right to Financial Privacy Act (&#8220;RFPA&#8221;) imposes a new requirement for financial institutions to provide new privacy protections to consumers. Financial institutions must provide disclosures to consumers of its privacy policy, and state the rights of consumers to direct their financial institution not to share their nonpublic personal information with third parties. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (&#8220;RESPA&#8221;) requires lenders to provide noncommercial borrowers with disclosures regarding the nature and cost of real estate settlements. Also, RESPA prohibits certain abusive practices, such as kickbacks, and places limitations on the amount of escrow accounts. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Penalties for noncompliance or violations under the above laws may include fines, reimbursement and other penalties. Due to heightened regulatory expectations related to compliance with generally, the Company may incur additional compliance costs. 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act created a new, independent federal agency called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is granted broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws. The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets. Smaller institutions, including the Bank, will be subject to rules promulgated by the CFPB but will continue to be examined and supervised by federal banking regulators for consumer compliance purposes. . 

&#160; 

Anti-Money Laundering Laws. A series of banking laws and regulations beginning with the bank Secrecy Act in 1970 requires banks to prevent, detect, and report illicit or illegal financial activities to the federal government to prevent money laundering, international drug trafficking, and terrorism. Under the US PATRIOT Act of 2001, financial institutions are subject to prohibitions against specified financial transactions and account relationships, requirements regarding the Customer Identification Program, as well as enhanced due diligence and &#8220;know your customer&#8221; standards in their dealings with high risk customers, foreign financial institutions, and foreign individuals and entities. 

&#160; 

Privacy and Data Security. The Gramm-Leach Bliley Act (&#8220;GLBA&#8221;) of 1999 imposes requirements on financial institutions with respect to consumer privacy. The GLBA generally prohibits disclosure of consumer information to non-affiliated third parties unless the consumer has been given the opportunity to object and has not objected to such disclosure. Financial institutions are further required to disclose their privacy policies to consumers annually. The GLBA also directs federal regulators, including the FDIC, to prescribe standards for the security of consumer information. The Bank is subject to such standards, as well as standards for notifying consumers in the event of a security breach. The Bank is required to have an information security program to safeguard the confidentiality and security of customer information and to ensure proper disposal of information that is no longer needed. Customers must be notified when unauthorized disclosure involves sensitive customer information that may be misused. 

&#160; 

Potential Enforcement Actions; Supervisory Agreements. Under federal law, the Bank and its institution-affiliated parties may be the subject of potential enforcement actions by the FDIC for unsafe and unsound practices in conducting their businesses, or for violations of any law, rule or regulation or provision, any consent order with any agency, any condition imposed in writing by the agency or any written agreement with the agency. Enforcement actions may include the imposition of a conservator or receiver, cease-and-desist orders and written agreements, the termination of insurance of deposits, the imposition of civil money penalties, the payment of restitution and removal and prohibition orders against institution-affiliated parties. The DBO also has authority to bring similar enforcement actions against the Bank. The FRB has the authority to bring similar enforcement actions against the Company. 

&#160; 

Legislation and Proposed Changes. From time to time, legislation is enacted which has the effect of increasing the cost of doing business, limiting or expanding permissible activities or affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial institutions. Proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations and taxation of banks, bank holding companies and other financial institutions are frequently made in Congress, in the California legislature and before various bank regulatory agencies. Typically, the intent of this type of legislation is to strengthen the banking industry, even if it may on occasion prove to be a burden on management&#8217;s plans. No prediction can be made as to the likelihood of any major changes or the impact that new laws or regulations might have on us. 

&#160; 

Effects of Government Monetary Policy. Our earnings and growth are affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government, particularly the FRB. The FRB implements national monetary policy for such purposes as curbing inflation and combating recession, through its open market operations in U.S. Government securities, control of the discount rate applicable to borrowings from the FRB, and establishment of reserve requirements against certain deposits. These activities influence growth of bank loans, investments and deposits, and also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. The Company&#8217;s profitability, like most financial institutions, is primarily dependent on interest rate spreads. In general, the difference between the interest rates paid by the Bank on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and other borrowings, and the interest rates received by the Bank on interest-earning assets, such as loans extended to customers and securities held in the investment portfolio, will comprise the major portion of the Company&#8217;s earnings. These rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, such as inflation, recession and unemployment, the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and the policies of regulatory agencies, particularly the FRB and the impact which future changes in domestic and foreign economic conditions might have on us cannot be predicted. The nature and impact of future changes in monetary policies and their impact on us cannot be predicted with certainty.
