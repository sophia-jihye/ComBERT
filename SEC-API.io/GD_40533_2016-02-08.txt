AEROSPACE 

Our Aerospace group is at the forefront of the business-jet industry. We deliver a family of Gulfstream aircraft, provide aircraft services and perform completions for aircraft produced by other original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). With more than 50 years of experience, the Aerospace group is known for: 

&#8226; 

superior aircraft design, quality, performance, safety and reliability; 

&#8226; 

technologically advanced cockpit and cabin systems; and 

&#8226; 

industry-leading product service and support. 

Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation designs, develops, manufactures, services and supports the world&#8217;s most technologically advanced business-jet aircraft. Our product line includes aircraft across a spectrum of price and performance options in the large- and mid-cabin business-jet market. The varying ranges, speeds and cabin dimensions are well-suited for the needs of a diverse and global customer base. 

In 2015, Gulfstream was awarded the Collier Trophy for the design and development of the G650 business-jet family. This is Gulfstream&#8217;s third time receiving the National Aeronautic Association&#8217;s annual award, which recognizes the greatest achievement in U.S. aeronautics or astronautics with respect to 

improving performance, efficiency and safety. The G650 family includes the G650 and the extended-range G650ER. The ultra-long-range G650ER flies farther at faster speeds than any other business jet on the market, and can travel 7,500 nautical miles at Mach 0.85. The G650 entered into service in 2012, and the G650ER was introduced and delivered in 2014. In February 2015, the G650ER set two city-pair records while flying around the world with one stop. Together, the G650 and G650ER hold more than 50 world speed records. 

We are committed to research and development (R&#38;D) activities to ensure we continue to introduce new products and first-to-market enhancements that broaden customer choice, improve aircraft performance and set new standards for customer safety, comfort and in-flight productivity. In 2014, we also introduced two new large-cabin business jets, the G500 and G600. These clean-sheet next-generation business jets optimize the speed, wide-cabin comfort, efficiency and advanced safety technology of the aircraft. At Mach 0.85, the G500 can fly 5,000 nautical miles, and the G600 can fly 6,200 nautical miles. The G500 completed its first flight in May 2015 and has since completed hundreds of test flight hours at speeds up to Mach 0.995 and altitude over 50,000 feet. The G500 and G600 are expected to enter into service in 2018 and 2019, respectively. These new aircraft demonstrate our consistent and disciplined investment in Gulfstream. 

Our product enhancement and development efforts include initiatives in advanced avionics, composites, renewable fuels, flight-control systems, acoustics, cabin technologies and vision systems. A recent example is the Symmetry Flight Deck introduced with the G500 and G600, which includes 10 touchscreens and active control sidesticks. The touchscreens improve how pilots interact with onboard systems, and the sidesticks are digitally linked to allow both pilots to see and feel each other&#8217;s control inputs, enhancing situational awareness and further improving safety of the flight. 

Gulfstream has an ongoing environmental sustainability program, including the use of renewable fuels. In 2015, we finalized an industry-first, three-year agreement that provides Gulfstream with a consistent supply of renewable fuels for daily flight operations from its headquarters in Savannah, Georgia. Each gallon of renewable fuel burned is expected to achieve a more than 50-percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions on a lifecycle basis, relative to petroleum-based jet fuel. 

Gulfstream designs, develops and manufactures aircraft in Savannah, including manufacturing all large-cabin models. The mid-cabin models are constructed by a non-U.S. partner. All models are outfitted in the group&#8217;s U.S. facilities. In support of Gulfstream&#8217;s growing aircraft portfolio and international customer base, we have invested in multi-year facilities projects at our Savannah campus, which are scheduled to continue through 2017. This expansion consists of constructing new facilities, including the completed purpose-built G500 and G600 manufacturing facilities, and renovating existing infrastructure. This effort follows earlier projects including a purpose-built G650 manufacturing facility, increased aircraft-service capacity, an improved customer sales and design center and a state-of-the-art paint facility. 

The group offers extensive support for the over 2,500 Gulfstream aircraft in service with the largest factory-owned service network in the business aviation industry, including professionals located around the globe. The service network for Gulfstream aircraft continues to evolve to address the demands of the group&#8217;s growing international customer base. We operate 11 company-owned service centers worldwide and have more than 20 factory-authorized service centers and authorized warranty facilities on six continents. We also operate a 24-hour-per-day/365-day-per-year Customer Contact Center and offer on-call Gulfstream aircraft technicians ready to deploy for urgent customer-service requirements in the Americas. This commitment to superior product support continues to receive industry recognition, including the number-one ranking for the 13th consecutive year in the annual Aviation International News Product Support Survey. 

Jet Aviation expands our Aerospace portfolio as a global leader in business aviation services, providing comprehensive services and a network of facilities to aircraft owners and operators. With employees across 

more than 25 airport facilities throughout Europe, the Middle East, Asia and North America, our service offerings include maintenance, repair, aircraft management, charter, fixed-base operations (FBO) and staffing services. We recently expanded our service network in Europe and the Bahamas, began construction on a major FBO expansion in Bedford, Massachusetts, and are on schedule to have a new maintenance facility in Macau operational in 2016. 

In addition to these capabilities, Jet Aviation has nearly 40 years of experience offering custom complex completions for business-jet and single- and double-aisle aircraft from its Basel, Switzerland, and St. Louis, Missouri, operations. To support the increasing demand for corporate and VIP aircraft interiors and our growing backlog, we recently expanded our production capacity at the Basel facility.

MARINE SYSTEMS 

Our Marine Systems group is a market-leading designer and builder of nuclear-powered submarines, surface combatants and auxiliary and combat-logistics ships for the U.S. Navy, and Jones Act ships for commercial customers. We provide high-value-added engineering, construction and assembly work, as well as lifecycle support. The group&#8217;s portfolio of platforms and diverse capabilities includes: 

&#8226; 

nuclear-powered submarines; 

&#8226; 

surface combatants; 

&#8226; 

auxiliary and combat-logistics ships; 

&#8226; 

commercial product carriers and containerships; 

&#8226; 

design and engineering support services; and 

&#8226; 

overhaul, repair and lifecycle support services. 

We have a long history as one of the primary shipbuilders for the U.S. Navy. We construct and deliver new ships and design and develop the next-generation of platforms for the Navy. More than 90 percent of the group&#8217;s revenue is for major Navy ship-construction, engineering and lifecycle support programs awarded under large, multi-ship contracts that span several years. These programs include Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarines built by Electric Boat, Arleigh Burke-class (DDG-51) and DDG-1000 guided-missile destroyers manufactured by Bath Iron Works and Expeditionary Mobile Base (ESB) auxiliary support ships produced by NASSCO. 

We are the prime contractor for the Virginia-class submarine program. Designed for the full range of global mission requirements, including intelligence gathering, special-operations missions and sea-based missile launch, these stealthy boats excel in littoral and open-ocean environments. We have delivered 12 submarines in conjunction with an industry partner that shares in the construction. In 2015, we completed the ramp-up in construction from one to two Virginia-class submarines per year. The remaining 16 submarines under contract are scheduled for delivery through 2023. We are also developing the Virginia Payload Module (VPM) for the next block of Virginia-class submarines that is expected to start construction in 2019. The VPM is an 80-foot hull section that will add four additional payload tubes, boosting strike capacity by 230 percent and preserving the United States&#8217; critical undersea capabilities. 

The group is currently performing development work for the replacement of the Navy&#8217;s Ohio-class ballistic missile submarine fleet, which will reach the end of its service life starting in 2027. These Ohio-class replacement submarines will provide strategic deterrent capabilities for decades to come. The lead ship is slated to start construction in 2021, with delivery to the Navy in 2027. We are preparing our workforce 

and facilities for the start of construction for the Ohio-class replacement program. This includes a new 113,000-square-foot automated frame and cylinder facility that we recently built in Quonset Point, Rhode Island, to support the Common Missile Compartment work under joint development for the U.S. Navy and the U.K. Royal Navy. 

We are the lead designer and builder of DDG-51 destroyers, managing the design, modernization and lifecycle support of these ships. These highly capable, multi-mission ships provide offensive and defensive capabilities and are capable of simultaneously fighting air, surface and subsurface battles. They can operate independently or as part of carrier strike groups, surface action groups, amphibious ready groups and underway replenishment groups. We currently have construction contracts for seven DDG-51s scheduled for delivery through 2022. 

Bath Iron Works is one of the Navy&#8217;s contractors involved in the development and construction of the DDG-1000 platform, the Navy&#8217;s next-generation guided-missile destroyer. These ships are equipped with numerous technological enhancements, including a low radar profile, an integrated power system and a software environment that ties together nearly every system on the ship. DDG-1000s will provide independent forward presence and deterrence, support special operations forces, and operate as an integral part of joint and combined expeditionary forces. Deliveries of the three ships in the program are scheduled through 2019. In December 2015, the first ship successfully completed its first set of at-sea builders tests and trials. 

We are delivering ESB auxiliary support ships, a second variant of the original Expeditionary Support Dock (ESD) ships, which serve as floating transfer stations that improve the Navy&#8217;s ability to deliver large-scale equipment to areas without adequate port access. The ESBs, equipped with a 52,000-square-foot flight deck and accommodations for up to 250 personnel, are capable of supporting a variety of missions, including airborne mine countermeasure, maritime security operations and disaster relief missions. The group has delivered the first three ships in the program, and construction is underway on the fourth ship, scheduled for delivery in 2018. 

Our Marine Systems group provides comprehensive ship and submarine overhaul, repair and lifecycle support services to extend the service life and maximize the value of these ships. We conduct surface-ship repair operations in four locations with full-service maintenance and repair shipyards on both U.S. coasts. We also provide extensive submarine repair services in a variety of U.S. locations and are converting two decommissioned submarines to moored training ships. In support of allied navies, we offer program management, planning, engineering and design support for submarine and surface-ship construction programs. 

Beyond its work for the Navy, the Marine Systems group has extensive experience in all phases of ship construction for commercial customers, designing and building oil tankers and dry cargo carriers for commercial markets since the 1970s. Our ships help our commercial customers satisfy the Jones Act requirement that ships carrying cargo between U.S. ports be built in U.S. shipyards. The group has advanced commercial shipbuilding technology with NASSCO&#8217;s design and delivery of the world&#8217;s first liquefied natural gas (LNG)-powered containership, using green ship technology to dramatically decrease emissions while increasing fuel efficiency. We are also designing and producing LNG-conversion-ready ships for commercial customers. Currently, we have construction contracts for eight ships scheduled for delivery through 2017. With the age of the Jones Act fleet and environmental regulations that impose more stringent emission control limits, we anticipate additional commercial shipbuilding opportunities. 

To further the group&#8217;s goals of operating efficiency, innovation and affordability for the customer, we make strategic investments in our business, often in cooperation with the Navy. In addition, the Marine Systems group leverages its design and engineering expertise across its shipyards to improve program 

execution and generate cost savings. This knowledge sharing enables the group to use resources more efficiently and drive process improvements. We are well-positioned to continue to fulfill the ship-construction and support requirements of our customers.

* In addition to our direct non-U.S. sales, we sell to non-U.S. governments through the FMS program. Under the FMS program, we contract with and are paid by the U.S. government, and the U.S. government assumes the risk of collection from the non-U.S. government customer. 

Our U.S. government businesses operate under fixed-price, cost-reimbursement and time-and-materials contracts. Our production contracts are primarily fixed-price. Under these contracts, we agree to perform a specific scope of work for a fixed amount. Contracts for research, engineering, repair and maintenance, and other services are typically cost-reimbursement or time-and-materials. Under cost-reimbursement contracts, the customer reimburses contract costs and pays a fixed, incentive or award-based fee. These fees are determined by our ability to achieve targets set in the contract, such as cost, quality, schedule and performance. Under time-and-materials contracts, the customer pays a fixed hourly rate for direct labor and generally reimburses us for the cost of materials. 

In our U.S. government business, fixed-price contracts accounted for 54 percent &#32;in 2015 , 53 percent &#32;in 2014 &#32;and 54 percent &#32;in 2013 ; cost-reimbursement contracts accounted for 42 percent &#32;in 2015 , 43 percent &#32;in 2014 &#32;and 42 percent &#32;in 2013 ; and time-and-materials contracts accounted for 4 percent &#32;in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 . 

Each of these contract types presents advantages and disadvantages. Typically, we assume more risk with fixed-price contracts. However, these types of contracts offer additional profits when we complete the 

work for less than the contract amount. Cost-reimbursement contracts generally subject us to lower risk. Accordingly, the associated fees are usually lower than fees earned on fixed-price contracts. Additionally, some costs are unallowable under these types of contracts, and the government reviews the costs we charge. Under time-and-materials contracts, our profit may vary if actual labor-hour costs vary significantly from the negotiated rates. Also, because these contracts can provide little or no fee for managing material costs, the content mix can impact margin rates. 

U.S. COMMERCIAL 

Our U.S. commercial revenue was $5.3 billion &#32;in 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;and $5.4 billion &#32;in 2013 . This represented approximately 17 percent &#32;of our consolidated revenue in 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;and 18 percent &#32;in 2013 . The majority of this revenue is for business-jet aircraft and related services where our customer base consists of individuals and public and privately held companies across a wide range of industries. 

NON-U.S. 

Our revenue from non-U.S. government and commercial customers was $8.2 billion &#32;in 2015 , $7.6 billion &#32;in 2014 &#32;and $6.3 billion &#32;in 2013 . This represented approximately 26 percent &#32;of our consolidated revenue in 2015 , 25 percent &#32;in 2014 &#32;and 20 percent &#32;in 2013 . 

We conduct business with customers around the world, providing a broad portfolio of products and services. Our non-U.S. defense subsidiaries are committed to maintaining long-term relationships with their respective governments and have established themselves as principal regional suppliers and employers. 

Our non-U.S. commercial business consists primarily of business-jet aircraft exports and worldwide aircraft services. The market for business-jet aircraft and related services outside North America has expanded significantly in recent years. While the installed base of aircraft is concentrated in North America, orders from non-U.S. customers represent a significant segment of our aircraft business with approximately 55 percent &#32;of the Aerospace group&#8217;s total backlog on December 31, 2015 . 

COMPETITION 

Several factors determine our ability to compete successfully in the defense and business-aviation markets. While customers&#8217; evaluation criteria vary, the principal competitive elements include: 

&#8226; 

the technical excellence, reliability, safety and cost competitiveness of our products and services; 

&#8226; 

our ability to innovate and develop new products and technologies that improve mission performance and adapt to dynamic threats; 

&#8226; 

successful program execution and on-time delivery of complex, integrated systems; 

&#8226; 

our global footprint and accessibility to customers; 

&#8226; 

the reputation and customer confidence derived from past performance; and 

&#8226; 

the successful management of customer relationships. 

DEFENSE MARKET COMPETITION 

The U.S. government contracts with numerous domestic and non-U.S. companies for products and services. We compete against other large platform- and system-integration contractors as well as smaller companies that specialize in a particular technology or capability. Outside the United States, we compete with global defense contractors&#8217; exports and the offerings of private and state-owned defense manufacturers. Our Combat Systems group competes with a large number of domestic and non-U.S. businesses. Our Information Systems and Technology group competes with many companies, from large defense companies to small niche competitors with specialized technologies or expertise. Our Marine Systems group has one primary 

competitor with which it also partners on the Virginia-class submarine program. The operating cycle of many of our major platform programs can result in sustained periods of program continuity when we perform successfully. 

We are involved in teaming and subcontracting relationships with some of our competitors. Competitions for major defense programs often require companies to form teams to bring together a spectrum of capabilities to meet the customer&#8217;s requirements. Opportunities associated with these programs include roles as the program&#8217;s integrator, overseeing and coordinating the efforts of all participants on a team, or as a provider of a specific component or subsystem. 

BUSINESS-JET AIRCRAFT MARKET COMPETITION 

The Aerospace group has several competitors for each of its Gulfstream products. Key competitive factors include aircraft safety, reliability and performance; comfort and in-flight productivity; service quality, global footprint and responsiveness; technological and new-product innovation; and price. We believe that Gulfstream competes effectively in all of these areas. 

The Aerospace group competes worldwide in the business-jet aircraft services market primarily on the basis of price, quality and timeliness. In our maintenance, repair and FBO businesses, the group competes with several other large companies as well as a number of smaller companies, particularly in the maintenance business. In our completions business, the group competes with other OEMs, as well as several third-party providers.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 

To foster innovative product development and evolution, we conduct sustained R&#38;D activities as part of our normal business operations. In the commercial sector, most of our Aerospace group&#8217;s R&#38;D activities support Gulfstream&#8217;s product enhancement and development programs. In our U.S. defense businesses, we conduct customer-sponsored R&#38;D activities under government contracts and company-sponsored R&#38;D, investing in technologies and capabilities that provide solutions for our customers. In accordance with 

government regulations, we recover a portion of company-sponsored R&#38;D expenditures through overhead charges to U.S. government contracts. For more information on our company-sponsored R&#38;D activities, including our expenditures for the past three years, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. 

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 

We develop technology, manufacturing processes and systems-integration practices. In addition to owning a large portfolio of proprietary intellectual property, we license some intellectual property rights to and from others. The U.S. government holds licenses to many of our patents developed in the performance of U.S. government contracts, and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by these patents. Although these intellectual property rights are important to the operation of our business, no existing patent, license or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would have a material impact on our business. 

EMPLOYEES 

On December 31, 2015 , our subsidiaries had 99,900 &#32;employees, approximately one-fifth &#32;of whom work under collective agreements with various labor unions and worker representatives. Agreements covering approximately 6 percent &#32;of total employees are due to expire in 2016 . Historically, we have renegotiated these labor agreements without any significant disruption to operating activities. 

RAW MATERIALS, SUPPLIERS AND SEASONALITY 

We depend on suppliers and subcontractors for raw materials, components and subsystems. Our U.S. government customer is a supplier on some of our programs. These supply networks can experience price fluctuations and capacity constraints, which can put pressure on our costs. Effective management and oversight of suppliers and subcontractors is an important element of our successful performance. We attempt to mitigate these risks with our suppliers by entering into long-term agreements and leveraging company-wide agreements to achieve economies of scale, and by negotiating flexible pricing terms in our customer contracts. We have not experienced, and do not foresee, significant difficulties in obtaining the materials, components or supplies necessary for our business operations. 

Our business is not seasonal in nature. The receipt of contract awards, the availability of funding from the customer, the incurrence of contract costs and unit deliveries are all factors that influence the timing of our revenue. In the United States, these factors are influenced by the federal government&#8217;s budget cycle based on its October-to-September fiscal year. 

REGULATORY MATTERS 

U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS 

U.S. government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) govern the majority of our contracts. The FAR mandates uniform policies and procedures for U.S. government acquisitions and purchased services. Also, individual agencies can have acquisition regulations that provide implementing language for the FAR or that supplement the FAR. For example, the DoD implements the FAR through the Defense Federal 

Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS). For all federal government entities, the FAR regulates the phases of any product or service acquisition, including: 

&#8226; 

acquisition planning, 

&#8226; 

competition requirements, 

&#8226; 

contractor qualifications, 

&#8226; 

protection of source selection and vendor information, and 

&#8226; 

acquisition procedures. 

In addition, the FAR addresses the allowability of our costs, while the CAS address how those costs should be allocated to contracts. The FAR subjects us to audits and other government reviews covering issues such as cost, performance, internal controls and accounting practices relating to our contracts. 

NON-U.S. REGULATORY 

Our non-U.S. revenue is subject to the applicable foreign government regulations and procurement policies and practices, as well as U.S. policies and regulations. We are also subject to regulations governing investments, exchange controls, repatriation of earnings and import-export control. 

BUSINESS-JET AIRCRAFT 

The Aerospace group is subject to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulation in the U.S. and other similar aviation regulatory authorities internationally, including the Civil Aviation Administration of Israel (CAAI), the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC). For an aircraft to be manufactured and sold, the model must receive a type certificate from the appropriate aviation authority, and each aircraft must receive a certificate of airworthiness. Aircraft outfitting and completions also require approval by the appropriate aviation authority, which often is accomplished through a supplemental type certificate. Aviation authorities can require changes to a specific aircraft or model type before granting approval. Maintenance facilities and charter operations must be licensed by aviation authorities as well. 

ENVIRONMENTAL 

We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations cover the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal, investigation and remediation of materials, substances and wastes identified in the laws and regulations. We are directly or indirectly involved in environmental investigations or remediation at some of our current and former facilities and at third-party sites that we do not own but where we have been designated a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or a state environmental agency. As a PRP, we are potentially liable to the government or third parties for the cost of remediating contamination. In cases where we have been designated a PRP, generally we seek to mitigate these environmental liabilities through available insurance coverage and by pursuing appropriate cost-recovery actions. In the unlikely event we are required to fully fund the remediation of a site, the current statutory framework would allow us to pursue contributions from other PRPs. We regularly assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters. 

Operating and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of contaminated sites are a normal, recurring part of our operations. Historically, these costs have not been material. Environmental costs often are recoverable under our contracts with the U.S. government. Based on information currently available and current U.S. government policies relating to cost recovery, we do not expect continued compliance with environmental regulations to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. For additional information relating to the impact of environmental matters, see Note N to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. 

AVAILABLE INFORMATION 

We file reports and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These reports and information include an annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and proxy statements. Free copies of these items are made available on our website (www.generaldynamics.com) as soon as practicable and through the General Dynamics investor relations office at (703) 876-3583.
