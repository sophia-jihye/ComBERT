We are a clinical stage pharmaceutical company, focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics to treat rare or uncommon chronic and serious inflammatory and fibrotic diseases with clear unmet medical needs. Our product Resunab is a novel synthetic oral endocannabinoid-mimetic drug that is designed to resolve chronic inflammation and halt fibrotic processes without causing immunosuppression. In preclinical models, Resunab also demonstrated an ability to promote bacterial clearance by the immune system. Resunab is currently being evaluated in three separate Phase 2 studies for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, or CF, systemic sclerosis and skin-predominant dermatomyositis. Top-line data from the cystic fibrosis and systemic sclerosis studies are anticipated by the end of 2016 and from the dermatomyositis study in the first quarter of 2017. The United States Food and Drug Administration (the &#8220;FDA&#8221;) has granted Resunab Orphan Drug Designation as well as Fast Track Status for both cystic fibrosis and systemic sclerosis. A fourth Phase 2 study of Resunab in systemic lupus erythematosus, or SLE, is planned to start in the first quarter of 2017. 

Since our inception, we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to business planning, research and development, recruiting management and technical staff, acquiring operating assets and raising capital. Our research and development activities have included conducting pre-clinical studies, developing manufacturing methods and manufacturing of our lead drug Resunab for clinical trials and conducting clinical studies in patients.

Resunab is a synthetic, rationally-designed oral small molecule drug that selectively binds to the cannabinoid receptor type 2, or CB2, which is found on activated immune cells, fibroblasts and muscle cells. Resunab stimulates the production of Specialized Pro-Resolving Lipid Mediators, or SPMs, which act to resolve inflammation, clear bacteria and halt fibrosis by activating endogenous pathways. These endogenous resolution pathways are normally activated in healthy individuals during the course of normal immune responses but are dysfunctional in chronic inflammatory and fibrotic diseases. Through its&#8217; activation of the CB2 receptor, Resunab is designed to move innate immune responses from the activation phase through completion of the resolution phase. The CB2 receptor plays an endogenous role in modulating and resolving inflammation by, in effect, turning heightened inflammation &#8220;off&#8221; and restoring homeostasis. 

A key aspect of the body&#8217;s innate immune response in the activation phase is the recruitment of inflammatory cells to the site of tissue infection/injury whereupon these cells act to destroy the infection and/or repair tissue damage. The activation phase of the innate immune response prepares the body for more effective clearance of the infectious organism and repair of damaged tissue. The next phase in a normal innate immune response is the resolution phase, during which the nature of the infiltrating immune cells changes from inflammatory to non-inflammatory, the infectious organisms are eliminated as a threat, the tissue then is cleared of residual cellular debris and immune cells, and tissue repair processes stop. In chronic inflammatory and fibrotic diseases, the innate immune responses are &#8220;stuck&#8221; in the initial activation phase. This failure to progress through the resolution phase causes chronic tissue infiltration with inflammatory cells and chronic activation of healing processes that cause tissue scarring, or fibrosis. The key event that propels an innate immune response from its activation phase to its resolution phase is a &#8220;class switch&#8221; from production of pro-inflammatory lipid mediators such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes to a family of SPMs (Figure 1) which include lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, and marescins. If an innate immune response persists in the activation phase and does not progress through resolution, chronic inflammation and fibrosis can result, causing organ dysfunction, organ failure, severe morbidity and even death. There are hundreds of inflammatory diseases, many of which are chronic, life-long and incurable.

&#160;

Figure 1. Resunab&#8217;s Intende d Mechanism of Action 

&#160;

&#160;

Resunab is designed to restore immune system homeostasis on a daily basis, by using the body&#8217;s own physiologic pathways to transition an innate immune response from the activation phase to the resolution phase. If an innate immune response is &#8220;stuck&#8221; in the activation phase, tissue damage, fibrosis and persistent infection are expected consequences. Endogenous progression of the innate immune response through its resolution phase has been shown to clear inflammation, stop fibrosis, and promote pathogen clearance. Resunab&#8217; s unique mechanism of action is very different than anti-inflammatory drugs which inhibit production or functions of certain pro-inflammatory mediators that initiate or are active during the activation phase. Activation of an innate immune response is necessary to clear infections, so that drugs that interfere with the activation phase carry the risk of immunosuppression and may have other undesirable side effects. In contrast, Resunab is designed to transition an innate immune response from its activation phase to resolution phase. Resunab&#8217;s CB2 agonist activity initiates a class switch in bioactive lipid mediators from inflammation-activating mediators to pro-resolving mediators.

Preclinical studies in isolated cells and animal models of disease and clinical pilot studies have shown that Resunab triggers the transition from the activation phase to the resolution phase of innate immune responses. Resunab shifts the balance of lipid mediators to favor production of SPMs and anti-inflammatory lipid mediators (such as prostaglandin J2) versus inflammation-activating lipid mediators (such as leukotriene B4 and prostaglandin E2). The transition out of the activation phase is reflected in preclinical cellular or animal models by reduced tissue edema, swelling, tenderness and pain, reduced production of the chemokine interleukin-8, and reduced production of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-&#945;, interleukin-1&#946;, and type 1 interferons. The transition into and through the resolution phase is reflected in preclinical cellular or animal models by increased clearance of bacteria ( Pseudomonas aeruginosa from the lung), apoptosis of T cells, reduction of neutrophils and a normalization of the number of macrophages in inflamed tissues. Production of transforming growth factor (TGF&#946;), myofibroblast accumulation, collagen production, and fibrosis are all reduced in tissue in pre-clinical animal models. 

&#160;

The development status of Resunab is summarized below:

Market Opportunity in Inflammatory and Fibrotic Diseases

Chronic, serious inflammatory and fibrotic diseases are varied. Some examples of chronic, serious diseases characterized by inflammation with variable degrees of fibrosis include genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, autoimmune diseases including systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, myositis, rheumatoid arthritis, vasculitis, primary biliary cirrhosis and lung diseases including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, bronchiolitis obliterans, and sarcoidosis. 

According to Global Business Intelligence Research, the global market for drugs to treat chronic inflammation in 2010 was approximately $58 billion and is expected to grow to approximately $86 billion by 2017. While some chronic inflammatory diseases are very common, for example, about 28.5 million Americans have chronic sinusitis and about 18.7 million Americans have asthma, our initial focus is on chronic, serious inflammatory and fibrotic diseases that are rare or uncommon and have significant unmet medical need. Some of these diseases can be categorized as &#8220;orphan diseases&#8221; in the U.S., meaning they affect no more than 200,000 patients each. Examples include cystic fibrosis, systemic sclerosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. 

Markets for Resunab

Cystic Fibrosis

Cystic fibrosis is a life-long, progressive, debilitating, and life-threatening autosomal recessive disease. Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the gene Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator or CFTR. The CFTR serves as a central hub to modulate transport, trafficking, and signaling in cells. Given multiple roles of CFTR in cellular activation and homeostasis, mutation of the CFTR give rise to multiple disorders in respiratory, digestive and reproductive organs. 

The CFTR mutations lead to defective ion transport, with reduced chloride and bicarbonate secretion and sodium hyper-absorption, followed by water hyper-absorption, by airway epithelia and other cell types. The resultant reduced height of epithelial lining fluid and decreased hydration of mucus results in abnormally thick and sticky mucus, which obstructs the lumen into which the mucus is secreted and reduces mucociliary clearance of bacteria. The dysfunction in ion transport in CF patients is reflected in abnormal sweat chloride levels.

The negative effects caused by CFTR mutations are not restricted to ion channels, but also extend to dysfunction of the innate immune system. The nature of the abnormalities in CF are consistent with inability of innate immune responses to make the transition out of the activation phase and into and through the resolution phase. Bioactive lipid mediators (SPMs) that initiate the transition to resolution phase of innate immune responses have been found to be deficient relative to pro-inflammatory lipid mediators that initiate its activation phase, and this reduction correlates with poor recovery of lung function following an acute pulmonary exacerbation in children. The preponderance of activated neutrophils and pro-inflammatory macrophages in inflamed tissue, reduced neutrophil apoptosis, high levels of neutrophil proteases that reflect persistent neutrophil activation, reduced clearance of neutrophils by macrophages, ineffective clearance of certain bacteria such as P. aeruginosa, and excessive activation of fibrotic pathways all show the inability of individuals with CF to resolve their innate immune responses. 

&#160;

An overview of the disease progression in cystic fibrosis is provided in Figure 3. 

Figure 3: Factors involved in cystic fibrosis progression 

&#160;

&#160;

As a result of obstructing secretions, recurrent infections, hyper-inflammation, and activated fibrotic pathways in the lungs, individuals with CF develop bronchiectasis, pulmonary fibrosis, mixed obstructive/restrictive lung disease, and, eventually, respiratory failure. They may also have chronic sinusitis and nasal polyps. The same pathophysiologic events of obstruction, infection, chronic inflammation, and tissue damage/fibrosis occur in the gastrointestinal system, which can lead to bowel obstructions, fat malabsorption, bacterial overgrowth, gut dysmotility, malnutrition, growth retardation, low weight, pancreatic insufficiency, cystic fibrosis-related diabetes, gallstones, and liver failure including cirrhosis. Adult males with cystic fibrosis have degeneration of the &#160; ductus deferens and sterility. End-stage organ involvement in cystic fibrosis is sometimes treated with transplantation, especially lung transplantation. 

The median current life expectancy of cystic fibrosis patients is about 40 years. According to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, 30,000 Americans and a total of 70,000 people in the United States and Europe suffer from cystic fibrosis. The cost of treating cystic fibrosis is high, with an average cost in the U.S. of between $50,000- $74,000 per patient per annum.

Current therapies for cystic fibrosis include mucolytics to breakdown mucus, antibiotics to fight bacterial infection, and, very recently, drugs that act to restore some functionality to the faulty CFTR protein in specific genetic sub-populations of patients, including Kalydeco&#8482; and Orkambi&#8482;. Kalydeco&#8482; was approved for treatment of cystic fibrosis in January 2012 and Orkambi was approved in June 2015. With about 2,000 different known mutations in the CFTR gene, Kalydeco&#8482; can only be used by a specific sub-section of the cystic fibrosis population who suffer from a limited number of &#8220;gating mutations,&#8221; including the G551D mutation. Combined, these currently account for about 5.7% of the total cystic fibrosis patient population worldwide. Orkambi&#8482; is currently only approved for adult patients carrying two copies of the delta508 CFTR mutation.

Of importance, drugs that are sufficient to correct ion channel functions of mutant CFTR protein are not necessarily able to correct the dysfunction of the innate immune system. For example, ivacaftor treatment has not been associated with reduction in sputum neutrophils or neutrophil derived proteases in CF patients. Thus correction of ion channel dysfunction does not necessarily translate into correction of dysfunction of the innate immune system. 

All CF patients appear to have dysfunction in resolution of the innate immune system, no matter which CFTR mutations a given patient has. Currently, there is no drug that is used commonly to this basic problem in CF, other than antibiotics to control infection and, indirectly, control inflammation. The use of high dose ibuprofen as an anti-inflammatory treatment is limited to about 3-5% of CF patients since there is a need to monitor levels closely in children and due to side effect risks, primarily gastrointestinal bleeding. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Strategic Plan Report, 2014-2018, includes a strategic priority to identify new treatments for CF that allow all patients to better manage the symptoms of their disease and improve their health, with a specific mention of the need for new agents that can resolve inflammation. 

We believe that there is general agreement in the CF community that an effective drug that will control hyper-inflammation and help clear infections would address a significant unmet medical need in CF, especially a drug that is orally administered, can be used chronically with other commonly prescribed medications for CF, is not immunosuppressive, and has anti-fibrotic effects.

(Systemic Sclerosis) Scleroderma 

Systemic sclerosis is a chronic, systemic autoimmune disease characterized by activation of innate and specific immune systems, an obliterative, proliferative vasculopathy of small blood vessels, and fibrosis of the skin and multiple internal organs. Approximately 90,000 people in the United States and Europe have systemic sclerosis. The disease affects mainly adults (80% of systemic sclerosis patients are women) with mean age of onset about 46 years of age in the United States and the majority of patients between 45-64 years of age. 

&#160;

A commonly used system classifies systemic sclerosis patients into those with more wide-spread skin thickening (diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis, about 45% of patients) and those with more restricted skin thickening (limit ed cutaneous systemic sclerosis, about 55% of patients). There is significant overlap in the clinical manifestations for these two groups of systemic sclerosis patients and no known significant differences in disease pathogenesis. 

Systemic sclerosis can affect multiple internal organs in the body, including the lungs, heart, kidneys, joints, muscles, esophagus, stomach and intestines. Clinically apparent organ involvement that occurs in more than a third of these patients includes thickened skin, Raynaud&#8217;s phenomenon, esophageal symptoms, pulmonary fibrosis, restrictive lung disease, edematous skin, joint contractures, digital ulcers, and muscle weakness. Less frequently occurring, yet life-threatening manifestations include pulmonary artery hypertension (about 1 in 5 patients), cardiac conduction blocks (about 1 in 10 patients), and renal crisis (about 1 in 50 patients). In the US, systemic sclerosis is the most deadly of the systemic autoimmune diseases. A patient with newly diagnosed diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis has a 1 in 2 chance of dying by seven years after onset of disease. About 85% of deaths caused by systemic sclerosis are the result of pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary artery hypertension, or cardiovascular disease, such as sudden death.

In systemic sclerosis the innate immune response fails to transition from the activation phase to the resolution phase. Individuals with systemic sclerosis who have interstitial lung disease have an imbalance of bioactive lipid mediators, causing a predominance of inflammation-activating mediators versus resolving mediators. The preponderance of inflammation-activating mediators correlates positively with the degree of inflammation in the lungs and negatively with forced vital capacity, a measure of lung fibrosis. Excessive activation of the pathways which cause fibrosis including TGF&#946;, myofibroblast accumulation, and production of collagen and other extracellular matrix proteins are all seen in systemic sclerosis.

Currently, there are no FDA-approved therapies specifically for systemic sclerosis, except secondarily for drugs to treat pulmonary artery hypertension associated with autoimmune diseases. Immunosuppressants with significant toxicities are commonly used to reduce disease activity, generally in the absence of data to support their use. For example, systemic corticosteroids are used frequently in systemic sclerosis patients, despite concerns about toxic side effect and precipitation of renal crisis.

We believe that there is general agreement in the systemic sclerosis community that an effective anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic drug would address a significant unmet medical need in systemic sclerosis, especially a drug that is orally administered, can be used chronically with other commonly prescribed medications for systemic sclerosis, and is not immunosuppressive. We believe such a therapy would be positively received by the market. 

Dermatomyositis

Dermatomyositis is a serious autoimmune idiopathic inflammatory myopathy with characteristic cutaneous findings. About 30,000 individuals in the U.S. have dermatomyositis. Dermatomyositis usually strikes adults, with most common age of adult onset between 50-60 years.

This systemic disorder most frequently affects the skin and muscles, and dermatomyositis can also include interstitial lung disease/restrictive lung disease, arthritis, gastrointestional and cardiac involvement. Inflammatory muscle disease can cause discomfort and significant weakness of the proximal muscles of the arms and legs and of the trunk. Dermatomyositis can include damaging inflammation elsewhere in the body, for example: lung inflammation that leads to lung fibrosis and restrictive lung disease; heart inflammation that causes arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, and pericarditis, inflammation of muscles in the esophagus that causes swallowing problems or aspiration pneumonia, and arthritis. Dermatomyositis patients may have active skin disease despite successful treatment of their muscle and/or lung disease. The skin findings in dermatomyositis can be disfiguring and are inflammatory rashes characterized by redness and itching in exposed areas of the skin, around the eyes, on the hands, and in a &#8220;shawl&#8221; distribution on the scalp, hands, upper back, and photo-exposed areas. With this chronic inflammation, patients with dermatomyositis have an increased risk of malignancy, most commonly in older patients By itself, skin involvement in dermatomyositis has a large negative impact on quality of life, comparable to that of cutaneous lupus erythematosus and vulvodynia, and much higher than those of many dermatologic diseases. The pathophysiology of dermatomyositis is also consistent with inability of patients to adequately resolve innate immune responses.

Therapy for dermatomyositis involves both general measures and specific measures to control the muscle disease and the skin disease. In addition, some patients with dermatomyositis need treatment for other systemic manifestations or complications. The muscle component is treated by administering corticosteroids, typically with an immunosuppressive agent. The skin disease is treated by avoiding sun exposure and by using sunscreens and photoprotective clothing, as well as with topical corticosteroids, and antimalarial agents. Antimalarial therapy frequently is ineffective or can cause drug reactions. Antimalarial-refractory disease is then treated with systemic therapies that may additionally cause toxicity, including systemic glucocorticoids, immunosuppressive therapies such as methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, or intravenous immunoglobulin.

&#160;

We believe that an effective drug that controls inflammation in the skin, muscles, and other organs will address a significant unmet medical need in dermatomyositis , particularly a drug that is orally administered, can be used chronically with other commonly prescribed medications for the disease, and is not immunosuppressive. 

Systemic Lupus Erythematosus

Systemic lupus erythematosus, or SLE or lupus, is a prototypical autoimmune disease with a wide array of clinical manifestations, including arthritis, rash, photosensitivity, oral ulcers, pleuritis, pericarditis, kidney problems, seizures and psychosis and blood cell abnormalities. The musculoskeletal system is the most commonly involved system in SLE. Patients with SLE have an increased frequency of related autoimmune problems, such as Sjogren's syndrome and antiphospholipid syndrome that require additional treatments. Lupus may occur with other autoimmune conditions, such as thyroiditis, hemolytic anemia, and idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura. Accelerated atherosclerosis among SLE patients is responsible for premature mortality.

The pathology of SLE involves chronic activation of the innate immune system by immune complexes, with activation of complement, increased production of type 1 interferons and other mediators of inflammation and resultant tissue inflammation and damage. 

Drugs specifically approved by the FDA for SLE are limited to aspirin, corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine and belimumab. Physicians commonly treat disease manifestations with immunosuppressive or corticosteroid therapies that have significant toxicities.

We believe that an effective drug that controls inflammation in the joints and skin as well as improves overall disease activity will address a significant unmet medical need in SLE , particularly a drug that is orally administered, can be used chronically with other commonly prescribed medications for the disease, and is not immunosuppressive. 

Current Treatment Alternatives for Chronic, Serious Diseases Characterized by Chronic Inflammation and Fibrosis

Overview 

Drugs currently used to treat chronic, serious diseases with chronic inflammation and fibrosis are divided broadly into several groups: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), anti-malarial agents, systemic corticosteroids, and immunosuppressive agents. The choice of agent or combination generally depends upon the underlying disease and physician and patient preferences. 

The potency of NSAIDs in the treatment of chronic, serious diseases with chronic inflammatory and fibrotic diseases is often too limited to control disease activity, and patients may receive additional treatment with anti-malarial drugs, systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressive agents. Anti-malarial therapy is used as a baseline treatment for chronic inflammation in certain autoimmune diseases, typically SLE and dermatomyositis, especially in patients with milder manifestations of disease. Anti-malarial therapy frequently is ineffective in controlling chronic, serious inflammation, or can cause drug reactions. Antimalarial-refractory disease is then treated with systemic therapies that may additionally cause toxicity, including systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents.

Systemic corticosteroids are commonly prescribed for treatment of chronic, serious diseases characterized by chronic inflammation and fibrosis, such as cystic fibrosis, systemic sclerosis, and dermatomyositis. Chronic corticosteroid use is limited by toxicities that include growth retardation, iatrogenic Cushings&#8217;s Disease, hypertension, high glucose levels/diabetes, obesity, brittle bones/osteoporosis, aseptic necrosis of bone, immunosuppression/increased infection, glaucoma, depression, and psychosis. Thus, safer yet potent alternatives to steroids have long been sought. 

Multiple other immunosuppressive drugs are used to treat chronic, serious, inflammatory diseases, to achieve disease control and to reduce or avoid the need for corticosteroids. These include biological agents, such as monoclonal antibodies or fusion proteins, which target a very specific molecule in a key disease pathway. These drugs have a number of disadvantages including that the drugs must be administered by parenterally and they are associated with increased incidence of malignancy and infection. Non-biologic immunosuppressive agents that are used to treat chronic, serious inflammation include methotrexate, mycophenolate, leflunomide, cyclophosphamide, and azathioprine, among others. Intravenous immunoglobulin is used occasionally to treat refractory chronic, serious inflammatory diseases.

Cystic Fibrosis 

The importance of treating inflammation in cystic fibrosis is confirmed in the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation&#8217;s Strategic Plan, 2014-2018. While treatment with systemic corticosteroids and ibuprofen are effective in improving the symptoms of cystic fibrosis, the side effects associated with chronic treatment using these drugs are significant. Specifically, long term usage of oral corticosteroids in children are associated with glucose intolerance, cataract formation, multiple bone fractures secondary to osteoporosis or osteopenia, 

&#160;

Cushing Syndrome effects, and anorexia nervosa as well as growth retardation. The use of high dose ibuprofen is limited by the years of treatment it takes to show benefit, a need to monitor levels closely in the patient, and the incre ased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. As a result, these drugs have limited long-term use in cystic fibrosis. 

Other therapies routinely used by cystic fibrosis patients include antibiotics, such as Cayston from Gilead and TOBI from Novartis, and mucolytics, such as Pulmozyme from Genentech. In addition, Vertex currently markets the only approved drugs that specifically target the defective CFTR protein, Kalydeco and Orkambi.

Systemic Sclerosis 

Cytotoxic medications are used to control overall disease activity in systemic sclerosis. In a study of 2,739 systemic sclerosis patients in the United States, in one year 44.3% received corticosteroids, 4.8% received mycophenolate mofetil, 2.7% received cyclophosphamide, and 0.5% received cyclosporine. In a report of 7,655 patients in the European Scleroderma Trials and Research Group database, immunosuppressant treatments used to treat systemic sclerosis and the percentage of patients receiving them were: prednisone (43.5%) with median dose of 8 mg/day; cyclophosphamide (15.9%); methotrexate (13.7%); azathioprine (6.4%); mycophenolate mofetil (4.2%), d-penicillamine (2.1%), and rituximab (1%).

Dermatomyositis

Current medications for dermatomyositis involve both treatments to reduce overall disease activity and specific treatments to control the muscle disease and the skin disease. The muscle component is treated by administering corticosteroids, typically with an immunosuppressive agent. The skin disease is treated by avoiding sun exposure and by using sunscreens and photoprotective clothing, as well as with topical corticosteroids, antimalarial agents such as hydroxychloroquine and immunosuppressive medications such as methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, or intravenous immunoglobulin.

Systemic Lupus Erythematosus

Similar to dermatomyositis, current medications for SLE involve treatments to reduce overall disease activity and specific treatments for a given organ involvement. Commonly used medications include NSAIDs, topical corticosteroids, antimalarial agents, prednisone, belimumab, and other immunosuppressive medications such as mycophenolate, methotrexate, azathioprine, and cyclophosphamide.

Resunab&#8217;s Mechanism of Action is Distinct from Anti-Inflammatory Drugs, Steroids and Immunosuppressive Agents

Corticosteroids and NSAIDs exert their effect by inhibiting the activation of inflammation. In simple terms, both classes of drugs inhibit inflammation by &#8220;interfering&#8221; with the biochemical pathways in the cell that promote and sustain inflammation. For example, NSAIDs directly inhibit the activity of the COX 1 and COX 2 enzymes that are responsible for generating pro-inflammatory eicosanoids. A drawback of this approach is that it only inhibits one arm of the eicosanoid pathway (e.g. COX but not LOX) resulting in an increase in LOX-derived inflammatory mediators which leads to gastrointestinal and cardiovascular side effects (termed &#8220;molecular shunting&#8221;).

Resunab on the other hand is intended to trigger endogenous pathways that resolve inflammation and halt fibrosis without immunosuppression. Resunab is intended to impact and activate multiple pathways including: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Increase in production of SPMs and anti-inflammatory eicosanoids, with a concomitant decrease in production of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Increase in production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, coupled with a decrease in production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and pro-fibrotic growth factors. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Increase in influx of non-inflammatory macrophages with a decrease in influx and accumulation of inflammatory cells and pro-fibrotic myofibroblasts. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Increase in bacterial clearance. SPMs stimulate production of bactericidal peptides, enhance phagocytosis and killing of bacteria by neutrophils and macrophages. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Increase in apoptosis of inflammatory cells, including neutrophil and pro-fibrotic cells, including fibroblasts. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Increase in clearance of apoptotic cells and cellular debris by non-inflammatory macrophages. 

Resunab potentially offers a new and unique mechanism to treat a spectrum of rare, chronic, serious inflammatory and fibrotic diseases.

&#160;

Safety &#38; Toxicology 

To date, Resunab has undergone an extensive battery of animal safety and toxicology studies in support of Phase II clinical development. Unlike other CB2 agonists, Resunab exhibits limited blood brain barrier penetration (30%) and negligible CB1 activity in vivo (12.1 binding affinity to CB2 vs. CB1) resulting in limited central nervous system side effects. Results of the safety pharmacology studies in animals assessing the central nervous system, cardiovascular and respiratory systems, renal system and gastrointestinal system were all negative and support that there should be a significant safety margin at anticipated therapeutics doses of Resunab in patients.

Animal toxicological profiles of orally administered Resunab in single and multi-dose studies in mice, rats, and dogs, and a battery of in vitro and in vivo genetic toxicity studies, have been conducted, including a chronic rat toxicology that was requested by the FDA and successfully completed. The results of these studies showed no major toxicological concerns and an excellent safety margin based on drug exposure levels in animals compared to human exposure. In support of Phase II clinical trials, thirteen-week Good Laboratory Practice (&#8220;GLP&#8221;) toxicology studies have been completed in rats and dogs. Based on the results of these studies and prior clinical trials, the safety margin in humans is estimated to be between 8 and 32 times greater than the doses in our clinical trials.

Pre-clinical Results

In pre-clinical studies, with both prophylactic and therapeutic administration, Resunab has demonstrated clear efficacy at resolving inflammation. Inflammation was induced in animal pharmacology models by a variety of stimuli that trigger acute innate immune responses or mimic established inflammation: arachidonic acid, zymosin, platelet activating factor, IL-1&#946; and TNF&#945;, Freund&#8217;s complete adjuvant, and bleomycin. At the histological level, Resunab suppressed inflammation in all of these disease models in which it was studied. At the cellular level, Resunab reduced the numbers of inflammatory cells in the tissue, especially neutrophils. Resunab also induced non-inflammatory death, or apoptosis, of activated T cells. At the molecular level, Resunab stimulated the production of the SPM lipoxin A4 and the anti-inflammatory eicosanoid prostaglandin J2, while reducing production of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids leukotriene B4 and prostaglandin E2. Resunab reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF&#945;, IL-1&#946;, and type 1 interferons. 

Resunab also demonstrated clear efficacy at stopping fibrotic processes in pre-clinical studies, with both prophylactic and therapeutic administration. Fibrosis was induced in joints by Freund&#8217;s complete adjuvant, in skin by bleomycin and TGF&#946; receptor 1 activation, and in lungs by bleomycin. At the histological level, Resunab inhibited the development or progression of fibrosis in each model, with reduced joint ankylisis, skin thickness, and lung fibrosis. For example, at a low dose of 0.1 mg/kg three days a week, Resunab significantly inhibited joint ankylosis (fibrosis) in adjuvant-induced arthritis. At a cellular level, myofibroblast accumulation was reduced (along with inflammatory cell infiltration). At the molecular level, Resunab reduced cellular activation through Erg-1, reduced expression of the pro-fibrotic growth factors TGF-&#946; and connective tissue growth factor, and reduced production of hydroxyproline and collagen. 

Collectively, we believe this data supports the development of Resunab as a potent and novel drug to resolve inflammation and halt fibrosis with the potential to treat some of the key manifestations of the indications we are pursuing. 

Effect of Resunab in CF Mouse Model

Since patients with CF not only have inflammation, but they are also chronically colonized with bacteria, pre-clinical studies were conducted by Case Western Reserve University to evaluate Resunab&#8217;s overall impact on Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization. Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection was impregnated into wildtype mice (control group) and CFTR-deficient mice in which the CFTR gene was knocked out. Each group then received treatments with Resunab escalating doses 24 hours post infection over a ten day period. At day 10, animals were euthanized and evaluated for bacteria load (colony forming units or &#8220;CFUs&#8221;), total and differential bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) white blood cell counts (WBCs). The results of the study demonstrated that in the CFTR-deficient mice group, Resunab improved survival, decreased weight loss, reduced the numbers of neutrophils and white blood cells in the lung and improved the ability of animals to resolve pulmonary infection as assessed by lung bacterial CFUs, compared to control treatment (see Figures 4 &#38; 5 below).

&#160;

Effect of Resunab in Fibrotic Disease Animal Models

The efficacy of Resunab was investigated in three mouse models of scleroderma. Oral administration of Resunab once-a-day at 1 mg/kg/day inhibited dermal fibrosis in the three models as measured by reductions in dermal thickness, markers of collagen production, and myofibroblast abundance (cells that produce collagen). Histopathologic evaluation revealed that Resunab inhibited the fibrosis of the skin tissue in each of these models. In addition, oral administration of Resunab was effective at inhibiting lung fibrosis in a bleomycin-induced mouse model of systemic sclerosis (Figure 6). Collectively, we believe this data supports the development of Resunab as a potent and novel anti-fibrotic/anti-inflammatory drug with the potential to treat some of the key manifestations of human scleroderma.

&#160;

Figure 6: Resunab inhibits skin thickening in bleomycin-induced model of fibrosis in systemic sclerosis 

&#160;

To translate these in vivo effects of Resunab on fibrosis in animal models to humans, we determined the anti-fibrotic effects of Resunab on dermal fibroblasts isolated from diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis patients. Dermal fibroblasts from systemic sclerosis patients overproduce extracellular matrix proteins like collagen and the pro-fibrotic cytokine TGF- &#946;. Further supporting its anti-fibrotic activity, Resunab inhibited new collagen synthesis, reduced TGF-&#946; and increased anti-inflammatory (resolving) eicosanoid levels in this ex-vivo model of human systemic sclerosis. These responses were statistically significant with a p&#60;0.001 as determined using the Student-Newmen Keuls post-hoc test for multiple comparisons. TGF-&#946; has been identified in published scientific literature to be an important cytokine in promoting inflammation and fibrosis in multiple diseases and conditions including systemic sclerosis and cystic fibrosis. While no pre-clinical model is entirely predictive of clinical efficacy, the results from these pre-clinical studies provide a credible rationale for further clinical development.

Human Clinical Results to Date

Two Phase 1 and one Phase 2 clinical trials have been conducted by prior licensees Atlantic Pharmaceuticals and Indevus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. who were developing Resunab as an analgesia therapy (pain relief) rather than an anti-inflammatory therapy. Based on their review of the preclinical and clinical data in pain relief, Indevus Pharmaceuticals elected not to continue with further clinical trials and its license rights were terminated in December 2008. Upon termination, the rights reverted back to Dr. Sumner Burstein who then assigned the rights to us in April 2009.

The first Phase 1 study evaluated the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of Resunab in healthy adult male subjects over a dose range from 1 mg to 10 mg, in 4 dose groups of 8 subjects each. Resunab had satisfactory oral bioavailability, was well tolerated, and exhibited linear pharmacokinetics over the dose range tested. There were no life-threatening or serious adverse events in this study. Two subjects in the 3 mg group and one subject in the 6 mg group out of a total of twenty-four subjects reported adverse events of mild to moderate intensity. None of the remaining subjects in the 3 mg and 6 mg groups and no subjects in the 1 mg, 10 mg and placebo groups experienced any adverse events. The two subjects in the 3 mg group reported blurred vision, difficulty in remembering, mild euphoria, impression of slower movements, dry mouth and difficulty in concentrating. The one subject in the 6 mg group reported orthostatic vagal fainting, feeling dizzy, and nausea immediately after the first blood draw, which occurred prior to the administration of the drug.

The second Phase 1 study evaluated the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single and multiple ascending doses of Resunab at higher doses. Each dose level had 8 subjects randomized at a ratio of 6 receiving Resunab and 2 receiving placebo. Doses ranged from 10 to 240 mg single dose, and 20, 40 and 80 mg three times a day, or tid, for 7 days multi-dose. Resunab showed good tolerability at single doses up to 120 mg and multiple doses up to 40 mg three times a day for 7 days. For the single dose treatment stage, the most frequently occurring treatment&#8211;emergent adverse events, or TEAEs, occurring in &#62; 10% of all subjects treated with Resunab, in decreasing order of frequency, were: dizziness (15 out of 48), nausea (10 out of 48), vomiting (7 out of 48), pallor (6 out of 48), dry mouth (5 out of 48), headache (5 out of 48), somnolence (5 out of 48), tremor (5 out of 48), and disorientation (5 out of 48). All TEAEs were mild to moderate and the majority of these events occurred in subjects treated at dose levels of 120 mg and above. For the multiple dose stage, there were no TEAEs at 20 mg tid while in the 40 and 80 mg tid dose groups the most frequently occurring TEAEs, occurring in &#62; 10% of all subjects treated with Resunab, were at the 40 and 80 mg tid dose respectively: dizziness (4 out of 6 and 3 out of 6), nausea (2 out of 6 and 1 out of 6), somnolence (2 out of 6 and 1 out of 6), dry mouth (1 out of 6 and 1 out of 6), fatigue (0 out of 6 and 2 out of 6), feeling abnormal (0 out of 6 and 2 out of 6), anorexia (0 out of 6 and 2 out of 6), 

&#160;

inappropriate affect (0 out of 6 and 2 out of 6), and orthostatic hypotension (0 out of 6 and 2 out of 6). The majority of these events were mild and occurred in subjects treated at the highest dose level of approximately 80 mg three times a day, for 7 days (i.e., subjects treated with 80 mg tid were reduced to 60 mg tid starting with the second dose on Day 2 continuing through Day 7). In some elderly patients over 65 years of age, changes in electrocardiogram readings were noted; howe ver no differences in readings were observed between subjects treated with Resunab versus and placebo thus this was not deemed to be of clinical relevance. Resunab exhibited linear pharmacokinetics over the dose range tested. 

A Phase 2 crossover design study was conducted for Resunab in refractory neuropathic pain patients, or NP. In this study, 21 NP patients were treated with either Resunab or placebo at a dose of 20 and 40 mg twice a day (8 hours apart) for 1 week followed by a 1 week washout and a cross over. Resunab reduced the 3 hour pain index by up to 28% (p&#60;0.03) in one cohort, and was effective at reducing pain by &#62;30% in 50% of this same cohort (P&#60;0.03) of refractory pain patients although its analgesic effect wore off between 3-8 hours post-dose. Resunab was well tolerated and there were no safety issues of note in this study.

While Resunab showed a clear analgesic signal in this phase 2 study in refractory neuropathic pain patients, we are not relying on these efficacy results to support our clinical program as this study was designed to measure pain while our future studies will have a completely different efficacy endpoint.

Clinical Development Plan 

Overview 

We are currently conducting Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in cystic fibrosis, systemic sclerosis, and dermatomyositis. These studies are evaluating the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of Resunab in patients, during 84 days of active treatment. Proof of CB2-mediated biologic activity is being tested with metabolipidomic profiles, testing for shift in production of bioactive lipid mediators to SPMs and away from inflammation-activating lipid mediators. Evidence of downstream effects of Resunab on relevant pathologic processes is being evaluated using biomarkers of inflammation and disease activity in blood and involved tissues. In addition we plan to commence a clinical study during the first quarter of 2017 in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, or SLE.

Upon obtaining adequate safety, efficacy, and mechanistic data to support selection of outcome, dose, and sample size in pivotal clinical studies in a given indication, we plan to conduct pivotal, global clinical trial(s) in cystic fibrosis, systemic sclerosis, and/or dermatomyositis. We will seek input and concordance from regulatory authorities on the design of these pivotal studies. 

We have obtained Orphan Drug Designations and Fast Track status for both CF and systemic sclerosis. Fast Track designation is eligible for some or all of the following: (i) more frequent meetings with FDA to discuss the drug&#8217;s development plan and ensure collection of appropriate data needed to support drug approval; (ii) more frequent written correspondence from FDA about things such as the design of the proposed clinical trial and the use of biomarkers; and (iii) eligibility for Accelerated Approval and Priority Review, if relevant criteria are met. 

Cystic Fibrosis 

In September 2015, we initiated a Phase 2 study in Resunab in patients suffering from CF. The study is a multi-center U.S. and European trial. The lead Principal Investigator in the U.S. is Dr. James Chmiel of the Rainbow Babies &#38; Children&#8217;s Hospital, Cleveland, Ohio and the Co-Investigator in Europe is Dr. Stuart Elborn of Queens University Hospital, Belfast, Ireland.

The primary objective of the CF study is to evaluate safety and tolerability of Resunab in seventy adults with cystic fibrosis. Secondary objectives are to assess Resunab concentrations and to evaluate efficacy of Resunab in cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis patients in the study are between 18-70 years of age with forced expiratory volume in one second &#8805; 40% predicted. Subjects are permitted to remain on their baseline medications for cystic fibrosis and do not need to have a specific mutation of the CFTR. The trial has screening period of 28 days, followed by 112 days of active treatment, and then 28 days safety follow-up. Resunab is being evaluated at initial dosing levels of 1 mg and 5 mg per day for the first 28 days, and then 20 mg once a day and 20 mg twice a day for the next 56 days, versus placebo. Patients are being monitored for safety and tolerability throughout the study. Safety will be assessed with physical examinations, adverse effects, laboratory safety testing, electrocardiograms and testing of psychoactivity. Other assessments will include Resunab concentrations and metabolites measurements of lung function, patient-reported outcomes, and biomarkers of inflammation in the blood and sputum, and metabolipidomic profiles. The Company expects to complete the study and report data by the end of 2016.

&#160;

Systemic Sclerosis (Scleroderma) 

In August 2015, we initiated a Phase 2 double-blind placebo-controlled clinical study in patients suffering from diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis. The study is a U.S. multi-center trial. The Principal Investigator is Dr. Robert Spiera of the Hospital of Special Surgery, New York City, New York. 

Patients in the systemic sclerosis trial have disease duration less than six years and are permitted to remain on their baseline mediations. Resunab is being evaluated at three dosing levels - 5 mg, 20 mg once a day, and 20 mg twice a day - versus placebo. The trial has a 28 day screening period, followed by 112 days of active treatment period and then a 28 day safety follow-up. The primary goals of this trial are to evaluate safety and explore efficacy of Resunab in thirty six patients with diffuse systemic sclerosis. Patients are being monitored for safety and tolerability throughout the study. Safety is being assessed with physical examinations, adverse effects, laboratory safety testing, electrocardiograms and testing of psychoactivity. Efficacy is being assessed using the Combined Response Index in diffuse cutaneous Systemic Sclerosis and its domains that measure skin thickening, lung function, physician and patient global assessments of general health, and disability. Secondary endpoint measurements include Resunab concentrations and metabolites, other patient-reported outcomes, biomarkers of inflammation and fibrosis in the blood and skin, and metabolipidomic profiles. We expect to complete the study and report data by the end of 2016. 

Dermatomyositis

In June 2015, we initiated a Phase 2 double-blind placebo-controlled clinical study evaluating Resunab in patients with skin-predominant dermatomyositis. The study is a U.S. single center trial and is being funded by a N.IH grant. The Principal Investigator is Dr. Victoria Werth of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA. 

Patients in the dermatomyositis study have active skin involvement, relatively inactive muscle disease, and are permitted to remain on their baseline mediations. Resunab is being evaluated at two dosing levels - 20 mg once a day and 20 mg twice a day - versus placebo. The trial design has a 28 day screening period, followed by 112 days treatment period and a 28 day safety follow-up. The primary goals of this trial are to evaluate safety and efficacy of Resunab in 22 patients with skin-predominant dermatomyositis. Patients are being monitored for safety and tolerability throughout the study. Safety is being assessed with physical examinations, adverse effects, laboratory safety testing, electrocardiograms and testing of psychoactivity. Efficacy is being assessed using the Cutaneous Dermatomyositis Disease Area and Severity Index. Secondary endpoint measurements include Resunab concentrations, other patient-reported outcomes, biomarkers of inflammation and disease activity in the blood and skin, and metabolipidomic profiles. Data from this single center study is expected Q1 2017.

Systemic Lupus Erythematosus

We plan to commence a Phase 2 double blind placebo-controlled study evaluating Resunab in the treatment of SLE in the first quarter of 2017. The study is being funded by an NIH Grant to the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research and will test the efficacy, safety, tolerability and biologic effects of Resunab as a novel, non-immunosuppressive oral treatment to improve signs and symptoms of SLE. The study plans to enroll about 100 adult SLE patients with active musculoskeletal disease and will be carried out at approximately 10 sites in the United States. These patients will receive either placebo or three different doses of Resunab daily for 84 days with 28 days follow-up.

Competition 

There are numerous drug therapies currently used to treat CF patients, targeting different aspects of this complex disease. Inhaled and oral antibiotics address the pulmonary microbial infection. Mucolytics address the accumulation of mucus in the lungs. Bronchodilators and hydration agents are also used to help improve pulmonary function. Targeting of the inflammatory component of the disease is currently done by high dose Ibuprofen and oral corticosteroids. While these offer some clinical benefit, they are not used chronically due to their adverse side effects which include immunosuppression and metabolic changes (steroids) as well as the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (ibuprofen). Thus, there is a clear and urgent unmet medical need for safe and effective inflammation-targeting drugs for the chronic treatment of CF that could potentially have a beneficial impact on morbidity and mortality.

An emerging area of CF therapy is the development of correctors and potentiators of CFTR. In January 2012, Vertex launched Kalydeco&#8482;, or ivacaftor, the first ever cystic fibrosis drug specifically targeting the underlying genetic defect in the CFTR ion channel. Kalydeco is a small synthetic oral molecule that helps potentiate the function of the G551D mutant CFTR protein, resulting in improved forced expiratory volume in one second (a measure of obstruction of airflow in the lungs) by approximately 10% in cystic fibrosis patients. With at least 1,800 different known mutations in the CFTR gene, Kalydeco can only be used by a specific sub-section of the cystic fibrosis population (ages 2 and above) who suffer from a limited number of &#8220;gating mutations,&#8221; including the G551D mutation. Combined, these currently account for about 5.7% of the total cystic fibrosis worldwide patient population or about 4,000 individuals.

&#160;

A new combination drug from Vertex, Orkambi&#8482; (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) combination treatment targets a larger population of homozygote &#916;F508 CFTR mutation patients. Orkambi was approved by the FDA on July 2, 2015. In clinical studies, the lung function of pat ients taking Orkambi improved by a range of 2.6 percentage points to 3 percentage points, compared with that of patients receiving placebo . &#160; Initially, Orkambi will target the approximately 8,500 homozygotic patients carrying two copies of the &#916;F508 mutati on, but further approval may be sought for heterozygotic patients (one copy of the &#916;F508 and another copy of a different CFTR mutation). Together these two patient populations are estimated to be about 70% of cystic fibrosis patients. 

Several other companies are developing drugs for CF targeting CFTR either as a protein or mRNA transcript. These are highlighted in the table below:

For autoimmune disorders such as systemic sclerosis, dermatomyositis and SLE, physicians treat patients with a number of drugs including potent immunosuppressants and cytotoxics to try to reduce the autoimmune response characteristic of the disease. These drugs have not proven to be very effective thus there remains a high unmet need for safe and effective drugs to treat these autoimmune disorders. Several companies, including Roche, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol Myers, Sanofi, Promedior and Digna Biotech, are actively working to develop new drugs for treating the inflammation and/or fibrosis in systemic sclerosis. To the best of our knowledge, Resunab offers a unique mode of action to treat systemic sclerosis being one of the few oral drugs with the potential to resolve inflammation and halt fibrosis without immunosuppression. 

Research and Development 

We incurred expenses of approximately $5,889,000 and $1,256,000 for research and development activities for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These expenses include cash and non-cash expenses relating to the development of our clinical and pre-clinical programs for Resunab.

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

Our intellectual property and product pipeline is based on seminal research done by Professor Sumner Burstein, Ph.D. at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center and patents filed by Corbus directly. Upon Corbus&#8217; formation, Dr. Burstein assigned to Corbus his rights and intellectual property ownership to Resunab on a royalty-free basis in consideration for 200,000 shares of Series A Non-Convertible preferred stock. The intellectual property includes scientific data and regulatory data, product know-how and one patent issued in January 2014 and expiring in November 2029 for the use of Resunab to treat interstitial cystitis, an indication for which we are currently pursuing partnership opportunities. 

Since acquiring the asset, we have filed three new patent applications for Resunab, which if granted, would extend intellectual property protection through at least 2033. The three new patent filings cover: 

&#160;

&#183; 

A composition of matter claim based on an improved ultrapure version of Resunab; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Resunab&#8217;s use in treating a number of pulmonary fibrotic diseases including cystic fibrosis, systemic sclerosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; and others 

&#160;

&#183; 

Specific Resunab dosing regimens and formulations. 

T he FDA has granted Resunab an Orphan Drug Designation for both cystic fibrosis and systemic sclerosis and we will be seeking orphan drug status for these indications in Europe. For dermatomyositis and possibly other orphan inflammatory diseases we will be seeking orphan drug status from the FDA and in Europe. Orphan drug status provides seven years of market exclusivity in the U.S. and ten years in Europe beginning on the date of drug approval.

Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for Resunab and to operate without infringing the proprietary right of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We strive to protect our intellectual property through a combination of patents, and trademarks as well as through the confidentiality provisions in our contracts. With respect to Resunab, we endeavor to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and internationally on all patentable aspects of the drug. We cannot be sure that the patents will be granted with respect to any patent applications we may own or license in the future, nor can we be sure that our existing patents or any patents we may own or license in the future will be useful in protecting our technology. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our intellectual property, please see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Relating to Our Intellectual Property Rights.&#8221; 

In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. For example, significant aspects of our proprietary technology platform are based on unpatented trade secrets and know-how. Trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and commercial partners. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. 

We also plan to seek trademark protection in the United States and outside of the United States where available and when appropriate. We intend to use these registered marks in connection with our pharmaceutical research and development as well as our product candidates. 

Manufacturing and Supply for Resunab 

We have developed and validated a good manufacturing practice, or GMP, process to manufacture Resunab API and drug product through our contract manufacturers. The API contract manufacturer has already produced multi-Kg scale bulk batches of the active pharmaceutical ingredient under GMP for our Phase 2 clinical studies and is capable of producing sufficient active ingredient for all the clinical studies required prior to submitting an NDA filing with the FDA. We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of Resunab. We expect to depend on third-party suppliers and manufacturing organizations for all of our clinical trial quantities of raw materials and drug substance. Resunab is a synthetic molecule and there are readily available supplies of all raw materials needed for the manufacture of Resunab. 

&#160;

Regulatory Matters 

Government Regulation 

Any product development activities related to Resunab or products that we may develop or acquire in the future will be subject to extensive regulation by various government authorities, including the FDA and other federal, state and local statutes and regulations and comparable regulatory authorities in other countries, which regulate the design, research, clinical and non-clinical development, testing, manufacturing, storage, distribution, import, export, labeling, advertising and marketing of pharmaceutical products and devices. Generally, before a new drug can be sold, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific to each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority. The data are often generated in two distinct development states: pre-clinical and clinical. Resunab or other products that we may develop or acquire in the future must be approved by the FDA through the IND process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. For new chemical entities, the pre-clinical development stage generally involves synthesizing the active component, developing the formulation and determining the manufacturing process, as well as carrying out non-human toxicology, pharmacology and drug metabolism studies which support subsequent clinical testing. 

The clinical stage of development can generally be divided into three sequential phases that may overlap, Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials. In Phase 1, generally, small numbers of healthy volunteers are initially exposed to single escalating doses and then multiple escalating doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these studies is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the drug. Phase 2 trials typically involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits, while Phase 2b trials are designed to determine efficacy. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected. In some instances, formal Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials may not be deemed necessary or required by the FDA. Such is often the case when the safety and efficacy of an active ingredient is considered to be well understood by the FDA. Under established regulatory frameworks, pharmaceutical products with active ingredients equal or similar to those known by the FDA often enter more streamlined development programs than compounds entirely new to the agency. 

Post-approval studies, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. Sometimes, these studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic condition, then often referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 studies. In other situations, post-approval studies aim to gain additional indications for a medication.. 

Development of Drugs in the United States 

In the United States, the process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA&#8217;s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 

Prior to the start of human clinical studies for a new drug in the United States, pre-clinical laboratory and animal tests are often performed under the FDA&#8217;s Good Laboratory Practices regulations. The sponsor must submit the result of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol to the FDA as part of an IND application, which is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug or biological product to humans. Similar filings are required in other countries. The amount of data that must be supplied in the IND depends on the phase of the study. Phase 1 studies typically require less data than larger Phase 2 and 3 studies. A clinical plan must be submitted to the FDA prior to commencement of a clinical trial. If the FDA has concerns about the clinical plan or the safety of the proposed studies, they may suspend or terminate the study at any time. Studies must be conducted in accordance with good clinical practice and regulator reporting of study progress and any adverse experiences is required. Studies are also subject to review by independent institutional review boards responsible for overseeing studies at particular sites and protecting human research study subjects. An independent institutional review board may also suspend or terminate a study once initiated. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that once begun, issues will not arise that could cause the trial to be suspended or terminated. 

Review and Approval in the United States 

Following pivotal or Phase 3 trial completion, data are analyzed to determine safety and efficacy. Data are then filed with the FDA in a New Drug Application, or an NDA, along with proposed labeling for the product and information about the manufacturing 

&#160;

and te sting processes and facilities that will be used to ensure product quality. In the United States, FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before marketing a pharmaceutical product. The NDA must contain proof of safety, purity, potency and efficacy, which e ntails extensive pre-clinical and clinical testing. 

The FDA will likely re-analyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and us during the review process. The review and evaluation of applications by the FDA is extensive and time consuming and may take several years to complete. The FDA may conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with current good manufacturing practice requirements and may also audit data from clinical and pre-clinical trials. 

There is no assurance that the FDA will act favorably or quickly in making such reviews and significant difficulties or costs may be encountered in our efforts to obtain FDA approvals. The FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be including in the product labeling, or may condition the approval of the NDA on other changes to the proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct post-marketing testing or clinical trials and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. Further, the FDA may place conditions on approvals including the requirement for a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals maybe withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur, following the initial marketing of the product.

Orphan Drug Designation 

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug available in the Unites States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of regulatory review and approval process. In addition to the potential period of exclusivity, orphan designation makes a company eligible for grant funding of up to $400,000 per year for four years to defray costs of clinical trial expenses, tax credits for clinical research expenses and potential exemption from the FDA application user fee. 

If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as (i) the drug&#8217;s orphan designation is revoked; (ii) its marketing approval is withdrawn; (iii) the orphan exclusivity holder consents to the approval of another applicant&#8217;s product; (iv) the orphan exclusivity holder is unable to assure the availability of a sufficient quantity of drug; or (v) a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by a competitor product. If a drug designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. There can be no assurance that we will receive orphan drug designation for Resunab in the indications of cystic fibrosis, systemic sclerosis, or other orphan inflammatory diseases. 

Drug Development in Europe 

In the European Union, our future products may also be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. Similar to the United States, the marketing of medicinal products has been subject to the granting of marketing authorizations by regulatory agencies. Particular emphasis is also being placed on more sophisticated and faster procedures for reporting of adverse events to the competent authorities. 

As in the United States, the various phases of pre-clinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the regulatory controls on clinical research are currently undergoing a harmonization process following the adoption of the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, there are currently significant variations in the member state regimes. All member states, however, currently require independent institutional review board approval of interventional clinical trials. Except for the United Kingdom Phase 1 studies in health volunteers, all clinical trials require either prior governmental notification or approval. Most regulators also require the submission of adverse event reports during a study and a copy of the final study report. 

&#160;

Review and Approval in the European Union 

In the European Union, approval of new medicinal products can be obtained through one of three processes: the mutual recognition procedure, the centralized procedure and the decentralized procedure. We intend to determine which process we will follow, if any, in the future. 

Mutual Recognition Procedure : An applicant submits an application in one European Union member state, known as the reference member state. Once the reference member state has granted the marketing authorization, the applicant may choose to submit applications in other concerned member states, requesting them to mutually recognize the marketing authorizations already granted. Under this mutual recognition process, authorities in other concerned member states have 55 days to raise objections, which must then be resolved by discussion among the concerned member states, the reference member state and the applicant within 90 days of the commencement of the mutual recognition procedure. If any disagreement remains, all considerations by authorities in the concerned member states are suspended and the disagreement is resolved through an arbitration process. The mutual recognition procedure results in separate national marketing authorizations in the reference member state. 

Centralized Procedure : This procedure is currently mandatory for products developed by means of a biotechnological process and optional for new active substances and other &#8220;innovative medicinal products with novel characteristics.&#8221; Under this procedure, an application is submitted to the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medical Products. Two European Union member states are appointed to conduct an initial evaluation of each application. These countries each prepare an assessment report that is then used as the basis of a scientific opinion of the Committee on Proprietary Medical Products. If this opinion is favorable, it is sent to the European Commission, which drafts a decision. After consulting with the member states, the European Commission adopts a decision and grants a marketing authorization, which is valid throughout the European Union and confers the same rights and obligations in each of the member states as a marketing authorization granted by that member state. 

Decentralized Procedure : The most recently introduced of the three processes for obtaining approval of new medicinal processes in the European Union, the decentralized procedure is similar to the mutual recognition procedure described above, but with differences in the timing that key documents are provided to concerned member states by the reference member state, the overall timing of the procedure and the possibility of, among other things, &#8220;clock stops&#8221; during the procedure. 

Post-Marketing Requirements 

Following approval of a new product, a pharmaceutical company and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA and other federal and state regulatory authorities, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting to applicable regulatory authorities of adverse experiences with the product, providing the regulatory authorities with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations not described in the drug&#8217;s approved labeling (known as &#8220;off-label use&#8221;), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. Modifications or enhancements to the products or labeling or changes of site of manufacture are often subject to the approval of the FDA and other regulators, which may or may not be received or may result in a lengthy review process. 

Prescription drug advertising is subject to federal, state and foreign regulations. In the United States, the FDA regulates prescription drug promotion, including direct-to-consumer advertising. Prescription drug promotion materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Any distribution of prescription drug products and pharmaceutical samples must comply with the U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act, a part of the U.S. Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Once a product is approved, its manufacture is subject to comprehensive and continuing regulations by the FDA. The FDA regulations require the products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with current good manufacturing practices, and NDA holders must list their products and register their manufacturing establishments with the FDA. These regulations also impose certain organizational, procedural and documentation requirements with respect to manufacturing and quality assurance activities. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with current good manufacturing practice and other laws. NDA holders using contract manufacturers, laboratories or packagers are responsible for the selection and monitoring of qualified firms. These firms are subject to inspections by the FDA at any time, and the discovery of violative conditions could result in enforcement actions that interrupt the operation of any such facilities or the ability to distribute products manufactured, processed or tested by them. 

Special Protocol Assessment 

The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act directs the FDA to meet with sponsors, pursuant to a sponsor&#8217;s written request, for the purpose of reaching agreement on the design and size of clinical trials intended to form the primary basis of an efficacy claim in an 

&#160;

NDA. If an agreement is reached, the FDA will reduce the agreement to writ ing and make it part of the administrative record. This agreement is called a special protocol assessment, or SPA. While the FDA&#8217;s guidance on SPAs states that documented SPAs should be considered binding on the review division, the FDA has latitude to cha nge its assessment if certain exceptions apply. Exceptions include public health concerns emerging that were unrecognized at the time of the protocol assessment, identification of a substantial scientific issue essential to the safety or efficacy testing t hat later comes to light, a sponsor&#8217;s failure to follow the protocol agreed upon, or the FDA&#8217;s reliance on data, assumptions or information that are determined to be wrong. 

Other Regulatory Matters 

Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in addition to the FDA, including, in the United States, the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety &#38; Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and state and local governments. Sales, marketing and scientific/educational programs must also comply with federal and state fraud and abuse laws. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. The handling of any controlled substances must comply with the U.S. Controlled Substances Act and Controlled Substances Import and Export Act. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair completion laws. 

In the United States, our product candidate, Resunab, is currently classified as Schedule I controlled substance as defined in the Controlled Substance Act (&#8220;CSA&#8221;). This designation is based on Resunab&#8217;s chemical structure and pharmacology (namely, it being a synthetic endocannabinoid mimetic that binds to the CB2 receptor). Even though Resunab&#8217; s mechanism of action is to modulate the immune system and results to date from clinical studies have demonstrated the drug has no psychotropic effects (which we believe is unlike other members of its chemical class), the DEA classifies Resunab as a Schedule I substance.

Schedule I controlled substances are pharmaceutical products subject to specific regulations under the CSA, that establishes, among other things, certain registration, manufacturing quotas, security, recordkeeping, reporting, import, export and other requirements administered by the DEA. All parties responsible for the manufacturing, distribution and testing the drug in clinical studies must apply for and obtain a license from the DEA before they are permitted to perform these activities with Resunab. Furthermore, these parties must have the security, control, recordkeeping, reporting and inventory mechanisms required by the DEA to prevent drug loss and diversion. All licensed facilities are required to renew their registrations annually if they intend to continue to work with our drug. The DEA conducts periodic inspections of certain registered establishments that handle controlled substances. We have been working with our manufacturers, distributors, exporters and clinical sites to obtain the necessary licenses to work with Resunab. The parties responsible for the manufacturing, distribution and export of Resunab have already applied for and have been granted DEA licenses and a number of institutions responsible for conducting our Phase 2 clinical studies have also been granted DEA licenses

Individual states have also established controlled substance laws and regulations. Though state-controlled substances laws often mirror federal law, because the states are separate jurisdictions, they may separately schedule drugs, as well. While some states automatically schedule a drug based on federal action, other states schedule drugs through rulemaking or a legislative action. The requirement for state registrations could also result in delay of the manufacturing, distribution of Resunab or in the completion of the Phase 2 clinical studies. We and our manufacturing vendors and clinical sites must also obtain separate state registrations, permits or licenses in order to be able to obtain, handle, and distribute controlled substances for clinical trials or commercial sale, and failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements could lead to enforcement and sanctions by the states in addition to those from the DEA or otherwise arising under federal law.

The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products. 

Third-Party Payer Coverage and Reimbursement 

Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any of our drug candidates that ultimately may obtain regulatory approval. In both the United States and foreign markets, our ability to commercialize our product candidates successfully, and to attract commercialization partners for our product candidates, depends in significant part on the availability of adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including, in the United States, governmental payers such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, managed care organizations, and private health insurers. Medicare is a federally funded program managed by the CMS, through local fiscal intermediaries and carriers that administer coverage and reimbursement for certain healthcare items and services furnished to the elderly and disabled. Medicaid is an insurance program for certain categories of patients 

&#160;

whose income and assets fall below state defined levels and who are otherwise uninsured that is both federally and state funded and managed by each state. The federal government sets general guidelines f or Medicaid and each state creates specific regulations that govern its individual program. Each payer has its own process and standards for determining whether it will cover and reimburse a procedure or particular product. Private payers often rely on the lead of the governmental payers in rendering coverage and reimbursement determinations. Therefore, achieving favorable CMS coverage and reimbursement is usually a significant gating issue for successful introduction of a new product. The competitive posit ion of some of our products will depend, in part, upon the extent of coverage and adequate reimbursement for such products and for the procedures in which such products are used. Prices at which we or our customers seek reimbursement for our product candid ates can be subject to challenge, reduction or denial by the government and other payers. 

The United States Congress and state legislatures may, from time to time, propose and adopt initiatives aimed at cost containment, which could impact our ability to sell our product candidates profitably. For example, in March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the associated reconciliation bill, which we refer to collectively as the Health Care Reform Law, a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Effective October 1, 2010, the Health Care Reform Law revised the definition of &#8220;average manufacturer price&#8221; for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates to states once the provision is effective. Further, the law imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may require us to modify our business practices with healthcare practitioners. We will not know the full effects of the Health Care Reform Law until applicable federal and state agencies issue regulations or guidance under the new law. Although it is too early to determine the effect of the Health Care Reform Law, the new law appears likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. Moreover, in the coming years, additional changes could be made to governmental healthcare programs that could significantly impact the success of our product candidates. 

The cost of pharmaceuticals continues to generate substantial governmental and third-party payer interest. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations and additional legislative proposals. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by current and future healthcare reforms.

Some third-party payers also require pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative devices or drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers that use such therapies. While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost-containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, the announcement or adoption of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for our product candidates and operate profitably. 

In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to be significantly lower.

&#160;

Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 

In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the CMS, other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the United States Department of Justice and individual United States Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. These regulations include: 

&#160;

&#183; 

the federal healthcare program anti-kickback law which prohibits, among other things, persons from soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; 

&#160;

&#183; 

federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other government reimbursement programs that are false or fraudulent. The government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal healthcare program anti-kickback law or related to off-label promotion constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal false claims laws; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 which prohibits executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters and which also imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the federal transparency requirements under the Health Care Reform Law requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to physician payments and other transfers of value and physician ownership and investment interests; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the ACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third party payer, including commercial insurers, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by federal laws, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA&#8217;s privacy and security standards directly applicable to &#8220;business associates&#8221;&#8212;independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys&#8217; fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

Post-Marketing Regulations 

Following approval of a new product, a pharmaceutical company and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA and other federal and state regulatory authorities, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting to applicable regulatory authorities of adverse experiences with the product, providing the regulatory authorities with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations not described in the drug&#8217;s approved labeling (known as &#8220;off-label use&#8221;), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. Modifications or enhancements to the products or labeling or changes of site of manufacture are often subject to the approval of the FDA and other regulators, which may or may not be received or may result in a lengthy review process. 

&#160;

Employees 

We have 12 full time employees. All of our employees are engaged in administration, finance, clinical, manufacturing, regulatory and business development functions. We believe our relations with our employees are good. We anticipate that the number of employees will grow as we continue to develop our product candidates. In addition, we utilize and will continue to utilize consultants, clinical research organizations and third parties to perform our pre-clinical studies, clinical studies, manufacturing and regulatory functions. 

Emerging Growth Company 

We are an &#8220;emerging growth company,&#8221; as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) January 1, 2020, (2) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (3) the date on which we become a &#8220;large accelerated filer&#8221; as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (4) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period.

For as long as we remain an &#8220;emerging growth company,&#8221; we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not &#8220;emerging growth companies&#8221; including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation and financial statements in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote to approve executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We are choosing to &#8220;opt out&#8221; of the extended transition periods available under the JOBS Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards, and intend to take advantage of the other reporting exemptions until we are no longer an &#8220;emerging growth company.&#8221;
