BUSINESS 

GENERAL 

We are a global nutrition company founded in 1980 that develops and sells weight management, healthy meals and snacks, sports and fitness, energy and targeted nutritional products as well as personal care products. As of December 31, 2015, we sold our products in 93 countries. We believe the enhanced consumer awareness and the demand for our products due to the global obesity epidemic coupled with the effectiveness of network marketing have been the primary reasons for our success throughout our 36-year operating history. 

We believe that direct-selling is ideally suited to marketing our products because sales of weight management, targeted nutrition, energy, sports &#38; fitness, and outer nutrition products are strengthened by ongoing personal contact and support, coaching and education between Members and their customers towards a healthy and active lifestyle. 

PRODUCT OVERVIEW 

For 36 years, our science-based products have helped Members and their customers from around the world lose weight, improve their health and experience life-changing results. As of December 31, 2015, for the product categories weight management, targeted nutrition, energy, sports &#38; fitness, and outer nutrition, we marketed and sold over 140 products encompassing over 5,000 SKUs globally. Our products are often sold as part of a program, and therefore our portfolio is comprised of a series of related products designed to simplify weight management and nutrition for our Members and their customers. We categorize our products into five groups: weight management, targeted nutrition, energy, sports &#38; fitness, outer nutrition, and literature, promotional and other. For 2015, 2014 and 2013, our Formula 1 Healthy Meal, our best-selling product line, approximated 30% of our net sales.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT &#38; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 

We are committed to providing the highest-quality, science-based products to help our consumers achieve what we refer to as a &#8220;healthy, active lifestyle&#8221; in the areas of weight management; targeted nutrition (including everyday wellness and healthy aging); energy, sports &#38; fitness; and outer nutrition. We rely on the scientific contributions from members of our Nutrition Advisory Board, along with our in-house scientific team, to continually upgrade or introduce new products as new scientific studies become available and accepted by regulatory authorities around the world. We also utilize the expertise of several international universities and key ingredient suppliers to review, evaluate and formulate new product ideas. Once a particular market opportunity has been identified, our scientists along with our marketing and sales teams work closely with Member leadership to successfully develop and launch the product. We aim to have at least one major product launch each year, timed around our major regional Member education and training events. These launches generally target specific product categories and markets we deem strategic to our business. 

Marketing foods on the basis of sound science means using ingredients that have been well studied and discussed in background scientific literature. Use of these ingredients for their well-established purposes is by definition not novel, and for that reason, most food uses of these ingredients are not subject to patent protection. Notwithstanding the absence of patent protection, we do own proprietary formulations for substantially all of our weight management products and dietary and nutritional supplements. We take care in protecting the intellectual property rights of our proprietary formulas by restricting access to our formulas within the Company to those persons or departments that require access to them to perform their functions, and by requiring our finished goods-suppliers and consultants to execute supply and non-disclosure agreements that seek to contractually protect our intellectual property rights. Disclosure of these formulas, in redacted form, is also necessary to obtain sanitary registrations in many countries. We also make efforts to protect some unique formulations under patent law. We strive to protect all new product developments as the confidential trade secrets of the Company and its inventor employees. 

&#160;

We use the umbrella trademarks Herbalife &#174; and the Tri-Leaf design worldwide, and protect several other trademarks and trade names related to our products and operations, such as Niteworks &#174; and Liftoff &#174; . Our trademark registrations are issued through the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, and comparable agencies in the foreign countries. As of December 31, 201 5 , we had over 2, 0 00 trademark registrations worldwide. We consider our trademarks and trade names to be an important factor in our business. 

GEOGRAPHIC PRESENCE 

As of December 31, 2015, we conducted business in 93 countries throughout the world. The top ten countries worldwide represented approximately 74.3%, 73.1%, and 73.4% of our net sales in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. In the countries where we conduct business, we typically maintain a physical presence and provide sales, marketing, call center, logistics and distribution services. Globally our products can be accessed at over 1,500 locations. We distribute our products through our distribution and sales centers and certain retail partners.

Our operating segments are based on geographical operations in six regions: North America, Mexico, South &#38; Central America, EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa), Asia Pacific and China. The following table shows net sales by geographic region.

MANUFACTURING, WAREHOUSING AND DISTRIBUTION 

Our objective is to provide the highest quality products to our Members and their customers. We seek to accomplish this goal through execution of our &#8220;seed to feed&#8221; strategy that includes significant investments in quality assurance, scientific personnel, product testing, and increasing the amount of self-manufacturing of our top products. Our seed to feed strategy is rooted in using quality ingredients from traceable sources coupled with the vertical manufacturing of our most popular products. For our botanical products, our seed to feed strategy also includes self-manufacturing of our teas and herbal ingredients. Our procurement activities now stretch back to the farms and will include the complete self-processing of teas and botanicals into finished raw materials. 

The foundation for high quality products is the quality of the ingredients. Ingredients are sourced from companies that are large and reputable suppliers in their respective field. For example, soy, our number one ingredient, is sourced from DuPont (formerly Solae) and ADM. Our vitamins, minerals and other key ingredients come from companies such as DSM (formerly Roche Vitamins) and BASF. Other key suppliers include Tate &#38; Lyle, DuPont (formerly Danisco), Kyowa Hakko, and Naturex. In addition to our own modern quality processes, sourcing from these suppliers also provides integrity to our ingredients by utilizing similar quality processes, equipment, expertise and traceability provided by these leading ingredients companies. 

&#160;

The next key component of our seed to feed strategy involves the high quality manufacturing of these ingredients into finished products, including vertical manufacturing. In addition to self-manufacturing, we purchase prod ucts from third-party manufacturers which account for a substantial amount of our product purchases. During 201 5 , we purchased approximately 2 8 % of our products from our top three third-party manufacturers. We work closely with our third-party manufacturers to ensure high quality products are produced and tested through a vigorous quality control process. Our current strategy is to continue expanding our self-manufacturing. We accelerated this initiative with the 2009 acquisition of Micelle Labs in Lake Forest, California and renovating the facility into a high-output, high-quality powder and liquid manufacturer. We call this facility the Herbalife Innovation and Manufacturing Facility (or &#8220;HIM&#8221;) Lake Forest. We have taken similar steps to suppor t our China market, with our HIM Suzhou facility which began operation in 1999. In 2014, we also exe cuted a lease in Nanjing, China in order to increase our future manufacturing capacity in China and we expect to invest in developing the facility over the next few years. In May of 2014, after spending 17 months renovating the 800,000 square foot former Dell computer assembly facility, we began production at the HIM Winston-Salem facility. This is now the C ompany&#8217;s largest manufacturing facility and will pro duce powders, liquids and teas. Together, these facilities produce approximately 50 % of our products sold worldwide. Once the HIM Winston-Salem facility is fully operational, we estimate that 60%-65% of our worldwide product sales will be self-manufactured in our HIM facilities around the world. In our U.S. Company-owned facilities, which produce for the U . S . , and over 50 international markets, we operate and test to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA&#8217;s strict dietary supplement current Good Manu facturing Practices (cGMPs), even though many of the products being manufactured are classified as food products that are generally subject to less stringent manufacturing standards. For those products not man ufactured at HIM facilities, which are typicall y exported, we combine four elements to ensure quality products: the same selectivity and assurance in ingredients as noted above; use of reputable, cGMP-compliant manufacturing partners; a significant supplier qualification and an nual audit program; and s ignificant product quality testing. 

In addition to ensuring the highest quality ingredients and building the quality into the finished products, we test our incoming raw materials for compliance to potency, identity and adherence to strict specifications, and our finished products are analyzed for label claim and microbiological purity thereby verifying product safety and shelf life in the market. For our self-manufactured products, we do substantially all of our testing in-house at our modern quality control laboratories in the U.S. and China. We have major quality control labs in Southern California, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Suzhou, China and our Worldwide Quality Center of Excellence in Changsha, China which tests products made at non-HIM facilities, even though they are already tested at audited contract manufacturer labs or third party labs. All HIM quality control labs contain modern analytical equipment and are backed by the expertise in testing and methods development of our scientists. We employ over 450 professionals performing science or technical related functions, which includes product development, quality control, and scientific and regulatory affairs around the world. 

The final part of our seed to feed strategy is delivering the high-quality product to our Members and their customers. As the shift in consumption patterns continues to reflect an increasing daily consumption focus, our strategy is to provide more product access points closer to our Members and their customers. We operate distribution points ranging from &#8220;hub&#8221; distribution centers, or DCs, in Los Angeles, Memphis, and Venray, Netherlands, to mid-size distribution centers in major countries which include Mexico and South Korea, to small pickup locations spread throughout the world. In addition to these Company-run distribution points, Herbalife partners with retail locations to provide Member pickup points in areas which are not well serviced from Herbalife-run distribution points. In aggregate, our Company-run distribution points and partner retail locations represent over 1,500 locations around the world. We are also experimenting with automated sales kiosks that will provide additional access points to our products. As many of our products can be temperature sensitive, we monitor our DCs for temperature and humidity and often will use shipping tags which monitor these parameters on certain shipment lanes and provide information to help make adjustments to shipping mode or packaging components to ensure the quality of the product being delivered to a Herbalife Distribution Center. 

COMPETITION 

The categories of weight management, targeted nutrition, energy, sports &#38; fitness, and outer nutrition products are very competitive in many channels including those of direct selling, the internet, in specialty retailers and the discounted channels of food, drug and mass merchandise. Herbalife has differentiated itself from the peer group through our Member focus on the consultative sales process through product education and the frequent and sometimes daily contact and support that many Members have with their customers. From a competitive stand point, there are many providers and sales outlets of weight management products including quick-service restaurants and specialty retailers, but we believe that none have effectively combined the product, personal coaching and education and the product access provided by our Members through their daily consumption business methods such as Nutrition Clubs, Weight Loss Challenges or Fit Camps. 

We are subject to competition for the recruitment of Members from other network marketing organizations, including those that market weight management, targeted nutrition, energy, sports &#38; fitness, and outer nutrition products, as well as other types of products which are sold through direct selling. Our ability to remain competitive depends on having relevant products that meet consumer needs, a rewarding compensation plan, enhanced education and tools, and a financially viable company. 

&#160;

OUR COMPETITIVE STREN GTHS 

As a global nutrition company, we believe that the direct selling channel is the most effective way to sell our products given the need for consumer education about nutrition products and the high touch and personalized service for those customers on a weight loss or weight management program. We believe that the direct-selling channel is ideally suited to marketing our products because sales of weight management, targeted nutrition, energy, sports &#38; fitness, and outer nutrition products are strengthened by ongoing personal contact, coaching and education between Members and their customers. This frequent, personal contact can enhance consumers&#8217; nutritional and health education as well as motivate consumers to begin and maintain an active lifestyle through wellness and weight management programs. In addition, our Members consume our products themselves, and therefore can provide first-hand testimonials of the effectiveness of our products to their customers. This personal product experience of our Members can serve as a powerful sales tool. 

Our business model enables us to grow our business with moderate investment in our infrastructure and fixed costs. We incur no direct incremental cost to add a new Member in our existing markets, and our Member compensation varies directly with product sales. In addition, our Members bear the majority of our consumer marketing expenses, and sales leaders sponsor and coordinate a large share of Member recruiting, meeting and training initiatives. Furthermore, we can readily increase production and distribution of our products as a result of having our own manufacturing facilities and numerous third party manufacturing relationships, as well as our global footprint of in-house and third party distribution centers. 

Our objective is sustainable growth in the sales of our products to our Members and their customers by increasing the retailing productivity, retention and recruitment of our Member base through the following competitive strengths. 

Member Base 

As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 4.0 million Members, which include approximately 0.3 million China sales representatives, sales officers, and independent service providers, most of whom are discount customers. Collectively, we currently refer to this group as &#8220;Members.&#8221; 

People become Herbalife Members for a number of reasons. Many first start out as product consumers who want to lose weight and improve their nutrition. Some later join simply to receive a wholesale price on products they and their families can consume and enjoy. Some join to earn part-time income, wanting to give direct sales a try, whereas others are drawn to Herbalife because they can be their own boss and can earn rewards based on their own skills and hard work. In addition to discounted prices, Members can earn profit from several sources. First, Members may earn profits by purchasing our products at wholesale prices, discounted depending on the Member&#8217;s level within our Marketing Plan, and reselling those products at prices they establish for themselves. Second, Members who sponsor other Members and establish, maintain, coach and train their own sales organizations may earn commissions and bonuses based upon their organization&#8217;s production. 

We are party to an agreement with our Members that prohibits us from selling our products through any distribution channel other than our network of independent Members, unless otherwise required by law. 

Members may sponsor other Members in an attempt to build a sales organization, whether or not they have attained any particular level in our Marketing Plan. A significant majority of our Members have not sponsored another Member. These &#8220;single level&#8221; Members are generally considered discount buyers or small retailers. A small number of these single-level Members have attained the sales leader level. 

Currently, approximately 655,000, or 16% of our 4.0 million Members, have attained the level of &#8220;sales leader&#8221;, of which approximately 603,000 have attained the level of &#8220;supervisor&#8221; in the 92 countries where we use our worldwide Marketing Plan and 52,000 sales officers and independent service providers operating under our China Marketing Plan. Collectively, we refer to this group as &#8220;sales leaders.&#8221;

In China, while direct selling is permitted, multi-level marketing is not. As a result, our business model in China differs from that used in other countries. In China, where permitted by law, we sell our products through our Members who are independent contractors. However, Members in China are categorized differently than those in other countries. Chinese citizens who apply and become Members are referred to as &#8220;Sales Representatives.&#8221; Sales Representatives receive scaled rebates based on the volume of products they purchase. Sales Representatives who reach certain volume thresholds and meet certain performance criteria are eligible to apply to provide marketing services. Once their application is accepted, they are referred to as &#8220;Service Providers.&#8221; Service Providers are independent business entities that are eligible to receive compensation from Herbalife for the marketing services they provide so long as they satisfy certain conditions, including procuring the requisite business licenses and having a physical business location. Sales Representatives who are in the process of applying to become Service Providers hold the title of &#8220;Sales Officers.&#8221;

&#160;

Geographic Diversification 

We have expanded our network marketing organization into 93 countries as of December 31, 2015. While sales within our local markets may fluctuate due to economic, market and regulatory conditions, competitive pressures, political and social instability or for Company-specific reasons, we believe that our geographic diversity mitigates our exposure to any one particular market. 

Our Science and our Products 

We are committed to providing our Members with high-quality, science-based products to help them increase consumption and the retailing of our products. We believe this can be best accomplished in part by introducing new products and by upgrading, reformulating and repackaging existing product lines. Our internal team of scientists and product developers collaborate with both our Nutrition Advisory Board and key ingredient suppliers to formulate, review and evaluate new product ideas. Once a particular market opportunity has been identified, our scientists along with our marketing and sales teams work closely with Member leadership to successfully develop and launch the product. 

We believe our focus on nutrition and botanical science and our efforts at combining our internal efforts with the scientific expertise of outside resources that include our ingredient suppliers, major universities, as well as our Nutrition Advisory Board have resulted in product differentiation that has given our Members and consumers increased confidence in our products. 

The Company continues to increase its investments in the areas of science and other technical functions including: research and development associated with creating new product formulations, clinical studies of existing products or products in development, technical operations to improve current product formulations, quality assurance and quality control to establish the appropriate quality systems, controls and standards as well as rigorous ingredient and product testing to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, as well as in the areas of regulatory and scientific affairs. Globally we spent approximately $69 million in 2015 on these activities, excluding any royalty fees associated with our products, which included approximately $2.5 million of research and development spending as defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

In 2010, we launched the Herbalife Nutrition Institute. The Institute is an informational resource dedicated to promoting excellence in the field of nutrition. The Institute&#8217;s website is our primary communication vehicle, and an educational resource for the general public, government agencies, the scientific community, and our Members, about good nutrition and basic health. Its mission is to encourage and support research and education on the relationship between good health, balanced nutrition and a healthy active lifestyle. In addition to providing research and education on the website and through sponsored conferences and symposia, the Institute will have associations with major nutrition science organizations. 

Part of the Herbalife Nutrition Institute is the Company&#8217;s Nutrition Advisory Board. The Nutrition Advisory Board is comprised of leading experts around the world in the fields of nutrition and health who educate our Members on the principles of nutrition, physical activity and healthy lifestyle. 

Members of our Nutrition Advisory Board and the editorial board of the Herbalife Nutrition Institute are affiliated with Herbalife as individuals and not as representatives of their respective universities. 

OUR STRATEGIES 

Herbalife works closely with its Members to improve the sustainability of the business they have created to market our products to consumers. These relationships allow us to identify and test successful marketing efforts and programs developed by one or more Members and disseminate those techniques to other Members. 

As an example of the effectiveness of our management of Member relationship, in or before 2004, Members in Mexico developed marketing techniques that improved both the affordability and effectiveness of our weight loss products through the creation of businesses that became known as &#8220;Nutrition Clubs&#8221;. Rather than buying several retail products, these businesses allow consumers to purchase and consume our products each day (a Member marketing technique we refer to as &#8220;daily consumption&#8221;), while continuing to benefit from the support and interaction with a Member as well as socializing with other customers. Other programs to drive daily consumption, whether for weight management or for improved physical fitness, include Member conducted weight loss contests, or Weight Loss Challenges, and Member led fitness programs, or Fit Camps. We refer to successful Member marketing techniques that we disseminate throughout our Member network, such as Nutrition Clubs, Weight Loss Challenges and Fit Camps as Distributor Methods of Operations, or DMOs. 

&#160;

Our strategies to grow our business center on our relationships with our Members and their relationships with consumers. These strategies include: 

Deliver Effective Products that are Scientifically Validated 

Our product strategy is focused on providing high-quality, science-based products that can support a healthy active lifestyle for Members and their customers in the areas of weight management; targeted nutrition (including everyday wellness and healthy aging); energy, sports &#38; fitness; and outer nutrition. We rely on the scientific contributions from members of our Nutrition Advisory Board, along with our in-house scientific team, to continually upgrade or introduce new products as new scientific studies become available and accepted by regulatory authorities around the world. Additionally, to support our daily consumption initiatives, our product strategy includes projects such as seasonal flavors of our meal replacement shake, new flavors of top selling products and various package sizes and products that can be consumed hot, such as our savory shakes and soups. We aim to have at least one major product launch each year, timed around our major regional Member education and training events. These launches generally target specific product categories and markets we deem strategic to our business. 

Improve the Sustainability of Members&#8217; Businesses 

Combined with our efforts to improve the effectiveness of our Members&#8217; marketing strategies is our strategy to improve the sustainability of our Members&#8217; businesses through the evolution of our Marketing Plan. 

Historically, qualifying for commissions and/or bonuses in our Marketing Plan required the purchase by the qualifying Member and their downline of products representing 4,000 Volume Points in a single month or 2,500 Volume Points in each of two consecutive months. In 2009, we enhanced our Marketing Plan to enable Members to qualify for commissions and/or bonuses by acquiring 5,000 Volume Points over the course of twelve months rather than one or two months, enabling our Members interested in trying direct selling to do so on a more gradual basis. During 2014, we simplified our qualification criteria. To attain sales leader status, a Member generally must be responsible for sales of products representing an accumulation of at least 4,000 Volume Points in any consecutive twelve month period. We believe this simplified and gradual approach will improve the success and retention of new sales leaders and benefit the business long term as it allows new Members to get product and customer experience, improved training and additional education about Herbalife products, daily consumption based DMOs and the business opportunity prior to becoming a sales leader. 

As a leading direct seller, we also endeavor to foster our Members to fairly and honestly market both our products and the business opportunity as part of being an Herbalife Member. 

Improve Members&#8217; Skills through Training 

We believe that personal and professional development are key to our Members&#8217; success and therefore we and our sales leaders have established an annual schedule of meetings and events to support this important objective. We and our Member leadership conduct training sessions on local, regional and global levels attended by thousands of Members to provide updates on product education, sales and marketing training, and instruction on available tools. These events are opportunities to showcase and disseminate our Members&#8217; evolving best marketing practices from around the world such as Nutrition Clubs, Weight Loss Challenges, Fit Camps and other business methods, and to introduce new or upgraded products. A variety of training and development tools are also available through online and mobile platforms. 

Increase Brand Awareness 

To increase our brand awareness, we and our Members have entered into numerous marketing alliances around the world. Herbalife sponsorships of and partnerships with featured athletes, teams and events promote brand awareness, the use of Herbalife products, and &#8220;Better living through nutrition.&#8221; We continue to build brand awareness and work towards becoming the most trusted brand in nutrition. We also work to leverage the power of our Member base as a marketing and brand-building tool. We maintain a brand style guide and brand asset library so that our Members have access to the Herbalife brand logo and marketing materials for use in their marketing efforts. 

&#160;

Improve Product Access 

As adoption of daily consumption methods continue to expand, we have identified a number of methods and approaches that better support Members by providing access points closer to where they do business and by improving product delivery efficiency through our distribution channels. Specific methods vary by markets, considering local Member needs as well as infrastructure and available resources. We continue to expand the number of Sales Centers, smaller pick up locations (including third party collection points), brand experience centers and automated sales centers. This expansion is based on the needs of our Members and the growth of the business primarily from deeper penetration into existing markets. For example, we now have distribution agreements with multiple retailers. We believe that by leveraging the retailer&#8217;s distribution system we are providing our Members with easier product access. We will continue to evaluate the need to increase the number of product access points. Many Members today focus on the use of technology to support their businesses. With the increased activity towards our online and mobile tools, we have enhanced our product access and distribution network to support higher volumes of online or mobile orders which result in Members and their customers selecting home or business delivery options. We continue to see online or mobile ordering activity increase in many established markets.

Leverage Our Infrastructure 

We continue to invest in our technology infrastructure in order to maintain, protect, and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards, emerging data security risks, and changing user patterns and preferences. 

We leverage an Oracle business suite platform to support our business operations, improve productivity and support our strategic initiatives. In addition, we also employ information technology systems to support Members and their increasing demand to be more connected to Herbalife, their business and their consumers. These systems include our Internet-based marketing and Member services platform with tools such as BizWorks, MyHerbalife, Go Herbalife, iChange, and Herbalife Mobile. We continue to invest in business intelligence tools to enable better analysis of our business and to identify opportunities for growth. We will continue to build on these platforms so that we can take advantage of the rapid development of technology around the globe. 

OUR NETWORK MARKETING PROGRAM 

General 

Our products are distributed through a global network marketing organization comprised of approximately 4.0 million Members, most of whom are discount customers, operating in 93 countries as of December 31, 2015. In China, due to local regulations, our sales are conducted through Company operated retail stores, sales representatives, sales officers and independent service providers; in the areas where we have a direct selling license, our sales representatives, sales officers and independent service providers can sell Herbalife product outside of the retail establishments. 

In addition to helping our Members and their customers achieve their goals of health and wellness through consumption of our products, we offer our Members a potential income opportunity as independent contractors. First, Members may earn profits by purchasing our products at wholesale prices, discounted depending on the Member&#8217;s level within our Member network, and reselling those products to persons at prices they set for themselves. Second, Members who sponsor other Members and establish and maintain their own sales organizations may earn compensation (including commissions, royalty overrides and production bonuses) based on the activity of their sales organizations, as well as the annual &#8220;Mark Hughes Bonus&#8221; which is based on several additional factors. 

Our sales are generated primarily from Member purchases that are for reasons other than earning network marketing compensation under the Company&#8217;s Marketing Plan. The majority of our Members have not sponsored another Member and do not earn compensation relating to product sales made by or to other Members. We believe these Members have joined the network for reasons other than participating in our network marketing compensation plan such as personal consumption and reselling products to others to earn retail profit. 

On July 18, 2002, we entered into an agreement with our Members that provides that we will continue to distribute Herbalife products exclusively through our Members and that, other than changes required by applicable law or necessary in our reasonable business judgment to account for specific local market or currency conditions to achieve a reasonable profit on operations, we will not make any material changes to certain aspects of our Marketing Plan that are adverse to our Members without the support of our Member leadership. Specifically, any such changes would require the approval of at least 51% of our Members then at the level of President&#8217;s Team earning at the production bonus level of 6% who vote, provided that at least 50% of those Members entitled to vote do in fact vote. We initiate these types of changes based on the assessment of what will be best for the Company and its Members and then submit such changes for the requisite vote. We believe that this agreement has strengthened our relationship with our existing Members, improved our ability to recruit new Members and generally increased the long-term stability of our business. 

&#160;

Structure 

To become a Member in most markets, a person must be sponsored by an existing Member and must purchase an Herbalife Member Pack, or HMP. The HMP is a Member kit available in local languages which typically includes product samples, a handy tote, booklets describing the Company, our compensation plan and rules of Member conduct, various training and promotional materials, Member applications and a product catalog. The price of an HMP varies by market and provides a low cost entry for incoming Members. HMPs do not generate any Member compensation and are not used for Member qualifications or recognition purposes under the Company&#8217;s Marketing Plan.

Volume Points are point values assigned to each of our products for use by the Company to determine a Member&#8217;s sales achievement level. We assign a Volume Point value to a product when it is first introduced into a market and the value is unaffected by subsequent exchange rate and price changes. The specific number of Volume Points assigned to a product, generally consistent across all markets, is based on a Volume Point to suggested retail price ratio for similar products in the market. 

To become a sales leader, or qualify for a higher level, Members must achieve specified Volume Point thresholds of product sales or earn certain amounts of royalty overrides during specified time periods and generally must re-qualify once each year. To attain sales leader status, a Member generally must be responsible for sales of products representing an accumulation of at least 4,000 Volume Points in any consecutive twelve month period. To re-qualify, sales leaders need to accumulate 4,000 Volume Points within the 12-month re-qualification period. In February of each year, we remove from the rank of sales leader those individuals who did not satisfy the sales leader qualification requirements during the preceding twelve months. See Item 7, Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding sales leader retention rates. 

The method for calculating distributor allowances and Marketing Plan payouts generally utilizes 90% to 95% of suggested retail price, depending on the product and market, to which we apply discounts of up to 50% for distributor allowances and payout rates of up to 15% for royalty overrides, up to 7% for production bonuses, and approximately 1% for the Mark Hughes bonus. 

Members, with the exception of those in China, earn the right to receive royalty overrides upon attaining the level of sales leader and above, and production bonuses upon attaining the level of Global Expansion Team and above. Once a Member becomes a sales leader, he or she has the opportunity to qualify by earning specified amounts of royalty overrides for the Global Expansion Team, the Millionaire Team or the President&#8217;s Team, and thereby receives production bonuses of up to 7%. We believe that the opportunity for Members to earn royalty overrides and production bonuses contributes significantly to our ability to retain our most active and productive Members. 

Our business model in China includes unique features as compared to our traditional business model in order to ensure compliance with Chinese government regulations. These include Company operated retail stores and certification procedures for sales personnel. These and other features of our business model in China have resulted in, and will continue to result in, substantial ongoing costs.

PRODUCT RETURN AND BUYBACK POLICIES 

In substantially all markets, our products include a customer satisfaction guarantee. Under this guarantee, any customer who is not satisfied with a Herbalife product for any reason may return it or any unused portion of it within 30 days to the Member from whom it was purchased for a full refund from the Member or credit toward the exchange of another Herbalife product. If they return the products to us on a timely basis, the Member may obtain replacement product from us for such returned products. In addition, in substantially all jurisdictions, we maintain a buyback program pursuant to which we will repurchase products sold to a Member who has decided to leave the business. The buyback program has certain terms and conditions that may vary by market, but generally permits the return of unopened and marketable condition products or sales materials purchased within the prior twelve month period, in exchange for a refund of the net price paid for the product, exclusive of the cost of shipment to the Member. We pay the cost to return the product to us. Together, product returns and buybacks were approximately 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.2% of product sales for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. 

&#160;

REGULATION 

General 

In both our United States and foreign markets, we are affected by extensive laws, governmental regulations, administrative determinations and guidance, court decisions and similar constraints. Such laws, regulations and other constraints exist at the federal, state or local levels in the United States and at all levels of government in foreign jurisdictions, including regulations pertaining to: (1) the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution, importation, sale and storage of our products; (2) product claims and advertising, including direct claims and advertising by us, as well as claims and advertising by Members, for which we may be held responsible; (3) our network marketing program; (4) transfer pricing and similar regulations that affect the level of U.S. and foreign taxable income and customs duties; (5) taxation of our Members (which in some instances may impose an obligation on us to collect the taxes and maintain appropriate records); and (6) currency exchange and repatriation. 

Products 

In the United States, the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, holding, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution and sale of our products are subject to regulation by various governmental agencies, including (1) the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, (2) the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, (3) the Consumer Product Safety Commission, or CPSC, (4) the United States Department of Agriculture, or USDA, (5) the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, (6) the United States Postal Service, (7) United States Customs and Border Patrol, and (8) the Drug Enforcement Administration. Our activities also are regulated by various agencies of the states, localities and foreign countries in which our products are manufactured, distributed or sold. The FDA, in particular, regulates the formulation, manufacture and labeling of over-the-counter, or OTC, drugs, conventional foods, dietary supplements, and cosmetics such as those distributed by us. The majority of the products marketed by us in the United States are classified as conventional foods or dietary supplements under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA. Internationally, the majority of products marketed by us are classified as foods, health supplements or food supplements. 

FDA regulations govern the preparation, packaging, holding and distribution of foods, OTC drugs and dietary supplements. Among other obligations, they require us and our contract manufacturers to meet relevant current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, regulations for the preparation, packaging, holding, and distribution of OTC drugs and dietary supplements. The FDA also requires identity testing of all incoming dietary ingredients used in dietary supplements, unless a company successfully petitions for an exemption from this testing requirement in accordance with the regulations. The cGMPs are designed to ensure that OTC drug and dietary supplement products are not adulterated with contaminants or impurities, and are labeled to accurately reflect the active ingredients and other ingredients in the products. Herbalife has regularly implemented enhancements, modifications and improvements to our manufacturing and corporate quality processes and believes we and our contract manufacturers are compliant with the FDA&#8217;s cGMP and other applicable manufacturing regulations in the United States. 

The U.S. Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, or DSHEA, revised the provisions of FFDCA concerning the composition and labeling of dietary supplements. Under DSHEA, dietary supplement labeling may display structure/function claims that the manufacturer can substantiate, which are claims that the products affect the structure or function of the body, without prior FDA approval, but with notification to the FDA. They may not bear any claim that they can prevent, treat, cure, mitigate or diagnose disease (a drug claim). In addition, the agency permits companies to use FDA-approved full and qualified health claims for products containing specific ingredients that meet stated requirements. 

U.S. law also requires that all serious adverse events occurring within the United States involving dietary supplements or OTC drugs be reported. We believe that we are in full compliance with this law having implemented a worldwide procedure governing adverse event identification, investigation and reporting. As a result of reported adverse events, we may from time to time elect, or be required, to remove a product from a market, either temporarily or permanently. 

Some of the products marketed by us are considered conventional foods and are currently labeled as such. Within the United States, this category of products is subject to the federal Nutrition, Labeling and Education Act, or NLEA, and regulations promulgated under the NLEA. The NLEA regulates health claims, ingredient labeling and nutrient content claims characterizing the level of a nutrient in the product. The ingredients in conventional foods must either be generally recognized as safe by experts or be approved as food additives under FDA regulations. 

The federal Food Safety Modernization Act is also applicable to some of Herbalife&#8217;s business and will require the development of a food safety plan and the implementation of preventative measures to protect against food contamination. Dietary supplements manufactured in accordance with GMPs and foods manufactured in accordance with the low acid food regulations are exempt. 

&#160;

In foreign markets, prior to commencing operations and prior to making or permitting sales of our products in the market, we may be required to obtain an approval, licens e or certification from the relevant country&#8217;s ministry of health or comparable agency. Where a formal approval, license or certification is not required, we nonetheless seek the advice of counsel regarding our compliance with applicable laws. Prior to ent ering a new market in which a formal approval, license or certificate is required, we work extensively with local authorities in order to obtain the requisite approvals. The approval process generally requires us to present each product and product ingredi ent to appropriate regulators and, in some instances, arrange for testing of products by local technicians for ingredient analysis. The approvals may be conditioned on reformulation of our products, or may be unavailable with respect to some products or so me ingredients. 

The FTC, which exercises jurisdiction over the advertising of all of our products in the United States, has in the past several years instituted enforcement actions against several dietary supplement and food companies and against manufacturers of weight loss products generally for false and misleading advertising of some of their products. In addition, the FTC has increased its scrutiny of the use of testimonials, which we also utilize, as well as the role of expert endorsers and product clinical studies. Although we have not been the target of FTC enforcement action for the advertising of our products, we cannot be sure that the FTC, or comparable foreign agencies, will not question our advertising or other operations in the future. 

In Europe, where an EU Health Claim regulation is in effect, the European Food Safety Authority, or EFSA, issued opinions following its review of a number of proposed claims dossiers. ESFA&#8217;s opinions, which have been accepted by the European Commission, are having a limiting effect on the use of certain nutrition-specific claims made for our products. Herbalife has revised affected product labels to ensure regulatory compliance. Until all modified labels are in the marketplace, there is the possibility that one or more EU Member States could take enforcement action. 

We are subject to a permanent injunction issued in October 1986 pursuant to the settlement of an action instituted by the California Attorney General, the State Health Director and the Santa Cruz County District Attorney. We consented to the entry of this injunction without in any way admitting the allegations of the complaint. The injunction prevents us from making specified claims in advertising of our products, but does not prevent us from continuing to make specified claims concerning our products, provided that we have a reasonable basis for making the claims. The injunction also prohibits certain recruiting-related investments from Members and mandates that payments to Members be premised on retail sales (as defined); the injunction provides that the Company may establish a system to verify or document such compliance. 

Network Marketing Program 

Our network marketing program is subject to a number of federal and state regulations administered by the FTC and various state agencies as well as regulations in foreign markets administered by foreign agencies. Regulations applicable to network marketing organizations generally are directed at ensuring that product sales ultimately are made to consumers and that advancement within our organization is based on sales of the organization&#8217;s products rather than investments in the organization or other non-retail sales related criteria. For instance, in some markets, there are limits on the extent to which Members may earn royalty overrides on sales generated by Members that were not directly sponsored by the Member. When required by law, we obtain regulatory approval of our network marketing program or, when this approval is not required, the favorable opinion of local counsel as to regulatory compliance. 

The FTC has promulgated nonbinding Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising, or Guides, that explain how the FTC interprets Section 5 of the FTC Act&#8217;s prohibition on unfair or deceptive acts or practices. Consequently, the FTC could bring a Section 5 enforcement action based on practices that are inconsistent with the Guides. Under the Guides, advertisements that feature a consumer and convey his or her atypical experience with a product or service are required to clearly disclose the results that consumers can generally expect. Herbalife has adapted its practices and rules regarding the practices of its Members to comply with the revised Guides. 

We also are subject to the risk of private party challenges to the legality of our network marketing program both in the United States and internationally. For example, in Webster v. Omnitrition International, Inc. , 79 F.3d 776 (9th Cir. 1996), the network marketing program of Omnitrition International, Inc., or Omnitrition, was challenged in a class action by Omnitrition distributors who alleged that it was operating an illegal &#8220;pyramid scheme&#8221; in violation of federal and state laws. We believe that our network marketing program satisfies federal and other applicable statutes and case law. 

In some countries, regulations applicable to the activities of our Members also may affect our business because in some countries we are, or regulators may assert that we are, responsible for our Members&#8217; conduct. In these countries, regulators may request or require that we take steps to ensure that our Members comply with local regulations. The types of regulated conduct include: (1) representations concerning our products; (2) income representations made by us and/or Members; (3) public media advertisements, which in foreign markets may require prior approval by regulators; (4) sales of products in markets in which the products have not been approved, licensed or certified for sale; and (5) classification by government agencies of our Members as employees of the Company. 

&#160;

In some markets, it is possible that improper product claims by Members could result in our products being reviewed by regulatory authorities and, as a result, being classified or pl aced into another category as to which stricter regulations are applicable. In addition, we might be required to make labeling changes. 

We also are subject to regulations in various foreign markets pertaining to social security assessments, employment and severance pay requirements, import/export regulations and antitrust issues. As an example, in many markets, we are substantially restricted in the amount and types of rules and termination criteria that we can impose on Members without having to pay social security assessments on behalf of the Members and without incurring severance obligations to terminated Members. In some countries, we may be subject to these obligations in any event. 

It is an ongoing part of our business to monitor and respond to regulatory and legal developments, including those that may affect our network marketing program. However, the regulatory requirements concerning network marketing programs do not include bright line rules and are inherently fact-based. An adverse judicial determination with respect to our network marketing program could have a material adverse effect to our financial condition and operating results. An adverse determination could: (1) require us to make modifications to our network marketing program, (2) result in negative publicity, or (3) have a negative impact on Member morale. In addition, adverse rulings by courts in any proceedings challenging the legality of network marketing systems, even in those not involving us directly, could have a material adverse effect on our operations. 

As has been reported in the national media, a hedge fund manager publicly raised allegations regarding the legality of our network marketing program. We believe, based in part upon prior guidance to the general public from the FTC, that our network marketing program is compliant with applicable law. 

Transfer Pricing and Similar Regulations 

In many countries, including the United States, we are subject to transfer pricing and other tax regulations designed to ensure that appropriate levels of income are reported as earned by our U.S. or local entities and are taxed accordingly. In addition, our operations are subject to regulations designed to ensure that appropriate levels of customs duties are assessed on the importation of our products. 

Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable regulations and restrictions, we are subject to the risk that governmental authorities could audit our transfer pricing and related practices and assert that additional taxes are owed. For example, we are currently subject to pending or proposed audits that are at various levels of review, assessment or appeal in a number of jurisdictions involving transfer pricing issues, income taxes, duties, value added taxes, withholding taxes and related interest and penalties in material amounts. In some circumstances, additional taxes, interest and penalties have been assessed, and we will be required to appeal or litigate to reverse the assessments. We have taken advice from our tax advisors and believe that there are substantial defenses to the allegations that additional taxes are owed, and we are vigorously defending against the imposition of additional proposed taxes. The ultimate resolution of these matters may take several years, and the outcome is uncertain. 

In the event that the audits or assessments are concluded adversely to us, we may or may not be able to offset or mitigate the consolidated effect of foreign income tax assessments through the use of U.S. foreign tax credits. Because the laws and regulations governing U.S. foreign tax credits are complex and subject to periodic legislative amendment, we cannot be sure that we would in fact be able to take advantage of any foreign tax credits in the future. 

Compliance Procedures 

As indicated above, Herbalife, our products and our network marketing program are subject, both directly and indirectly through Members&#8217; conduct, to numerous federal, state and local regulations, both in the United States and foreign markets. Beginning in 1985, we began to institute formal regulatory compliance measures by developing a system to identify specific complaints against Members and to remedy any violations of Herbalife&#8217;s rules by Members through appropriate sanctions, including warnings, suspensions and, when necessary, terminations. In our manuals, seminars and other training programs and materials, we emphasize that Members are prohibited from making therapeutic claims for our products. 

Our general policy regarding acceptance of Member applications from individuals who do not reside in one of our markets is to refuse to accept the individual&#8217;s Member application. 

&#160;

In order to comply with regulations that apply to both us and our Members, we conduct considerable research into the applicable regulatory framework prior to entering any new market to identify all necessary licenses and approvals and ap plicable limitations on our operations in that market. Typically, we conduct this research with the assistance of local legal counsel and other representatives. We devote substantial resources to obtaining the necessary licenses and approvals and bringing our operations into compliance with the applicable limitations. We also research laws applicable to Member operations and revise or alter our Member manuals and other training materials and programs to provide Members with guidelines for operating a busine ss, marketing and distributing our products and similar matters, as required by applicable regulations in each market. We are, however, unable to monitor our Members effectively to ensure that they refrain from distributing our products in countries where we have not commenced operations, and we do not devote significant resources to this type of monitoring. 

In addition, regulations in existing and new markets often are ambiguous and subject to considerable interpretive and enforcement discretion by the responsible regulators. Moreover, even when we believe that we and our Members are initially in compliance with all applicable regulations, new regulations regularly are being added and the interpretation of existing regulations is subject to change. Further, the content and impact of regulations to which we are subject may be influenced by public attention directed at us, our products or our network marketing program, so that extensive adverse publicity about us, our products or our network marketing program may result in increased regulatory scrutiny. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 8,000 employees, of which approximately 2,300 were located in the United States. These numbers do not include our Members, who are independent contractors. In certain countries, which include China and Mexico, we have employees who are subject to labor union agreements and there have been no significant business interruptions as a result of any labor disputes.
