 ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS 

General 

Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;ours,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; and the &#8220;Company&#8221; refer to Era Group Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. &#8220;Era Group&#8221; refers to Era Group Inc., incorporated in 1999 in Delaware. &#8220;Common Stock&#8221; refers to the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Era Group. The Company&#8217;s fiscal year ended on December 31, 2015 . 

We are one of the largest helicopter operators in the world and the longest serving helicopter transport operator in the U.S., which is our primary area of operations. Our helicopters are primarily used to transport personnel to, from and between offshore oil and gas production platforms, drilling rigs and other installations. In the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , approximately 66% , 67% &#32;and 60% , respectively, of our total operating revenues were earned in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and during the same periods, approximately 10% , 15% &#32;and 18% , respectively, of our operating revenues were earned in Alaska. We also provide helicopters and related services to foreign third-party helicopter operators. In the year ended December 31, 2015 , approximately 21% &#32;of total operating revenues were earned in international locations. We currently have customers in Brazil, Colombia, Dominican Republic, India, Norway, Spain and the United Kingdom. 

The primary users of our helicopter services are international, major integrated and independent oil and gas exploration, development and production companies. Our customers include Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (&#8220;Anadarko&#8221;), Petroleo Brasileiro S.A. (&#8220;Petrobras Brazil&#8221;), Shell Pipeline Company, LP (&#8220;Shell&#8221;), Energy Resource Technology, Inc (&#8220;ERT&#8221;) and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (&#8220;BSEE&#8221;), a U.S. government agency. In the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , approximately 78% , 76% &#32;and 75% , respectively, of our operating revenues were derived from helicopter services, including emergency search and rescue services, provided to customers primarily engaged in offshore oil and gas exploration and production activities. Accordingly, our results of operations are, to a large extent, tied to the level of offshore production and development activity by oil and gas companies in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Alaska and Brazil. In addition to serving the oil and gas industry, we provide air medical services, utility services to support firefighting, mining, power line and pipeline survey activities and Alaska flightseeing tours, among other activities. 

We also dry-lease helicopters to third parties and foreign affiliates. These third parties and affiliates in turn provide helicopter services to customers in their local markets or provide niche services. Under our dry-lease arrangements, operational responsibility is typically assumed by the lessee, which allows for lower investment costs for direct support infrastructure. 

In certain countries where we believe it is beneficial to access the local market for offshore helicopter support, we conduct our international operations through subsidiaries, strategic alliances with foreign partners or through entities structured as joint ventures with local shareholders. For example, in Brazil, we hold a 50% economic and 20% voting interest in Aer&#243;leo Taxi Aero S/A (&#8220;Aer&#243;leo&#8221;), a Brazilian entity that provides helicopter transport services to the offshore oil and gas industry. Aer&#243;leo is consolidated in our financial statements as it is a variable interest entity of which we are the primary beneficiary. In 2015, we also acquired a 75% interest in Hauser Investments Limited (&#8220;Hauser&#8221;), which owns 100% of Sicher Helicopters SAS (&#8220;Sicher&#8221;). Sicher, based in Bogota, Colombia, is one of the leading helicopter operators in Colombia with a strong presence in the existing onshore oil and gas market. See Part II, Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - &#8220; Recent Developments &#8221; for more information about our interests in Aer&#243;leo and Sicher. 

In Alaska, we operate light and medium helicopters on the North Slope in support of oil and gas exploration, development and production activities and inland in support of utility activities. Additionally, we operate light helicopters in flightseeing operations, primarily in support of the cruise line industry, providing passengers with glacier and dog-sled tours from Juneau and Denali. 

We provide additional services through joint ventures that complement our core chartering and dry-leasing activities. We hold a 50% interest in our Dart Holding Company Ltd. (&#8220;Dart&#8221;) joint venture, which is a sales and manufacturing organization based in Canada that engineers and manufactures after-market helicopter parts and accessories for sale to helicopter manufacturers and operators and distributes parts and accessories on behalf of other manufacturers. We also hold a 50% interest in Era Training Center LLC (&#8220;Era Training&#8221;), a joint venture based in Lake Charles, Louisiana, which provides classroom instruction, flight simulator and other training to our employees and third parties. 

Era Group&#8217;s principal executive office is located at 818 Town &#38; Country Blvd., Suite 200, Houston, Texas 77024, and its telephone number is (713) 369-4700. Era Group&#8217;s website address is www.eragroupinc.com . The reference to Era Group&#8217;s website is not intended to incorporate the information on the website into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

Emerging Growth Company 

On January 31, 2013, SEACOR Holdings Inc. (&#8220;SEACOR&#8221;) completed the spin-off of Era Group, and we are now an independent company with our Common Stock traded on the New York Stock Exchange (&#8220;NYSE&#8221;) under the symbol &#8220;ERA.&#8221; We are an &#8220;Emerging Growth Company,&#8221; as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the &#8220;JOBS Act&#8221;), and are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These include, but are not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (&#8220;the Sarbanes-Oxley Act&#8221;), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and obtaining stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments. Unless our public float exceeds $700 million or our annual revenues exceed $1 billion before then, we will cease to be an emerging growth company beginning with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018. 

Segment and Geographic Information 

We have determined that our operations comprise a single segment. Helicopters are mobile and versatile assets and, as a result, may be utilized in any of our service lines as business needs dictate. We provide helicopters under contracts ranging from dry-leases, where only the helicopter is provided, to contracts providing full service operational support. Financial data for geographic areas is reported in Note 15 &#32;of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Our Strategy 

Our goal is to be the most efficient helicopter operator in the industry. Our operational, commercial and capital allocation strategies to achieve this goal are as follows: 

Be a preferred provider of helicopter transport services. The primary focus of our business operations is the provision of safe, reliable and efficient helicopter services to our valued customers. We believe our customers consider safety and reliability as the two primary attributes required of their helicopter service providers. We are a founding member of HeliOffshore, a helicopter industry safety association, and we continue to play a major role in the organization, which uses cross-industry cooperation as a platform for enhancing the industry&#8217;s overall strong safety record by sharing best practices, developing and applying advanced technology and encouraging common global flight standards. Amongst the helicopter service operators who meet their safety and reliability requirements, we believe customers usually make their selection of a provider based on aircraft availability, quality and location of facilities, customer service and pricing. We maintain 20 &#32;bases of operations to support our customer needs, including a 35-acre super base in Houma, Louisiana. Opened in the second quarter of 2015, our Houma base is one of the premier heliports servicing the Gulf of Mexico, with a new passenger terminal and hangar offering state of the art technology, security screening and passenger processing and comfort to our passengers and employees. We maintain a close partnership with our customers to help us better anticipate their needs, to assist us in providing customer service and to better manage our fleet utilization and capital allocation. 

Continue to upgrade our versatile helicopter fleet with a focus on effective fleet utilization and management. &#32;&#32;We have a well-maintained and diverse fleet of helicopters to support our customers&#8217; needs. We seek to improve and enhance our fleet through the acquisition of new helicopter models and the installation of newer and safer technologies. An integral part of our fleet strategy is premised upon maintaining well-qualified and well-trained maintenance, ground and flight crews to service our fleet. We regularly review our asset portfolio by assessing market conditions and our customers&#8217; demand for different helicopter models. We buy, sell and lease out equipment in the ordinary course of our business. We believe our strong relationships with the original equipment manufacturers (&#8220;OEMs&#8221;) help us maintain an asset base suitable for use within our own operations and for dry-leasing to other operators. We have ordered and maintain options on a number of new helicopters from the OEMs. During 2015, we took delivery of two S92 &#32;heavy helicopters and two AW189 &#32;heavy helicopters, and we have orders for two &#32;additional S92 &#32;helicopters, seven &#32;additional AW189 &#32;helicopters and five &#32; AW169 &#32;light twin helicopters. These new helicopter models enhance our fleet diversity and better enable us to meet customer needs. In order to maintain the flexibility required to address changing industry and market conditions that impact the supply and demand for our services and our customer needs, we retain the ability to terminate a significant portion of our commitments to purchase new helicopters upon payment of specified liquidated damages. 

Pursue dry-leasing opportunities. &#32;&#32; We believe dry-leasing permits us to monetize helicopter demand from end markets that we may not otherwise have access to without a further investment in infrastructure or operations. There is increasing competition in the dry-leasing market with the introduction and expansion of specialized helicopter leasing companies. We believe customers look to us for helicopter dry-leasing because of our fleet diversity, including selection of light, medium and heavy helicopters to meet customer needs, and our ability as an operator to provide related services such as training, maintenance support and temporary ground and flight crews, both of which differentiate us from the financial leasing companies. 

&#160; 

Expand into new and growing geographic markets. &#32;&#32; We believe there are significant opportunities in offshore oil and gas markets outside of the U.S., and we selectively seek to access these growth markets. In addition to our 50% interest in Aer&#243;leo and 75% interest in Sicher, we continue to develop our relationships with, and identify new, local operators in targeted markets that we believe are underserved by larger multinational helicopter operators, may benefit from our unique offering of services and expertise and provide us with opportunities for growth. As we seek to grow our business, we regularly evaluate new opportunities and entry into new markets through acquisitions, participation in affiliates, investment in joint ventures and the creation of partnership and alliances with industry participants. 

Maximize shareholder value. We proactively manage our fleet as a portfolio of assets, and we plan our capital allocation with a focus on achieving business growth and improving rates of return, taking into careful account our balance sheet, liquidity and risk management. Our goal is to deliver strong returns over time by: improving the cash returns through capital and operational efficiency improvements; deploying more capital into opportunities management believes can deliver strong returns for the benefit of our shareholders, including making strategic acquisitions or strategic equity investments; and withdrawing capital from areas where returns are deemed inadequate and unable to be sufficiently improved. We continuously evaluate and optimize our fleet utilization, and as helicopters come off of current contracts or are replaced by newer models, we assess our future opportunities for such helicopters against our ability to recover our remaining investments in the secondary helicopter market. When appropriate, we may divest helicopters when such actions provide the highest shareholder return. In addition, we intend to continue to pursue opportunities to realize value from our fleet&#8217;s versatility by shifting assets between markets when circumstances warrant. 

We will continue to build upon the expertise, relationships and buying power in our operating businesses to develop other business opportunities and sources of revenue. 

Equipment and Services &#32; 

We own and operate three classes of helicopters: 

&#8226; 

Heavy &#32;helicopters, which have twin engines and a typical passenger capacity of 16 to 19, are primarily used in support of the deepwater offshore oil and gas industry, frequently in harsh environments or in areas with long distances from shore, such as those in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Brazil, Australia and the North Sea. Heavy helicopters are also used to support search and rescue operations. 

&#8226; 

Medium &#32;helicopters, which have twin engines and a typical passenger capacity of 11 to 12, are primarily used to support the offshore oil and gas industry, search and rescue services, air medical services, utility services to support firefighting, mining, power line and pipeline survey activities and corporate uses. 

&#8226; 

Light &#32;helicopters, which may have single or twin engines and a typical passenger capacity of five to nine, are used to support a wide range of activities, including the shallow water oil and gas industry, utility services, air medical services, tourism and corporate uses. 

As of December 31, 2015 , we owned, leased or managed a total of 146 &#32;helicopters, consisting of 13 &#32;heavy helicopters, 55 &#32;medium helicopters, 35 &#32;light twin engine helicopters and 43 &#32;light single engine helicopters. As of December 31, 2015 , we had commitments to purchase 14 &#32;new helicopters consisting of seven &#32; AW189 &#32;heavy helicopters, two &#32; S92 &#32;heavy helicopters and five &#32; AW169 &#32;light twin helicopters. The AW189 &#32;and S92 &#32;helicopters are scheduled to be delivered beginning 2016 &#32;through 2018 . Delivery dates for the AW169 &#32;helicopters have not been determined. In addition, we had outstanding options to purchase up to an additional ten &#32; AW189 &#32;helicopters and two &#32; S92 &#32;helicopters. If these options were exercised, the helicopters would be delivered beginning in 2017 &#32;through 2018 . 

As of December 31, 2015 , 116 &#32;of our helicopters were located in the U.S. and 30 &#32;were located in foreign jurisdictions. 

The following table identifies the types of helicopters that comprise our fleet and the number of those helicopters in our fleet as of December 31, 2015 . &#8220;Owned&#8221; are those helicopters owned by us. &#8220;Leased-in&#8221; are those helicopters leased-in under operating leases. &#8220;Managed&#8221; are those helicopters that are owned by non-affiliated entities and operated by us for a fee.

_______________ 

(1) 

In typical configuration for our operations. 

(2) 

Reflects the average age of helicopters that are owned by us. 

The management of our fleet involves a careful evaluation of the expected demand for helicopter services across global markets, including the types of helicopters needed to meet this demand. As offshore oil and gas exploration and production globally moves to deeper water, more heavy and medium helicopters and newer technology helicopters may be required. Our orders and options to purchase helicopters are primarily for heavy helicopters. These capital commitments reflect our effort to meet customer demand for helicopters suitable for the deepwater market. 

Heavy and medium helicopters fly longer distances at higher speeds and can carry heavier payloads than light helicopters and are usually equipped with sophisticated avionics permitting them to operate in more demanding weather conditions and difficult climates. Heavy and medium helicopters are most commonly used for crew changes on large offshore production facilities and drilling rigs servicing the oil and gas industry. They are the preferred helicopters in international offshore markets, where facilities tend to be larger, the drilling locations more remote, and onshore infrastructure more limited. 

In the U.S., we provide and operate helicopters under contracts using a Federal Aviation Administration (&#8220;FAA&#8221;) issued Part 135 Air Operator&#8217;s Certificate (&#8220;AOC&#8221;) for a variety of activities, primarily offshore oil and gas exploration, development and production, air medical services, utility services, flightseeing tours, and emergency response search and rescue. For operating contracts, we are required to provide a complete support package including flight crews, helicopter maintenance and management of flight operations. 

In international markets, local regulatory requirements may require us to conduct our international operations using another operator&#8217;s AOC through strategic alliances with foreign partners or through non-wholly owned entities with local shareholders. When operating on another operator&#8217;s AOC through dry-leases, our customers generally handle all the operational 

&#160; 

support except where our international contracts require us to provide more limited operational support, which typically consists of pilot training and/or helicopter maintenance. 

Markets 

Our current principal markets for our transportation and search and rescue services to the offshore oil and gas exploration, development and production industry are in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Alaska and Brazil. In addition, we currently conduct activities in Colombia, Dominican Republic, India, Norway, Spain and the United Kingdom. 

Demand for helicopters in support of offshore oil and gas exploration, development and production, both in the U.S. and internationally, is affected by the level of offshore exploration and drilling activities. Activity levels in the offshore oil and gas industry, in turn, are affected by prevailing oil and gas prices, expectations about future prices, price volatility and long-term trends in oil and gas prices. Historically, the prices for oil and gas and, consequently, the level of activity in the offshore oil and gas exploration development and production sectors, have been volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to changes in the supply of and demand for oil and gas, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond our control, such as: 

&#8226; 

customer assessments of offshore drilling prospects compared with land-based opportunities, including oil sands and shale formations; 

&#8226; 

customer assessments of cost, geological opportunity and political stability in host countries; 

&#8226; 

worldwide supply of and demand for oil and natural gas; 

&#8226; 

the price and availability of alternative fuels; 

&#8226; 

the ability of The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (&#8220;OPEC&#8221;) to set and maintain production levels and pricing; 

&#8226; 

the level of production of non-OPEC countries; 

&#8226; 

the relative exchange rates for the U.S. dollar; and 

&#8226; 

various U.S. and international government policies regarding exploration and development of oil and gas reserves. 

U.S. Markets. &#32; We are one of the largest suppliers of helicopter services in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, which is a major offshore oil and gas exploration and production region and one of the largest oil and gas aviation markets in the world, and where we operate from 13 &#32;bases. Our client base in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico consists primarily of international, independent and major integrated oil and gas companies. Among our strengths in this region are our advanced proprietary flight-following systems, our maintenance operations and our search and rescue services. 

We have four &#32;operating bases in Alaska, where we provide support for international, independent and major integrated oil and gas companies along the North Slope, summer flightseeing tours and support for inland utility operations. Despite the remote location of our Alaskan bases, they are strategically located to provide services to our customers. These bases frequently include crew accommodations, hangars and fuel systems, all of which can be otherwise difficult or expensive to secure and maintain in such remote locations. 

Our air medical services operations are primarily located in the eastern U.S. 

International Markets. &#32;We actively market our services globally and currently conduct our international activities in Brazil, Colombia, Dominican Republic, India, Norway, Spain and the United Kingdom. 

Brazil. &#32;&#32;Brazil has one of the largest deepwater offshore exploration and production areas in the world. In 2011, we acquired a 50% economic interest and 20% voting interest in Aer&#243;leo. Aer&#243;leo has a network of three operating bases distributed strategically in Brazil. As of December 31, 2015 , Aer&#243;leo had a fleet of 16 &#32;helicopters, including three &#32; H225 &#32;heavy helicopters and 13 &#32; AW139 &#32;medium helicopters. Aer&#243;leo&#8217;s main customers are Petrobras Brazil, Repsol Brazil, S.A. and Saipem do Brasil Lda. 

Colombia. Sicher provides helicopter services to Colombia&#8217;s existing onshore and expanding offshore oil and gas market using a fleet of five &#32;helicopters, including one &#32; AW139 &#32;helicopter, three &#32; BO105 &#32;light twin helicopters and one &#32; AS350 &#32;single engine helicopter. 

Europe. &#32;&#32;We dry-lease helicopters and provide logistics and spare parts support to several operators in Europe. These helicopters are used in Norway, Spain and the United Kingdom by operators providing search and rescue services, utility operations and oil and gas exploration and production support. 

India. &#32;&#32;In India, we dry-lease helicopters and provide logistics and spare parts support to an operator in the oil and gas industry. 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

A significant portion of our operating revenues and profits related to oil and gas exploration and production activity is dependent on actual flight hours. The fall and winter months have fewer hours of daylight, particularly in Alaska, and flight hours are generally lower at these times. In addition, prolonged periods of adverse weather in the fall and winter months, coupled with the effect of fewer hours of daylight, can adversely impact operating results. In general, the months of December through February in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and October through April in Alaska have more days of adverse weather conditions than the other months of the year. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, June through November is tropical storm season. During a tropical storm, we are unable to operate in the area of the storm. However, flight activity may increase immediately before and after a storm due to the evacuation and return of offshore workers. The Alaska flightseeing operation is also seasonal with activity occurring only from late May until early September. There is less seasonality in our dry-leasing and air medical activities. 

Customers and Contractual Arrangements 

Our principal customers in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico are major integrated and independent oil and gas exploration and production companies and BSEE. We provide helicopters to BSEE under contract and provide services, including the provision of flight crews, helicopter maintenance and management of flight operations. In Alaska, our principal customers are international, independent and major integrated oil and gas exploration and production companies and cruise line passengers. Internationally, we typically dry-lease helicopters to local helicopter companies that operate our helicopters under their operating certificates and retain the operating risk. These companies in turn provide helicopter transportation services to oil and gas companies, utility companies, firefighting operators and governmental agencies. As of December 31, 2015 , approximately 8% &#32;of our helicopters were utilized in support of these dry-leasing activities. 

During the year ended December 31, 2015 , our top ten customers accounted for 76% &#32;of total revenues. During the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , each of Anadarko and BSEE accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues. 

We charter the majority of our helicopters primarily through master service agreements, subscription agreements, day-to-day charter arrangements, fixed-term noncancelable contracts and dry-leases. Master service agreements and subscription agreements typically require a fixed monthly fee plus incremental payments based on flight hours flown. These agreements have fixed terms ranging from one month to five years and generally may be canceled without penalty upon 30-90 days&#8217; notice. Generally, these contracts do not commit our customers to acquire specific amounts of services or minimum flight hours and permit our customers to decrease the number of helicopters under contract with a corresponding decrease in the fixed monthly payments without penalty. Day-to-day charter arrangements call for either a combination of a daily fixed fee plus a charge based on hours flown or an hourly rate with a minimum number of hours to be charged. Dry-leases generally run from two to five years and may contain early cancellation provisions. Services provided under dry-leases can include only the equipment or can include the equipment plus logistical and maintenance support. The rate structure, as it applies to our contracts with oil and gas customers, typically contains terms that limit our exposure to changes in fuel costs. Air medical services are provided under contracts with hospitals that typically include a fixed monthly and hourly rate structure. With respect to flightseeing helicopters, block space is allocated to cruise lines and seats are sold directly to customers. 

Competitive Conditions 

The helicopter industry is highly competitive. There are, however, factors that provide advantages and in some instances barriers to entry, particularly customer certification and access to appropriate facilities in strategic locations. Customers tend to rely heavily on existing relationships and seek operators with established safety records and knowledge of the operating environment. 

We are one of the largest helicopter companies operating in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Alaska and Brazil. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, we have many competitors, the three largest being Bristow Group Inc. (&#8220;Bristow&#8221;), PHI, Inc. (&#8220;PHI&#8221;) and Rotorcraft Leasing Company LLC. Some oil and gas customers in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico operate their own helicopter fleets in addition to smaller companies that offer services similar to ours. In Alaska, we compete against a large number of relatively small operators. In international markets, we have several major competitors depending on the region. Our primary competitors in Brazil consist of Lider Avia&#231;&#227;o Holding S.A., OMNI T&#225;xi A&#233;reo Ltda., and Brazilian Helicopter Services Taxi A&#233;reo Ltda. 

In air medical services, there are several major competitors with fleets dedicated to air medical operations including Air Methods Corporation, PHI and Air Medical Group Holdings. We compete against national and regional firms, and there is usually more than one competitor in each local market. In addition, we compete against hospitals that operate their own helicopters and, in some cases, against ground ambulances. 

In most instances, an operator must have an acceptable safety record, demonstrated reliability and suitable equipment to bid for work. Among bidders meeting these criteria, customers typically make their final choice based on helicopter preference, aircraft availability, the quality and location of operating bases, customer service and price. 

&#160; 

Our dry-leasing business competes against financial leasing companies such as Element Financial Corporation, Lease Corporation International (Aviation) Limited, Macquarie Rotocraft Leasing Limited, Milestone Aviation Group Limited and Waypoint Leasing Limited. 

Risks of Foreign Operations 

We have activities worldwide, and for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , 21% , 15% , and 18% , respectively, of our operating revenues were derived from foreign activities. 

Foreign operations are subject to inherent risks, which, if they materialize, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - &#8220; We are subject to risks associated with our international operations &#8221; for more information. 

Government Regulation 

Regulatory Matters. &#32;&#32; Our operations are subject to significant federal, state and local regulations in the U.S., as well as international treaties and conventions and the laws of foreign jurisdictions where we operate our equipment or where the equipment is registered or operated. Our results of operations are dependent upon our ability to maintain compliance with all applicable laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. 

In the U.S. we hold the status of an air carrier under the relevant provisions of Title 49 of the United States Transportation Code (&#8220;Transportation Code&#8221;) and engage in the operating and dry-leasing of helicopters in the U.S. and, as such, we are subject to various statutes and regulations. We are governed principally by the regulations of the United States Department of Transportation (&#8220;DOT&#8221;), including Part 298 registration as an On-Demand Air Taxi Operator, and the regulations of the FAA applicable to an FAA Part 135 Air Taxi certificate holder. Among other things, the DOT regulates our status as an air carrier, including our U.S. citizenship. The FAA regulates our flight operations and, in this respect, has jurisdiction over our personnel, helicopters, ground facilities and certain technical aspects of our operations. In addition to the FAA, the National Transportation Safety Board is authorized to investigate our helicopter accidents (if any) and to recommend improved safety standards. We are also subject to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, because of the use of radio facilities in our operations. &#32; 

Helicopters operating in the U.S. are subject to registration, and their owners are subject to citizenship requirements under the Federal Aviation Act. This Act generally requires that before a helicopter may be legally operated in the U.S., it must be owned by citizens of the U.S., which, in the case of a corporation, means a corporation: (i) organized under the laws of the U.S. or of a state, territory or possession thereof, (ii) of which at least 75% of its voting interests are owned or controlled by persons who are &#8220;U.S. citizens&#8221; (as defined in the Federal Aviation Act and regulations promulgated thereunder), and (iii) of which the president and at least two-thirds of the board of directors and managing officers are U.S. citizens. We have adopted provisions in our amended and restated Certificate of Incorporation to ensure compliance with the regulations of the FAA. 

In Brazil, an operator must be licensed by the National Agency for Civil Aviation. Under applicable Brazilian law, in order to maintain its license, an operator must have Brazilian officers and be controlled by nationals of Brazil, meaning at least 80% of the operator&#8217;s voting shares are held by Brazilian nationals. The majority holder of voting shares in Aer&#243;leo is a Brazilian national and therefore this subsidiary is currently controlled within the meaning of Brazil licensing requirements. Our ability to conduct our helicopter operating business in Brazil is dependent on our ability to maintain Aer&#243;leo&#8217;s AOC. 

We also are subject to state and local regulations including, but not limited to, significant state regulations for our air medical services and search and rescue operations. In addition, our international operations, primarily helicopter dry-leasing and our joint ventures, are required to comply with the laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. 

Environmental Compliance. &#32;&#32; Our business is subject to international and U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and occupational safety and health, including laws that govern the discharge of oil and pollutants into navigable waters. Such laws include the federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act, which imposes restrictions on the discharge of pollutants to the navigable waters of the U.S. We are also subject to the Coastal Zone Management Act, which authorizes state development and implementation of certain programs to manage water pollution to restore and protect coastal waters. In addition, because our operations generate and, in some cases, involve the transportation of hazardous wastes, we are subject to the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which regulates the use, generation, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous and certain non-hazardous wastes. Violations of these laws, along with comparable state and local laws, may result in civil and criminal penalties, fines, injunctions or other sanctions. We are also subject to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and certain comparable state laws, which establish strict and, under certain circumstances, joint and several, liabilities for specified parties in connection with liability for the investigation and remediation of releases of hazardous materials into the environment and damages to natural resources. Such liability can arise even as a result of conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators or third parties. 

&#160; 

In addition, our customers in the oil and gas exploration, development and production industry are affected by environmental laws and regulations that restrict their activities (and have become stricter as a result of the Deepwater Horizon &#32;incident) and may result in reduced demand for our services. 

We believe that our operations are currently in material compliance with all environmental laws and regulations. We do not expect that we will be required to make capital expenditures in the near future that are material to our financial position or operations to comply with environmental laws and regulations; however, because such laws and regulations are frequently changing and may impose stricter requirements, we cannot predict the ultimate cost of complying with these laws and regulations. The recent trend in environmental legislation and regulation is generally toward stricter standards, and it is our view that this trend is likely to continue. 

We manage exposure to losses from the above-described laws through our efforts to use only well-maintained, well-managed and well-equipped facilities and equipment and our development of safety and environmental programs, including our insurance program. We believe these efforts will be able to accommodate all reasonably foreseeable environmental regulatory changes. There can be no assurance, however, that any future laws, regulations or requirements or that any discharge or emission of pollutants by us will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or our results of operations. 

Safety, Industry Hazards and Insurance 

The safety of our passengers and the maintenance of a safe working environment for our employees is our number one operational priority. We believe we have a strong safety culture throughout our organization that is sponsored by our Chief Executive Officer, who is responsible for setting the tone at the top. We strive to exceed the stringent safety and performance audit standards set by aviation regulatory bodies and our customers. 

Our in-house safety department is responsible for our compliance with safety standards within our organization, standardizing base operating procedures, compliance with government regulations and customer requirements, and educating and training our employees. A key to maintaining our strong safety record is having highly qualified, experienced and well trained employees. We conduct training and safety programs to promote a safe working environment and minimize hazards. 

Helicopter operations are potentially hazardous and may result in incidents or accidents. Hazards such as adverse weather conditions, collisions, fire and mechanical failures may result in death or injury to personnel, damage to equipment, and other environmental damage. We target zero accidents and injuries in the workplace, and we achieved zero air accidents in both 2015 &#32;and 2014. 

We have implemented a safety program that includes, among many other features, (i) transition and recurrent training using flight training devices, (ii) an FAA approved flight operational quality assurance program and (iii) health and usage monitoring systems (&#8220;HUMS&#8221;), which automatically monitor and report on vibrations and other anomalies on key components of certain helicopters in our fleet. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we employed 938 individuals, including 270 pilots and 262 mechanics. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. Certain of our employees in Brazil (approximately 29% &#32;of our total workforce) are covered by union or other collective bargaining agreements. If we are involved in any disputes over the terms of these collective bargaining agreements and are unable to negotiate acceptable contract terms with the unions that represent our employees, it could result in strikes, work stoppages or other slowdowns, higher labor costs or other conditions that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
