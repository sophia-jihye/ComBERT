Our Products 

We manage our business based on the products we manufacture. Our reportable segments correspond to our principal product lines: market pulp, tissue, wood products, newsprint and specialty papers. Certain segment and geographical financial information, including sales by segment and by geographic area, operating income (loss) by segment and long-lived assets by geographic area, can be found in Note 19, &#8220;Segment Information &#8221; to our consolidated financial statements and related notes (&#8220;Consolidated Financial Statements&#8221;) appearing in Part II, Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,&#8221; of this Form 10-K. 

Market pulp 

We produce market pulp at seven &#32;facilities in North America, with total capacity of approximately 1.8 million &#32;metric tons, or approximately 10% of total North American capacity, making us the third largest pulp producer in North America. Approximately 70% of our virgin pulp capacity is softwood-based: northern bleached softwood kraft pulp, southern bleached softwood kraft pulp and fluff pulp. We are also the world&#8217;s largest producer of recycled bleached kraft pulp and a competitive producer of northern bleached hardwood kraft pulp and southern bleached hardwood kraft pulp. Wood pulp is the most commonly used material to make paper. Pulp not converted into paper is sold as market pulp, which is used to make a range of consumer products including tissue, packaging, specialty paper products, diapers and other absorbent products. Approximately 30% of our 2015 &#32;market pulp shipments were exported outside of North America, including significant exports to Europe, Asia and Latin America. 

Tissue 

With the acquisition of Atlas Paper in 2015 (as described below), we now produce tissue products at two &#32;facilities in North America, both located in Florida. With total capacity of 63,000 &#32;short tons ( 57,000 &#32;metric tons), we are a fully integrated manufacturer operating three tissue machines and 14 converting lines. We manufacture a range of tissue products for the away-from-home and private-label at-home markets, including recycled and virgin paper products, covering premium, value and economy grades. These facilities will be complemented by the tissue manufacturing and converting facility in Calhoun, Tennessee, which will have a total capacity of 66,000 short tons (60,000 metric tons). Starting in 2017, we will manufacture premium and ultra-premium tissue products in Calhoun. 

Wood products 

We operate 15 &#32;sawmills in Canada that produce construction-grade lumber sold in North America, mostly on the east coast. Our sawmills produce dimension spruce-pine-fir lumber and are a major source of wood chips for our pulp and paper mills and wood residue we use as fuel in our power cogeneration assets and other operations. In 2015 , we shipped 1.6 billion board feet of construction-grade lumber within North America. We also operate two &#32;remanufactured wood products facilities that produce bed frame components, finger joints and furring strips, two &#32;engineered wood products facilities that produce I-joists for the construction industry, and one &#32;wood pellet facility, all of which are located in Canada. 

Newsprint 

We produce newsprint at 10 &#32;facilities in North America and one &#32;facility in South Korea. With total capacity of approximately 2.4 million metric tons, or approximately 9% &#32;of total worldwide capacity, we are the largest producer of newsprint in the world by capacity. We are also the largest North American producer of newsprint, with capacity of approximately 2.2 million &#32;metric tons, or approximately 41% of total North American capacity. We sell newsprint to newspaper publishers all over the world and also to commercial printers in North America for uses such as inserts and flyers. In 2015 , approximately 61% of our total newsprint shipments were to North American markets. 

Specialty papers 

We produce specialty papers at five &#32;facilities in North America. Our specialty papers segment is composed of uncoated mechanical papers, including supercalendered (&#8220;SC&#8221;), superbright, high bright, bulky book and directory papers, as well as coated mechanical papers and uncoated freesheet papers. With total capacity of approximately 1.2 million short tons (1.1 million metric tons), or approximately 30% &#32;of total North American capacity, we are the largest producer of uncoated mechanical papers in North America, and the third largest in the world. Also, with 541,000 short tons (491,000 metric tons) of capacity, or approximately 19% of total North American capacity, we are North America&#8217;s third largest producer of coated mechanical papers. Our specialty papers are used in books, retail inserts, direct mail, coupons, magazines, catalogs and other commercial printing applications. We sell specialty papers to major commercial printers, direct mailers, publishers, catalogers and retailers, mostly in North America.

Abitibi-LP Engineered Wood Inc. and Abitibi-LP Engineered Wood II Inc. are located in Larouche and Saint-Prime, respectively, and are unconsolidated entities in which we have a 50% interest in each entity. We operate the facilities and our joint venture partners sell the products. The amounts in the above table represent the mills&#8217; total capacity and production. 

Other products 

We also sell green power produced from renewable sources, wood chips and other wood related products to customers located in Canada and the United States. Sales of these other products are considered a recovery of the cost of manufacturing our primary products. 

Raw Materials 

Our operations consume substantial amounts of raw materials such as wood, recovered paper (old newspapers, old magazines and sorted office paper) and chemicals, as well as energy in the manufacturing of our paper, tissue, pulp and wood products. We purchase raw materials and energy sources (to complement internal generation) primarily on the open market. 

Wood 

Our sources of wood include purchases from local producers, including sawmills that supply residual wood chips, wood harvested from government-owned land on which we hold timber supply guarantees or harvesting rights, and property we own or lease. In Quebec, new legislation has replaced the use of timber supply and forest management agreements with timber supply guarantees on government-owned land as of April 1, 2013. As a result, we no longer have long-term harvesting rights contracts in Quebec but instead are allocated a certain volume of supply through timber supply guarantees. These guarantees are five years in length and are renewable, subject to certain conditions. As of December 31, 2015 , we were allocated 4.1 million cubic meters of supply through the timber supply guarantees. In Ontario, we had long-term harvesting rights for approximately 11.4 million acres of Crown-owned land, as of December 31, 2015 . The harvesting rights licenses in Ontario are 20 years in length and automatically renew every five years, contingent upon our continual compliance with environmental performance and reforestation requirements. 

We depend heavily on harvesting rights and timber supply guarantees over government-owned land in Ontario and Quebec, respectively. In particular, the volume of harvest permitted under these licenses is subject to limits, generally referred to as the &#8220;annual allowable cut,&#8221; which are reviewed regularly, typically every five years in Quebec and every 10 years in Ontario. Between 2006 and 2011, the chief forester of the province of Quebec ordered reductions to the allowable harvest of approximately 24% in Quebec, and a further reduction of approximately 4% between 2013 and 2018. Also, as of April 1, 2013, about 25% of the then remaining timber supply guarantees allocated in Quebec were transferred to an open auction system that was implemented in 2013. 

We have sought out independent certification for 100% of the forests that we manage or on which we hold significant harvesting rights in order to demonstrate our strong belief that it is possible to carefully harvest trees while maintaining biodiversity and protecting the forest values important to a range of stakeholders. The woodlands that we manage are all independently certified to at least one of two internationally recognized forest management standards: Sustainable Forestry Initiative &#174; &#32;(&#8220;SFI &#174; &#8221;) and Forest Stewardship Council &#174; &#32;(&#8220;FSC &#174; &#8221;). 

In 2015, we successfully maintained SFI forest management certification for all of our managed woodlands in Quebec and Ontario. In addition, we continue to be one of the largest holders of SFI and FSC forest management certificates in North 

America. On January 1, 2014, three of our FSC forest management certificates (Black Spruce and Dog River Matawin forests, Ontario; Lac-Saint-Jean, Quebec; and Mistassini-P&#233;ribonka, Quebec) were temporarily suspended under the FSC National Boreal Standard. The Black Spruce and Dog River Matawin forests certification was reinstated on November 25, 2015. The suspension of the Lac-Saint-Jean certificate was extended on July 2, 2015, for an additional 12 months, and the Mistassini-P&#233;ribonka certificate expired on December 3, 2014. Both areas remain certified under the SFI standard, and we remain fully committed to 100% certification to at least one of two internationally recognized forest management standards in use in Canada. 

We have also instituted fiber-tracking systems at all of our North American facilities to ensure that our wood fiber supply comes from acceptable sources such as certified forests and legal harvesting operations. These systems are third-party certified according to one or more of three internationally recognized chain of custody standards, namely SFI, FSC and Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (&#8220;PEFC&#8221;), with the exception of the fiber-tracking system of our new Atikokan sawmill, which is expected to be third-party certified in 2016. For both our internal and external wood and fiber sources, 100% is procured through the FSC Controlled Wood standard, the PEFC due diligence requirements or the SFI fiber sourcing requirements, and in some cases a combination of these standards. 

We strive to improve our forest management and wood fiber procurement practices and we encourage our wood and fiber suppliers to demonstrate continual improvement in forest resource management, wood and fiber procurement and third-party certification. 

The 2006 Softwood Lumber Agreement (the &#8220;SLA&#8221;), which governed Canada&#8217;s softwood lumber exports to the United States, expired in October 2015. The SLA provided for, among other things, softwood lumber to be subject to one of two ongoing border restrictions, depending upon the province of first manufacture with several provinces being exempt from these border restrictions. Volume quotas were established for each company within the provinces of Ontario and Quebec based on historical production, and the volume quotas were not transferable between provinces. Quota volume restrictions were lifted if U.S. composite prices rose above $355 composite per thousand board feet. Although the agreement has expired, its terms provided that no trade sanctions would be imposed with respect to softwood lumber imports from Canada for one year following its expiration, that is, until October of 2016. It is uncertain how or whether Canadian softwood lumber exports to the United States will be regulated after October 2016. For additional information, see Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors &#8211; There is uncertainty with respect to future regulation of our Canadian softwood lumber exports to the United States,&#8221; of this Form 10-K. 

Recovered paper 

We are one of the largest consumers of recycled fiber in North America and have a number of de-inking plants that use advanced mechanical and chemical processes to manufacture high quality pulp from recovered paper. Using recovered paper, we produce, among other things, recycled newsprint comparable in quality to paper produced with 100% virgin fiber pulp. The Thorold and Mokpo newsprint operations, the Menominee and Fairmont pulp operations, and the Hialeah tissue operations, produce products containing 100% recycled fiber. In 2015 , we used 0.9 million metric tons of recovered paper in our production processes and averaged 19% recycled fiber content in the newsprint we produced. 

Energy 

Steam and electrical power constitute the primary forms of energy used in pulp, tissue and paper production. Process steam is produced in boilers using a variety of fuel sources, as well as heat recovery units in mechanical pulp facilities. All of our mills produce 100% of their own steam requirements, with the exception of our Thorold mill. In 2015 , our Alma, Calhoun, Catawba, Coosa Pines, Dolbeau, Gatineau, K&#233;nogami, Saint-F&#233;licien and Thunder Bay operations collectively consumed approximately 47% of their electrical requirements from internal sources, notably on-site cogeneration and hydroelectric dams. We purchased the balance of our energy needs from third parties. We have seven sites that operate cogeneration facilities and all of these sites generate primarily &#8220;green energy&#8221; from renewable biomass. In addition, we utilize alternative fuels such as methane from landfills, used oil and tire-derived fuel to reduce consumption of fossil fuels. 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had one hydroelectric generation and transmission network (Hydro-Saguenay in the Saguenay region of Quebec), which consisted of seven generating stations with 170 MW of capacity and generation of 1,076 GWh. The water rights agreements required to operate some of these facilities typically range from 10 to 25 years and, subject to certain conditions, are generally renewable for additional terms. In some cases, the agreements are contingent on the continued operation of the related paper mills and a minimum level of capital spending in the region. For the other facilities, the right to generate hydroelectricity stems from our ownership of the riverbed on which these facilities are located. 

Competition 

In general, our products, other than tissue, are globally-traded commodities and are marketed in close to 80 countries. The markets in which we compete are highly competitive and, aside from quality specifications to meet customer needs, the production of our products, other than tissue, does not depend upon a proprietary process or formula. Pricing and the level of shipments of our products are influenced by the balance between supply and demand as affected by global economic conditions, changes in consumption and capacity, the level of customer and producer inventories, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Any material decline in prices for our products or other adverse developments in the markets for our products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Prices for our products have been and are likely to continue to be highly volatile. 

We compete with a number of other major market pulp producers with operations in North America. Market pulp is a globally-traded commodity for which competition exists in all major markets. We produce six major grades of market pulp (northern and southern softwood, northern and southern hardwood, recycled bleached kraft and fluff) and compete with other producers from South America (eucalyptus hardwood and radiata pine softwood), Europe (northern hardwood and softwood) and Asia (mixed tropical hardwood). Price, quality, service and fiber sources are considered the main competitive determinants. 

We are an integrated manufacturer of tissue products and compete with several major competitors in the North American tissue market. The key competitive attributes in this market include price, product quality, service and customer relationships. Competition is also significantly affected by geographic location, as freight costs represent a material portion of the costs. We compete with branded products and low cost private-label products and with the three largest North American producers representing approximately 65% of the North American capacity in 2015. 

We compete in North America with both large North American and numerous smaller local lumber producers in a highly competitive market. We also compete with European producers in the North American market during periods of favorable currencies and prices. Because there are few distinctions between lumber from different producers, competition is primarily based on price. Competition is also affected by cost and availability of wood, freight cost and labor. 

Newsprint is produced by numerous manufacturers worldwide. In 2015 , the five largest North American producers represented approximately 83% of North American newsprint capacity and the five largest global producers represented approximately 33% of global newsprint capacity. Our total newsprint capacity is approximately 9% &#32;of worldwide newsprint capacity. We face competition from both large global producers and numerous smaller regional producers. Price, quality and customer relationships are important competitive determinants. 

Our specialty papers, including uncoated mechanical papers and coated mechanical papers, compete on the basis of price, quality, service and breadth of product line. With approximately 30% &#32;of North American uncoated mechanical papers capacity, we are the largest producer of uncoated mechanical papers in North America and the third largest in the world. We compete with numerous uncoated mechanical paper producers, with the five largest North American producers representing 75% of the North American uncoated mechanical papers capacity and the five largest global producers representing 51% of global uncoated mechanical papers capacity in 2015 . In addition, imports from overseas accounted for approximately 8% of North American uncoated mechanical paper demand in 2015 . We also compete with a number of other coated mechanical paper producers with operations in North America. In 2015 , the five largest North American producers represented approximately 94% of North American capacity for coated mechanical papers. We compete with numerous worldwide suppliers of other grades of paper such as coated freesheet and SC paper. Imports of coated mechanical papers accounted for approximately 13% of North American demand in 2015 . Since October 20, 2015, we have been required to make cash deposits at a subsidy rate of 17.87% for estimated and projected countervailing duties on SC papers we import to the U.S. from our Canadian mills. Based on our current operating parameters, the cash deposits could be as high as $25 million per year. For additional information, see Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors &#8211; We are subject to countervailing duty trade remedies on exports of our SC paper to the U.S., which could adversely affect our operations and cash flows,&#8221; of this Form 10-K. 

As with other global commodities, the competitive position of our products is significantly affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For additional information, see Item 7A, &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk &#8211; Foreign Currency Exchange Risk,&#8221; of this Form 10-K. 

Trends in advertising, electronic data transmission and storage, and the Internet are expected to have further adverse effects on the demand for traditional print media, including our products and those of our customers. For additional information, see Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors &#8211; Developments in alternative media are expected to continue to adversely affect the demand for some of our key products, especially in North America, and our responses to these developments may not be successful,&#8221; of this Form 10-K. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we employed approximately 8,000 &#32;people, of whom approximately 5,300 &#32;were represented by various unions, primarily Unifor, and the Confederation of National Trade Unions (the &#8220;CNTU&#8221;) in Canada and predominantly by the United Steelworkers International (the &#8220;USW&#8221;) in the U.S. In the past year, we renewed or entered into a number of agreements with unions, ranging between four and five-year periods, covering approximately 800 employees, primarily in our sawmills and woodlands in Canada. The collective agreements covering approximately 270 employees in Canada and 200 employees in the U.S. have expired in 2015, affecting two of our pulp and paper operations. We also have collective agreements covering approximately 800 employees in six sawmills and three woodlands operations in Canada that have either expired or are scheduled to expire in 2016. 

While we intend to renew collective agreements, there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew agreements on satisfactory terms, or that we will maintain continuously satisfactory agreements with all of our unionized employees. Should we be unable to do so, it could result in strikes, work stoppages or disturbances by affected employees, which could cause us to experience a disruption of operations and affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

Trademarks 

We have registrations or pending applications for our key trademarks &#8220;RESOLUTE&#8221; and &#8220;resolute Forest Products &#38; Design&#8221; in the countries of our principal markets, as well as &#8220;RESOLUTE FOREST PRODUCTS&#8221; and &#8220;R Design&#8221; in Canada and the United States, and &#8220;R&#201;SOLU&#8221; and &#8220;Produits forestiers r&#233;solu &#38; Design&#8221; in Canada. We consider our interest in these trademarks to be important and necessary to the conduct of our business. The current registrations of these trademarks are effective for various periods of time and may be renewed periodically, provided that we, as the registered owner, and/or licensee comply with all applicable renewal requirements. 

Environmental Matters 

We are subject to a variety of federal or national, state, provincial and local environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We believe our operations are in material compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations. While it is impossible to predict future environmental regulations that may be established, we believe that we will not be at a competitive disadvantage with regard to meeting future Canadian, United States or South Korean standards. For additional information, see Note 15, &#8220;Commitments and Contingencies &#32;&#8211; Environmental matters,&#8221; to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
