 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

We are a biotechnology company focused on designing, developing and commercializing innovative gene therapies, therapeutics and proprietary medical approaches to stimulate and guide an anti-tumor immune response for the treatment of cancer. We seek to overcome the problem of tumor-induced immune subversion via intratumoral immunotherapy. 

&#160; 

Our Business and Mission 

&#160; 

Our mission is to pursue the advancement of immune system-stimulating treatments through the advancement of our proprietary immunotherapy platform which is designed to overcome tumor immune tolerance. Our proprietary intratumoral electroporation-based therapy is a platform which includes immune modulating therapeutic product candidates intended to treat a wide range of solid tumor types, combined with our ImmunoPulse&#174; delivery technology. ImmunoPulse&#174; is an electroporation delivery device that we use in combination with our therapeutic product candidates, including DNA plasmids that encode for immunologically active agents, to deliver the therapeutic directly into the tumor and promote an inflammatory response against the cancer. This unique therapeutic modality is intended to reverse the immunosuppressive microenvironment in the tumor and engender a systemic anti-tumor response against untreated tumors in other parts of the body. Our electroporation delivery device consists of an electrical pulse generator and disposable applicators, which can be adapted to treat different tumor types. 

&#160; 

Our Strategy 

&#160; 

Traditional modalities for treating cancer have limited clinical efficacy and are frequently associated with significant morbidity. Immunotherapy, a relatively new therapeutic modality, focuses on modulating the immune system to treat cancer, rather than directly killing the cancer cells. Systemic delivery of immune-modulating proteins such as interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interleukin-12 (IL-12) have shown early encouraging results in terms of efficacy but with significant mechanism-based toxicity. More recently, monoclonal antibody (mAb) drugs have been developed, which target critical &#8220;immune checkpoint&#8221; proteins and augment anti-tumor immunity. Monoclonal antibodies such as, anti-CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4) and anti-PD-1 (program cell-death-1), have been developed for treatment of several indications, and have already been approved for treatment of metastatic melanoma and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. These new immuno-oncology agents have shown tremendous clinical benefit for those patients with late-stage cancer, across multiple tumor types. However, only a subset of patients responds to these therapies. 

&#160; 

We have several completed and have ongoing clinical trials for the use of our therapeutic candidates to treat different tumor types with our electroporation delivery device. We also continue to investigate collaboration opportunities that will enable us to identify rational combinations with current and emerging standard-of-care drugs, including immune-modulating checkpoint inhibitors (such as anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PD-1). We expect to continue to conduct additional clinical trials for our product candidates in accordance with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements, some of which may relate to therapeutic candidates for select, rare cancers (orphan indications) that have limited therapeutic options. Our strategy also includes expanding the applications of our technologies through strategic collaborations or evaluation of other opportunities such as in-licensing and strategic acquisitions. We may collaborate with major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and government agencies, providing us access to complementary technologies and/or greater resources. These business activities are intended to provide us with mutually beneficial opportunities to expand or advance our product pipeline. We may license our intellectual property to other companies to leverage our technologies for applications that may not be appropriate for our independent product development. 

&#160; 

Clinical Program 

&#160; 

Our lead product candidate, ImmunoPulse&#174; IL-12, consists of a plasmid construct encoding the proinflammatory cytokine, IL-12, which is delivered into the tumor through in vivo electroporation. A Phase 1 clinical trial in metastatic melanoma using electroporation to deliver plasmid-DNA encoding for the IL-12 cytokine was completed in 2008. The data, published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology (Daud A et al, JCO, 2008) indicate that the in vivo gene transfer of IL-12 DNA using electroporation in metastatic melanoma is safe. In addition, anti-tumor activity was observed after a single cycle of treatment, including two complete responses. Importantly, regression in distant, non-injected/non-electroporated lesions was also observed, suggesting that local treatment with ImmunoPulse&#174; IL-12 may lead to a systemic anti-tumor immune response (i.e. an abscopal effect). We are currently pursuing two Phase 2 trials: ImmunoPulse&#174; IL-12 monotherapy in patients with metastatic melanoma and ImmunoPulse&#174; IL-12 plus pembrolizumab in patients with advanced, metastatic melanoma. In addition, we are pursuing ImmunoPulse&#174; IL-12 monotherapy in patients with triple negative breast cancer. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

OMS-I100: An Open-Label Phase 2 Trial of ImmunoPulse &#174; IL-12 monotherapy in patients with metastatic melanoma 

&#160; 

On December 5, 2014, we released top-line six-month data from the first Phase 2 trial of this product candidate in patients with stage III and IV metastatic melanoma, which was presented in an abstract at the Melanoma Bridge 2014 conference in Naples, Italy. In this Phase 2 study, 30 patients with stage III and IV melanoma received up to four cycles of pIL-12 EP into superficial cutaneous, subcutaneous and nodal lesions on days 1, 5 and 8 of each 12-week cycle. We reported that of the 29 patients who were evaluable, an objective response rate of 31% (9/29) was observed, with 14% (4/29) of patients having a complete response (CR) and 17% (5/29) of patients having a partial response. Regression of distant lesions was seen in 50% (13/26) of patients with evaluable non-injected, non-electroporated lesions. Clinical endpoints included objective response rate, local and distant lesion regression, duration of response, overall survival and safety. The results of this study demonstrated that multiple treatment cycles of ImmunoPulse&#174; IL-12 is safe and well-tolerated, with no treatment-limiting toxicities. The vast majority of adverse events were localized to the treatment site and were Grade 1 or 2 in severity. Importantly, there was no evidence of systemic toxicities, which is a key feature of the ImmunoPulse&#174; IL-12 intratumoral treatment strategy. In order to continue to acquire clinical and immune correlational data on melanoma patients treated with ImmunoPulse&#174; IL-12, the protocol was amended to enroll up to an additional 30 patients (OMS-I100 Addendum). Enrollment in OMS-I100 Addendum is complete and activities related to closing out this clinical trial is underway, including completion of a clinical study report that will be filed to the FDA. 

&#160; 

Long-term, follow-up data of patients who participated in the OMS-I100 trial at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and later went on to receive an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy was presented by Dr. Alain Algazi at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2016 in New Orleans. These data suggest that ImmunoPulse&#174; IL-12 may prime and enhance response rates to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. Fourteen (14) of the 29 patients who completed ImmunoPulse&#174; IL-12 or progressed went on to receive an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody treatment. Overall, 5 of these 14 patients (36%) experienced a CR and 4 patients had a partial response (PR) (29%), for an ORR of 64%. Two patients experienced SD (14%) and three patients had progressive disease (21%) (Algazi et al. 2016; Chen and Daud 2016). The promising single-agent activity observed in the Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies, as well as the potential of an immune-priming effect with ImmunoPulse&#174; IL-12 prior to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy warrants further clinical investigation. 

&#160; 

We consider the results of the OMS-I100 Phase 2 study in advanced melanoma, along with the emerging long-term follow-up data, to be significant and thus we are continuing to identify and develop new therapeutic targets that, like IL-12, can (i) be encoded into DNA, (ii) be delivered intratumorally using electroporation, and (iii) have an ability to reverse the immunosuppressive mechanisms of the tumor. We plan to expand our ImmunoPulse&#174; pipeline beyond the delivery of plasmid-DNA encoding for cytokines to include other molecules that may be critical to key pathways associated with tumor immune subversion. 

&#160; 

OMS-I140: Triple Negative Breast Cancer &#8212; Biomarker-Focused Pilot Study 

&#160; 

Worldwide, approximately 170,000 new cases of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) are diagnosed each year, accounting for approximately 15% of all breast cancer. TNBC frequently affects younger women (less than 40 years old) and is characterized by higher relapse rates when compared with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancers. TNBC is also associated with an increased risk of recurrence, both locally and in distant sites including the lung and brain. Advanced TNBC remains a significant area of unmet medical need and there is no established standard-of-care. Treatment generally includes chemotherapy, with or without radiation and/or surgery. However, no treatment regimen has clearly demonstrated superiority. 

&#160; 

Toward the end of October 2015, we enrolled the first patient in our biomarker-focused pilot study of ImmunoPulse &#174; IL-12 in patients with TNBC. The study is open for enrollment and on-going. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the potential of ImmunoPulse&#174; IL-12 to promote a pro-inflammatory molecular and histological signature in tumor samples and the secondary objectives include the evaluation of safety and tolerability; evaluation of local ablation effect (% of necrosis) and description of other evidence of anti-tumor activity. The study is being conducted at Stanford University and is designed to assess whether ImmunoPulse&#174; IL-12 increases TNBC tumor immunogenicity by driving a pro-inflammatory cascade that leads to increases in cytotoxic tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). The presence and number of TILs is thought to be a key requirement for promoting the anti-tumor activity of antibodies like anti-PD-1/PD-L1. By driving cytotoxic immune cells into the tumor, ImmunoPulse&#174; IL-12 may be an ideal candidate to combine with checkpoint blockade therapies which have reported some, but limited activity in TNBC. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

CC-15852: An Open-Label Phase 2 Trial of ImmunoPulse&#174; IL-12 plus Pembrolizumab in Patients with Advanced, Metastatic Melanoma 

&#160; 

In August 2015, we enrolled the first patient into the Phase 2 investigator sponsored clinical trial led by the University of California, San Francisco to assess the anti-tumor activity, safety, and tolerability of the combination of ImmunoPulse &#174; IL-12, and Merck&#8217;s approved anti-PD-1 agent, KEYTRUDA&#174; (pembrolizumab), in patients with unresectable metastatic melanoma. The primary endpoint is the best Overall Response Rate (bORR) of the combination regimen in patients whose tumors are characterized by low numbers of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Recent data suggest that patients whose tumors are not associated with TILs or CD8+ T-cells at the tumor margin are unlikely to respond to anti-PD-1 therapies such as KEYTRUDA&#174;, while those who are PD-L1 positive and have increased TILs are more likely to have a clinical benefit. Therefore, therapies that promote TIL generation and PD-L1 positivity may play an important role in augmenting the clinical efficacy of the anti-PD1/PD-L1 agents. IL-12 is an inflammatory cytokine believed to be a master regulator of the immune system, promoting up-regulation of both the innate and adaptive immune responses and biasing the immune system towards a proinflammatory state. More specifically, IL-12 stimulates the production of another cytokine, interferon gamma (IFN-undefined), which, in turn, results in the stimulation of antigen processing and presentation machinery, leading to increased TILs and anti-tumor cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) activity. The sponsor of this investigator-initiated study, UCSF, expects to enroll up to 42 patients; The study is enrolling and on-going. We currently are on track to complete enrollment by the end of calendar year 2016. 

&#160; 

In addition to the three clinical trials described above, we have also pursued Phase 2 clinical trials in patients with merkel cell carcinoma and head and neck cancer. 

&#160; 

Our ImmunoPulse&#174; Platform 

&#160; 

The effectiveness of many drugs and DNA-based therapeutics is dependent upon their crossing the cell membrane. In the 1970s, it was discovered that the brief application of high-intensity, pulsed electric fields to the cell resulted in a temporary and reversible increase in the permeability of the cell membrane, a mechanism known as &#8220;electroporation.&#8221; 

&#160; 

The transient, reversible nature of the electrical permeabilization of cell membranes and the resulting increase in intracellular delivery of therapeutic agents is the underlying basis of our ImmunoPulse&#174; therapeutic approach. The electroporation delivery system consists of an electrical pulse generator and various disposable applicators. While the extent of membrane permeabilization depends on various electrical, physical, chemical, and biological parameters, research with electroporation delivery has demonstrated an improvement of cellular uptake of chemical molecules from 100 to 1,000-fold above baseline. After cessation of the electrical pulse, the membrane re-stabilizes, trapping the molecules within the cell and allowing them to perform their function. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

DNA Delivery With Electroporation &#8212; ImmunoPulse&#174; 

&#160; 

The greatest obstacles to the wide acceptance and use of DNA-based therapeutics has been the safe, efficient, and economical delivery and expression of plasmid-DNA constructs. We believe that electroporation is uniquely capable of overcoming these obstacles. Together with our partners and collaborators, we plan to be the leader in establishing electroporation-delivered DNA immunotherapies. We believe that electroporation could become the method of choice for plasmid-DNA delivery into cells in many clinical applications. 

&#160; 

The ImmunoPulse&#174; approach employs an electroporation system designed to create favorable conditions to deliver plasmid DNA encoding immunotherapeutic cytokines directly into cells of the tumor microenvironment. The cytokine-encoding plasmid is first injected into the selected tumor. A needle-electrode array then delivers the electrical pulses produced in the pulse generator. OncoSec is developing new technologies called TRACE and Helix to improve electroporation. TRACE, or tissue-based real-time adaptive control electroporation, technology is used to perform electroporation with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy feedback operating in a closed-loop configuration to optimize each pulse duration in real-time. The Helix technology improves the distribution of the therapeutic agent in tissue and achieves delivery to an area that is three times larger than a standard injection needle. 

&#160; 

Our ImmunoPulse&#174; product candidates are based on our proprietary DNA based immunotherapy technology, which is designed to stimulate the human immune system, resulting in systemic anti-tumor immune responses. Because our candidate therapeutics are plasmid constructs, we expect to benefit from a simpler, more consistent and scalable manufacturing process in comparison to therapies based on patient-derived cells or recombinant proteins. Our lead product candidate, ImmunoPulse&#174; IL-12, consists of a plasmid construct encoding the proinflammatory cytokine, IL-12, which is delivered into the tumor through in vivo electroporation. ImmunoPulse&#174; IL-12 is being studied in several open-label Phase 2 clinical trials. 

&#160; 

Cancer deploys multiple immune-subversive mechanisms in parallel to suppress anti-tumor immune responses and we believe it is unlikely that any single immunotherapy product will suffice to achieve durable responses in most patients and in most tumor types. Therefore, we are conducting research and development on other DNA-encoded, immunologically-active molecules with an aim to produce additional immunotherapeutic drugs capable of breaking the immune system&#8217;s tolerance to cancer. We have the opportunity to leverage the flexibility of a DNA plasmid-based technology to rapidly pursue candidate molecules and combinations of therapeutics. We can introduce, for example, pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, immune stimulatory receptors, co-stimulatory molecules, adhesion molecules, and T-cell engagement molecules. We expect that electroporation-mediated intratumoral expression of immunologically-active molecules such as these can reverse the immunosuppressive microenvironment of the tumor and drive systemic anti-tumor immune responses while limiting systemic exposure and toxicities associated with these potent immunologic effector molecules. 

&#160; 

Advisory Panels 

&#160; 

We have consulted with senior and respected oncology researchers and clinicians to provide counsel as part of our advisory panels for our ImmunoPulse&#174; clinical programs. We expect to continue to establish relationships with scientific, clinical and medical experts in academia, as needed, to assist us on issues related to potential product applications, product development, and clinical testing. 

&#160; 

Commercialization 

&#160; 

We plan to continue our clinical development strategy for the ImmunoPulse&#174; IL-12 program with Phase 2 and subsequent pivotal clinical trials focused on various cancers, including those that have a demonstrated response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint therapies such as metastatic melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. We believe that there is a significant unmet medical need for patients who are non-responsive or refractory to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies. 

&#160; 

We hope to be first-to-market in treatment for metastatic melanoma for patients who are non-responsive or refractory to currently approved anti-PD-1 checkpoint therapies. We continue to also focus on partnering and commercialization strategies that leverage Phase 2 clinical studies in the United States. Our near term plan is to identify and engage potential partners who are established industry leaders in the field of immuno-oncology, or plan to expand their portfolio in this space. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We are in a highly competitive industry. We are in competition with traditional and alternative therapies for the indications we are targeting, as well as pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, hospitals, research organizations, individual scientists and nonprofit organizations engaged in the development of drugs and other therapies for these indications. Our competitors may succeed, and many have already succeeded, in developing competing products, obtaining FDA approval for products, or gaining patient and physician acceptance of products before us for the same markets and indications that we are targeting. Many of these companies, and large pharmaceutical companies in particular, have greater research and development, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing, financial and managerial resources, and experience than we have, and many of these companies may have products and product candidates that are in a more advanced stage of development than our product candidates. If we are not &#8220;first to market&#8221; for a particular indication, it may be more difficult for us or our collaborators to effectively enter markets unless we can demonstrate our products are clearly superior to existing therapies (see also &#8220;Intellectual Property&#8221; below). 

&#160; 

Examples of competitive therapies include the following: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; &#9679; Immunotherapy . This therapeutic approach stimulates the patient&#8217;s own immune system to attack malignant tumor cells, which have managed to circumvent the body&#8217;s natural immune processes that would normally recognize and destroy these cells before they are able to form growing cancerous tumors. Several methods have been employed to evoke this immune response, including monoclonal antibodies and autologous cell-based vaccines, as well as viral and non-viral targeted delivery of immunotherapeutic agents. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; YERVOY&#174; (ipilimumab), approved in 2011, is a monoclonal antibody that acts to block the CTLA-4 receptor (an immune checkpoint receptor) on T-cells. In the presence of CTLA-4 receptor it is believed tumors are able to suppress the immune system from recognizing cancerous cells, however blockade of this receptor with YERVOY&#174; (an anti-CTLA-4 antibody) appears to allow the immune system to generate an antitumor T-cell response. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; YERVOY&#174; was the first approved immunotherapy in melanoma, and current research is evaluating the use of other anti-checkpoint monoclonal antibodies. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Other monoclonal antibodies approved that act to block a checkpoint receptor, PD-1, were recently approved by the FDA. KEYTRUDA&#174; (pembrolizumab) and OPDIVO&#174; (nivolumab), were both approved for use in late-stage unresectable metastatic melanoma in 2014 based on the impressive objective response rate data from Phase I and II clinical trials. A third monoclonal antibody like KEYTRUDA and OPDIVO, that targets the PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint axis, TECENTRIQ (atezolizumab), was approved on May 18, 2016 by the FDA for the treatment of urothelial carcinoma, the most common type of bladder cancer. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Moreover, there are an increasing number of combination immunotherapies being evaluated, including combinations of checkpoint inhibitor therapies. In October 2015, the FDA announced the approval of the first immune checkpoint inhibitor combination of YERVOY&#174; (ipilimumab) plus OPDIVO&#174; (nivolumab) in advanced melanoma. We expect more approvals of this combination, and other novel combinations, to be approved in the coming years as more and more combinations continue to be investigated. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Provenge&#174;, a product developed and marketed by Dendreon Corporation, and many emerging therapies continue to employ an autologous cell-based mode of delivery, which involves the harvesting of a patient&#8217;s own cells, growing them in a lab, incubating with a vaccine or immune stimulating agent, and re-administering the resulting product to the patient. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Other cell-based approaches include Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocyte (TIL) and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CART) therapies. These therapies continue to be investigated in clinical trials for both solid and hematologic cancers. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Viral vectors, such as adenoviruses and oncolytic viruses, have also been used to deliver immunotherapeutic payloads to fight against cancerous cells, either systemically or through direct injection into the tumor. Clinical trials for this therapeutic delivery method are ongoing with no approved therapies yet to be available in the clinic. Recently, Amgen&#8217;s tamoligene laherparapvec, or T-VEC, completed its Phase III trial and met its primary endpoint. This data was presented to the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee, who voted to recommend approval of this therapy to the FDA. The final decision on approval of this therapy remains with the FDA. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Other non-viral vector methods, that deliver nucleic-acid based therapies, are also currently being developed and employed in ongoing clinical trials. Examples of other non-viral vector methods include, liposome-based delivery systems, bacterial-based delivery systems, and mechanical delivery systems. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Vaccination . The use of peripheral vaccination has long held interest as another potential modality that could prove beneficial in treating and limiting systemic oncologic disease. Several antigen-specific investigational vaccines have been tested in humans in the past, in particular in melanoma, such as MAGE-A3, however none of these have proven to be successful in a large Phase 3 registration trial. &#160; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

We have assembled a senior management team with many years of experience and success in biotech/pharma operations, business and commercial development, and capital markets. In addition, we have assembled a clinical and regulatory team experienced in developing and advancing novel therapeutic approaches through clinical testing and regulatory approvals. As of October 7, 2016, we have a total of 46 employees. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe that our relations with our employees are good. 

&#160; 

We expect to hire additional staff and to engage consultants in regulatory, compliance, investor and public relations, and general administration as necessary. We also expect to engage experts in healthcare and in general business to advise us in various capacities. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

Our success and ability to compete depends upon our intellectual property. We have acquired or been issued 28 U.S. patents and have two U.S. patent applications pending. We have filed 14 U.S. provisional patent applications, and have converted three provisional applications into regular utility applications. We will continue to file additional patent applications, when appropriate. We have a total of 13 issued patents and six pending patent applications in other jurisdictions. In addition, we have licensed intellectual property rights that allow us to use certain electroporation technology and methods of delivering DNA-based cytokines as an immunotherapy, including using catheter-based delivery. The bulk of our patents, including fundamental patents directed toward our proprietary technology, expire between 2017 and 2027. 

&#160; 

We are party to a cross-license agreement with Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (&#8220;Inovio&#8221;), which we entered into concurrently with the closing of our acquisition of certain assets from Inovio in 2011. This agreement provides for the exclusive license to Inovio of patent rights sold to us by Inovio. Inovio is restricted to using these patent rights for the electroporation mediated delivery of gene or nucleic acids, outside of those encoding cytokines. We received a non-exclusive cross-license by Inovio to patent rights related to certain technology patents in exchange for specified sublicensing and other licensing fees and royalties. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

United States 

&#160; 

In the United States, our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. Federal and state statutes and regulations, many of which are administered by the FDA, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA&#8217;s refusal to approve pending applications, a clinical hold, warning letters, recall or seizure of products, partial or total suspension of production, withdrawal of the product from the market, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. 

&#160; 

FDA approval is required before any new unapproved drug or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves, among other things: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; completion of pre-clinical testing and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA&#8217;s good laboratory practice regulations; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; performance of adequate human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each intended use; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA, which the FDA must review and approve. &#160; 

The pre-clinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and the receipt and timing of approval, if any, is highly uncertain. The results of pre-clinical tests, together with certain manufacturing information, analytical data and a proposed clinical trial protocol and other information, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. Once an IND is in effect, the protocol for each clinical trial to be conducted under the IND must be submitted to the FDA, which may or may not allow the trial to proceed. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with good clinical practice requirements. For purposes of an NDA submission and approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Phase 1 : The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, and excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Phase 2 : The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications, and to determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase II clinical trials may be conducted. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Phase 3 : The drug is administered in large patient populations to obtain additional evidence of clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at multiple, geographically-dispersed clinical trial sites and to establish the overall risk-benefit relationship of the drug. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Phase 4 : In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA for a product candidate on the sponsor&#8217;s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the drug&#8217;s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval. &#160; 

The results of product development, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. NDAs must also contain extensive information relating to the product&#8217;s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. 

&#160; 

Once the submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. Pursuant to the FDA&#8217;s performance goals, NDA reviews are to be completed within ten months, subject to extensions by the FDA. Before approving an NDA, the FDA often inspects the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured and will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with good manufacturing practices. Additionally, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with good clinical practices before approving an NDA. If the FDA determines that the NDA is not acceptable, then the FDA may outline the deficiencies in the NDA and often will request additional information or additional clinical trials. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional testing or information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 

&#160; 

Even if regulatory approval of a product candidate is obtained, such approval will usually impose limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed. Additionally, the FDA may require post-approval testing, such as Phase IV studies, or surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. 

&#160; 

After FDA approval, a product will be subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to drug/device listing, recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, manufacturing practices, labeling, advertising and promotion, and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. The FDA may withdraw its approval of a product if compliance with regulatory requirements and manufacturing standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things: restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product; complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; or injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 

&#160; 

International Regulation 

&#160; 

When we pursue research and/or commercialization of our product candidates in countries other than the United States, we will need to obtain the necessary approvals by the regulatory authorities of such foreign countries comparable to the FDA before we could commence clinical trials or marketing of our product candidates in those countries, and we would be subject to a variety of foreign regulations regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. The approval processes and requirements vary by country and can involve additional product testing and additional review periods, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. 

&#160; 

Other Regulatory Requirements and Environmental Matters 

&#160; 

We are or may become subject to various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices and the experimental use of animals, as well as environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, any use and disposal by us of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research. In each of these areas, as above, the FDA and other government agencies have broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including, among other things, the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products, and withdraw approvals, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on us. Additionally, if we are able to successfully obtain approvals for and commercialize our product candidates, then we may become subject to various federal, state, and local laws targeting fraud, abuse, privacy, and security in the healthcare industry.

Manufacturing 

&#160; 

We currently contract with third parties for the manufacture, testing and storage of our plasmid product candidate and intend to continue to do so in the future. We currently assemble certain components of our electroporation systems, which is our delivery mechanism for our biologic to a patient&#8217;s cell. We utilize the services of contract manufacturers to manufacture the remaining components of these systems and our product supplies for clinical trials and intend to continue to do so in the future. We are ISO 13485 certified and have an audited quality management system. In addition, all manufacturers of our products must comply with cGMP requirements enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. 

&#160; 

We do not own and have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial plasmid manufacturing capabilities. The use of contracted manufacturing is relatively cost-efficient and has eliminated the need for our direct investment in manufacturing facilities. Because we rely on contract manufacturers, we employ personnel with extensive technical, manufacturing, analytical and quality experience to oversee contract manufacturing and testing activities, and to compile manufacturing and quality information for our regulatory submissions. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements, and which govern record keeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance, among others. Our systems and our contractors are required to be in compliance with these regulations, and this is assessed regularly through monitoring of performance and a formal audit program. We believe that there are alternate sources of raw material supply and finished goods manufacturing that can satisfy our requirements, although we cannot be certain that transitioning to such vendors, if necessary, would not result in significant delay or material additional costs. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

We recognized $14.7 million and $13.1 million in research and development expenses in the fiscal years ended July 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. From our inception through July 31, 2016, we have incurred an aggregate of approximately $39.7 million of research and development expenses, the significant majority of which relate to our development of immuno-oncology therapeutic product candidates, with the use of an electroporation device.
