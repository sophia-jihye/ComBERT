CITIZENS FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. 

&#160;

Citizens Financial Services, Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;), a Pennsylvania corporation, was incorporated on April 30, 1984 to be the holding company for First Citizens Community Bank (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;), which until 2012, and in connection with its conversion from a national bank to a Pennsylvania-chartered bank and trust company, operated under the name First Citizens National Bank. The Company is primarily engaged in the ownership and management of the Bank and the Bank&#8217;s wholly-owned insurance agency subsidiary, First Citizens Insurance Agency, Inc. On December 11, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of The First National Bank of Fredericksburg (&#8220;FNB&#8221;) by merging FNB into the Bank, with the Bank as the resulting institution.

&#160;

FIRST CITIZENS COMMUNITY BANK 

&#160;

The Bank is a full-service bank engaged in a broad range of banking activities and services for individual, business, governmental and institutional customers. These activities and services principally include checking, savings, and time deposit accounts; residential, commercial and agricultural real estate, commercial and industrial, state and political subdivision and consumer loans; and a variety of other specialized financial services. The Trust and Investment division of the Bank offers a full range of client investment, estate, mineral management and retirement services. 

&#160;

The Bank&#8217;s main office is located at 15 South Main Street, Mansfield, (Tioga County) Pennsylvania. The Bank&#8217;s primary market area consists of the Pennsylvania Counties of Bradford, Clinton, Potter and Tioga in north central Pennsylvania. It also includes Allegany, Steuben, Chemung and Tioga Counties in Southern New York. With the completion of the FNB acquisition, the Bank has added seven additional banking offices in south central Pennsylvania; four offices in Lebanon Country, two offices in Schuylkill County, and one office in Berks County. The economy of the Bank&#8217;s market areas are diversified and include manufacturing industries, wholesale and retail trade, service industries, agricultural and the production of natural resources of gas and timber. We are dependent geographically upon the economic conditions in both north central and south central Pennsylvania, as well as the southern tier of New York. In addition to the main office in Mansfield and the additional seven offices acquired from FNB, the Bank has 16 other full service branch offices in its market areas. 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, the Bank had 229 full time employees and 51 part-time employees, resulting in 246 full time equivalent employees at our corporate offices and other banking locations. 

&#160;

COMPETITION 

&#160;

The banking industry in the Bank&#8217;s service area is intensely competitive, both among commercial banks and with financial service providers such as consumer finance companies, thrifts, investment firms, mutual funds, insurance companies, credit unions, mortgage banking firms, financial companies, financial affiliates of industrial companies, internet entities, and government sponsored agencies, such as Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, provide additional competition for loans and other financial services. The overall economy, which continues to be sluggish, has also increased competitive pressures particularly for entities seeking loan growth. Additionally, north central Pennsylvania has benefited from additional wealth resulting from the exploration for natural gas in our primary market. This has resulted in increased competition from brokerage firms and retirement fund management firms. The Bank is generally competitive with all competing financial institutions in its service areas with respect to interest rates paid on time and savings deposits, service charges on deposit accounts and interest rates charged on loans.

&#160;

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 

GENERAL 

&#160; 

The Bank is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking (&#8220;PDB&#8221;) and, as a member of the Federal Reserve System, by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;FRB&#8221;). Federal and state banking laws and regulations govern, among other things, the scope of a bank&#8217;s business, the investments a bank may make, the reserves against deposits a bank must maintain, terms of deposit accounts, loans a bank makes, the interest rates a bank charges and collateral a bank takes, the activities of a bank with respect to mergers and consolidations and the establishment of branches. The Company is registered as a bank holding company and is subject to supervision and regulation by FRB under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the &#8220;BHCA&#8221;). 

PENNSYLVANIA BANKING LAWS 

&#160; 

The Pennsylvania Banking Code (&#8220;Banking Code&#8221;) contains detailed provisions governing the organization, location of offices, rights and responsibilities of directors, officers, and employees, as well as corporate powers, savings and investment operations and other aspects of the Bank and its affairs. The Banking Code delegates extensive rule-making power and administrative discretion to the PDB so that the supervision and regulation of state chartered banks may be flexible and readily responsive to changes in economic conditions and in savings and lending practices. 

&#160; 

Pennsylvania law also provides Pennsylvania state chartered institutions elective parity with the power of national banks, federal thrifts, and state-chartered institutions in other states as authorized by the FDIC, subject to a required notice to the PDB. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Act (&#8220;FDIA&#8221;), however, prohibits state chartered banks from making new investments, loans, or becoming involved in activities as principal and equity investments which are not permitted for national banks unless (1) the FDIC determines the activity or investment does not pose a significant risk of loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund and (2) the bank meets all applicable capital requirements. Accordingly, the additional operating authority provided to the Bank by the Banking Code is restricted by the FDIA. 

&#160;

In April 2008, banking regulators in the States of New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (the &#8220;Interstate MOU&#8221;) to clarify their respective roles, as home and host state regulators, regarding interstate branching activity on a regional basis pursuant to the Riegle-Neal Amendments Act of 1997. The Interstate MOU establishes the regulatory responsibilities of the respective state banking regulators regarding bank regulatory examinations and is intended to reduce the regulatory burden on state chartered banks branching within the region by eliminating duplicative host state compliance exams. Under the Interstate MOU, the activities of branches we established in New York would be governed by Pennsylvania state law to the same extent that federal law governs the activities of the branch of an out-of-state national bank in such host states. Issues regarding whether a particular host state law is preempted are to be determined in the first instance by the PDB. In the event that the PDB and the applicable host state regulator disagree regarding whether a particular host state law is pre-empted, the PDB and the applicable host state regulator would use their reasonable best efforts to consider all points of view and to resolve the disagreement. 

&#160;

COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT 

&#160;

The Community Reinvestment Act, (&#8220;CRA&#8221;), as implemented by FRB regulations, provides that the Bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with its safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution&#8217;s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. The CRA requires the FRB, in connection with its examination of the Bank, to assess the institution&#8217;s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain corporate applications by such institution, such as mergers and branching. The Bank&#8217;s most recent rating was &#8220;Satisfactory.&#8221; Various consumer laws and regulations also affect the operations of the Bank. In addition to the impact of regulation, commercial banks are affected significantly by the actions of the FRB as it attempts to control the money supply and credit availability in order to influence the economy. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

THE DODD-FRANK ACT 

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (&#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) has significantly changed the current bank regulatory structure and will affect it into the immediate future the lending and investment activities and general operations of depository institutions and their holding companies. 

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FRB to establish minimum consolidated capital requirements for bank holding companies that are as stringent as those required for insured depository institutions; the components of Tier 1 capital would be restricted to capital instruments that are currently considered to be Tier 1 capital for insured depository institutions. In addition, the proceeds of trust preferred securities are excluded from Tier 1 capital unless (i) such securities are issued by bank holding companies with assets of less than $500 million or (ii) such securities were issued prior to May 19, 2010 by bank or savings and loan holding companies with less than $15 billion of assets. The exclusion of such proceeds are phased in over a three year period beginning in 2013. 

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Act also created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with extensive powers to implement and enforce consumer protection laws. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks, among other things, including the authority to prohibit &#8220;unfair, deceptive or abusive&#8221; acts and practices. However, institutions of less than $10 billion in assets, such as the Bank, will continue to be examined for compliance with consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations by, and be subject to the enforcement authority of, their prudential regulators. 

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Act created a new supervisory structure for oversight of the U.S. financial system, including the establishment of a new council of regulators, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, to monitor and address systemic risks to the financial system. Non-bank financial companies that are deemed to be significant to the stability of the U.S. financial system and all bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets will be subject to heightened supervision and regulation. The FRB will implement prudential requirements and prompt corrective action procedures for such companies. 

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Act made many other changes in banking regulation. Those include allowing depository institutions, for the first time, to pay interest on business checking accounts, requiring originators of securitized loans to retain a percentage of the risk for transferred loans, establishing regulatory rate-setting for certain debit card interchange fees and establishing a number of reforms for mortgage originations. Effective October 1, 2011, the debit-card interchange fee was capped at $0.21 per transaction, plus an additional 5 basis point charge to cover fraud losses. These fees are much lower than the current market rates. Although the regulation only impacts banks with assets above $10 billion, we believe that the provisions could result in a reduction in interchange revenue in the future. 

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Act also broadened the base for FDIC insurance assessments. The FDIC was required to promulgate rules revising its assessment system so that it is based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of an insured institution instead of deposits. That rule took effect April 1, 2011. The Dodd-Frank Act also permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor, retroactive to January 1, 2008. 

&#160;

Under provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act referred to as the &#8220;Volcker Rule&#8221; certain limitations are placed on the ability of bank holding companies and their affiliates to engage in sponsoring, investing in and transacting with certain investment funds, including hedge funds and private equity funds (collectively &#8220;covered funds&#8221;). The Volcker Rule also places restrictions on proprietary trading, which could impact certain hedging activities. The Volcker Rule became fully effective in July 2015. We do not expect this rule to have a material impact on the Company. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to promulgate numerous and extensive implementing regulations. Although the substance and scope of many of these regulations cannot be determined at this time, particularly those provisions relating to the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Dodd-Frank Act and implementing regulations may have a material impact on operations through, among other things, increased compliance costs, heightened regulatory supervision, and higher interest expense. 

&#160;

CURRENT CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS 

&#160;

Federal regulations require FDIC-insured depository institutions, including state-chartered, FRB-member banks, to meet several minimum capital standards. These capital standards were effective January 1, 2015, and result from a final rule implementing regulatory amendments based on recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. 

&#160;

The capital standards require the maintenance of common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, 6.0% and 8.0%, respectively, and a leverage ratio of at least 4% of Tier 1 capital. Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders&#8217; equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and Additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital generally includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus Additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;), up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. The Company has exercised the AOCI opt-out option and therefore AOCI is not incorporated into common equity Tier 1 capital. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations. 

&#160;

In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50% is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one- to four-family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100% is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150% is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0% to 600% is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors. 

&#160;

In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions by the institution and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if an institution does not hold a &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement is being phased in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increasing each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019. 

&#160;

The FRB has authority to establish individual minimum capital requirements in appropriate cases upon a determination that an institution&#8217;s capital level is or may become inadequate in light of the particular risks or circumstances. 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we met all applicable capital adequacy requirements. 

&#160;

PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION RULES 

&#160;

Federal law establishes a system of prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions. The law requires that certain supervisory actions be taken against undercapitalized institutions, the severity of which depends on the degree of undercapitalization. The FRB has adopted regulations to implement the prompt corrective action legislation as to state member banks. The regulations were amended to incorporate the previously mentioned increased regulatory capital standards that were effective January 1, 2015. An institution is deemed to be &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or greater. An institution is &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5% or greater. An institution is &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 4.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5%. An institution is deemed to be &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 3.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0%. An institution is considered to be &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Subject to a narrow exception, a receiver or conservator must be appointed for an institution that is &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; within specified time frames. The regulations also provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the FRB within 45 days of the date an institution is deemed to have received notice that it is &#8220;undercapitalized,&#8221; &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; or &#8220;critically undercapitalized.&#8221; Compliance with the capital restoration plan must be guaranteed by any parent holding company up to the lesser of 5% of the depository institution&#8217;s total assets when it was deemed to be undercapitalized or the amount necessary to achieve compliance with applicable capital requirements. In addition, numerous mandatory supervisory actions become immediately applicable to an undercapitalized institution including, but not limited to, increased monitoring by regulators and restrictions on growth, capital distributions and expansion. The FRB could also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors. Significantly and critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to additional mandatory and discretionary measures. 

&#160;

STANDARDS FOR SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS 

&#160;

The federal banking agencies have adopted Interagency Guidelines prescribing Standards for Safety and Soundness in various areas such as internal controls and information systems, internal audit, loan documentation and credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth and quality, earnings and compensation, fees and benefits. The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the FRB determines that a state member bank fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the FRB may require the institution to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. 

&#160;

ENFORCEMENT 

&#160;

The PDB maintains enforcement authority over the Bank, including the power to issue cease and desist orders and civil money penalties and remove directors, officers or employees. The PDB also has the power to appoint a conservator or receiver for a bank upon insolvency, imminent insolvency, unsafe or unsound condition or certain other situations. The FRB has primary federal enforcement responsibility over FRB-member state banks and has authority to bring actions against the institution and all institution-affiliated parties, including shareholders, who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful actions likely to have an adverse effect on the bank. Formal enforcement action may range from the issuance of a capital directive or a cease and desist order, to removal of officers and/or directors. Civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and can amount to $25,000 per day, or even $1 million per day in especially egregious cases. The FDIC, as deposit insurer, has the authority to recommend to the FRB that enforcement action be taken with respect to a member bank. If the FRB does not take action, the FDIC has authority to take such action under certain circumstances. In general, regulatory enforcement actions occur with respect to situations involving unsafe or unsound practices or conditions, violations of law or regulation or breaches of fiduciary duty. Federal and Pennsylvania law also establish criminal penalties for certain violations. 

&#160;

REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS ON BANK DIVIDENDS 

&#160;

The Bank may not declare a dividend without approval of the FRB, unless the dividend to be declared by the Bank's Board of Directors does not exceed the total of: (i) the Bank's net profits for the current year to date, plus (ii) its retained net profits for the preceding two years, less any required transfers to surplus. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Under Pennsylvania law, the Bank may only declare and pay dividends from its accumulated net earnings. In addition, the Bank may not declare and pay dividends from the surplus funds that Pennsylvania law requires that it maintain. Under these policies and subject to the restrictions applicable to the Bank, the Bank could have declared, during 2015, without prior regulatory approval, aggregate dividends of approximately $9.2 million, plus net profits earned to the date of such dividend declaration. 

&#160;

BANK SECRECY ACT 

&#160;

Under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), banks and other financial institutions are required to retain records to assure that the details of financial transactions can be traced if investigators need to do so. Banks are also required to report most cash transactions in amounts exceeding $10,000 made by or on behalf of their customers. Failure to meet BSA requirements may expose the Bank to statutory penalties, and a negative compliance record may affect the willingness of regulating authorities to approve certain actions by the Bank requiring regulatory approval, including new branches. 

&#160;

INSURANCE OF DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS 

&#160;

The Bank&#8217;s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) of the FDIC. Under the FDIC&#8217;s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors, with less risky institutions paying lower assessments. An institution&#8217;s assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned, and certain adjustments specified by FDIC regulations. Until recently, assessment rates ranged from seven to 77.5 basis points of assessable deposits. 

&#160;

As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC has issued final rules implementing changes to the assessment rules. The rules change the assessment base used for calculating deposit insurance assessments from deposits to total assets less tangible (Tier 1) capital. Since the new base is larger than the previous base, the FDIC also lowered assessment rates so that the rule would not significantly alter the total amount of revenue collected from the industry. The range of adjusted assessment rates is now 2.5 to 45 basis points of the new assessment base. The rule is expected to benefit smaller financial institutions, which typically rely more on deposits for funding, and shift more of the burden for supporting the insurance fund to larger institutions, which are thought to have greater access to nondeposit funding. No institution may pay a dividend if it is in default of its assessments. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, deposit insurance per account owner is $250,000 for all types of accounts. 

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum target DIF ratio from 1.15% of estimated insured deposits to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. The FDIC must seek to achieve the 1.35% ratio by September 30, 2020. Insured institutions with assets of $10 billion or more are supposed to fund the increase. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the 1.5% maximum fund ratio, instead leaving it to the discretion of the FDIC. The FDIC has recently exercised that discretion by establishing a long range fund ratio of 2%. 

&#160;

The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. A significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank. Management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future. 

&#160;

Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or regulatory condition imposed in writing. The management of the Bank does not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance. 

&#160;

FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 

&#160;

Under FRB regulations, the Bank is required to maintain reserves against its transaction accounts (primarily NOW and regular checking accounts). For 2016, the Bank is required to maintain average daily reserves equal to 3% on aggregate transaction accounts of up to $110.0 million, plus 10% on the remainder, and the first $15.2 million of otherwise reservable balances will be exempt. These reserve requirements are subject to annual adjustment by the FRB. The Bank is in compliance with the foregoing requirements. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

ACQUISITION OF THE HOLDING COMPANY 

&#160;

Under the Federal Change in Bank Control Act (the &#8220;CIBCA&#8221;), a notice must be submitted to the FRB if any person (including a company), or group acting in concert, seeks to acquire 10% or more of the Company&#8217;s shares of outstanding common stock, unless the FRB has found that the acquisition will not result in a change in control of the Company. Under the CIBCA, the FRB generally has 60 days within which to act on such notices, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer, the convenience and needs of the communities served by the Company and the Bank, and the anti-trust effects of the acquisition. Under the BHCA, any company would be required to obtain prior approval from the FRB before it may obtain &#8220;control&#8221; of the Company within the meaning of the BHCA. Control generally is defined to mean the ownership or power to vote 25% or more of any class of voting securities of the Company or the ability to control in any manner the election of a majority of the Company&#8217;s directors. An existing bank holding company would be required to obtain the FRB&#8217;s prior approval under the BHCA before acquiring more than 5% of the Company&#8217;s voting stock. 

&#160;

HOLDING COMPANY REGULATION 

&#160;

The Company, as a bank holding company, is subject to examination, supervision, regulation, and periodic reporting under the BHCA, as administered by the FRB. The Company is required to obtain the prior approval of the FRB to acquire all, or substantially all, of the assets of any bank or bank holding company. Prior FRB approval would be required for the Company to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting securities of any bank or bank holding company if it would, directly or indirectly, own or control more than 5% of any class of voting shares of the bank or bank holding company. 

&#160;

A bank holding company is generally prohibited from engaging in, or acquiring, direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting securities of any company engaged in nonbanking activities. One of the principal exceptions to this prohibition is for activities found by the FRB to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Some of the principal activities that the FRB has determined by regulation to be closely related to banking are: (i) making or servicing loans; (ii) performing certain data processing services; (iii) providing securities brokerage services; (iv) acting as fiduciary, investment or financial advisor; (v) leasing personal or real property under certain conditions; (vi) making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare; and (vii) acquiring a savings association. 

&#160;

A bank holding company that meets specified conditions, including that its depository institutions subsidiaries are &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; and &#8220;well managed,&#8221; can opt to become a &#8220;financial holding company.&#8221; A &#8220;financial holding company&#8221; may engage in a broader array of financial activities than permitted a typical bank holding company. Such activities can include insurance underwriting and investment banking. The Company does not anticipate opting for &#8220;financial holding company&#8221; status at this time. 

&#160;

The Company is subject to the FRB&#8217;s consolidated capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies. Traditionally, those guidelines have been structured similarly to the regulatory capital requirements for the subsidiary depository institutions, but were somewhat more lenient. For example, the holding company capital requirements allowed inclusion of certain instruments in Tier 1 capital that are not includable at the institution level. As previously noted, the Dodd-Frank Act requires that the guidelines be amended so that they are at least as stringent as those required for the subsidiary depository institutions. See &#160;&#8220;&#8212;The Dodd-Frank Act.&#8221; 

&#160;

A bank holding company is generally required to give the FRB prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of then outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the Company&#8217;s consolidated net worth. The FRB may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, FRB order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the FRB. The FRB has adopted an exception to that approval requirement for well-capitalized bank holding companies that meet certain other conditions. 

&#160;

The FRB has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends by bank holding companies. In general, the FRB&#8217;s policies provide that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the bank holding company appears consistent with the organization&#8217;s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The FRB&#8217;s policies also require that a bank holding company serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks by using available resources to provide capital funds during periods of financial stress or adversity and by maintaining the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks where necessary. The Dodd-Frank Act codified the source of strength policy and requires the promulgation of implementing regulations. Under the prompt corrective action laws, the ability of a bank holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of the Company to pay dividends or otherwise engage in capital distributions.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Act makes depository institutions liable to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for losses suffered or anticipated by the insurance fund in connection with the default of a commonly controlled depository institution or any assistance provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to such an institution in danger of default. That law would have potential applicability if the Company ever held as a separate subsidiary a depository institution in addition to the Bank.

The status of the Company as a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act will not exempt it from certain federal and state laws and regulations applicable to corporations generally, including, without limitation, certain provisions of the federal securities laws.

EFFECT OF GOVERNMENT MONETARY POLICIES 

&#160;

The earnings and growth of the banking industry are affected by the credit policies of monetary authorities, including the Federal Reserve System. An important function of the Federal Reserve System is to regulate the national supply of bank credit in order to control recessionary and inflationary pressures. Among the instruments of monetary policy used by the Federal Reserve to implement these objectives are open market activities in U.S. government securities, changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits. These operations are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and indirectly, bank loans, securities, and deposits. These variables may also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve authorities have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to have such an effect in the future. 

&#160;

In view of the changing conditions in the national economy and in the money markets, as well as the effect of actions by monetary and fiscal authorities including the Federal Reserve System, no prediction can be made as to possible changes in interest rates, deposit levels, loan demand or their effect on the business and earnings of the Company and the Bank. Additional information is included under the caption &#8220; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8221; appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
