&#160; 

COMPANY BACKGROUND 

&#160; 

Evolving Systems was founded in 1985 to provide software and services to the U.S. telecommunications industry. During our early years our product focus was on solutions that supported number management and number porting. In November 2004, we expanded our product set and geographical reach with the acquisition of Tertio Telecoms Ltd. (&#147;Evolving Systems U.K.&#148;), a supplier of Operations Support Systems (&#147;OSS&#148;) software solutions for service activation and mediation to communication carriers throughout Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia. With this acquisition we not only expanded our markets beyond North America, we also added service activation and billing mediation solutions to our product portfolio. The acquisition significantly expanded our product and service capabilities, allowing us to address a larger portion of our customers&#146; OSS application needs with a balanced mix of products as well as services. We currently focus primarily on the wireless markets in the areas of mobile marketing analytics, subscriber activation, SIM card management and activation, self&#151;service mobile applications, data enablement solutions, connected device activation and management of services. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

On July 1, 2011, we sold our numbering solutions business to NeuStar, Inc. for $39.4 million in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities (the &#147;Asset Sale&#148;). As a result of the Asset Sale we no longer sell local number portability or number management solution products in North America. 

&#160; 

On October 24, 2013 we acquired privately held Telespree Communications (&#147;Telespree&#148;), now known as Evolving Systems Labs, Inc. (&#147;Evolving Systems Labs&#148;), for an initial payment of approximately $1.6 million, comprised of approximately $0.8 million in cash and approximately $0.8 million in stock. There is an earn-out provision whereby we may potentially make additional payments in cash on the achievement of certain financial targets for the period from October 25, 2013 through October 24, 2016. In addition, there is a final payment of $0.5 million to be made subject to reduction for certain claims. The final payment has not been made as of the date of this Form 10-K was filed. The acquisition included technology used in the delivery and management of mobile data services and a portfolio of SaaS based solutions. 

&#160; 

On September 30, 2015, we acquired privately held RateIntegration, Inc. d/b/a Sixth Sense Media (&#147;SSM&#148;), now known as Evolving Systems NC, Inc. (&#147;Evolving Systems NC&#148;) for an initial cash payment totaling approximately $9.75 million, plus customary working capital adjustments, and we agreed to make a payment of $250,000 on the one year anniversary of the transaction, with such payment being available to secure SSM&#146;s representations and warranties under the acquisition agreement. The acquisition included SSM&#146;s software solution, Real-time Lifecycle Marketing&#153; (&#147;RLM&#148;), a platform which enables carrier marketing departments to innovate, execute and manage highly-personalized and contextually-relevant, interactive campaigns that engage consumers in real time. 

&#160; 

INDUSTRY DYNAMICS 

&#160; 

The market for mobile marketing analytics, communications activation and provisioning solutions is constantly changing. Several key factors are driving carrier demand for next generation solutions, supporting growth for specific products within the sector: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Carriers seeking to further monetize their customer relationships and associated demographic, behavioral, location and contextual information to up-sell their network services and open new channels for optimized and personalized third-party service revenues;

&#183; &#160; Rapid adoption of smart phones and network-attached devices, driving increased usage of mobile data;

&#183; &#160; On-going network investment to provide vastly improved delivery speeds and capacity (Long Term Evolution, or &#147;LTE&#148;/4G);

&#183; &#160; Pricing pressure within the telecom industry driven by relatively flat subscriber growth, network upgrade costs, subscriber churn, and increased competition from traditional and new market entrants such as Over-the-Top (&#147;OTT&#148;) services both in the developed and emerging markets; and

&#183; &#160; Adoption of the connected device and M2M markets.

&#160; 

Today, carriers are compelled to offer a growing array of services to deliver personalized and differentiated user experiences, reduce subscriber churn and maintain or grow market share. These value-added services have to be delivered to the market in ever shorter windows as competitive pressure has increased the velocity at which carriers deliver new products and services. To achieve these objectives, operators are increasingly reliant on flexible service enablement solutions that offer a myriad of options for their subscribers. 

&#160; 

As network migrations to 4G/LTE accelerate and subscribers continue to drive growth in mobile solutions, the SIM card has emerged as a vital link in the telecom value chain. Capability, such as that provided by Evolving Systems&#146; Dynamic SIM Allocation&#153; (&#147;DSA&#148;) solution for dynamically activating and managing the SIM card, is becoming an important component in the operators&#146; infrastructure, both to reduce operating costs associated with the provisioning of SIM cards, as well as to improve the end-user experience. 

&#160; 

We are a pioneer and leader in this market and believe we are well-positioned to maintain our leadership role in this emerging growth segment. To date our DSA solution has activated almost half a billion SIM cards, and in 2015 alone we activated in excess of 170 million SIM cards, providing enhanced functionality and significant operator savings. Our Mobile Marketing solution is installed in 15 carriers connecting with over 250 Million subscribers around the world. 

&#160; 

PRODUCT PORTFOLIO 

&#160; 

Real-Time Lifecycle Marketing &#153; 

&#160; 

Our Real-time Lifecycle Marketing platform empowers marketing departments to create and deploy highly personalized, location and contextually relevant, interactive customer engagement campaigns. The platform monitors customer events and 

&#160; 

&#160; 

behavioural patterns in real-time, building a profile of each subscriber. When the right conditions are met, the platform pushes the best match or a personalized offer or ad to the customer. 

&#160; 

Compared with many other marketing campaign management systems, RLM more accurately targets marketing messages and campaigns that drive incremental revenue more quickly. 

&#160; 

The RLM solution is comprised of a number of components: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; The Profiling Engine of the RLM platform supports static as well as ongoing dynamic profiling of subscribers. It fully supports any real-time or micro segmentation requirements as needed by the business. The Profile Engine is a rules-driven flexible aggregator of subscriber baseline and usage data. It has been designed to handle any data model, including any data representation that may be available within the carrier&#146;s legacy billing and Customer Relationship Management (&#147;CRM&#148;) environment.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; The Campaign Manager fulfills the RLM platform&#146;s campaign and offering requirements. It includes a business friendly dashboard allows for rapidly configuring, testing and launching new business campaigns. Through the dashboard the business user can target specific subscribers, define offers and rewards, and create the personalized messages per campaign, interaction and subscriber. The dashboard provides a real-time view on each campaign&#146;s effectiveness and impact.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Campaign Modules provide predefined templates for specific types of real-time mobile marketing tactics, including marketing and loyalty for digital services such as mobile money and content, data package upsell and top-up accelerators.

&#160; 

Dynamic SIM Allocation&#153; 

&#160; 

We introduced our Dynamic SIM Allocation&#153; solution, or &#147;DSA,&#148; in 2007. DSA offers carriers a dramatically improved alternative to the inefficient traditional SIM distribution and activation practices. 

&#160; 

The SIM card is central to the provisioning of wireless access and services for most networks used today by wireless operators world-wide, as well as next generation 4G LTE technologies. Typically, SIM cards are pre-provisioned before they are distributed to the retail environment. Pre-provisioning SIM cards requires that network resources (e.g., mobile numbers) be allocated well in advance of the wireless device becoming available for sale. This leads to poor utilization of numbers and other network resources, increases unnecessary network costs, and delivers a poor user experience. 

&#160; 

DSA&#146;s core technological innovation, on which we have several US patents, enables new SIM cards that have not been pre-provisioned to be detected on first use, triggering an efficient, dynamic provisioning process and eliminating the need for pre-provisioning and thus lowering the operator&#146;s costs. The SIM activation occurs only when a SIM card is first used. 

&#160; 

During the activation process, the solution enables an on-device interaction with the end-user, delivering a differentiated user-experience, reducing customer churn and boosting revenue for the carrier. 

&#160; 

The DSA solution offers a number of benefits including: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Increased revenue and market share: Our DSA solution supports the search, selection and payment for &#147;vanity numbers&#148; and allows a carrier the opportunity to monetize these numbers where, for example, each number can have a different price. Allowing new subscribers to select their number is a market differentiator that will attract more subscribers. In addition, subscribers who select their own number are more likely to keep the number, which may result in greater subscriber lifespan and reduced churn.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Improved user experience at lower cost : Carriers have various customer care processes, like those for mobile number portability, or replacing lost or stolen SIM cards. These processes can be inefficient and have high operational costs. Our DSA solution helps carriers provide more customer self-care for an improved user experience at lower costs.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Choice and Personalization on the device : Prepaid subscribers have traditionally been offered few choices at time of activation. With our solution, prepaid subscribers have an on-device language choice, a choice of product, package or tariff, the ability to select a number from a database of available numbers, including vanity number search and free or chargeable numbers, and the ability to select from a carrier&#146;s promotions and value added services. In addition, on-device

&#160; 

&#160; 

personalization is not limited to the point of first use. Using our DSA solution, subscribers can make changes to their service at any time. 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Improved efficiency and utilization : SIM cards that are never activated for a revenue-generating subscriber result in increased costs and waste. Activating SIM cards dynamically on first use makes the SIM distribution process more efficient and flexible. SIM cards are not linked with any product or region until they are first used, allowing SIM stock to be moved freely to meet demand. The number of SIM types a carrier has to support is greatly reduced, resulting in less packaging cost and waste. Finally, by removing the need for SIM cards to be pre-provisioned, costly resources, such as numbers and network database capacity, are used only when needed.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Availability to meet demand : Carriers can find it difficult to effectively and reliably manage their SIM inventory, especially when multiple SIM card variants and profiles are needed. Our DSA solution helps carriers to ensure new SIM cards and numbers are always available to meet demand.

&#160; 

DSA is an integrated solution comprised of several components: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; First Use Register (&#147;FUR&#148;) is responsible for the integration with the network, via SS7/SIGTRAN for 3G networks and DIAMETER for LTE. It detects the first use of a SIM card, enabling the update of the card, and facilitating any optional dialogue with the subscriber in a highly secure manner. It triggers the provisioning process, including the allocation of a definitive International Mobile Subscriber Identity, or &#147;IMSI,&#148; and the Mobile Subscriber Integrated Services Digital Network-Number, or &#147;MSISDN&#148;. The IMSI identifies the SIM, while the MSISDN is used for routing calls to the subscriber.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Task Management is a module that controls the process flow of tasks involved with completing the subscriber&#146;s activation process. The module orchestrates the overall process, providing robust capabilities for processing high volume, low latency, and mission critical transactions.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Resource Management is a component that records and controls the management and assignment of specific inventory elements and resources. The component allocates the resources used by the DSA solution, including IMSI and MSISDN values.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Menu Server is a module that defines and controls the menu dialogue with a subscriber. The Menu Server provides carriers with the ability to customize the end user experience on the device. Working with a SIM applet, Menu Server allows the wireless carrier to quickly and easily customize the end user screens on their phones or other devices.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Smartphone Welcome Portal allows DSA to support activation processes through a rich browser-based dialogue, as well as a dialogue through menus on a phone screen. With the Mobile Broadband Module, carriers can offer a customized experience for subscribers who are activating new SIM cards in smart phones and/or a wide variety of connected devices. As part of this experience, DSA can promote smartphone apps on behalf of the network operator or third parties, offering a new way to acquire app users in markets where SIM-only sales are dominant.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Promotions Engine enables DSA to offer dynamic promotions to end users as part of the on-device activation experience. Dynamic promotions are those which are selected as relevant to a specific user based on their device type, location, the time/date they activate their SIM, and other choices they make during the activation process.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; In-Life Interaction Engine enables many of the personalization options such as number and tariff choice, or promotions, to be offered to users via their device after first use, as well as during the first use period.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Operational Dashboard is a module that assists operators in the administration, operation, and maintenance of the DSA platform. Operational Dashboard offers carriers a powerful reporting tool and a flexible, easy-to-use tool that provides visibility into the performance of DSA.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Direct Authentication is an extension module to the First Use Register which can generate Global System for Mobile Communication, or &#147;GSM&#148; SIM and Universal Mobile Telecommunications System, or &#147;UMTS&#148; SIM authentication. This removes the need to dedicate an Authentication Center (&#147;AUC&#148;) to perform this function for the First Use Register.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; SIM Reservation Portal&#153; extends the personalization capabilities of DSA to more of an operator&#146;s customers. Working alongside DSA&#146;s on-device personalization, it offers personalization in advance of SIM purchase, through a web portal that can be deployed on the public internet, or in a store kiosk.

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Smart Dealer provides SIM retailers with a tool set that enables them to sell SIM cards efficiently and effectively. With Smart Dealer, the operator is able to communicate and guide dealers towards using the latest promotions, enabling instant reactions to competitor activities. New offers can be trialed through split-testing, varying offers by region, time, day, or device. Smart Dealer captures subscriber details for &#147;Know Your Customer&#148; prepaid registration using standard, low cost devices.

&#160; 

Tertio Service Activation 

&#160; 

Our service activation solution, Tertio &#174; , is used by carriers to activate a new subscriber or to add a new service to an existing subscriber. Our Tertio product provides a flexible operating environment for carriers to manage their voice, data, and content service needs for both their traditional and broadband IP networks. Our solution is deployed as the service activation engine for approximately 30 networks around the world, including two of the world&#146;s largest wireless carriers. 

&#160; 

Tertio Service Activation is an integrated, scalable and flexible solution with a graphical interface and is comprised of several components: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Tertio Service Composer is a modeling tool that simplifies the creation of new services.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Tertio Content Connector is a tool used for activation of next-generation services.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Tertio Activation Designer is a tool designed to speed network feature activation.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Tertio Service Verification is a module that allows carriers to verify that the services implemented in the network match those that were in the original service order. By providing this capability, carriers can continually check the accuracy of their order/activation processes.

&#160; 

Our Tertio solution addresses the entire service lifecycle, allowing carriers to introduce new network technologies and easing the burden of integration with existing devices and systems. Service providers who use our Tertio solution can better plan, manage and execute the introduction of new services. 

&#160; 

Number Inventory and Management 

&#160; 

Our number inventory solution, Total Number Management &#153; (&#147;TNM&#148;), is a scalable and fully automated solution that enables operators to reliably and efficiently manage their telephone numbers (i.e. SIMs, MSISDNs, IMSIs, Integrated Circuit Card Identifiers (&#147;ICCIDs&#148;) and Internet Protocols (&#147;IPs&#148;) as well as other communication identifiers such as Uniform Resource Locators or (&#147;URLs&#148;) and email addresses. TNM focuses on the automation of all number resource management processes, allowing operators to adhere to regulatory requirements and effectively manage the lifecycle of telephone numbers, as well as benefit from time savings and reduced costs. 

&#160; 

The major components of TNM are: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Number management : TNM maintains a clean number resource inventory, ensuring accurate status information and avoiding number conflicts.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Vanity/Golden number support : TNM provides the capability to mark numbers as &#145;Golden&#146; or &#145;Vanity&#146; numbers based on user defined criteria. Golden numbers are then protected from the general assignment rules and may only be allocated when specifically requested.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; SIM management : TNM provides full lifecycle SIM management to include a standardized SIM card profile and templates, as well as an automated interface to the SIM manufacturer&#146;s system, which reduces cumbersome processes associated with sending orders.

&#160;

&#160; 

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT 

&#160; 

We develop most of our products and services internally, conducting research to identify specific industry and customer business needs as well as market requirements and we use that information to determine our investment in product development (&#147;PD&#148;). We evaluate the market for new products and we leverage our existing product capabilities with enhancements of existing products. Our product &#147;roadmap&#148; helps us identify which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented. We build investment plans for our principal product areas and we make other investments in tools and product extensions to accelerate the development, implementation and integration process for customer solutions. 

&#160; 

PD is expensed as incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we expensed $3.8 million, $3.6 million and $3.0 million, respectively, in PD costs. The majority of PD investments in 2015 went into the further development and enhancement of our DSA solution. 

&#160; 

SALES AND MARKETING 

&#160; 

Our sales force is primarily a field organization structured to focus on specific geographical territories around the world: The Americas (North, Central and South), Europe, Middle East and Africa, the Commonwealth of Independent States (comprised of Russia and other former Soviet Republics) and Asia Pacific. Our sales activities cover both direct sales to carrier customers as well as sales through partners such as Gemalto, Oberthur, and Ericsson, who include our products as part of their wider solution offerings, and systems integrators such as Accenture and IBM who license our technology to customers as part of their delivery engagements. 

&#160; 

Our solutions and our customers&#146; infrastructures are complex, and require a high degree of consultative selling which often results in a long sales cycle in excess of twelve months. In addition, our business relies on incremental revenue from existing customers, which requires regular interaction with customers to discuss enhancements to our existing solutions as well as the introduction of new features and functionality. The sales team is also responsible for making proactive proposals to prospects, as well as managing and delivering responses to competitive tenders. This complex, highly interactive approach results a long sales cycle, requiring us to invest a considerable amount of time developing business opportunities without guaranteed sales. 

&#160; 

Our marketing organization supports our sales activities by identifying markets for our products and establishing an awareness of our offerings in those markets through a combination of direct marketing, web marketing, and participation in shows, conferences, and industry bodies. The marketing organization is responsible for maintaining our web site and creating electronic and print-based sales collateral to support our sales activities. 

&#160; 

COMPETITION 

&#160; 

The market for telecommunications OSS products and mobile analytics and advertising is competitive and is subject to rapid technological change, changing industry standards, regulatory developments and consolidation. We face increasing demand for improved product performance, enhanced functionality, rapid integration capabilities coupled with pricing pressures. Our existing and potential competitors include many large domestic and international companies that often have substantially greater financial, technological, marketing, distribution and other resources, larger installed customer bases and longer-standing relationships with telecommunications customers. The market for telecommunications OSS software and services is extremely large and we currently hold only a small portion of total market share. We believe our work to establish the dynamic SIM allocation market has resulted in our achieving a measurable and reasonable market share in those areas. 

&#160; 

Our principal competitors for our Tertio Service Activation solution are Comptel, Amdocs and Oracle. In the area of dynamic SIM allocation, we believe we hold a significant leadership position; however, we see occasional competition from Giesecke &#38; Devrient GmbH and HP, as well as a few other smaller regional competitors. In addition, some of the network equipment manufacturers&#146; next generation solutions address some of the benefits provided by our DSA solution. For our TNM solution competition comes from a variety of billing vendors and vendors such as Telcordia/Ericsson. Competitors for our RLM solution 

&#160; 

&#160; 

include specialist vendors such as Knowesis, Pontis and Business Logic Systems, as well as some products in general CRM suites from vendors such as SAS and Oracle. 

&#160; 

For all of our products, our ability to compete successfully depends on a wide range of factors. We deliver value by offering competitively priced quality solutions, tailored specifically to our customers&#146; network topography. After a customer implements our products, we often receive subsequent orders for enhancements to add functionality or increase capacity. Complex solutions tailored to customers&#146; needs are expensive and time consuming to replace our software, thus providing us with an incumbent advantage. Furthermore, many of our customer relationships span five years or more. We believe all of these factors give us a competitive advantage and can be a barrier to entry for potential competitors. 

&#160; 

SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS 

&#160; 

For the year ended December 31, 2015, no significant customer exceeded the threshold (defined as contributing at least 10%) of revenue from continuing operations. For the year ended December 31, 2014, two significant customers accounted for 24% (13% and 11%) of revenue from continuing operations. These customers are large telecommunications operators in Europe and Mexico. For the year ended December 31, 2013 one significant customer accounted for 12% of revenue from continuing operations. This customer is a large telecommunications operator in Europe. 

&#160; 

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 

&#160; 

We rely on a combination of patents, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements and licensing arrangements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We have patents in the U.S. on elements of our DSA and mobile broadband enablement products and patents pending in other countries on elements of our DSA and other products. 

&#160;
