 Item 1. Business. 

We are a leading global beauty company. Founded in Paris in 1904, we are a pure play beauty company with a portfolio of well-known brands that compete in the four segments in which we operate: Fragrances, Color Cosmetics, Skin &#38; Body Care and, during fiscal 2016, we acquired the personal care and beauty business of Hypermarcas S.A. (the &#8220;Brazil Acquisition&#8221;), which additionally represents a separate segment. We hold the #2 global position in fragrances, the #4 global position in color cosmetics and have a strong regional presence in skin &#38; body care. 

We have transformed into a multi-segment beauty company with market leading positions in both North America and Europe through new product offerings, diversified sales channels and our global growth strategy. Today, our business has a diversified revenue base that generated net revenues in fiscal 2016 &#32;of 46%, 36%, 16% and 2% from Fragrances, Color Cosmetics, Skin &#38; Body Care and Brazil Acquisition, respectively. 

On July 8, 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement (the &#8220;Transaction Agreement&#8221;) to acquire (the &#8220;Transactions&#8221;) The Procter &#38; Gamble Company&#8217;s (&#8220;P&#38;G&#8221;) global fine fragrances, salon professional, cosmetics and retail hair color businesses, along with certain hair styling brands (&#8220;P&#38;G Beauty Brands&#8221;). Following the closing of the Transactions, which is currently expected to occur in October 2016, we expect the combined company to hold the #1 global position in fragrances, the #3 global position in color cosmetics and the #2 global position in hair salon, with combined revenues of approximately $9.2 billion based on fiscal 2015 performance, excluding annualized results for the acquired Bourjois brand and the Brazil Acquisition. The completion of the Transactions is subject to numerous conditions. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Relating to the Transactions&#8212;The Transactions may not be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, or at all.&#8221; 

In addition, during fiscal 2016, we acquired the personal care and beauty business of Hypermarcas S.A. (the &#8220;Brazil Acquisition&#8221;). This acquisition additionally represents a separate segment. We believe these two transactions, combined with organic growth, will help us to achieve our strategic vision to be a new global leader and challenger in the beauty industry. 

Our top 10 brands, which we refer to as our &#8220;power brands&#8221;, generated 70% of our net revenues in fiscal 2016 &#32;and comprise the following globally recognized brands: adidas, Calvin Klein, Chlo&#233;, Davidoff, Marc Jacobs, OPI, philosophy, Playboy, Rimmel &#32;and Sally Hansen. &#32;Our brands compete in all key distribution channels across both prestige and mass markets and in over 130 countries and territories. Following the Transactions, we expect to re-evaluate our approach to power brands.

We target organic growth through our focus on supporting and expanding global brands while consistently developing and seeking to acquire new brands and licenses. Brand innovation and new product development are critical components of our success. 

Our &#8220;power brands&#8221;, each of which we describe in further detail below, are at the core of our accomplishments. We invest aggressively behind current and prospective power brands, which are our largest brands and those that we believe to have the greatest global potential, to enhance our scale in the three beauty segments in which we compete. 

&#8226; adidas. adidas &#32;is one of the biggest licensed brands in the global mass skin &#38; body care market and maintains a significant presence in deodorants and shower gels.

Our Strategic Vision 

Our mission is to become a new global leader by being a challenger in the beauty industry. On July 8, 2015, we entered into the Transaction Agreement to acquire the P&#38;G Beauty Brands. After the completion of the Transactions, we intend to reorganize our business into three new divisions: Coty Luxury Division, focused on fragrances and skin care; Coty Consumer Beauty Division, focused on color cosmetics, retail hair coloring and styling products and body care; and Coty Professional Beauty Division, focused on servicing salon owners and professionals in both hair and nail care. This new category-focused organizational structure puts consumers first by specifically targeting how and where they shop, and what and why they purchase. In this new organizational structure, each division will have full end-to-end responsibility to optimize consumers&#8217; beauty experience in the relevant categories and channels, which we believe will drive profitable growth through targeted expertise. 

The chart below reflects the anticipated allocation of the combined company brands across our expected new divisions: 

Our key business strategies following the Transactions will be to: 

&#8226; 

Leverage the Strength and Scale of the Combined Company to Create a New Global Leader and Challenger in the Beauty Industry . We expect that the Transactions will create one of the world&#8217;s largest pure-play beauty companies, with pro forma combined annual revenues of approximately $9.2 billion based on fiscal 2015 performance, excluding annualized results for the acquired Bourjois brand and the Brazil Acquisition. 

&#8226; 

Expand in Attractive New Category, Through the Addition of the Hair Color and Styling Business. &#32;Following the Transactions, we will expand our product offering with the addition of the hair color and styling business, led by the Wella and Clairol brands, acquired in the acquisition of P&#38;G Beauty Brands. The combined business will have a balanced portfolio across four product categories, each with a top three global position based on pro forma net sales. 

&#8226; 

Combine New Organic Growth Opportunities with a Well-Targeted Acquisition Strategy . Coty was founded in 1904 as a revolutionary mass fragrance company and over the last three decades has successfully completed a number of acquisitions to drive product, geographic and distribution platform diversity and growth. We will leverage further organic growth opportunities presented by the Transactions, and we are continuously evaluating and will also continue to evaluate potential acquisitions that would augment our portfolio going forward and further our progression towards becoming a global leader in beauty. 

&#8226; 

Drive Improvements in Margin, Profit and Free Cash Flow, Providing Financial Flexibility. We expect that after the Transactions, the combined operational and financial platform will allow us to drive meaningful earnings per share accretion and substantial incremental free cash flow generation, providing financial flexibility for the Company. In August 2016, our Board of Directors (the &#8220;Board&#8221;) approved a 10% increase in our annual dividend to $0.275 from $0.25 per share in the prior year on our Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. We intend to further increase the annual dividend per share to $0.50 after completion of the Transactions, demonstrating our confidence in our ability to generate substantial cash flow. 

&#8226; 

Capitalize on Strong, Well-Aligned and Balanced Leadership Team. &#32;Following the Transactions, our new Chief Executive Officer, Camillo Pane, will oversee a management team, together with a broader leadership organization, consisting of executives from Coty and P&#38;G, as well as key external hires. 

Certain of the above strategies may be altered if the Transactions are not completed. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;The Transactions may not be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, or at all.&#8221;

Research and Development 

Research and development is a pillar of our innovation. It combines cutting-edge research and technology, new ingredients and precise market testing, enabling us to develop and support the development of new products while continuing to improve our existing products. Our key new product developments with significant product innovation components in calendar years 2014 and 2015 included Rimmel Wonder&#8217;Lash mascara with Argan Oil, a patented creamy, volumizing and conditioning mascara, Sally Hansen &#32;Miracle Gel 2.0, the only two-step gel manicure with a plumping top coat that does not require light, philosophy ultimate miracle worker, featuring a patented multi-protection formula for the face and eyes, and Lancaster 365 Skin Repair Serum, which helps manage aging at the roots. In calendar year 2016, our new product developments included Lancaster &#8217;s new generation sun protection that targets all rays of light in the known solar spectrum. Our products have received numerous awards, including awards from The Fragrance Foundation and CLIO. 

We continuously seek to improve our products through research and development, and strive to provide the consumer with the best possible products. Our research and development teams work with our marketing and operations teams to identify recent trends and consumer needs and to bring products quickly to market. Additionally, our basic and applied research groups, which conduct longer-term research such as &#8220;blue sky&#8221; research, seek to develop proprietary new technologies for first-to-market products and for improving existing products. This research and development is done both internally and through affiliations with various universities, technical centers, supply partners, industry associations and technical associations. As of June 30, 2016, we owned approximately 800 patents and patent applications globally. 

We perform extensive testing on our products, including testing for safety, packaging, toxicology, in vitro eye irritation, microbiology, quality and stability. We also have a robust internal and external testing program that includes sensory, consumer and clinical testing. We do not conduct animal testing on our products or ingredients, nor do we engage others to undertake such testing on our behalf, except when required by local country laws. 

As of June 30, 2016, we had approximately 300 employees engaged in research and development. Research and development expenditures totaled 1.1%, 1.1% and 1.0% of net revenues in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We maintain six research and development centers, which are located in the U.S., Europe, Brazil and China. 

Suppliers, Manufacturing and Related Operations 

We manufacture approximately 68% of our products in eight facilities around the world. These facilities are located in the U.S., Europe, Brazil and China. Several of these locations provide multi-segment manufacturing. Approximately 30% of our finished products are manufactured to our specifications by third parties. 

We continue to streamline our manufacturing processes and identify sourcing opportunities to improve innovation, customer service and product quality, increase efficiencies and reduce costs. We have a dedicated worldwide procurement team that we believe follows industry best practices and that is making a concentrated effort to reduce costs associated with our third-party suppliers. While we believe that our manufacturing facilities are sufficient to meet current and reasonably anticipated manufacturing requirements, we continue to identify opportunities to make improvements in productivity. For example, we are streamlining our manufacturing facilities to optimize costs. To capitalize on supply chain benefits, we will continue to complement our own manufacturing network with the use of pertinent third parties on a global basis for finished goods production. 

The principal raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are essential oils, alcohol and specialty chemicals. The essential oils in our fragrance products are generally sourced from fragrance houses. As a result, we realize material cost savings and benefits from the technology, innovation and resources provided by these fragrance houses. 

We purchase the raw materials for all our products from various third parties. We also purchase packaging components that are manufactured to our design specifications. We work in collaboration with our suppliers to meet our stringent design and creative criteria. In fiscal 2016, no single supplier accounted for more than 10% of the materials used in the manufacture of our products. 

We regularly benchmark the performance of our supply chain and adjust our suppliers and our distribution networks and manufacturing footprint based upon the changing needs of our business. We are always considering new ways to improve our overall supply chain performance through better use of our production and sourcing capabilities. We believe that we currently have adequate sources of supply for all our products. We have not experienced material disruptions in our supply chain in the past, and we believe we have robust practices in place to respond to any potential disruptions in our supply chain. 

We have established a global distribution network designed to meet the changing demands of our customers while maintaining service levels. In fiscal 2015, we received awards in Leadership and Strategy and Manufacturing in Action, from the Manufacturer of the Year Awards. We are continuing to evaluate and restructure our physical distribution network to increase efficiency and reduce our order lead times. 

We also recognize the importance of our employees and have programs in place designed to ensure operating safety. We also have in place programs designed to ensure that our manufacturing and distribution facilities comply with applicable environmental rules and regulations, and these programs have improved our employee safety as benchmarked against industry levels. 

Marketing and Sales 

We have dedicated marketing and sales forces (including ancillary support services) in most of our significant markets. We believe that local teams dedicated to the commercialization of our brands give us the greatest opportunity to execute our business strategy. We are also developing branding and marketing execution strategies with our top customers. 

Our marketing strategy creates a distinct image and personality for each brand. Many of our products are linked to recognized designers and design houses such as Balenciaga, Bottega Veneta, Calvin Klein, Chlo&#233;, Marc Jacobs, Miu Miu and Robert Cavalli , celebrities, such as Beyonc&#233; Knowles, David Beckham, Enrique Iglesias, Jennifer Lopez and Katy Perry, and lifestyle brands, such as adidas , Davidoff &#32;and Playboy. &#32;Each of our brands is promoted with consistent logos, packaging and advertising designed to enhance its image and the uniqueness of each brand. Our strategy is to promote these brands mostly in television, print, outdoor ads, in-store displays and online on brand sites and social networks. We also leverage our relationships with celebrities to endorse certain of our products. Recent campaigns include Cara Delevingne, Kate Moss and Georgia May Jagger for Rimmel , Jasmine Tookes and Tobias Sorensen for Calvin Klein Eternity NOW , Christy Turlington and Ed Burns for Calvin Klein Eternity &#32;and a television spot for Marc Jacobs Daisy Dream directed by long-time Marc Jacobs muse Sofia Coppola . 

Our marketing efforts also benefit from cooperative advertising programs with retailers, often in connection with in-store marketing activities. Such activities are designed to attract consumers to our counters, displays and walls and make them try, or purchase, our products. We also engage in sampling and &#8220;gift-with-purchase&#8221; programs designed to stimulate product trials. We have more recently been expanding our digital marketing efforts, including through websites we do not control or operate, with a multi-pronged strategy that ranges from brand sites, social networking campaigns and blogs, to e-commerce. Currently, 41 of our brands have marketing sites, 36 have social networking activities, two have e-commerce capabilities and 12 are sold on branded e-commerce sites. We also partner with key &#8220;brick and mortar&#8221; retailers in their expansion into e-commerce. 

Our consolidated expenses for advertising and promotional costs were $967.6 million, $1.008 billion and $1.070 billion in fiscal 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. Our consolidated expenses for total marketing and advertising were $1.364 billion, $1.471 billion and $1.563 billion in fiscal 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. 

Distribution Channels and Retail Sales 

We currently have offices in more than 35 countries and market, sell and distribute our products in over 130 countries and territories. 

We have a balanced multi-channel distribution strategy and market products across price points in prestige and mass channels of distribution. We offer certain products through multiple distribution channels to reach a broader range of customers. We sell products in each of our segments through retailers, including hypermarkets, supermarkets, independent and chain drug stores and pharmacies, upscale perfumeries, upscale and mid-tier department stores, nail salons, specialty retailers, duty-free shops and traditional food, drug and mass retailers. Our principal retailers in the mass distribution channel include CVS, Shoppers Drug Mart, Target, Walgreens and Wal-Mart in the Americas; Auchan, Carrefour, DM Drogerie Markt, Tesco and Watson&#8217;s in EMEA; and Chemist Warehouse Group, Priceline Pharmacies and Watsons in Asia Pacific. Our principal retailers in the prestige distribution channel include Macy&#8217;s and Ulta in the Americas; Beauty Alliance, Boots, Mueller, Parfumerie Douglas and Watson in EMEA; Chemist Warehouse Group and Priceline Pharmacies in Asia Pacific; and Sephora in multiple geographic regions. Other principal retailers include Kohl&#8217;s and QVC in the Americas. In fiscal 2016, no retailer accounted for more than 10% of our global net revenues; however, certain retailers accounted for more than 10% of net revenues within certain geographic markets. In fiscal 2016, our top ten retailers combined accounted for 29% of our net revenues and Wal-Mart, our top retailer, accounted for 7% of our net revenues. We are pursuing our strategy of geographic expansion by selling through retailers, our subsidiaries or third-party distributors and our strategy of increasing our presence in e-commerce by selling through websites that support an e-commerce-only product distribution business, including our own branded websites. We believe our commercial expertise enhances our capabilities when we enter new markets where products must suit local consumer preferences, incomes and demographics. 

We also sell a broad range of our products through travel retail sales channels, including duty-free shops, airlines, cruise lines and other tax-free zones. Travel retail sales channels represented 6% of our net revenues in fiscal 2016. In addition, we 

sell our products through the internet over our retail partners&#8217; e-commerce sites and through online retailers, and we sell our philosophy &#32;products through philosophy -branded websites and through direct marketing via television. 

In countries and territories in which we sell our products but where we do not have a subsidiary, our products are sold through third-party distributors. Distributors in different countries or territories may sell to different types of customers, such as traditional retailers or via direct marketing. In some cases, we also outsource functions or parts of functions that can be performed more effectively by external service providers. We direct our third-party service providers and distributors in the marketing, advertising and promotion of our products. Our third-party distributors contribute knowledge of the local market and dedicated sales personnel. 

In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;), we report revenues on a net basis, which reflects the amount of actual returns received and the amount established for anticipated returns. As a percentage of gross sales after customer discounts and allowances, returns accounted for approximately 3.0%, 3.3% and 3.9% in fiscal 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. 

Competition 

We compete against a number of manufacturers and marketers of fragrances, color cosmetics and personal care products. In addition to the established multinational brands against which we compete, small targeted niche brands continue to enter the market. Competition is also increasing from private label products sold by apparel retailers and mass distribution retailers. 

We believe that we compete primarily on the basis of perceived value, including pricing and innovation, service to the consumer, promotional activities, advertising, special events, new product introductions, e-commerce and mobile-commerce initiatives, direct sales and other activities. It is difficult for us to predict the timing and scale of our competitors&#8217; actions in these areas. Refining product portfolios with more enhanced products and focusing the portfolio on a smaller number of high-potential brands has become a priority as we compete in the slower-growing developed markets. 

Intellectual Property 

Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. We rely on a combination of trademarks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets and know-how, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights (including confidentiality and invention assignment agreements) to establish and protect our proprietary rights. 

We generally own the trademark rights in key sales countries in Trademark International Class 3 (covering cosmetics and perfumery) for use in connection with, among others, the following brands: Astor, Bourjois, Coty, Joop!, Jovan, Lancaster, Manhattan, N.Y.C. New York Color, OPI, philosophy, Rimmel and &#32;Sally Hansen. &#32;We license trademarks for the balance of our material product lines, and we are generally the exclusive trademark licensee for all Class 3 trademarks as used in connection with our products. We or our licensors, as the case may be, actively protect the trademarks used in our principal products in the U.S. and significant markets worldwide. We consider the protection of our trademarks to be essential to our business. 

A number of our products also incorporate patented, patent-pending or proprietary technology in their respective formulations and/or packaging, and in some cases our product packaging is subject to copyright, trade dress or design protection. While we consider our patents and copyrights, and the protection thereof, to be important, no single patent or copyright, or group of patents or copyrights, is material to the conduct of our business. As of June 30, 2016, we owned approximately 800 patents and patent applications globally. 

Products representing a significant portion of our net revenues are manufactured and marketed under exclusive license agreements granted to us for use on a worldwide and/or regional basis. As of June 30, 2016, we maintained 29 brand licenses. In fiscal 2016, 53% of our net revenues were generated from licensed brands, with our licensed power brands (our top six licenses) representing between 3% and 16% of total net revenues. In each of fiscal 2015 and 2014, 57% and 60% of our net revenues were generated from licensed brands, respectively. 

Our existing licenses, including those for our power brands, impose obligations on us that we believe are common to many licensing relationships in the beauty industry. These obligations include: 

&#8226; paying annual royalties on net sales of the licensed products; 

&#8226; maintaining the quality of the licensed products and the image of applicable trademarks; 

&#8226; 

permitting the licensor&#8217;s involvement in and, in some cases, approval of advertising, packaging and marketing plans relating to the licensed products; 

&#8226; maintaining minimum royalty payments and/or minimum sales levels for the licensed products; 

&#8226; actively promoting the sales of the licensed products; 

&#8226; spending a certain amount of net sales on marketing and advertising for the licensed products; 

&#8226; maintaining the integrity of the specified distribution channel for the licensed products; 

&#8226; expanding the sales of the licensed products and/or the markets in which it is sold; 

&#8226; agreeing not to enter into licensing arrangements with competitors of certain of our licensors; 

&#8226; indemnifying the licensor in the event of product liability or other claims related to our products; 

&#8226; limiting assignment and sub-licensing to third parties without the licensor&#8217;s consent; and 

&#8226; 

in some cases, requiring notice to, or approval by, the licensor of certain changes in control as a condition to continuation of the license. 

We are currently in material compliance with all terms of our brand license agreements. 

Most brand licenses have renewal options for one or more terms, which can range from three to ten years. Certain brand licenses provide for automatic extensions, so long as minimum annual royalty payments are made, while renewal of others is contingent upon attaining of specified sales levels. The next power brand license scheduled to expire that does not provide for automatic renewal or renewal at our option expires in fiscal 2022. Three of our brand licenses expire during fiscal 2017.

We may be unable to obtain, maintain and protect the intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business, and may be subject to claims that we infringe or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others, which could materially harm our business.

Employees 

As of June 2016 , we had approximately 10,060 full-time employees in over 35 countries. In addition, we employ a large number of seasonal contractors during our peak manufacturing and promotional season, primarily at our manufacturing facility in Sanford, North Carolina. We recognize the importance of our employees to our business and believe our relationship with our employees is satisfactory. 

Our employees in the U.S. are not covered by collective bargaining agreements. Our employees in certain countries in Europe are subject to works council arrangements. We have not experienced a material strike or work stoppage in the U.S. or any other country where we have a significant number of employees. 

Government Regulation 

We and our products are subject to regulation by various U.S. federal regulatory agencies as well as by various state and local regulatory authorities and by the applicable regulatory authorities in the countries in which our products are produced or sold. Such regulations principally relate to the ingredients, labeling, packaging, advertising and marketing of our products. Because we have commercial operations overseas, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the &#8220;FCPA&#8221;) as well as other countries&#8217; anti-corruption and anti-bribery regimes, such as the U.K. Bribery Act. 

Environmental, Health and Safety 

We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, provincial, state, municipal and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to, among other matters, safe working conditions, product stewardship and environmental protection, including those relating to emissions to the air, discharges to land and surface waters, generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste materials, and the registration and evaluation of chemicals. We maintain policies and procedures to monitor and control environmental, health and safety risks, and to monitor compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety requirements. Compliance with such laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, has not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. However, environmental laws and regulations have tended to become increasingly stringent and, to the extent regulatory changes occur in the future, they could result in, among other things, increased costs to us. For example, certain states, such as California, and the U.S. Congress have proposed legislation relating to chemical disclosure and other requirements related to the content of our products. For more information, see &#8220;&#8212;Risk Factors &#8212;We are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that could affect our business or financial results.&#8221; 

Seasonality 

Our sales generally increase during our second fiscal quarter as a result of increased demand by retailers associated with the holiday season. Working capital requirements, sales, and cash flows generally experience variability during the three to six months preceding the holiday period due in part to product innovations and new product launches and the size and timing of certain orders from our customers. While we continue to attempt to reduce this seasonality, sales volume of holiday gift items is, by its nature, difficult to forecast. 

We generally experience peak inventory levels from July to October and peak receivable balances from September to December. During the months of November, December and January of each year, cash is normally generated as customer payments for holiday season orders are received. 

In response to this seasonality and other factors, management has implemented various working capital programs aimed at optimizing the effectiveness of our inventories, customer receivables and accounts payable. For example, to improve inventory productivity, we have enhanced our sales and operational planning forecasting processes. To improve accounts payable efficiency, we have commenced a harmonization of our vendor management practices across geographies to optimize our payments to vendors.
