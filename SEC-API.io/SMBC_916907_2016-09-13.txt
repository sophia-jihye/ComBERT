 Item 1. Description of Business 

General

Southern Missouri Bancorp, Inc. ("Company"), which changed its state of incorporation to Missouri on April 1, 1999, was originally incorporated in Delaware on December 30, 1993 for the purpose of becoming the holding company for Southern Missouri Savings Bank upon completion of Southern Missouri Savings Bank's conversion from a state chartered mutual savings and loan association to a state chartered stock savings bank. As part of the conversion in April 1994, the Company sold 1,803,201 shares of its common stock to the public. The Company's Common Stock is quoted on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol "SMBC".

Southern Missouri Savings Bank was originally chartered as a mutual Missouri savings and loan association in 1887. On June 20, 1995, it converted to a federally chartered stock savings bank and took the name Southern Missouri Savings Bank, FSB. On February 17, 1998, Southern Missouri Savings Bank converted from a federally chartered stock savings bank to a Missouri chartered stock savings bank and changed its name to Southern Missouri Bank &#38; Trust Co. On June 4, 2004, Southern Missouri Bank &#38; Trust Co. converted from a Missouri chartered stock savings bank to a Missouri state chartered trust company with banking powers ("Charter Conversion"). On June 1, 2009, the institution changed its name to Southern Bank ("Bank").

The primary regulator of the Bank is the Missouri Division of Finance. The Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ("Federal Reserve Board" or "FRB") is the Bank&#8217;s primary federal regulator. The Bank's deposits continue to be insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund ("DIF") of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"). With the Bank's conversion to a trust company with banking powers, the Company became a bank holding company regulated by the FRB.

The principal business of the Bank consists primarily of attracting retail deposits from the general public and using such deposits along with wholesale funding from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines ("FHLB"), and to a lesser extent, brokered deposits, to invest in one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, mortgage loans secured by commercial real estate, commercial non-mortgage business loans, and consumer loans. These funds are also used to purchase mortgage-backed and related securities ("MBS"), U.S. Government Agency obligations, municipal bonds, and other permissible investments.

At June 30, 2016, the Company had total assets of $1.4 billion, total deposits of $1.1 b illion and stockholders' equity of $126.0 million. The Company has not engaged in any significant activity other than holding the stock of the Bank. Accordingly, the information set forth in this report, including financial statements and related data, relates primarily to the Bank. The Company's revenues are derived principally from interest earned on loans, debt securities, MBS, CMOs and, to a lesser extent, banking service charges, bank card interchange fees, gains on sales of loans, loan late charges, increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance, and other fee income.

Acquisitions

On August 5, 2014, the Company completed its acquisition of Peoples Service Company (PSC) and its subsidiaries, Peoples Banking Company (PBC) and Peoples Bank of the Ozarks (Peoples), Nixa, Missouri (the &#8220;Peoples Acquisition&#8221;). Peoples was merged into the Company&#8217;s bank subsidiary, Southern Bank, in early December, 2014, in connection with the conversion of Peoples&#8217; data system. The Company acquired Peoples primarily for the purpose of conducting commercial banking activities in markets where it believes the Company&#8217;s business model will perform well, and for the long-term value of its core deposit franchise. Notes payable of $2.9 million were contractually required to be repaid on the date of acquisition. The goodwill of $3.0 million arising from the acquisition consists largely of synergies and economies of scale expected from combining the operations of the Company and Peoples. Total goodwill was assigned to the acquisition of the bank holding company.

The Company completed its acquisition of Ozarks Legacy Community Financial, Inc. (Ozarks Legacy), and its subsidiary, Bank of Thayer, headquartered in Thayer, Missouri, in October 2013. At closing, Ozarks Legacy had total assets of approximately $81 million, loans, net, of $38 million, and deposits of $68 million. The Company completed its acquisition of Citizens State Bankshares of Bald Knob, Inc. (Citizens), and its subsidiary, Citizens 

&#160;

&#160;

State Bank, headquartered in Bald Knob, Arkansas, in February 2014. At closing, Citizens had total assets of approximately $72 million, loans, net, of $12 million, and deposits of $64 million. (The Ozarks Legacy and Citizens acquisitions are referred to as the &#8220;Fiscal 2014 Acquisitions&#8221; collectively.)

On December 17, 2010, the Bank entered into a Purchase and Assumption Agreement with the FDIC, as receiver, to acquire certain assets and assume certain liabilities of the former First Southern Bank, with headquarters in Batesville, Arkansas, and one branch location in Searcy, Arkansas (the &#8220;Fiscal 2011 Acquisition&#8221;). As a result of the transaction, the Company acquired loans recorded at a fair value of $114.6 million and deposits recorded at a fair value of $130.8 million, at December 17, 2010.

Capital Raising Transactions

On November 22, 2011, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of 1,150,000 shares of common stock at a price to the public of $19.00 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $21.9 million. The proceeds from the offering have been used for general corporate purposes, including the funding of loan growth and the purchase of securities.

On July 21, 2011, as part of the Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF) of the United States Department of the Treasury (Treasury), the Company entered into a Small Business Lending Fund-Securities Purchase Agreement (Purchase Agreement) with the Secretary of the Treasury, pursuant to which the Company (i) sold 20,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A (SBLF Preferred Stock) to the Secretary of the Treasury for a purchase price of $20,000,000. The SBLF Preferred Stock was issued pursuant to the SBLF program, a $30 billion fund established under the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 that was created to encourage lending to small business by providing capital to qualified community banks with assets of less than $10 billion.

The SBLF Preferred Stock qualified as Tier 1 capital. The SBLF Preferred Stock was entitled to receive non-cumulative dividends, payable quarterly, on each January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1, beginning October 1, 2011. The dividend rate, as a percentage of the liquidation amount, fluctuated on a quarterly basis during the first 10 quarters during which the SBLF Preferred Stock was outstanding, based upon changes in the Bank&#8217;s level of Qualified Small Business Lending (QBSL), as defined in the Purchase Agreement. Based upon the increase in the Bank&#8217;s level of QBSL over the baseline level calculated under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the dividend rate for the initial dividend period was set at 2.8155%. For the second through ninth calendar quarters, the dividend rate was adjusted to between one percent (1%) and five percent (5%) per annum, to reflect the amount of change in the Bank&#8217;s level of QBSL. For the tenth calendar quarter through four and one half years after issuance, the dividend rate was fixed at between one percent (1%) and seven percent (7%) based upon the increase in QBSL as compared to the baseline. After four and one half years from issuance, the dividend rate increased to 9% (including a quarterly lending incentive fee of 0.5%).

As required by the Purchase Agreement, $9,635,000 of the proceeds from the sale of the SBLF Preferred Stock was used to redeem the 9,550 shares of the Company&#8217;s Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A issued in 2008 to the Treasury in the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), plus the accrued dividends owed on those preferred shares. As part of the 2008 TARP transaction, the Company had issued a ten-year warrant to Treasury to purchase 228,652 shares (split-adjusted) of the Company&#8217;s common stock at an exercise price (split-adjusted) of $6.27 per share. The Company repurchased the warrant on May 29, 2015, for $2.7 million. Immediately prior to the repurchase, the warrant had been exercisable for the purchase of 231,891 shares (split-adjusted) at an exercise price of $6.18 per share.

The Company noted in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed October 16, 2015, that it redeemed all 20,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s SBLF Preferred Stock. The shares of SBLF Preferred Stock were redeemed at their liquidation amount of $1,000 per share plus accrued but unpaid dividends to the redemption date.

Market Area

The Bank provides its customers with a full array of community banking services and conducts its business from its headquarters in Poplar Bluff, 32 additional full service offices, and three limited service offices located in Poplar Bluff (4), Van Buren, Dexter, Kennett, Doniphan, Sikeston, Qulin, Matthews, Springfield (3), Thayer (2), West Plains, Alton, Clever, Forsyth, Fremont Hills, Kimberling City, Ozark, Nixa (2), and Rogersville, Missouri, and Jonesboro (2), Paragould, Brookland, Batesville, Searcy, Bald Knob (2) and Bradford, Arkansas.

&#160;

&#160;

The Bank&#8217;s primary market area includes eight southeast and south-central Missouri counties where the Bank operates 15 facilities, with one facility located in a municipality that straddles a county line and is mostly situated in a ninth county. Those nine counties (Butler, Carter, Dunklin, Howell, New Madrid, Oregon, Ripley, Scott, and Stoddard) have a population of roughly 232,000 persons. In northeast and north-central Arkansas, the Bank&#8217;s nine facilities are located in four counties (Craighead, Greene, Independence, and White) with a population of roughly 265,000 persons &#8211; this area includes the Jonesboro, Arkansas, Metropolitan Statistical Area, with a population of 124,000. In southwest Missouri, our eleven facilities are located in five counties with a population of approximately 494,000, including the Springfield, Missouri, Metropolitan Statistical Area, with a population of roughly 456,000. The Bank also serves a few communities just outside these county borders which do not have a notable impact on the demographics of the market area. The Bank&#8217;s southeast Missouri and northeast and north central Arkansas markets are primarily rural in nature with economies supported by manufacturing activity, agriculture (livestock, rice, timber, soybeans, wheat, melons, corn, and cotton), healthcare, and education. Large employers include hospitals, manufacturers, school districts, and colleges. In the southwest Missouri market, major employers include healthcare providers, educational institutions, federal, local, and state government, retailers, transportation and distribution firms, and leisure, entertainment, and hospitality interests. For purposes of the Bank&#8217;s lending policy, the Bank&#8217;s primary lending area is considered to be the counties where the Bank has a branch facility, and any contiguous county.

Competition

The Bank faces strong competition in attracting deposits (its primary source of lendable funds) and originating loans. At June 30, 2016, the Bank was one of 29 bank or saving association groups located in its southeast and south-central Missouri market area competing for approximately $4.3 billion in deposits at FDIC-insured institutions, one of 21 bank or saving association groups located in its northeast and north-central Arkansas market area (five of these overlap with the southeast and south-central Missouri market area) competing for $5.3 billion in deposits, and one of 39 bank or savings association groups located in its southwest Missouri markets (twelve of these overlap with the Arkansas or other Missouri market areas) competing for $9.3 billion in deposits.

Competitors for deposits include commercial banks, credit unions, money market funds, and other investment alternatives, such as mutual funds, full service and discount broker-dealers, equity markets, brokerage accounts and government securities. The Bank's competition for loans comes principally from other financial institutions, mortgage banking companies, mortgage brokers and life insurance companies. The Bank expects competition to continue to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes within the financial services industry. Technological advances, for example, have lowered barriers to market entry, allowed banks to expand their geographic reach by providing services over the Internet and made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally have been provided by banks. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which permits affiliation among banks, securities firms and insurance companies, also has changed the competitive environment in which the Bank conducts business.

Lending Activities

General. The Bank's lending activities consist of origination of loans secured by mortgages on one- to four-family and multifamily residential real estate, commercial and agricultural real estate, construction loans on residential and commercial properties, commercial and agricultural business loans and consumer loans. The Bank has also occasionally purchased loan participation interests originated by other lenders and secured by properties generally located in the States of Missouri or Arkansas.

Supervision of the loan portfolio is the responsibility of our Chief Lending Officer. Loan officers have varying amounts of lending authority depending upon experience and types of loans. Loans beyond their authority are presented to the next level of authority, which may include one of two Regional Loan Committees or our Agricultural 

&#160;

&#160;

Loan Committee. The Regional Loan Committees each consist of several senior lending officers of the Bank and one non-employee director, and is responsible for approving lending relationships up to $1.5 million. For the Regional Loan Committee to approve a proposed loan, approval of the non-employee director is required. The Agricultural Loan Committee consists of several senior lending officers of the Bank and is responsible for approving agricultural lending relationships up to $2.0 million. Loan requests above these approval authorities are presented to the Senior Loan Committee, comprised of our President/Chief Executive Officer, Chief Lending Officer, and Chief Credit Officer, along with various appointed loan officers. Loans to one borrower (or group of related borrowers), in the aggregate, in excess of $2.5 million require the approval of a majority of the Discount Committee, which consists of all Bank directors, prior to the closing of the loan. All loans are subject to ratification by the full Board of Directors.

The aggregate amount of loans that the Bank is permitted to make under applicable federal regulations to any one borrower, including related entities, or the aggregate amount that the Bank could have invested in any one real estate project, is based on the Bank's capital levels. See "Regulation - Loans to One Borrower." At June 30, 2016, the maximum amount which the Bank could lend to any one borrower and the borrower's related entities was approximately $36.4 million. At June 30, 2016, the Bank's ten largest credit relationships, as defined by loan to one borrower limitations, ranged from $11.7 million to $20.5 million, net of participation interests sold. As of June 30, 2016, the majority of these credits were commercial real estate, multi-family real estate, or commercial business loans, and all of these relationships were performing in accordance with their terms.

Residential Mortgage Lending. The Bank actively originates loans for the acquisition or refinance of one- to four-family residences. These loans are originated as a result of customer and real estate agent referrals, existing and walk-in customers and from responses to the Bank's marketing campaigns. At June 30, 2016, residential loans secured by one- to four-family residences totaled $264.0 million, or 23.2% of net loans receivable.

The Bank currently offers both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage ("ARM") loans. During the year ended June 30, 2016, the Bank originated $27.9 million of ARM loans and $27.6 million of fixed-rate loans that were secured by one- to four-family residences, for retention in the Bank&#8217;s portfolio. An additional $22.9 million in fixed-rate one- to four-family residential loans were originated for sale on the secondary market. Substantially all of the one- to four-family residential mortgage originations in the Bank's portfolio are located within the Bank's market area.

The Bank generally originates one- to four-family residential mortgage loans in amounts up to 90% of the lower of the purchase price or appraised value of residential property. For loans originated in excess of 80%, the Bank charges an additional 50-75 basis points, but does not require private mortgage insurance. At June 30, 2016, the remaining balance of loans originated with a loan-to-value ratio in excess of 80% was $66.6 million. For fiscal years ended June 30, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012, originations of one- to four-family loans in excess of 80% loan-to-value have totaled $16.5 million, $24.3 million, $13.6 million, $13.8 million and $12.7 million, respectively, totaling $80.9 million. The remaining balance of those loans at June 30, 2016, was $50.1 million. Originating loans with higher loan-to-value ratios presents additional credit risk to the Bank. Consequently, the Bank limits this product to borrowers with a favorable credit history and a demonstrable ability to service the debt. The majority of new residential mortgage loans originated by the Bank conform to secondary market underwriting standards, however, documentation of loan files may not be adequate to allow for immediate sale. The interest rates charged on these loans are competitively priced based on local market conditions, the availability of funding, and anticipated profit margins. Fixed and ARM loans originated by the Bank are amortized over periods as long as 30 years, but typically are repaid over shorter periods.

Fixed-rate loans secured by one- to four-family residences have contractual maturities up to 30 years, and are generally fully amortizing with payments due monthly. These loans normally remain outstanding for a substantially shorter period of time because of refinancing and other prepayments. A significant change in the interest rate environment can alter the average life of a residential loan portfolio. The one- to four-family fixed-rate loans do not contain prepayment penalties. At June 30, 2016, one- to four-family loans with a fixed rate totaled $139.9 million, and had a weighted-average maturity of 116 months.

The Bank currently originates one- to four-family adjustable rate mortgage (&#8220;ARM&#8221;) loans, which adjust annually, after an initial period of one, three, five, or seven years. Typically, originated ARM loans secured by owner occupied properties reprice at a margin of 2.75% to 3.00% over the weekly average yield on United States Treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year (&#8220;CMT&#8221;). Generally, ARM loans secured by non-owner occupied residential properties reprice at a margin of 3.75% over the CMT index. Current residential ARM loan originations are subject to annual and lifetime interest rate caps and floors. As a consequence of using interest rate caps, initial rates which may be at a premium or discount, and a "CMT" loan index, the interest earned on the Bank's ARMs will react differently to changing interest rates than the Bank's cost of funds. At June 30, 2016, one- to four-family loans tied to the CMT index totaled $130.7 million. One- to four-family loans tied to other indices totaled $12.0 million.

In underwriting one- to four-family residential real estate loans, the Bank evaluates the borrower's ability to meet debt service requirements at current as well as fully indexed rates for ARM loans, as well as the value of the property securing the loan. Most properties securing real estate loans made by the Bank during fiscal 2016 had appraisals performed on them by independent fee appraisers approved and qualified by the Board of Directors. The Bank generally requires borrowers to obtain title insurance and fire, property and flood insurance (if indicated) in an amount not less than the amount of the loan. Real estate loans originated by the Bank generally contain a "due on sale" clause allowing the Bank to declare the unpaid principal balance due and payable upon the sale of the security property.

The Bank also originates loans secured by multi-family residential properties that are often located outside the Company&#8217;s primary market area, but made to borrowers who operate within the primary market area. At June 30, 2016, the Bank had $129.0 million, or 11.4% of net loans receivable, in multi-family residential real estate. The majority of the multi-family residential loans that are originated by the Bank are amortized over periods generally up to 25 years, with balloon maturities up to ten years. Both fixed and adjustable interest rates are offered and it is 

&#160;

&#160;

typical for the Bank to include an interest rate &#8220;floor&#8221; and &#8220;ceiling&#8221; in these loan agreements. Variable rate loans typically adjust daily, monthly, quarterly or annually based on the Wall Street prime interest rate. Generally, multi-family residential loans do not exceed 85% of the lower of the appraised value or purchase price of the secured property. The Bank generally requires a Board-approved independent certified fee appraiser to be engaged in determining the collateral value. As a general rule, the Bank requires the unlimited guaranty of all individuals (or entities) owning (directly or indirectly) 20% or more of the stock of the borrowing entity.

The primary risk associated with multifamily loans is the ability of the income-producing property that collateralizes the loan to produce adequate cash flow to service the debt. High unemployment or generally weak economic conditions may result in borrowers having to provide rental rate concessions to achieve adequate occupancy rates. In an effort to reduce these risks, the Bank will evaluate the guarantor&#8217;s ability to inject personal funds as a tertiary source of repayment.

Commercial Real Estate Lending. The Bank actively originates loans secured by commercial real estate including land (improved and unimproved), strip shopping centers, retail establishments, nursing homes and other healthcare related facilities, and other businesses generally located in the Bank's market area. At June 30, 2016, the Bank had $452.1 million in commercial real estate loans, which represented 40.0% of net loans receivable. Of this amount, $102.2 million were loans secured by agricultural properties. The increase over the last several fiscal years in agricultural lending is the result of an intentional focus by the Bank on that segment of our market, including the hiring of personnel with knowledge of agricultural lending and experience in that type of business development. The Bank expects to continue to grow its agricultural lending portfolio, but expects that the rate of growth experienced over the last several fiscal years is unlikely to be maintained. The Bank expects to continue to maintain or increase the percentage of commercial real estate loans, inclusive of agricultural properties, in its total portfolio.

Commercial real estate loans originated by the Bank are generally based on amortization schedules of up to 25 years with monthly principal and interest payments. Generally, these loans have fixed interest rates and maturities ranging up to seven years, with a balloon payment due at maturity. Alternatively, for some loans, the interest rate adjusts at least annually after an initial period up to seven years, based upon the Wall Street prime rate. The Bank typically includes an interest rate "floor" in the loan agreement. The Bank's fixed-rate commercial real estate portfolio has a weighted average maturity of 38 months. Variable rate commercial real estate originations typically adjust daily, monthly, quarterly or annually based on the Wall Street prime rate. Generally, loans for improved commercial properties do not exceed 80% of the lower of the appraised value or the purchase price of the secured property. Agricultural real estate terms offered differ slightly, with amortization schedules of up to 25 years with an 80% loan-to-value ratio, or 30 years with a 75% loan-to-value ratio. Agricultural real estate loans generally require annual, instead of monthly, payments. Before credit is extended, the Bank analyzes the financial condition of the borrower, the borrower's credit history, and the reliability and predictability of the cash flow generated by the property and the value of the property itself. Generally, personal guarantees are obtained from the borrower in addition to obtaining the secured property as collateral for such loans. The Bank also generally requires appraisals on properties securing commercial real estate to be performed by a Board-approved independent certified fee appraiser.

Generally, loans secured by commercial real estate involve a greater degree of credit risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. These loans typically involve large balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the secured property, repayment of such loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. See "Asset Quality."

Construction Lending. The Bank originates real estate loans secured by property or land that is under construction or development. At June 30, 2016, the Bank had $77.4 million, or 6.8% of net loans receivable in construction loans outstanding.

Construction loans originated by the Bank are generally secured by mortgage loans for the construction of owner occupied residential real estate or to finance speculative construction secured by residential real estate, land development, or owner-operated or non-owner occupied commercial real estate. At June 30, 2016, $43.9 million of the Bank's construction loans were secured by one- to four-family residential real estate (of which $6.0 million was for speculative construction), $18.3 million of which were secured by multi-family residential real estate, and $15.2 million of which were secured by commercial real estate. During construction, these loans typically require monthly interest-only payments and have maturities ranging from 6 to 12 months. Once construction is completed, permanent 

&#160;

&#160;

construction loans may be converted to monthly payments using amortization schedules of up to 30 years on residential and generally up to 25 years on commercial real estate.

Speculative construction and land development lending generally affords the Bank an opportunity to receive higher interest rates and fees with shorter terms to maturity than those obtainable from residential lending. Nevertheless, construction and land development lending is generally considered to involve a higher level of credit risk than one- to four-family residential lending due to (i) the concentration of principal among relatively few borrowers and development projects, (ii) the increased difficulty at the time the loan is made of accurately estimating building or development costs and the selling price of the finished product, (iii) the increased difficulty and costs of monitoring and disbursing funds for the loan, (iv) the higher degree of sensitivity to increases in market rates of interest and changes in local economic conditions, and (v) the increased difficulty of working out problem loans. Due in part to these risk factors, the Bank may be required from time to time to modify or extend the terms of some of these types of loans. In an effort to reduce these risks, the application process includes a submission to the Bank of accurate plans, specifications and costs of the project to be constructed. These items are also used as a basis to determine the appraised value of the subject property. Loan amounts are generally limited to 80% of the lesser of current appraised value and/or the cost of construction.

Consumer Lending. The Bank offers a variety of secured consumer loans, including home equity, direct and indirect automobile loans, second mortgages, mobile homes and loans secured by deposits. The Bank originates substantially all of its consumer loans in its primary market area. Usually, consumer loans are originated with fixed rates for terms of up to five years, with the exception of home equity lines of credit, which are variable, tied to the prime rate of interest, and are for a period of ten years. At June 30, 2016, the Bank's consumer loan portfolio totaled $46.5 million, or 4.1% of net loans receivable.

Home equity loans represented 54.0% of the Bank's consumer loan portfolio at June 30, 2016, and totaled $25.1 million, or 2.2% of net loans receivable.

Home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) are secured with a deed of trust and are issued up to 100% of the appraised or assessed value of the property securing the line of credit, less the outstanding balance on the first mortgage. Interest rates on the HELOCs are adjustable and are tied to the current prime interest rate, generally with an interest rate floor in the loan agreement. This rate is obtained from the Wall Street Journal and adjusts on a daily basis. Interest rates are based upon the loan-to-value ratio of the property with better rates given to borrowers with more equity. HELOCs, which are secured by residential properties, are secured by stronger collateral than other consumer loans and because of the adjustable rate structure, contain less interest rate risk to the Bank. Lending up to 100% of the value of the property presents greater credit risk to the Bank. Consequently, the Bank limits this product to customers with a favorable credit history. At June 30, 2016, lines of credit up to 80% of the property value represented 87.0% of outstanding balances, and 88.9% of balances and commitments; lines of credit for more than 80%, but not exceeding 90%, of the property value represented 12.8% of outstanding balances and 10.9% of balances and commitments; and lines of credit in excess of 90% of the property value represented 0.2% of outstanding balances and 0.2% of balances and commitments.

Automobile loans represented 13.4% of the Bank's consumer loan portfolio at June 30, 2016, and totaled $6.2 million, or 0.55% of net loans receivable. Of that total, an immaterial amount was originated by auto dealers. Typically, automobile loans are made for terms of up to 60 months for new and used vehicles. Loans secured by automobiles have fixed rates and are generally made in amounts up to 100% of the purchase price of the vehicle.

Consumer loan terms vary according to the type and value of collateral, length of contract and creditworthiness of the borrower. The underwriting standards employed for consumer loans include employment stability, an application, a determination of the applicant's payment history on other debts, and an assessment of ability to meet existing and proposed obligations. Although creditworthiness of the applicant is a primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the security, if any, in relation to the proposed loan amount.

Consumer loans may entail greater credit risk than do residential mortgage loans, because they are generally unsecured or are secured by rapidly depreciable or mobile assets, such as automobiles. In the event of repossession or default, there may be no secondary source of repayment or the underlying value of the collateral could be insufficient to repay the loan. In addition, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower's continuing financial stability, and thus are more likely to be affected by adverse personal circumstances. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit 

&#160;

&#160;

the amount which can be recovered on such loans. The Bank's delinquency levels for these types of loans are reflective of these risks. See "Asset Classification."

Commercial Business Lending. The Bank's commercial business lending activities encompass loans with a variety of purposes and security, including loans to finance accounts receivable, inventory, equipment and operating lines of credit. At June 30, 2016, the Bank had $202.0 million in commercial business loans outstanding, or 17.8% of net loans receivable. Of this amount, $73.3 million were loans related to agriculture, including amortizing equipment loans and annual production lines. The increase over the last several fiscal years in agricultural business lending is the result of an intentional focus by the Bank on that segment of our market, including the hiring of personnel with knowledge of agricultural business lending and experience in that type of business development. The Company expects to continue to grow its agricultural lending portfolio, but expects that the rate of growth experienced over the last several fiscal years is unlikely to be maintained. The Bank expects to continue to maintain the current percentage of commercial business loans in its total loan portfolio.

The Bank currently offers both fixed and adjustable rate commercial business loans. At year end, the Bank had $137.5 million in fixed rate and $64.6 million of adjustable rate commercial business loans. The adjustable rate business loans typically reprice daily, monthly, quarterly, or annually, in accordance with the Wall Street prime rate of interest. The Bank typically includes an interest rate "floor" in the loan agreement.

Commercial business loan terms vary according to the type and value of collateral, length of contract and creditworthiness of the borrower. Generally, commercial loans secured by fixed assets are amortized over periods up to five years, while commercial operating lines of credit or agricultural production lines are generally for a one year period. The Bank's commercial business loans are evaluated based on the loan application, a determination of the applicant's payment history on other debts, business stability and an assessment of ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. Although creditworthiness of the applicant is a primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the security, if any, in relation to the proposed loan amount.

Unlike residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrower's ability to make repayment from his or her employment and other income, and which are secured by real property whose value tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial business loans are of higher risk and typically are made on the basis of the borrower's ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower's business. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial business loans may be substantially dependent on the success of the business itself. Further, the collateral securing the loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business.

As of June 30, 2016, loans with a maturity date after June 30, 2017, with fixed interest rates totaled $416.1 million, and loans with a maturity date after June 30, 2017, with adjustable rates totaled $344.0 million.

Loan Originations, Sales and Purchases

Generally, all loans are originated by the Bank's staff, who are salaried loan officers. Loan applications are generally taken and processed at each of the Bank's full-service locations, and the Bank in recent years began processing online applications for single-family residential loans. The Bank also offers secondary market loans to its customers.

While the Bank originates both adjustable-rate and fixed-rate loans, the ability to originate loans is dependent upon the relative customer demand for loans in its market. In fiscal 2016, the Bank originated $425.9 million of loans, compared to $391.2 million and $289.7 million, respectively, in fiscal 2015 and 2014. Of these loans, mortgage loan originations were $334.2 million, $276.0 million and $226.2 million in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Increases in originations over recent periods is attributed primarily to an expanded market area and customer base following recent acquisitions.

From time to time, the Bank has purchased loan participations consistent with its loan underwriting standards. In fiscal 2016, the Bank purchased $5.8 million of new loan participations. At June 30, 2016, loan participations totaled $12.2 million, or 1.07% of net loans receivable. At June 30, 2016, all of these participations were performing in accordance with their respective terms. The Bank evaluates additional loan participations on an ongoing basis, based in part on local loan demand, liquidity, portfolio and capital levels.

Amount reported in fiscal 2015 includes the Company&#8217;s acquisition of loans from the Peoples acquisition recorded at a $190.4 million fair value, and in fiscal 2014 includes the Company&#8217;s acquisition of loans from the Ozark Legacy acquisition and the Citizens acquisition recorded at $39.4 million and $12.0 million fair value, respectively.

Loan Commitments

The Bank issues commitments for one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, operating or working capital lines of credit, and standby letters-of-credit. Such commitments may be oral or in writing with specified terms, conditions and at a specified rate of interest. The Bank had outstanding net loan commitments of approximately $163.8 million at June 30, 2016. See Note 15 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8.

Loan Fees

In addition to interest earned on loans, the Bank receives income from fees in connection with loan originations, loan modifications, late payments and for miscellaneous services related to its loans. Income from these activities varies from period to period depending upon the volume and type of loans made and competitive conditions.

Asset Quality

Delinquent Loans. Generally, when a borrower fails to make a required payment on mortgage or installment loans, the Bank begins the collection process by mailing a computer generated notice to the customer. If the delinquency is not cured promptly, the customer is contacted again by notice or telephone. After an account secured by real estate becomes over 60 days past due, the Bank will typically send a 30-day demand notice to the customer which, if not cured or unless satisfactory arrangements have been made, will lead to foreclosure. Foreclosure may not begin until the loan reaches 120 days delinquency in the case of consumer residential loans. For consumer loans, the Missouri Right-To-Cure Statute is followed, which requires issuance of specifically worded notices at specific time intervals prior to repossession or further collection efforts.

&#160;

The following table sets forth the Bank's loan delinquencies by type and by amount at June 30, 2016.

Non-Performing Assets. The table below sets forth the amounts and categories of non-performing assets in the Bank's loan portfolio. Loans are placed on non-accrual status when the collection of principal and/or interest becomes doubtful, and as a result, previously accrued interest income on the loan is removed from current income. The Bank has no reserves for uncollected interest and does not accrue interest on non-accrual loans. A loan may be transferred back to accrual status once a satisfactory repayment history has been restored. Foreclosed assets held for sale include assets acquired in settlement of loans and are shown net of reserves.

For information regarding accrual of interest on impaired loans, see Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8.

The Company generally treats loans acquired with impaired credit quality as an accruing asset, despite reporting such loans as impaired, because these loans are recorded at acquisition at fair value, which includes an accretable discount which is recorded as interest income over the expected life of the obligation. 

The following table sets forth information with respect to the Bank's non-performing assets as of the dates indicated.

At June 30, 2016, troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) totaled $8.4 million, of which $2.3 million was considered nonperforming and was included in the nonaccrual loan total above. The remaining $6.1 million in TDRs have complied with the modified terms for a reasonable period of time and are therefore considered by the Company to be accrual status loans. At June 30, 2015, TDRs totaled $9.3 million, of which $2.8 million was considered nonperforming and was included in the nonaccrual loan total above. In general, these loans were subject to classification as TDRs at June 30, 2016, on the basis of guidance under ASU 2011-02, which indicates that the Company may not consider the borrower&#8217;s effective borrowing rate on the old debt immediately before the restructuring in determining whether a concession has been granted.

Real Estate Owned. Real estate properties acquired through foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value, less estimated disposition costs. If fair value at the date of foreclosure is lower than the balance of the related loan, the difference will be charged-off to the allowance for loan losses at the time of transfer. Management periodically updates real estate valuations and if the value declines, a specific provision for losses on such property is established by a charge to operations. At June 30, 2016, the Company's balance of real estate owned totaled $3.3 million and included $623,000 residential and $2.7 million non-residential properties.

Asset Classification. Applicable regulations require that each insured institution review and classify its assets on a regular basis. In addition, in connection with examinations of insured institutions, regulatory examiners have authority to identify problem assets and, if appropriate, require them to be classified. There are three classifications for problem assets: substandard, doubtful and loss. Substandard assets must have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts, 

&#160;

conditions and values questionable, and there is a high possibility of loss. An asset classified loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the institution is not warranted. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as loss, it charges off the balance of the assets. Assets which do not currently expose the Bank to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses, may be designated as special mention. The Bank's determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the FRB and the Missouri Division of Finance, which can order the establishment of additional loss allowances.

On the basis of management's review of the assets of the Company, at June 30, 2016, classified assets totaled $16.0 million, or 1.14% of total assets as compared to $20.9 million, or 1.61% of total assets at June 30, 2015. Of the amount classified as of June 30, 2016, $16.0 million was considered substandard, while none was considered doubtful or loss. Included in classified assets at June 30, 2016, was one significant loan relationship with outstanding classified balances of $1.5 million secured by commercial real estate, an aircraft, and a general business lien (an additional $3.2 million outstanding to this borrower is not classified, due to a USDA guarantee). Also included are various other loans totaling $9.5 million (see Note 3 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 for more information on classified loans); foreclosed real estate and repossessed assets totaling $3.4 million; and all of the Company's investments in pooled trust preferred securities, with a book value of $1.6 million. Classified loans are so designated due to concerns regarding the borrower&#8217;s ability to generate sufficient cash flows to service the debt. The investments in pooled trust preferred securities were classified due to concerns about the ability of the pools to generate sufficient cash flows to service the debt. Two of these securities, with a book value of $630,000, have previously deferred interest payments, and another of these securities, with a book value of $471,000, continues to defer interest payments as of June 30, 2016. Classified loans totaling $5.6 million had been placed on nonaccrual status at June 30, 2016, of which $2.7 million were more than 30 days delinquent. Of the remaining $5.4 million of classified loans, all were performing in accordance with terms at June 30, 2016, and none were more than 30 days delinquent.

Other Loans of Concern. In addition to the classified assets above, there was also an aggregate of $3.7 million in loans, with respect to which management has doubts as to the ability of the borrowers to continue to comply with present loan repayment terms, which may ultimately result in the classification of such assets. These loans continued to perform according to terms as of June 30, 2016, but were identified as other loans of concern due to concerns regarding the borrower&#8217;s ability to continue to generate sufficient cash flows to service the debt.

Allowance for Loan Losses. The Bank's allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses based on management's evaluation of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of loan activity, including those loans which are being specifically monitored. Such evaluation, which includes a review of loans for which full collectability may not be reasonably assured, considers among other matters, the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, economic conditions, historical loan loss experience and other factors that warrant recognition in providing for an adequate provision for loan losses. These provisions for loan losses are charged against earnings in the year they are established. The Bank had an allowance for loan losses at June 30, 2016, of $13.8 million, which represented 152% of nonperforming assets as compared to an allowance of $12.3 million, which represented 148% of nonperforming assets at June 30, 2015.

At June 30, 2016, the Bank also had an allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures of $745,000, as compared to $704,000 at June 30, 2015. This amount is maintained as a separate liability account to cover estimated potential credit losses associated with off-balance sheet credit instruments such as off-balance sheet loan commitments, standby letters of credit, and guarantees.

Although management believes that it uses the best information available to determine the allowance, unforeseen market conditions could result in adjustments and net earnings could be significantly affected if circumstances differ substantially from assumptions used in making the final determination. Future additions to the allowance will likely be the result of periodic loan, property and collateral reviews and thus cannot be predicted with certainty in advance.

Investment Activities

General. Under Missouri law, the Bank is permitted to invest in various types of liquid assets, including U.S. Government and State of Missouri obligations, securities of various federal agencies, certain certificates of deposit of insured banks and savings institutions, banker's acceptances, repurchase agreements, federal funds, commercial paper, investment grade corporate debt securities and obligations of States and their political sub-divisions. Generally, the investment policy of the Company is to invest funds among various categories of investments and repricing characteristics based upon the Bank's need for liquidity, to provide collateral for borrowings and public unit deposits, to help reach financial performance targets and to help maintain asset/liability management objectives.

The Company's investment portfolio is managed in accordance with the Bank's investment policy which was adopted by the Board of Directors of the Bank and is implemented by members of the asset/liability management committee which consists of the President/CEO, the CFO, the COO and four outside directors.

Investment purchases and/or sales must be authorized by the appropriate party, depending on the aggregate size of the investment transaction, prior to any investment transaction. The Board of Directors reviews all investment transactions. All investment purchases are identified as available-for-sale ("AFS") at the time of purchase. The Company has not classified any investment securities as held-to-maturity over the last five years. Securities classified as "AFS" must be reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, recorded as a separate component of stockholders' equity. At June 30, 2016, AFS securities totaled $129.2 million (excluding FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank membership stock). For information regarding the amortized cost and market values of the Company's investments, see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8.

As of June 30, 2016, the Company had no derivative instruments and no outstanding hedging activities. Management has reviewed potential uses for derivative instruments and hedging activities, but has no immediate plans to employ these tools.

Debt and Other Securities. At June 30, 2016, the Company's debt and other securities portfolio totaled $58.0 million, or 4.13% of total assets as compared to $59.5 million, or 4.58% of total assets at June 30, 2015. During fiscal 2016, the Bank had $10.6 million in maturities and $18.4 million in securities purchases. Of the securities that matured, $8.6 million was called for early redemption. At June 30, 2016, the investment securities portfolio included $6.5 million in U.S. government and government agency bonds, of which $4.5 million is subject to early redemption at the option of the issuer, and $46.2 million in municipal bonds, of which $41.1 million is subject to early redemption at the option of the issuer. The remaining portfolio consists of $5.3 million in other securities (including pooled trust preferred securities with an estimated fair value of $1.0 million). Based on projected maturities, the weighted average life of the debt and other securities portfolio at June 30, 2016, was 44 months. Membership stock held in the FHLB of Des Moines, totaling $6.0 million, and the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, totaling $2.3 million, along with equity stock of $475,000 in two correspondent (banker&#8217;s) banks, was not included in the above totals.

At June 30, 2016, the Company owned four pooled trust preferred securities with an estimated fair value of $1.0 million and a book value of $1.6 million. For three of these securities, the estimated fair value of $673,000 is less than the book value of $1.4 million. The June 30, 2016, cash flow analysis for these three securities indicated it is probable the Company will receive all contracted principal and related interest projected. The cash flow analysis used in making this determination was based on anticipated default, recovery, and prepayment rates, and the resulting cash flows were discounted based on the yield anticipated at the time the securities were purchased. At December 31, 2008, analysis of the fourth pooled trust preferred security indicated other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI). The loss recognized at that time reduced the amortized cost basis for that security, and as of June 30, 2016, the estimated fair value of the security exceeds the new, lower amortized cost basis. See Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8.

Mortgage-Backed Securities. At June 30, 2016, mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;MBS&#8221;) totaled $71.2 million, or 5.1%, of total assets, as compared to $70.1 million, or 5.4%, of total assets at June 30, 2015. During fiscal 2016, the Bank had maturities and prepayments of $13.3 million and $14.2 million in purchases of MBS. At

&#160;

June 30, 2016, the MBS portfolio included $54.6 million in fixed-rate MBS, and $16.6 million in fixed rate collateralized mortgage obligations (&#8220;CMOs&#8221;), all of which passed the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council's sensitivity test. Based on projected prepayment rates, the weighted average life of the MBS and CMOs at June 30, 2016, was 45 months. Prepayment rates may cause the anticipated average life of MBS portfolio to extend or shorten based upon actual prepayment rates.

Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds

General. The Company's primary sources of funds are deposits, borrowings, payments of principal and interest on loans, MBS and CMOs, interest and principal received on investment securities and other short-term investments, and funds provided from operating results. Loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows and loan prepayments are significantly influenced by general market interest rates and overall economic conditions.

Borrowings, including FHLB advances, have been used at times to provide additional liquidity. Borrowings are used on an overnight or short-term basis to compensate for periodic fluctuations in cash flows, and are used on a longer term basis to fund loan growth and to help manage the Company's sensitivity to fluctuating interest rates.

Deposits. The Bank's depositors are generally residents and entities located in the State of Missouri or Arkansas. Deposits are attracted from within the Bank's market area through the offering of a broad selection of deposit instruments, including demand deposit accounts, negotiable order of withdrawal ("NOW") accounts, money market deposit accounts, saving accounts, certificates of deposit and retirement savings plans. Deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required, the time periods the funds may remain on deposit and the interest rate, among other factors. In determining the terms of its deposit accounts, the Bank considers current market interest rates, profitability to the Bank, managing interest rate sensitivity and its customer preferences and concerns. The Bank's Asset/Liability Committee regularly reviews its deposit mix and pricing.

&#160;

&#160;

The Bank will periodically promote a particular deposit product as part of the Bank's overall marketing plan. Deposit products have been promoted through various mediums, which include radio and newspaper advertisements, as well as &#8220;grassroots&#8221; marketing techniques, such as sponsorship of &#8211; or activity at &#8211; community events. The emphasis of these campaigns is to increase consumer awareness and market share of the Bank.

The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in prevailing interest rates, and competition. Based on its experience, the Bank believes that its deposits are relatively stable sources of funds. However, the ability of the Bank to attract and maintain certificates of deposit, and the rates paid on these deposits, has been and will continue to be significantly affected by market conditions. The following table depicts the composition of the Bank's deposits as of June 30, 2016:

In the unlikely event the Bank is liquidated, depositors will be entitled to payment of their deposit accounts prior to any payment being made to the Company as the sole stockholder of the Bank.

Borrowings. As a member of the FHLB of Des Moines, the Bank has the ability to apply for FHLB advances. These advances are available under various credit programs, each of which has its own maturity, interest rate and repricing characteristics. Additionally, FHLB advances have prepayment penalties as well as limitations on size or term. In order to utilize FHLB advances, the Bank must be a member of the FHLB system, have sufficient collateral to secure the requested advance and own stock in the FHLB equal to 4.45% of the amount borrowed. See "REGULATION &#8211; The Bank &#8211; Federal Home Loan Bank System."

Although deposits are the Bank's primary and preferred source of funds, the Bank has actively used FHLB advances. The Bank's general policy has been to utilize borrowings to meet short-term liquidity needs, or to provide a longer-term source of funding loan growth when other cheaper funding sources are unavailable or to aide in asset/liability management. As of June 30, 2016, the Bank had $110.2 million in FHLB advances, of which $69.8 million was overnight borrowings, another $40.4 million had an original term of ten years, subject to early redemption by the FHLB after an initial period of one to five years. In order for the Bank to borrow from the FHLB, it has pledged $522.9 million of its residential and commercial real estate loans to the FHLB (although the actual collateral required for advances taken and letters of credit issued amounts to $163.9 million) and has purchased $6.0 million in FHLB stock. At June 30, 2016, the Bank had additional borrowing capacity on its pledged residential and commercial real estate loans from the FHLB of $138.2 million, as compared to $307.4 million at June 30, 2015.

Additionally, the Bank is approved to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank&#8217;s discount window on a primary credit basis. Primary credit is available to approved institutions on a generally short-term basis at the &#8220;discount rate&#8221; set by the FOMC. The Bank has pledged agricultural real estate and other loans to farmers as collateral for any amounts borrowed through the discount window. As of June 30, 2016, the Bank was approved to borrow up to $112.6 million through the discount window, but no balance was outstanding.

Also classified as borrowings are the Bank&#8217;s securities sold under agreements to repurchase (&#8220;repurchase agreements&#8221;). These agreements are typically entered into with local public units or corporations. Generally, the Bank pays interest on these agreements at a rate similar to those available on repurchase agreements with wholesale funding sources, but in the current rate environment the Bank is paying a rate slightly higher than the market for such funding. The Bank views repurchase agreements with local entities as a stable funding source, and collateral requirements relating to public units are somewhat easier to manage using repurchase agreements. At June 30, 2016, the Bank had outstanding $27.1 million in repurchase agreements, as compared to $27.3 million at June 30, 2015.

Southern Missouri Statutory Trust I, a Delaware business trust subsidiary of the Company, issued $7.0 million in Floating Rate Capital Securities (the "Trust Preferred Securities") with a liquidation value of $1,000 per share in March, 2004. The securities are due in 30 years, were redeemable after five years and bear interest at a floating rate based on LIBOR. At June 30, 2016, the current rate was 3.41%. The securities represent undivided beneficial interests in the trust, which was established by Southern Missouri Bancorp for the purpose of issuing the securities. The Trust Preferred Securities were sold in a private transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act") and have not been registered under the Act. The securities may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.

Southern Missouri Statutory Trust I used the proceeds of the sale of the Trust Preferred Securities to purchase Junior Subordinated Debentures of Southern Missouri Bancorp. Southern Missouri Bancorp is using the net proceeds for working capital and investment in its subsidiaries. Trust Preferred Securities currently qualify as 

&#160;

&#160;

Tier I Capital for regulatory purposes. See "Regulation" for further discussion on the treatment of the trust-preferred securities.

In its October 2013 acquisition of Ozarks Legacy, the Company assumed $3.1 million in floating rate junior subordinated debt securities. The securities had been issued in June 2005 by Ozarks Legacy in connection with the sale of trust preferred securities, bear interest at a floating rate based on LIBOR, and mature in 2035. At June 30, 2016, the carrying value was $2.6 million with a current rate was 3.10%.

In the Peoples Acquisition, the Company assumed $6.5 million in floating rate junior subordinated debt securities. The debt securities had been issued in 2005 by PBC in connection with the sale of trust preferred securities, bear interest at a floating rate based on LIBOR, are now redeemable at par, and mature in 2035. At June 30, 2016, the carrying value was $5.0 million with a current rate was 2.45%.

REGULATION

The following is a brief description of certain laws and regulations applicable to the Company and the Bank. Descriptions of laws and regulations here and elsewhere in this prospectus do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the actual laws and regulations. Legislation is introduced from time to time in the United States Congress or the Missouri state legislature that may affect the operations of the Company and the Bank. In addition, the regulations governing us may be amended from time to time. Any such legislation or regulatory changes in the future could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.

Recent Legislation

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) imposed various restrictions and an expanded framework of regulatory oversight for financial institutions, including depository institutions. The following discussion summarizes significant aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act that may affect the Bank and the Company.

The following selected aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are related to the operations of the Bank:

&#183; The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;), an independent consumer compliance regulatory agency within the Federal Reserve, has been established. The CFPB is empowered to exercise broad regulatory, supervisory and enforcement authority over financial institutions with total assets of over $10 billion with respect to Federal consumer financial protection laws. Financial institutions with assets of less than $10 billion, like the Bank, will continue to be subject to supervision and enforcement by their primary federal banking regulator with respect to federal consumer financial protection laws. The CFPB also has authority to promulgate new consumer financial protection regulations and amend existing consumer financial protection regulations; 

&#183; The Federal Deposit Insurance Act was amended to require depository institution holding companies to serve as a source of strength for their depository institution subsidiaries; 

&#183; The prohibition on payment of interest on demand deposits was repealed; 

&#183; Deposit insurance was permanently increased to $250,000; and 

&#183; The deposit insurance assessment base for FDIC insurance is the depository institution's average consolidated total assets less the average tangible equity during the assessment period; 

The following aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are related to the operations of the Company:

&#183; Tier 1 capital treatment for "hybrid" capital items like trust preferred securities is eliminated, subject to various grandfathering and transition rules. As required by the Act, the federal banking agencies have promulgated new rules on regulatory capital for both depository institutions and their holding companies; 

&#183; Public companies are required to provide their shareholders with a non-binding vote: (i) at least once every three years on the compensation paid to executive officers, and (ii) at least once every six years on whether shareholders should have a "say on pay" vote every one, two or three years; 

&#183; A separate, non-binding shareholder vote is required regarding golden parachutes for named executive officers when a shareholder vote takes place on mergers, acquisitions, dispositions or other transactions that would trigger the parachute payments; 

&#183; Securities exchanges are required to prohibit brokers from using their own discretion to vote shares not beneficially owned by them for certain "significant" matters, which include votes on the election of directors, executive compensation matters, and any other matter determined to be significant; 

&#183; Stock exchanges are prohibited from listing the securities of any issuer that does not have a policy providing for (i) disclosure of its policy on incentive compensation payable on the basis of financial information reportable under the securities laws, and (ii) the recovery from current or former executive 

&#160;

&#160;

officers, following an accounting restatement triggered by material noncompliance with securities law reporting requirements, of any incentive compensation paid erroneously during the three-year period preceding the date on which the restatement was required that exceeds the amount that would have been paid on the basis of the restated financial information; 

&#183; Smaller reporting companies are exempt from complying with the internal control auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. 

The Bank

General. As a state-chartered, federally-insured trust company with banking powers, the Bank is subject to extensive regulation. Lending activities and other investments must comply with various statutory and regulatory requirements, including prescribed minimum capital standards. The Bank is regularly examined by the FRB and the Missouri Division of Finance and files periodic reports concerning the Bank's activities and financial condition with its regulators. The Bank's relationship with depositors and borrowers also is regulated to a great extent by both federal law and the laws of Missouri, especially in such matters as the ownership of deposit accounts and the form and content of mortgage documents.

Federal and state banking laws and regulations govern all areas of the operation of the Bank, including reserves, loans, mortgages, capital, issuance of securities, payment of dividends, and establishment of branches. Federal and state bank regulatory agencies also have the general authority to limit the dividends paid by insured banks and bank holding companies if such payments should be deemed to constitute an unsafe and unsound practice. The respective primary federal regulators of the Company and the Bank have authority to impose penalties, initiate civil and administrative actions and take other steps intended to prevent banks from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices.

State Regulation and Supervision. As a state-chartered trust company with banking powers, the Bank is subject to applicable provisions of Missouri law and the regulations of the Missouri Division of Finance. Missouri law and regulations govern the Bank's ability to take deposits and pay interest thereon, to make loans on or invest in residential and other real estate, to make consumer loans, to invest in securities, to offer various banking services to its customers, and to establish branch offices.

Federal Reserve System. The FRB requires all depository institutions to maintain reserves at specified levels against their transaction accounts (checking, NOW and Super NOW checking accounts). At June 30, 2016, the Bank was in compliance with these reserve requirements.

The Bank is authorized to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank "discount window." FRB regulations require associations to exhaust other reasonable alternative sources of funds, including FHLB borrowings, before borrowing from the Federal Reserve Bank.

Federal Home Loan Bank System. &#160; The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Des Moines, which is one of 11 regional FHLBs that provide home financing credit. Each FHLB serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. It is funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB System. It makes loans or advances to members in accordance with policies and procedures, established by the Board of Directors of the FHLB, which are subject to the oversight of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. All advances from the FHLB are required to be fully secured by sufficient collateral as determined by the FHLB. In addition, all long-term advances are required to provide funds for residential home financing. See Business - Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds - Borrowings.

As a member, the Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB of Des Moines. At June 30, 2016, the Bank had $6.0 million in FHLB stock, which was in compliance with this requirement. The Bank received $99,000 and $116,000 in dividends from the FHLB of Des Moines for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

The FHLBs continue to contribute to low- and moderately-priced housing programs through direct loans or interest subsidies on advances targeted for community investment and low- and moderate-income housing projects. These contributions have adversely affected the level of FHLB dividends paid and could continue to do so in the future. These contributions could also have an adverse effect on the value of FHLB stock in the future. A reduction in value of the Bank's FHLB stock may result in a corresponding reduction in the Bank's capital.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation . The Bank's deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC. The general insurance limit is $250,000. As insurer, the FDIC imposes deposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by FDIC-insured institutions. It also may prohibit any FDIC-insured institution from engaging in any activity the FDIC determines by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the fund. The FDIC also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions against a member bank of the Federal Reserve Board after giving the FRB an opportunity to take such action.

The Dodd-Frank Act establishes 1.35% as the minimum reserve ratio (the ratio of the net worth of the fund to aggregate insured deposits). The FDIC has adopted a plan under which it will meet this ratio by September 30, 2020, the deadline imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act. The FDIC is required to offset the effect of the increase in the reserve ratio on institutions with assets less than $10 billion of the increase in the statutory minimum reserve ratio to 1.35% from the former statutory minimum of 1.15%. In addition to the statutory minimum ratio, the FDIC must designate a reserve ratio, known as the designated reserve ratio or DRR, which may exceed the statutory minimum. The FDIC has established 2.0% as the DRR.

Implementing the Dodd-Frank Act requirement that the FDIC&#8217;s deposit insurance assessments be based on assets instead of deposits, the FDIC has issued rules specifying that specify that the assessment base for a bank is equal to its total average consolidated assets less average tangible equity. Until the FDIC&#8217;s reserve ratio reaches 1.15%, the FDIC assessment rates for an institution with assets of less than $10 billion generally range from approximately 2.5 basis points to 45 basis points, depending on applicable adjustments. Effective for the quarter beginning July 1, 2016 or the quarter that begins after the reserve ratio reserve ratio reaches 1.15%, the assessment rates for such an institution will range from 3 to 30 basis points, based on the institution&#8217;s weighted average CAMELS component ratings and certain financial ratios. These rates are subject to downward adjustment (not below 1.5 basis points) based on the ratio of unsecured debt the institution has issued to its assessment base, and to upward adjustment based on its holdings of unsecured debt issued by other insured institutions. Assessment rates are expected to decrease in the future as the reserve ratio increases in specified increments. To implement the offset requirement, FDIC regulations require that institutions with assets of $10 billion or more pay a surcharge during a temporary period, and smaller institutions will receive certain credits when the reserve ratio reaches 1.38%. No institution may pay a dividend if it is in default on its federal deposit insurance assessment.

A significant increase in insurance assessment rates would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank. There can be no prediction as to what insurance assessment rates will be in the future. Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. Management of the Bank is not aware of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of the Bank's deposit insurance.

In addition to the assessment for deposit insurance, institutions are required to make payments on bonds issued in the late 1980s by the Financing Corporation to recapitalize a predecessor deposit insurance fund. This payment is established quarterly and during the fourth quarter ended June 30, 2016, was 0.56 basis points (annualized) of assessable deposits.

Prompt Corrective Action . Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act ("FDIA"), each federal banking agency is required to implement a system of prompt corrective action for depository institutions that it regulates. The federal banking agencies have promulgated substantially similar regulations to implement this system of prompt corrective action. In connection with the capital rules discussed under &#8220;Capital Rules&#8221; below, effective January 1, 2015, an institution is deemed to be &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; if it has (i) a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or more, (ii) a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5% or more, (iii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or more, and (iv) a leverage ratio of 5.0% or more, and is not subject to specified requirements to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. Additionally, an institution shall be deemed to be "adequately capitalized" if it has (i) a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or more, (ii) a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5% or more, (iii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or more, and (iv) a leverage ratio of 4.0% or more and does not meet the definition of "well capitalized;" "undercapitalized" if it has (i) a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 8.0%, (ii) a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio that is less than 4.5%, (iii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio that is less than 6.0%, or (iv) a leverage ratio that is less than 4.0%; "significantly undercapitalized" if it has (i) a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 6.0%, (ii) a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio that is less than 3.0%, (iii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio that is less than 4.0%, or (iv) a leverage ratio that is less than 3.0%; and "critically undercapitalized" if it has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

A federal banking agency may, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, reclassify a well capitalized institution as adequately capitalized and may require an adequately capitalized institution or an undercapitalized institution to comply with supervisory actions as if it were in the next lower category if the institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition or has received in its most recent examination, and has not corrected, a less than satisfactory rating for asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity or sensitivity to market risk. (The agency may not, however, reclassify a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized.) An institution that is not well capitalized is subject to certain restrictions on its deposit rates.

An undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized institution is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to its appropriate federal banking agency. The plan must specify (i) the steps the institution will take to become adequately capitalized, (ii) the capital levels to be attained each year, (iii) how the institution will comply with any regulatory sanctions then in effect against the institution and (iv) the types and levels of activities in which the institution will engage. The banking agency may not accept a capital restoration plan unless the agency determines, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions, and is likely to succeed in restoring the institution's capital and would not appreciably increase the risks to which the institution is exposed. An institution that is not well capitalized is subject to restrictions on brokered deposits.

The FDIA provides that the appropriate federal regulatory agency must require an insured depository institution that is significantly undercapitalized or is undercapitalized and either fails to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan within the time period allowed or fails in any material respect to implement a capital restoration plan accepted by the appropriate federal banking agency to take one or more of the following actions: (i) sell enough shares, including voting shares, to become adequately capitalized; (ii) merge with (or be sold to) another institution (or holding company), but only if grounds exist for appointing a conservator or receiver; (iii) restrict certain transactions with banking affiliates as if the "sister bank" requirements of Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act ("FRA") did not exist; (iv) otherwise restrict transactions with bank or non-bank affiliates; (v) restrict interest rates that the institution pays on deposits to "prevailing rates" in the institution's region; (vi) restrict asset growth or reduce total assets; (vii) alter, reduce or terminate activities; (viii) hold a new election of directors; (ix) require dismissal of any director or senior executive officer who held office for more than 180 days immediately before the institution became undercapitalized; (x) require employment of qualified senior executive officers; (xi) prohibit acceptance of deposits from correspondent depository institutions; (xii) require divestiture of certain non-depository affiliates which pose a danger to the institution; (xiii) be divested by a parent holding company; (xiv) require prior FRB approval for payment of dividends by a bank holding company; and (xv) take any other action which the FRB, in the case of a state member bank, determines would better carry out the purposes of the prompt corrective action provisions.

A critically undercapitalized institution is subject to further restrictions and to appointment of a receiver or conservator 90 days after becoming critically undercapitalized unless the FDIC and, in the case of a state member Bank, the FRB concur that other action better serves the purposes of the prompt corrective action provisions.

At June 30, 2016, the Bank was categorized as "well capitalized" under the prompt corrective action regulations of the FRB.

Standards for Safety and Soundness. The federal banking regulatory agencies have prescribed, by regulation, standards for all insured depository institutions relating to: (i) internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems; (ii) loan documentation; (iii) credit underwriting; (iv) interest rate risk exposure; (v) asset growth; (vi) asset quality; (vii) earnings; and (viii) compensation, fees and benefits ("Guidelines"). The Guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the FRB determines that the Bank fails to meet any standard prescribed by the Guidelines, the agency may require the Bank to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard.

Guidance on Subprime Mortgage Lending. The federal banking agencies have issued guidance on subprime mortgage lending to address issues related to certain mortgage products marketed to subprime borrowers, particularly adjustable rate mortgage products that can involve "payment shock" and other risky characteristics. Although the guidance focuses on subprime borrowers, the banking agencies note that institutions should look to the principles contained in the guidance when offering such adjustable rate mortgages to non-subprime borrowers. The guidance prohibits predatory lending programs; provides that institutions should underwrite a mortgage loan on the borrower's ability to repay the debt by its final maturity at the fully-indexed rate, assuming a fully amortizing repayment schedule; encourages reasonable workout arrangements with borrowers who are in default; mandates clear and balanced advertisements and other communications; encourages arrangements for the escrowing of real estate taxes and insurance; and states that institutions should develop strong control and monitoring systems. The 

&#160;

&#160;

guidance recommends that institutions refer to the Guidelines (discussed above) which provide underwriting standards for all real estate loans.

The federal banking agencies announced their intention to carefully review the risk management and consumer compliance processes, policies and procedures of their supervised financial institutions and their intention to take action against institutions that engage in predatory lending practices, violate consumer protection laws or fair lending laws, engage in unfair or deceptive acts or practices, or otherwise engage in unsafe or unsound lending practices.

Guidance on Commercial Real Estate Concentrations . The federal banking agencies have issued guidance on sound risk management practices for concentrations in commercial real estate lending. The particular focus is on exposure to commercial real estate loans that are dependent on the cash flow from the real estate held as collateral and that are likely to be sensitive to conditions in the commercial real estate market (as opposed to real estate collateral held as a secondary source of repayment or as an abundance of caution). A bank that has experienced rapid growth in commercial real estate lending, has notable exposure to a specific type of commercial real estate loan, or is approaching or exceeding the following supervisory criteria may be identified for further supervisory analysis with respect to real estate concentration risk; total loans for construction land development and other land representing 100% or more of the Bank&#8217;s total capital; or total commercial real estate loans (as defined in the guidance) that exceed 300% of the Bank&#8217;s total capital and the Bank&#8217;s commercial real estate portfolio has increased by 50% or more during the prior 36 months.

Capital Rules . The regulatory capital ratios of the federal banking agencies implement the &#8220;Basel III&#8221; regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. &#8220;Basel III&#8221; refers to various documents released by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The Capital regulations became effective January 1, 2015 (with some provisions transitioned into full effectiveness over two to four years). The new requirements created a new ratio for Common Equity Tier 1 (&#8220;CET1&#8221;) capital, increased the leverage and Tier 1 capital ratios, changed the risk-weights of certain assets for purposes of the risk-based capital ratios, created an additional capital conservation buffer over the minimum capital ratios, and changed what qualifies as regulatory capital.

Under the new requirements, the minimum capital ratios are: a ratio of CET1 capital to total risk-weighted assets of 4.5%, a ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 6.0%, a ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0%, and a leverage ratio of 4.0%.

Mortgage servicing rights, certain deferred tax assets and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries over designated percentages of common stock are deducted from capital, subject to a two-year transition period. CET1 capital consists of Tier 1 capital less all capital components that are not considered common equity. In addition, Tier 1 capital generally includes accumulated other comprehensive income, which includes all unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities, subject to a two-year transition period. Because of its asset size, Southern Bank had the one-time option and elected in the first quarter of calendar year 2015 to permanently opt-out of the inclusion of accumulated other comprehensive income in its capital calculations, to reduce the impact of market volatility on its regulatory capital levels. For a bank holding company with less than $15 billion in consolidated assets as of December 31, 2009, TARP and cumulative perpetual preferred stock included in Tier 1 capital prior to May 19, 2010 is grandfathered and included as Tier 1 capital under the new capital regulations.

The new requirements also include changes in the risk-weights of certain assets to better reflect credit risk and other risk exposures. These include a 150% risk weight (up from 100%) for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans and for non-residential mortgage loans that are 90 days past due or otherwise in nonaccrual status; a 20% (up from 0%) credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable (currently set at 0%); a 250% risk weight (up from 100%) for mortgage servicing and deferred tax assets that are not deducted from capital; and increased risk-weights (0% to 600%) for equity exposures.

In addition to the minimum CET1, Tier 1, and total capital ratios, Southern Bank and the Company must maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional CET1 capital equal to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets above each of the required minimum capital levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying certain discretionary bonuses. This new capital conservation buffer requirement is be phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increasing each year until fully implemented in January 2019.

Under the standards, in order to be considered well-capitalized, Southern Bank is required to have at least a CET1 ratio of 6.5% (new), a Tier 1 ratio of 8% (increased from 6%), a total capital ratio of 10% (unchanged) and a 

&#160;

&#160;

leverage ratio of 5% (unchanged), and not be subject to specified requirements to meet and maintain a specific capital ratio for a capital measure.

As of June 30, 2016, Southern Bank and the Company meet all these new requirements, including the full 2.5% capital conservation buffer, and would remain well capitalized if all phased-in requirements had been fully in effect on that date.

Activities and Investments of Insured State-Chartered Banks. The FDIA generally limits the activities and equity investments of FDIC-insured, state-chartered banks to those that are permissible for national banks. Under regulations dealing with equity investments, an insured state bank generally may not directly or indirectly acquire or retain any equity investment of a type, or in an amount, that is not permissible for a national bank. An insured state bank is not prohibited from, among other things, (i) acquiring or retaining a majority interest in a subsidiary, (ii) investing as a limited partner in a partnership the sole purpose of which is direct or indirect investment in the acquisition, rehabilitation or new construction of a qualified housing project, provided that such limited partnership investments may not exceed 2% of the bank's total assets, (iii) acquiring up to 10% of the voting stock of a company that solely provides or reinsures directors', trustees' and officers' liability insurance coverage or bankers' blanket bond group insurance coverage for insured depository institutions, and (iv) acquiring or retaining the voting shares of a depository institution if certain requirements are met.

Subject to certain regulatory exceptions, FDIC regulations provide that an insured state-chartered bank may not, directly, or indirectly through a subsidiary, engage as "principal" in any activity that is not permissible for a national bank unless the FDIC has determined that such activities would pose no risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund and that the bank is in compliance with applicable regulatory capital requirements.

Affiliate Transactions. The Company and the Bank are separate and distinct legal entities. Various legal limitations restrict the Bank from lending or otherwise supplying funds to the Company (or any other affiliate), generally limiting such transactions with the affiliate to 10% of the Bank's capital and surplus and limiting all such transactions with all affiliates to 20% of the Bank's capital and surplus. Such transactions, including extensions of credit, sales of securities or assets and provision of services, also must be on terms and conditions consistent with safe and sound banking practices, including credit standards, that are substantially the same or at least as favorable to the Bank as those prevailing at the time for transactions with unaffiliated companies.

Federally insured banks are subject, with certain exceptions, to certain additional restrictions (including collateralization) on extensions of credit to their parent holding companies or other affiliates, on investments in the stock or other securities of affiliates and on the taking of such stock or securities as collateral from any borrower. In addition, such banks are prohibited from engaging in certain tying arrangements in connection with any extension of credit or the providing of any property or service.

Community Reinvestment Act. Banks are also subject to the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 ("CRA"), which requires the appropriate federal bank regulatory agency, in connection with its regular examination of a bank, to assess the bank's record in meeting the credit needs of the community serviced by the bank, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The regulatory agency's assessment of the bank's record is made available to the public. Further, such assessment is required of any bank which has applied, among other things, to establish a new branch office that will accept deposits, relocate an existing office or merge or consolidate with, or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of, a financial institution. The Bank received a "satisfactory" rating during its most recent CRA examination.

Dividends. Dividends from the Bank constitute the major source of funds for dividends that may be paid by the Company. The amount of dividends payable by the Bank to the Company depends upon the Bank's earnings and capital position, and is limited by federal and state laws, regulations and policies.

The amount of dividends actually paid by the Bank during any one period will be strongly affected by the Bank's management policy of maintaining a strong capital position. Dividends can be restricted if the capital conservation buffer is not maintained as described under &#8220;Capital Rules&#8221; above. Federal law further provides that no insured depository institution may make any capital distribution (which would include a cash dividend) if, after making the distribution, the institution would be "undercapitalized," as defined in the prompt corrective action regulations. Moreover, the federal bank regulatory agencies also have the general authority to limit the dividends paid by insured banks if such payments should be deemed to constitute an unsafe and unsound practice.

The Company

Federal Securities Law. The stock of the Company is registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). As such, the Company is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements of the SEC under the Exchange Act.

The Company's stock held by persons who are affiliates (generally officers, directors and principal stockholders) of the Company may not be resold without registration or unless sold in accordance with certain resale restrictions. If the Company meets specified current public information requirements, each affiliate of the Company is able to sell in the public market, without registration, a limited number of shares in any three-month period.

The SEC has adopted rules under which, if certain conditions are met, the holders of 3% of voting shares of the Company who have held their shares for three years may require the Company to include their nominees for board seats in proxy materials distributed by the Company. "Smaller reporting companies", like the Company, will be subject to these new rules after a three-year phase-in period.

Bank Holding Company Regulation. Bank holding companies are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FRB under the Bank Holding Company Act (&#8220;BHCA&#8221;). As a bank holding company, the Company is required to file reports with the FRB and such additional information as the FRB may require, and the Company and its non-banking affiliates are subject to examination by the FRB. Under FRB policy, a bank holding company must serve as a source of financial strength for its subsidiary banks. Under this policy the FRB may require, and has required in the past, a holding company to contribute additional capital to an undercapitalized subsidiary bank. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, this policy is codified and rules to implement it will be established. Under the BHCA, a bank holding company must obtain FRB approval before: (i) acquiring, directly or indirectly, ownership or control of any voting shares of another bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, it would own or control more than 5% of such shares (unless it already owns or controls the majority of such shares); (ii) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company; or (iii) merging or consolidating with another bank holding company.

The Company is subject to the activity limitations imposed on bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies. The BHCA prohibits a bank holding company, with certain exceptions, from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank or bank holding company, or from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, or providing services for its subsidiaries. The principal exceptions to these prohibitions involve certain activities which are permitted, by statute or by FRB regulation or order, have been identified as activities closely related to the business of banking or managing or controlling banks. The list of activities permitted by the FRB includes, among other things, operating a savings institution, mortgage company, finance company, credit card company or factoring company; performing certain data processing operations; providing certain investment and financial advice; underwriting and acting as an insurance agent for certain types of credit-related insurance; leasing property on a full-payout, non-operating basis; selling money orders, travelers' checks and United States Savings Bonds; real estate and personal property appraising; providing tax planning and preparation services; and, subject to certain limitations, providing securities brokerage services for customers.

TAXATION

Federal Taxation &#160;

General. The Company and the Bank report their income on a fiscal year basis using the accrual method of accounting and are subject to federal income taxation in the same manner as other corporations with some exceptions, including particularly the Bank's reserve for bad debts discussed below. The following discussion of tax matters is intended only as a summary and does not purport to be a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the Bank or the Company.

Bad Debt Reserve. Historically, savings institutions, such as the Bank used to be, which met certain definitional tests primarily related to their assets and the nature of their business ("qualifying thrift"), were permitted to establish a reserve for bad debts and to make annual additions thereto, which may have been deducted in arriving at their taxable income. The Bank's deductions with respect to their loans, which are generally loans secured by certain interests in real property, historically has been computed using an amount based on the Bank's actual loss experience, in accordance with IRC Section 585(B)(2). Due to the Bank's loss experience, the Bank generally recognized a bad debt deduction equal to their net charge-offs.

The Bank&#8217;s average assets for the current year exceeded $500 million, thus classifying it as a large bank for purposes of IRC Section 585. Under IRC Section 585(c)(3), a bank that becomes a large bank must change its method of accounting from the reserve method to a specific charge-off method under IRC Section 166. The Bank&#8217;s deductions with respect to their loans are computed under the specific charge-off method. The specific charge-off method will be used in the current year and all subsequent tax years.

Distributions. To the extent that the Bank makes "nondividend distributions" to the Company, such distributions will be considered to result in distributions from the balance of its bad debt reserve as of December 31, 1987 (or a lesser amount if the Bank's loan portfolio decreased since December 31, 1987) and then from the supplemental reserve for losses on loans ("Excess Distributions"), and an amount based on the Excess Distributions will be included in the Bank's taxable income. Nondividend distributions include distributions in excess of the Bank's current and accumulated earnings and profits, distributions in redemption of stock and distributions in partial or complete liquidation. However, dividends paid out of the Bank's current or accumulated earnings and profits, as calculated for federal income tax purposes, will not be considered to result in a distribution from the Bank's bad debt reserve. The amount of additional taxable income created from an Excess Distribution is an amount that, when reduced by the tax attributable to the income, is equal to the amount of the distribution. Thus, if the Bank makes a "nondividend distribution," then approximately one and one-half times the Excess Distribution would be includable in gross income for federal income tax purposes, assuming a 35% corporate income tax rate (exclusive of state and local taxes). See "REGULATION" for limits on the payment of dividends by the Bank. The Bank does not intend to pay dividends that would result in a recapture of any portion of its tax bad debt reserve.

Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax. The Internal Revenue Code imposes a tax on alternative minimum taxable income ("AMTI") at a rate of 20%. In addition, only 90% of AMTI can be offset by net operating loss carry-overs. AMTI is increased by an amount equal to 75% of the amount by which the Bank's adjusted current earnings exceeds its AMTI (determined without regard to this preference and prior to reduction for net operating losses).

Dividends-Received Deduction. The Company may exclude from its income 100% of dividends received from the Bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations. The corporate dividends-received deduction is generally 70% in the case of dividends received from unaffiliated corporations with which the Company and the Bank will not file a consolidated tax return, except that if the Company or the Bank owns more than 20% of the stock of a corporation distributing a dividend, then 80% of any dividends received may be deducted.

Missouri Taxation &#160;

General. Missouri-based banks, such as the Bank, are subject to a Missouri bank franchise and income tax.

Bank Franchise Tax. The Missouri bank franchise tax is imposed on (i) the bank's taxable income at the rate of 7%, less credits for certain Missouri taxes, including income taxes. However, the credits excludes taxes paid for real estate, unemployment taxes, bank tax, and taxes on tangible personal property owned by the Bank and held for lease or rentals to others - income-based calculation; and (ii) the bank's net assets at a rate of .007%. Net assets are defined as total assets less deposits and the investment in greater than 50% owned subsidiaries - asset-based calculation.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Income Tax. The Bank and its holding company and related subsidiaries are subject to an income tax that is imposed on the consolidated taxable income apportioned to Missouri at the rate of 6.25%. The return is filed on a consolidated basis by all members of the consolidated group including the Bank.

Arkansas Taxation

General. Due to its loan activity and the acquisitions of Arkansas banks in recent periods, the Bank is subject to an Arkansas income tax. The tax is imposed on the Bank&#8217;s apportioned taxable income at a rate of 6%.

Audits

There have been no IRS audits of the Company's Federal income tax returns or audits of the Bank's state income tax returns during the past five years.
