BUSINESS

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

Avalon Holdings Corporation (&#8220;Avalon&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was formed on April 30, 1998 as a subsidiary of American Waste Services, Inc. (&#8220;AWS&#8221;). On June 17, 1998, AWS distributed, as a special dividend, all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Avalon to the holders of AWS common stock on a pro rata and corresponding basis (the &#8220;Spin-off&#8221;). The history and organization of the remaining operations, some of which were contributed to Avalon as a result of the Spin-off, are described below. 

&#160; 

In June 1990, AWS purchased approximately 5.6 acres of real estate located in Warren, Ohio on which it constructed Avalon&#8217;s corporate headquarters. In connection with the acquisition of such property, Avalon Lakes Golf, Inc. (&#8220;ALGI&#8221;), a former subsidiary of AWS and now a wholly owned subsidiary of Avalon, acquired the real and personal property associated with the Avalon Lakes Golf Course, an 18-hole golf course adjacent to the office property. The corporate headquarters and ALGI were contributed to Avalon by AWS. The Avalon corporate headquarters building includes a clubhouse, restaurant, golf simulators and a pro shop for the Avalon Golf and Country Club at Avalon Lakes Golf Course. 

&#160; 

In 1995, American Waste Management Services, Inc. (&#8220;AWMS&#8221;) commenced its waste disposal brokerage and management operations and in 1997, American Landfill Management, Inc. (&#8220;ALMI&#8221;) started its captive landfill management operations. Both companies were contributed to Avalon by AWS and now are wholly owned subsidiaries of Avalon. 

&#160; 

In November 2003, TBG, Inc. (&#8220;TBG&#8221;), a subsidiary of ALGI, entered into a long-term lease agreement with Squaw Creek Country Club to lease and operate its golf course and related facilities. As a result of the transaction, Avalon created a newly organized subsidiary, Avalon Golf and Country Club, Inc. (&#8220;AGCC&#8221;) which manages all the golf courses and related operations. 

&#160; 

In October 2006, Avalon, through a newly created subsidiary, Avalon Country Club at Sharon, Inc. (&#8220;Sharon&#8221;), completed the acquisition of the Sharon Country Club assets. The primary assets of the Sharon club include the golf course and clubhouse. Avalon renovated the clubhouse and constructed additional recreational facilities and operates the Sharon facilities as part of its Avalon Golf and Country Club. 

&#160; 

In June 2011, AWMS Water Solutions, LLC (formerly American Water Management Services, LLC) was formed to acquire options on properties for the purpose of operating salt water injection wells. AWMS Water Solutions, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Avalon, manages all the salt water injection well operations, including the marketing and sales function and all decisions regarding the well operations for a percentage of the gross revenues. 

&#160; 

In August 2013, Avalon created a new Ohio limited liability company, AWMS Holdings, LLC, to act as a holding company to form and own a series of wholly owned subsidiaries that will own and operate salt water injection wells and facilities (together the &#8220;facilities&#8221;). AWMS Holdings, LLC, offers investment opportunities to accredited investors by selling membership units of AWMS Holdings, LLC through private placement offerings. The monies received from these offerings, along with internally contributed capital, are used to construct the facilities necessary for the operation of salt water injection wells. As a result of the private placement offering, Avalon is not the majority owner of AWMS Holdings, LLC; however, due to the managerial control of AWMS Water Solutions, LLC, the financial statements of AWMS Holdings, LLC and subsidiaries are included in Avalon&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. 

&#160; 

In August 2013, AWMS Holdings, LLC formed its first wholly owned subsidiary, AWMS Rt. 169, LLC, to own and operate two salt water injection wells. AWMS Rt. 169, LLC leases 5.2 acres on which the salt water injection wells are located. 

&#160; 

In August 2014, Avalon, through a newly created subsidiary, The Avalon Resort and Spa LLC, completed the acquisition of The Magnuson Grand Hotel in Howland, Ohio. Subsequent to the acquisition, The Magnuson Grand Hotel was renamed and now operates as The Avalon Inn (formerly renamed The Avalon Resort and Spa in August 2014). The primary assets of The Avalon Inn include the hotel, indoor swimming pool and adjoining tennis center. The Avalon Inn is located adjacent to Avalon&#8217;s corporate headquarters and the Avalon Lakes Golf Course. In 2015, The Avalon Inn was in operation and in the process of being renovated and expanded. The renovations and expansion include a complete renovation of the existing facility and indoor junior Olympic sized swimming pool, new restaurants, bars, extensive conference facilities and complete fitness center. The Avalon Inn operates in conjunction with the Avalon Golf and Country Club. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Business Segments Information 

&#160; 

Avalon&#8217;s business segments are waste management services and golf and related operations. The waste management services segment includes waste disposal brokerage and management services, captive landfill management operations and salt water injection well operations. The golf and related operations segment includes the operation and management of three golf courses and related clubhouses, a hotel, fitness centers, tennis courts, spa services, dining, banquet and conference facilities and a travel agency. In 2015, one customer of the waste management services segment, Shell Western Exploration and Production, Inc., accounted for 11% of the waste management services segment&#8217;s net operating revenues to external customers and 8% of the consolidated net operating revenues. In 2014, no customer individually accounted for 10% or more of Avalon&#8217;s consolidated net operating revenues. 

&#160; 

Waste Management Services 

&#160; 

Avalon&#8217;s waste management subsidiaries provide hazardous and nonhazardous waste disposal brokerage and management services, captive landfill management services and salt water injection well operations. Waste management services are provided to industrial, commercial, municipal and governmental customers primarily in selected northeastern and midwestern United States markets. For the years 2015 and 2014, the net operating revenues of the waste management services segment represented approximately 72% and 75%, respectively, of Avalon&#8217;s total consolidated net operating revenues. 

&#160; 

AWMS assists customers with managing and disposing of wastes at approved treatment and disposal sites based upon a customer&#8217;s needs. 

&#160; 

Because waste generators remain liable for their waste, both before and after disposal, they require assurance that their waste will be safely and properly transported, treated and disposed of. To give customers this confidence, as well as to limit its own potential liability, AWMS has instituted procedures designed to minimize the risks of improper handling or disposal of waste. 

&#160; 

Before AWMS will provide waste brokerage or management services, a potential customer must complete a detailed waste profile setting forth the amount, chemical composition and any unique characteristics for each type of waste to be handled. Representative samples of the waste are analyzed by a state or federally certified laboratory. In addition, an AWMS representative generally inspects the process generating the waste, the location where the waste may be temporarily stored or the site of the remediation project producing the waste, and interviews representatives of the generator familiar with the waste. This inspection, along with the laboratory results, allows AWMS to determine whether the waste is within acceptable parameters for disposal and, if so, what special handling and treatment procedures must be instituted. If the waste is continuously generated, new representative samples are tested on a periodic basis. 

&#160; 

These procedures are important to both AWMS and its customers because the key to proper handling of waste is accurate identification. Hazardous waste which is not identified as such, and thus, improperly disposed of can result in substantial liability to the waste generator, the disposal facility, AWMS and potentially to all other waste generators that have used the disposal site. Conversely, waste that could safely and legally be disposed of in a solid waste landfill, but is instead sent to a hazardous waste facility for treatment and disposal, will result in substantial and unnecessary expense to the generator. 

&#160; 

ALMI is a landfill management company that provides technical and operational services to customers owning captive disposal facilities. A captive disposal facility only disposes of waste generated by the owner of such facility. ALMI provides turnkey services, including daily operations, facilities management and management reporting for its customers. Currently, ALMI manages one captive disposal facility located in Ohio. In addition, American Construction Supply, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of ALMI, sells construction mats. 

&#160; 

AWMS Holdings, LLC, is a holding company that was created to form and own a series of wholly owned subsidiaries that own and operate salt water injection wells and facilities. AWMS Holdings, LLC, offers investment opportunities to accredited investors by selling membership units of AWMS Holdings, LLC through private placement offerings. The monies received from these offerings, along with internally contributed capital, are used to construct the facilities necessary for the operation of salt water injection wells. AWMS Water Solutions, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Avalon, manages the operations, including the marketing and sales function and all the decisions regarding the well operations for a percentage of the gross revenues. As a result of the private placement offering, Avalon is not the majority owner of AWMS Holdings, LLC; however, due to the managerial control of AWMS Water Solutions, LLC, the financial statements of AWMS Holdings, LLC and subsidiaries are included in Avalon&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. AWMS Holdings, LLC formed its first wholly owned subsidiary, AWMS Rt. 169, LLC, to own and operate two salt water injection wells. AWMS Rt. 169, LLC leases 5.2 acres on which the salt water injection wells are located.

&#160; 

Golf and Related Operations 

&#160; 

Avalon&#8217;s golf and related operations segment operates three golf courses and related country clubs and facilities, a hotel and travel agency. For the years 2015 and 2014, the net operating revenues of the golf and related operations segment represented approximately 28% and 25%, respectively, of Avalon&#8217;s total consolidated net operating revenues. 

&#160; 

ALGI owns and operates a Pete Dye designed championship golf course located in Warren, Ohio. ALGI generates revenue from membership dues, greens fees, cart rentals, merchandise, and food and beverage sales. 

&#160; 

TBG, a subsidiary of ALGI, entered into a long-term agreement with Squaw Creek Country Club to lease and operate its golf course and related facilities. The lease, which commenced on November 1, 2003, has an initial term of ten (10) years with four (4) consecutive ten (10) year renewal term options unilaterally exercisable by TBG. In addition to a championship golf course, the Squaw Creek facilities include a swimming pool, tennis courts and a clubhouse that includes a fitness center, dining and banquet facilities. TBG generates its revenue in the same manner as ALGI, but also generates revenues from tennis and swimming. 

&#160; 

Avalon Travel, Inc., a subsidiary of ALGI, owns and operates a travel agency which generates its revenue from booking travel reservations. 

&#160; 

In October 2006, Avalon, through its subsidiary, Avalon Country Club of Sharon, Inc., completed the acquisition of the Sharon Country Club assets. The primary assets of Sharon include the golf course and clubhouse which includes, dining and banquet facilities, a swimming pool, spa services and a fitness center. Sharon generates its revenue in the same manner as ALGI and TBG, but also generates revenues from its fitness center and spa services. &#160; 

&#160; 

In August 2014, Avalon, through a newly created subsidiary, The Avalon Resort and Spa LLC, completed the acquisition of The Magnuson Grand Hotel in Howland, Ohio. Subsequent to the acquisition, The Magnuson Grand Hotel was renamed and now operates as The Avalon Inn (formerly renamed The Avalon Resort and Spa in August 2014). The primary assets of The Avalon Inn include the hotel, indoor swimming pool and adjoining tennis center. The Avalon Inn is located adjacent to Avalon&#8217;s corporate headquarters and the Avalon Lakes Golf Course. The Avalon Inn provides guests with a self-contained vacation experience, offering hotel guests golf packages to all of the golf courses of the Avalon Golf and Country Club and allows its guests to utilize the facilities at each of the clubhouses. Members of the Avalon Golf and Country Club also have access to all of the amenities offered by The Avalon Inn. The Avalon Inn earns revenues through room rentals, food and beverage sales, merchandise sales, tennis and fitness activities. In 2015, The Avalon Inn was in operation and in the process of being renovated and expanded. The renovations and expansion include a complete renovation of the existing facility and indoor junior Olympic sized swimming pool, new restaurants, bars, extensive conference facilities and complete fitness center. The Avalon Inn operates in conjunction with the Avalon Golf and Country Club. 

&#160; 

In November 2003, Avalon formed the Avalon Golf and Country Club to manage its golf courses and the related operations. Members of the Avalon Golf and Country Club are entitled to privileges at all the facilities. Membership requires payment of annual dues. Members receive several benefits including reduced greens fees, preferential tee times and discounts on merchandise. In addition, members of the Avalon Golf and Country Club also have access to all of the amenities offered by The Avalon Inn. The Avalon Golf and Country Club competes with many public courses and country clubs in the area. Although the golf courses continue to be available to the general public, the primary source of revenues is derived from the members of the Avalon Golf and Country Club. Avalon believes that the combination of its three golf facilities and the addition of The Avalon Inn will result in additional memberships in the Avalon Golf and Country Club. The ability to retain current members and attract new members has been an ongoing challenge. Although Avalon was able to increase the number of members of the Avalon Golf and Country Club, as of December 31, 2015, Avalon has not attained its membership goals. There can be no assurance as to when such goals will be attained and when the golf and related operations will ultimately become profitable. Avalon is continually using different marketing strategies to attract new members, such as local television advertising and various membership promotions. A significant decline in members could adversely affect the future financial performance of Avalon. 

&#160; 

The golf courses are significantly dependent upon weather conditions during the golf season as a result of being located in northeast Ohio and western Pennsylvania. Avalon&#8217;s financial performance is adversely affected by adverse weather conditions. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Governmental Regulations 

&#160; 

The federal government and numerous state and local governmental bodies are continuing to consider legislation or regulations to either restrict or impede the disposal and/or transportation of waste. A portion of Avalon&#8217;s waste brokerage and management services revenues is derived from the disposal and/or transportation of out-of-state waste. Any law or regulation restricting or impeding the transportation of waste or the acceptance of out-of-state waste for disposal could have a negative effect on Avalon. Avalon&#8217;s waste brokerage and management services may also be affected by the trend toward laws requiring the development of waste reduction and recycling or other programs. 

&#160; 

All three of Avalon&#8217;s golf course operations and The Avalon Inn currently hold liquor licenses for their respective facilities. If, for some reason, any one of these facilities were to lose their liquor license, the financial performance of the golf and related operations would be adversely affected. 

&#160; 

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

Avalon&#8217;s sales and marketing approach is decentralized, with each business segment being responsible for its own sales and marketing efforts. Each business segment employs its own sales force which concentrates on expanding its business. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The hazardous and nonhazardous waste disposal brokerage and management business is highly competitive and fragmented. Avalon&#8217;s waste disposal brokerage and management business competes with other brokerage companies, as well as, with companies which own treatment and disposal facilities. In addition to price, knowledge and service are key factors when competing for waste disposal brokerage and management business. Avalon&#8217;s waste disposal brokerage and management operations obtain and retain customers by providing services and identifying cost-efficient disposal options unique to a customer&#8217;s needs. Consolidation within the solid waste industry has resulted in a reduction in the number of disposal options available to waste generators and may cause disposal pricing to increase. Avalon may need to absorb all or a portion of these cost increases depending upon competitive conditions at the time. 

&#160; 

Avalon&#8217;s golf courses are located in Warren, Ohio, Vienna, Ohio and Sharon, Pennsylvania and compete with many public courses and country clubs in the area. 

&#160; 

The Avalon Inn&#8217;s principal competitors are operators of full service, select service and extended stay properties, including major hospitality chains with well-established and recognized brands. We also compete against small chains and independent and local owners and operators. We compete for guests based primarily on the resort complex and country club experience created through the combination of the resort and country club operations. 

&#160; 

Insurance 

&#160; 

Avalon carries $11,000,000 of liability insurance coverage. This insurance includes coverage for comprehensive general liability, automobile liability and other customary coverage. Avalon also carries $5,000,000 of liability insurance for the golf courses and related operations which maintain separate insurance coverage. Avalon carries comprehensive property damage coverage and, also, professional liability insurance for its fitness, swimming and spa activities. No assurance can be given that such insurance will be available in the future or, if available, that the premiums for such insurance will be reasonable. 

&#160; 

If Avalon were to incur a substantial liability for damages not covered by insurance or in excess of its policy limits or at a time when Avalon no longer is able to obtain appropriate liability insurance, its financial condition could be materially adversely affected. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, Avalon had 388 employees, 31 of whom were employed by the waste management services segment, 335 of whom were employed by the golf and related operations and 22 of whom were employed in financial and administrative activities. Avalon believes that it has a good relationship with its employees. 

&#160; 

Other Business Factors 

&#160; 

None of Avalon&#8217;s business segments is materially dependent on patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises or concessions, other than permits, licenses and approvals issued by regulatory agencies. Avalon does not sponsor significant research and development activities.
