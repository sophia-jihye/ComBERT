&#32;(1) Includes approximately 18,400 boxcars in Rail North America. 

Our rail customers primarily operate in the petroleum, chemical, food/agriculture and transportation industries. Our worldwide railcar fleet consists of diverse railcar types that our customers use to ship approximately 600 different commodities. The following table presents an overview of our railcar types as well as the industries of our customers and the commodities they ship. 

RAIL NORTH AMERICA 

Rail North America is comprised of our wholly owned operations in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, as well as an affiliate investment. Rail North America primarily provides railcars pursuant to full-service leases under which it maintains the railcars, pays ad valorem taxes and property insurance, and provides administrative and other ancillary services. These railcars have estimated useful economic lives of 27 to 42 years &#32;and an average age of approximately 20 years. Rail North America has a large and diverse customer base, serving approximately 800 customers. In 2015 , no single customer accounted for more than 6% of Rail North America&#8217;s total lease revenue, and the top ten customers combined accounted for approximately 24% of Rail North America&#8217;s total lease revenue. Rail North America leases railcars for terms that generally range from four to ten years, although leases may be for longer or shorter terms depending on market conditions. The average remaining lease term of the North American fleet was approximately four years as of December 31, 2015 . Rail North America&#8217;s primary competitors are Union Tank Car Company, American Railcar Leasing, Trinity Industries Leasing Company, the CIT Group, Wells Fargo Rail, The Andersons, Inc., and SMBC Rail Services, LLC. Rail North America competes on the basis of customer relationships, lease rate, maintenance capabilities, customer service, engineering expertise, and availability of railcars. 

Rail North America purchases new railcars from a number of manufacturers, including Trinity Industries, National Steel Car Ltd., The Greenbrier Companies, Freightcar America, and American Railcar Industries, Inc. We also acquire railcars in the secondary market. 

During 2014, we acquired more than 18,500 boxcars from General Electric Railcar Services Corporation for approximately $340 million (the "Boxcar Fleet"). In 2011, we entered into an agreement to acquire 12,500 newly built railcars from Trinity Rail Group, LLC ("Trinity"), a subsidiary of Trinity Industries, over a five-year period. As of December 31, 2015 , we have received customer commitments to lease 12,400 railcars from this agreement, of which 10,100 have been delivered. In 2014, we entered into a new long-term supply agreement with Trinity that will take effect in mid-2016, upon the scheduled expiration of the 2011 supply agreement. Under the terms of that agreement, we may order up to 8,950 newly built railcars over a four-year period from March, 2016 through March, 2020. We may order either tank or freight cars; however, we expect that the majority of the order will be for tank cars. In January 2017, as part of the agreement, either party may initiate a review of the contract pricing if it no longer reflects market rates. This review could result in modifications to the agreement, including termination. 

&#160; 

Rail North America also owns a fleet of locomotives, consisting of 611 older four-axle and 26 six-axle locomotives as of December 31, 2015 . Locomotive customers are primarily Class I, regional, and short-line railroads and industrial users. Lease terms vary from month-to-month to 15 years. As of December 31, 2015 , the average remaining lease term of the locomotive fleet was approximately seven years. Rail North America's primary competitors in locomotive leasing are Wells Fargo Rail, CIT Group Inc., and Progress Rail Services Corporation. Competitive factors in the market include equipment condition, availability, customer service, and pricing. 

Rail North America also remarkets rail assets, including assets managed for third parties and an affiliate. Remarketing activities generate fees and gains which may contribute significantly to Rail North America&#8217;s segment profit. 

Maintenance 

Rail North America operates an extensive network of maintenance facilities in the United States and Canada dedicated to performing timely, efficient, and high quality maintenance for customers. Services include interior cleaning of railcars, routine maintenance and general repairs to the car body and safety appliances, regulatory compliance work, wheelset replacements, exterior blast and painting, and car stenciling. To the extent possible, railcar maintenance is scheduled in a manner that minimizes the amount of time the car is out of service. Rail North America&#8217;s maintenance network consists of: 

&#8226; 

Six major maintenance facilities that can complete all types of maintenance services. 

&#8226; 

Five field maintenance facilities that primarily focus on routine cleaning, repair, and regulatory compliance services. 

&#8226; 

Six customer-dedicated sites operating solely within specific customer facilities that offer services tailored to the needs of our customers&#8217; fleets. 

&#8226; 

Twenty mobile unit locations that travel to many track-side field locations to provide spot repairs and interior cleaning services, thus avoiding the need to send a railcar to a major maintenance facility. 

The maintenance network is supplemented by a number of preferred third-party maintenance facilities. In certain cases, we have entered into fixed-capacity contracts with these third parties under which Rail North America has secured access to maintenance capacity. In 2015 , third-party maintenance facilities accounted for approximately 45% of Rail North America&#8217;s maintenance costs (excluding the cost of repairs performed by railroads). 

In 2015 , wholly owned and third-party maintenance facilities performed approximately 79,000 service events, including multiple independent service events for the same car. 

Our maintenance activities are substantially dedicated to servicing our wholly owned railcar fleet pursuant to the provisions of our lease contracts. Additionally, our customers periodically require services that are not included in the full-service lease agreement, such as repair of railcar damage and, as noted below, we provide maintenance services to one of our affiliates. Revenue earned from these types of maintenance services is recorded in other revenue. 

Affiliates 

Adler Funding LLC ("Adler") is a 12.5% owned railcar leasing partnership that was formed in 2010 with UniCredit Bank AG, Sperber Rail Holdings Inc., and LBT Holding Corporation. Rail North America provides lease, maintenance and asset remarketing services to Adler, for which it receives a base service fee and a performance-based asset remarketing fee. As of December 31, 2015 , Adler owned approximately 2,400 railcars in North America consisting primarily of freight cars with an average age of approximately twelve years. 

Southern Capital Corporation LLC (&#8220;SCC&#8221;) was a 50% owned joint venture with the Kansas City Southern Railroad, formed in 1996. During 2014 and 2015, SCC sold substantially all of its remaining railcars and locomotives. 

RAIL INTERNATIONAL 

Rail International is comprised of our wholly owned European operations ("GATX Rail Europe" or "GRE") and a wholly owned railcar leasing business in India ("Rail India"), as well as one development stage affiliate in China. GRE leases railcars to customers throughout Europe pursuant to full-service leases under which it maintains the railcars and provides value-adding services according to customer requirements. &#32;These railcars have estimated useful lives of 35 to 40 years and an average age of approximately 18 years. GRE has a diverse customer base with approximately 250 customers. In 2015 , two customers each accounted for more than 10% of GRE's total lease revenue and the top ten customers combined accounted for approximately 65% of GRE's total lease revenue. GRE's lease terms generally range from one to ten years and as of December 31, 2015 , the average remaining lease term of the European fleet was approximately two years. GRE competes principally on the basis of customer relationships, lease rate, maintenance expertise, and availability of railcars. Its primary competitors are VTG Aktiengesellschaft, the Ermewa Group, Nacco, a subsidiary of CIT Group Inc, Wascosa AG, and On Rail. 

GRE acquires new railcars primarily from Astra Rail Industries S.R.L., Legios Loco a.s., and Feldbinder Spezialfahrzeugwerke GmbH. Additionally, GRE's Ostr&#243;da, Poland maintenance facility assembles several hundred tank cars each year. As of December 31, 2015 , GRE has a firm commitment to acquire approximately 300 newly manufactured railcars to be delivered in 2016. 

Rail India began operations in 2012 as the first company registered to lease railcars under the Indian Railways Wagon Leasing Scheme. In 2015, Rail India focused on pursuing investment opportunities in new and existing flat wagons, and developing relationships with customers, suppliers and the Indian Railways. As of December 31, 2015 &#32;Rail India owned 777 railcars with estimated useful lives of 20-25 years. Rail India's lease terms, all of which are net leases, generally range from two to ten years and as of December 31, 2015 , the average remaining lease term of the Indian fleet was approximately five years. In 2016, Rail India expects to continue to pursue investment opportunities and grow its fleet of wagons. 

Maintenance 

GRE operates maintenance facilities in Hannover, Germany and Ostr&#243;da, Poland that perform significant repairs, regulatory compliance and modernization work for owned railcars. These service centers are supplemented by a number of third-party repair facilities, which in 2015 &#32;accounted for approximately 43% of GRE's fleet repair costs. 

Similar to our Rail North America segment, Rail International's customers periodically require maintenance services that are not included in the full-service lease agreement. For GRE, these services are generally related to the repair of damages by customers and railways. Revenue earned from these maintenance activities is recorded in other revenue. 

In India, all railcar maintenance is performed by the Indian Railways or an authorized third party provider. 

Rail International Affiliates 

In 2012, IMC-GATX Financial Leasing (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. (&#8220;IMC-GATX China&#8221;) was established as a 50% owned China-based joint venture between us and IMC Pan Asia Alliance Group (&#8220;IMC&#8221;). IMC is a well-established shipping enterprise with experience operating in China and was also our partner in a marine joint venture until we sold our interest in 2015. The primary objective of IMC-GATX China is to establish a rail leasing business in China, if that market develops. 

We previously owned a 37.5% interest in Ahaus Alst&#228;tter Eisenbahn Cargo AG (&#8220;AAE&#8221;), a Switzerland-based freight railcar leasing affiliate. During 2013, we sold our interest to our partner, Ahaus Alst&#228;tter Eisenbahn Holding AG. 

ASC 

ASC operates the largest fleet of US-flagged vessels on the Great Lakes and strives to attain the highest levels of delivery efficiency, safety and environmental stewardship. ASC provides waterborne transportation of dry bulk commodities such as iron ore, coal, limestone aggregates, and metallurgical limestone, which serve end markets that include steel making, domestic automobile manufacturing, electricity generation, and non-residential construction. &#32; Customer service, primarily in the form of scheduling flexibility, reliability, and operating safety, is key to ASC&#8217;s success. ASC&#8217;s sailing season generally runs from April 1 through December 31; however, depending on customer demand and weather conditions, certain vessels may commence operations during March and continue to operate into January of the following year. 

At December 31, 2015 , ASC&#8217;s fleet consisted of 17 vessels with a net book value of $236.5 million and $6.8 million of off-balance sheet assets. All ships are environmentally and operationally compliant. Fourteen of the vessels are diesel powered, have an average age of 38 years, and estimated useful lives of 65 years. Two steam powered vessels were built in the 1940s and 1950s and have estimated remaining useful lives of four years. The other vessel in ASC's fleet is a diesel-powered articulated tug-barge built in 2012, which is leased by ASC under an operating lease that expires in 2017. Sixteen of ASC&#8217;s vessels are generally available for both service contract and spot business; the remaining vessel is dedicated to a time charter agreement that is scheduled to expire following the 2018 sailing season. ASC&#8217;s vessels operate exclusively in the fresh water of the Great Lakes and as a result, with proper maintenance and periodic refurbishment, may achieve extended service well beyond the useful life estimates. 

All of ASC&#8217;s vessels are equipped with self-unloading equipment, enabling them to discharge dry bulk cargo without assistance from shore-side equipment or personnel. This equipment enables the vessels to operate twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. ASC&#8217;s vessels are capable of transporting and unloading almost any free flowing, dry bulk commodity. In 2015 , ASC served 26 customers with the top five customers comprising 85% of total revenue. 

The following table sets forth ASC's fleet as of December 31, 2015 :

ASC&#8217;s vessels operate pursuant to customer contracts that stipulate freight volume and may also be supplemented with additional spot volume opportunities. In 2015 , ASC operated 13 vessels and carried 26.5 million &#32;net tons of cargo. The number of vessels deployed by ASC in any given year is dependent on customer volume requirements. 

ASC&#8217;s primary competitors on the Great Lakes are Interlake Steamship Company, Great Lakes Fleet, Inc., Grand River Navigation, Central Marine Logistics, and VanEnkevort Tug and Barge. ASC principally competes on the basis of service capabilities, customer relationships, and price. 

The United States shipping industry is subject to the Jones Act, which requires all commercial vessels transporting goods between US ports to be built, owned, operated and manned by US citizens, and registered under the US flag. 

PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT 

Portfolio Management has historically generated leasing, marine operating, asset remarketing, and management fee income through a collection of diversified wholly owned assets and joint venture investments. In addition, Portfolio Management's segment profit is significantly impacted by the contribution of the Rolls-Royce &#38; Partners Finance companies. In 2015, we made the decision to exit the majority of our marine investments within our Portfolio Management segment, including six chemical parcel tankers, a number of inland marine vessels, and our 50% interest in the Cardinal Marine joint venture. Certain marine investments were sold during 2015, and additional sales are expected to be completed in 2016. See the Portfolio Management section in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K for further details. Management believes that selling these investments at this time will provide favorable returns and eliminate the future risk of continuing to hold these investments in markets that have become more volatile. Subsequent to the sales of these marine investments, segment profit will be driven primarily by the Rolls-Royce &#38; Partners Finance entities and, to a lesser extent, by certain retained marine investments. 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;

Owned and Managed Assets 

Portfolio Management's wholly owned portfolio consists of assets subject to operating and finance leases, marine assets operating in pooling arrangements, and secured loans. As of December 31, 2015, $103.4 million of the owned assets were held for sale. Upon completion of the sales of the marine investments described above, Portfolio Management's remaining owned assets will consist primarily of five liquefied gas carrying vessels. 

Portfolio Management also manages portfolios of assets for third parties which generate fee and residual sharing income through portfolio administration and remarketing of these assets. 

Affiliates 

Portfolio Management has historically held investments in affiliated companies, primarily aircraft spare engine leasing and shipping operations. 

The Rolls-Royce &#38; Partners Finance companies (collectively the &#8220;RRPF affiliates&#8221;) are a collection of fifteen 50% owned domestic and foreign joint ventures with Rolls-Royce plc (or affiliates thereof, collectively &#8220;Rolls-Royce&#8221;), a leading manufacturer of commercial aircraft jet engines. &#32;The RRPF affiliates are primarily engaged in two business activities: lease financing of aircraft spare engines to a diverse group of commercial aircraft operators worldwide and sale-leaseback financing of aircraft spare engines to Rolls-Royce for use in their engine maintenance programs. As of December 31, 2015 , the RRPF affiliates, in aggregate, owned 436 &#32;engines, of which 224 were on lease to Rolls-Royce. Aircraft engines are generally depreciated over a useful life of 25 years when new and, depending on actual hours of usage and with proper maintenance, may achieve extended service well beyond the useful life estimates. As of December 31, 2015 , the average age of these engines was approximately 11 years. Lease terms vary but typically range from 7 to 10 years. Rolls-Royce acts as manager for each of the RRPF affiliates and also performs substantially all required maintenance activities. 

Cardinal Marine Investments LLC (&#8220;Cardinal Marine&#8221;) was a 50% owned marine joint venture with IMC Holdings, a subsidiary of IMC. IMC is a leading Asia-focused integrated maritime and industrial solutions provider with diversified interests in dry and liquid bulk shipping, ship and crew management, offshore and marine engineering, oil and gas assets, and services and logistics. Cardinal Marine owns five chemical parcel tankers (each with 45,000 dead weight tons (&#8220;dwt&#8221;) carrying capacity) that operate under a pooling arrangement with IMC's other chemical tankers in support of the movement of liquid bulk chemicals in the Middle East Gulf/Far East and US Gulf/Far East trades. In 2015, we sold our interest in this joint venture to our partner, IMC Holdings. 

Intermodal Investment Funds V and VII were each 50% owned joint ventures with DVB Bank SE. The affiliates were formed to finance shipping containers, which were on direct finance leases to third parties. In 2014, we sold our investments in these joint ventures. 

Somargas II Private Limited (&#8220;Somargas&#8221;) and Singco Gas Pte, Limited (&#8220;Singco&#8221;) were 35% and 50% owned joint ventures with IM Skaugen ASA (&#8220;Skaugen&#8221;). Somargas owned six liquid petroleum gas/ethylene vessels (each with 8,500 - 10,000 cubic meters (&#8220;cbm&#8221;) carrying capacity) and Singco owned four liquid petroleum gas/ethylene/LNG vessels (each with 10,000 cbm carrying capacity). In 2013, we sold our interests in Singco and Somargas to Skaugen. In connection with the sale, we received five of the vessels. The vessels continue to operate under a pooling arrangement with Skaugen. 

TRADEMARKS, PATENTS AND RESEARCH ACTIVITIES 

Patents, trademarks, licenses and research and development activities are not material to our businesses taken as a whole. 

SEASONAL NATURE OF BUSINESS 

ASC&#8217;s fleet is inactive for a significant portion of the first quarter of each year due to the winter conditions on the Great Lakes. 

CUSTOMER BASE 

GATX, taken as a whole, is not dependent upon a single customer nor does it have any significant customer concentrations. Segment concentrations, if material, are described above. 

EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEE RELATIONS 

As of December 31, 2015 , we employed 2,253 persons, of whom approximately 42% &#32;were union workers covered by collective bargaining agreements. 

See "Note 15 . Concentrations " in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information about our employees and concentration of labor force. 

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 

Our operations, facilities and properties are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations. These laws cover discharges to waters; air emissions; toxic substances; the generation, handling, storage, transportation, and disposal of waste and hazardous materials; and the investigation and remediation of contamination. These laws have the effect of increasing the cost and liability associated with leasing and operating assets, and violations can result in significant fines, penalties, or other liabilities. Environmental risks and compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations are inherent in rail operations, which frequently involve transporting chemicals and other hazardous materials. 

We are subject to, and may from time to time continue to be subject to, environmental cleanup and enforcement actions in the US and in the foreign countries in which we operate. In particular, the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (&#8220;CERCLA&#8221;), also known as the Superfund law, generally imposes joint and several liability for investigation, cleanup and enforcement costs on current and former owners and operators of a site, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. Accordingly, we have been and may, in the future, be named as a potentially responsible party under CERCLA and other federal, state, local, and foreign laws or regulations for all or a portion of the costs to investigate and clean up sites at which certain contaminants may have been discharged or released by us, our current lessees, former owners or lessees of properties, or other third parties. Environmental remediation and other environmental costs are accrued when considered probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. As of December 31, 2015 , environmental costs were not material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. For further discussion, see "Note 24 . Legal Proceedings and Other Contingencies " in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
