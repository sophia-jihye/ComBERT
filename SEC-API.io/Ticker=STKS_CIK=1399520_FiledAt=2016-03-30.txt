&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

We are a global hospitality company that develops, owns and operates upscale, high-energy restaurants and lounges and provides turn-key food and beverage services for hospitality venues including hotels, casinos and other high-end locations globally. Turn-key food and beverage services are food and beverage services that can be scaled and implemented by us at a particular hospitality venue and customized per the requirements of the client. We were established with the vision of becoming a global market leader in the hospitality industry by melding high-quality service, ambiance and cuisine into one great experience. Our primary restaurant brand is STK, a multi-unit steakhouse concept that combines a high-energy, social atmosphere with the quality of a traditional upscale steakhouse. Our food and beverage hospitality management services, or &#8220;F&#38;B,&#8221; include developing, managing and operating restaurants, bars, rooftop lounges, pools, banqueting and catering facilities, private dining rooms, room service and mini bars tailored to the specific needs of high-end hotels and casinos. Our F&#38;B hospitality clients include global hospitality companies such as the W Hotel, Cosmopolitan Hotel, Gansevoort Hotel Group, Hippodrome Casino, ME Hotels and Hyatt Hotels. 

&#160; 

We opened our first restaurant in January 2004 and as of March 30, 2016, we owned and operated (under lease agreements) 13 and managed (under management agreements) 15 restaurants and lounges, including ten STKs in major metropolitan cities in the United States and Europe (of which seven are owned and three managed). In addition, we provided food and beverage services in five hotels and casinos, one of which is under a lease agreement and four of which are under separate management agreements. We generate management and incentive fee revenue from those restaurants and lounges that we do not own, but instead manage on behalf of our F&#38;B hospitality clients. All of our restaurants, lounges and F&#38;B services are designed to create a social dining and entertainment experience within a destination location. We believe that this design philosophy separates us from more traditional restaurant and foodservice competitors. Our net income for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $7.1 million &#32;and $5.0 million , respectively. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2015, including derivative income of $6.1 million related to the contingent payment associated with the potential exercise of our publicly traded warrants, a non cash impairment loss of approximately $3.0 million primarily relating to our STK location in Washington, DC and the loss from discontinued operations of $(2,476) . On February 27, 2016, our publicly traded warrants expired and approximately 1.4 million shares our Common Stock were forfeited in connection with the expiration of all of the publicly traded warrants. Our net income for the year ended December 31, 2014 included a derivative income of $3.9 million related to the contingent payment associated with the potential exercise of our publicly traded warrants and the loss from discontinued operations of $(1.5) million . The loss from discontinued operations reflects our exiting of non-strategic and underperforming units during these periods and includes the closing of Tenjune in 2014. Further, we closed the Bagatelle unit in Las Vegas, terminated the management agreement with The Palms Hotel in Las Vegas for the Heraea concept and terminated the lease with The Palms Hotel in Las Vegas for the Xi Shi concept in 2013, we also closed the ONE concept in Atlantic City in 2012, a kiosk in New York City and STKOUT Midtown, which featured burgers and shakes in 2013. 

&#160; 

Based on our strong momentum and brand appeal, we expect to continue to expand our operations domestically and internationally through a mix of company owned restaurants and managed units by continuing our disciplined and targeted site 

selection process and supplemented by the increasingly regular inbound inquiries we receive from office building, hotel and casino owners and landlords to develop and open new locations. We currently anticipate that our expansion plans will require capital expenditures, net of improvement allowances, of approximately $6.0 million over the next 12 months, subject to revision if we enter into new agreements. There can be no assurance that we will be able to expand our operations at the rate we currently expect or at all. 

&#160; 

STK 

&#160; 

STK is a steakhouse restaurant concept with locations in major metropolitan cities globally. STK artfully blends two concepts into one &#8212; the modern steakhouse and a chic lounge, offering a high-energy, fine dining experience in a social atmosphere with the quality of a traditional upscale steakhouse. Each STK location features a large and open restaurant and bar area with a DJ or DJ mix playing music throughout the restaurant so our customers can enjoy a high-energy, fun &#8220;destination&#8221; environment that encourages social interaction. We believe this concept truly differentiates us from other upscale steakhouses. Our menu provides a variety of portion sizes and signature options to appeal to a broad customer demographic. We currently operate seven owned and three managed STK restaurants in major metropolitan cities globally, such as Atlanta, Chicago, Las Vegas, London, Los Angeles, Miami, Milan, New York and Washington D.C. On February 10, 2014, we entered into a lease agreement with Walt Disney Parks and Resorts U.S., Inc. with respect to the opening of an STK restaurant in Orlando, Florida, which is expected to open in 2016. On August 13, 2014, we announced that we entered into an agreement to operate the F&#38;B services for a hotel in Miami, Florida that will include an STK expected to open in 2016. On November 3, 2014, we entered into a lease agreement to open an STK restaurant in Denver, Colorado in 2016. On June 5, 2015, we entered into lease agreements to open STK restaurants in Austin, Texas, and Dallas, Texas which are expected to open in 2016. On July 15, 2015, we entered into a lease agreement to open an STK restaurant in the Andaz Hotel in San Diego, California. On August 13, 2015, we entered into a management agreement to open an STK in Toronto, Canada, which is expected to open in 2016. On October 5, 2015, we entered into a lease agreement to open an STK restaurant in Edinburgh, Scotland, which is expected to open in 2017. On November 16, 2015, we entered into a license agreement for an STK in Ibiza, Spain, which is expected to open in 2017. On January 21, 2016, we entered into a lease agreement to open an STK restaurant in Boston, Massachusetts, which is expected to open in 2017. Our STK restaurants average approximately 10,000 square feet and we typically target locations that range in size from 8,000 to 10,000 square feet. In 2015, the average unit volume, check average and beverage mix for owned and managed STK restaurants in either a leased or F&#38;B location that have been open a full twelve months at December 31, 2015 were $11.0 million, $118.99 and 39%, respectively. 

F&#38;B Hospitality Services Business 

&#160; 

Our F&#38;B hospitality services business provides the development, management and operations for upscale restaurants and turn-key F&#38;B services at high-end hotels and casinos. Through our developmental and operational expertise, we are able to provide comprehensive tailored F&#38;B solutions to our hospitality clients. Our fee-based hospitality food and beverage solutions include developing, managing and operating restaurants, bars, rooftops, pools, banqueting, catering, private dining rooms, room service and mini bars on a contract basis. Currently we are operating under five F&#38;B hospitality management agreements with hotels and casinos throughout the United States and in Europe. Our F&#38;B hospitality clients include global hospitality companies such as the W Hotel, Cosmopolitan Hotel, Gansevoort Hotel Group, Hippodrome Casino and ME Hotels. The Hyatt Hotels will also be an F&#38;B hospitality client in 2016. Historically, our clients have provided the majority of the capital required for the development of the facilities we manage on their behalf. Our F&#38;B hospitality contracts generate revenues for us through base management fees, calculated as a percentage of the operation&#8217;s revenues, and additional incentive fees based on the operation&#8217;s profitability. Our management fee income has decreased from $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, to $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, due primarily to a decrease in the incentive fee income at our UK operations. Some of the operations we manage have an STK restaurant on the premises. We typically target F&#38;B hospitality opportunities where we believe we can generate $500,000 to $750,000 of pre-tax income. We expect our food and beverage hospitality services business to be an important driver of our growth and profitability going forward, enabling us to generate management fee income with minimal capital expenditures. 

Our Growth Strategies and Outlook 

&#160; 

We believe our existing restaurant concepts and F&#38;B hospitality services have significant room to grow and that our presence, brand recognition and operating performance from our continuing operations provide us with the ability to launch these concepts further into the domestic and international markets. We have established our operational infrastructure in both the United States and Europe which will allow us to pursue opportunities globally. We have also built a pipeline of potential new STK and F&#38;B hospitality projects. In the near term, we are focused on expanding our footprint in North America and 

Europe with medium to long-term expansion opportunities in Asia and the Middle East. We believe continued international expansion is a significant opportunity for us based upon the success of our ME Hotel operations, which includes STK London. 

Expansion of STK 

&#160; 

We have identified up to 50 additional major metropolitan markets globally where we could grow our STK brand over time. We expect to open as many as two to three STKs annually in the next three years, and to target approximately 25% annual unit growth thereafter, provided that we have enough capital, acceptable locations and quality restaurant managers available to support that pace of growth. We believe that the completion of the Merger enabled us to opportunistically invest more of our own capital in projects in order to capture a greater proportion of the economic returns. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to open new STKs at the rate we currently expect or that our pipeline of planned offerings will be fully realized. 

&#160; 

Expansion Through New F&#38;B Hospitality Projects 

&#160; 

We believe we are well positioned to leverage the strength of our brands and the relationships we have developed with global hospitality providers to drive the continued growth of our food and beverage hospitality projects, which traditionally have provided fee income with minimal capital expenditures. We continue to receive significant inbound inquiries regarding new services in new hospitality opportunities globally and to work with existing hospitality clients to identify and develop additional opportunities in their venues. Going forward, we expect to target one to two new food and beverage hospitality projects every 12 months. However, we cannot control the timing and number of acceptable opportunities that will be offered to us for our consideration. 

&#160; 

Increase Our Operating Efficiency 

&#160; 

In addition to expanding into new cities and hospitality venues, we intend to increase revenue and profits in our existing operations, and we believe that we have adequate capital and resources available to allocate towards operational initiatives. Notwithstanding these initiatives, we are targeting same store sales to grow by approximately 0% to 1% annually as a result of our continued focus on this aspect of our growth plan. We also expect operating margin improvements as our restaurants and services mature. However, there can be no assurances that any increases in same store sales or operating margins will be achieved. Furthermore, as our footprint continues to increase in scale, we expect to benefit by leveraging system-wide operating efficiencies and best practices. 

&#160; 

Site Selection and Development 

&#160; 

We believe that the locations of our restaurants are critical to our long-term success, and we devote significant time and resources to analyzing each prospective site. We intend to continue our focus on (i) major metropolitan areas with demographic and discretionary spending profiles that favor our high-end concepts and (ii) partners with excellent track records and brand recognition. We also consider factors such as traffic patterns, proximity to high-end shopping areas and office buildings, hotels and convention centers, area restaurant competition, accessibility and visibility. Our ability to open new restaurants depends upon, among other things, finding quality locations, reaching acceptable agreements regarding the lease of locations, raising or having available adequate capital for construction and opening costs, timely hiring, training and retaining the skilled management and other employees necessary to meet staffing needs, obtaining, for an acceptable cost, required permits and approvals and efficiently managing the amount of time and expense to build out and open each new restaurant. 

Operations and Management 

&#160; 

Our Chief Operating Officer is responsible for overseeing the operational results of all of our locations. Our locations are organized into different regions, each serviced by a Regional Director of Operations who reports directly to our Chief Operating Officer. Each location is managed by a General Manager who reports to his or her Regional Director of Operations. The General Manager of each location has primary accountability for ensuring compliance with our operating standards and for overseeing all of the location&#8217;s full and part time employees. The General Managers are assisted in the day-to-day operations of the restaurant by a Floor Manager who is directly responsible for the supervision of the bar, host, server, runner and busser personnel. The Executive Chef supervises and coordinates all back-of-the-house operations, including ensuring that our quality standards are being met and maintaining a safe, efficient and productive work environment. 

&#160; 

Sourcing and Supply Chain 

&#160; 

We seek to ensure consistent quality of the food and beverages served in our properties through the coordination and cooperation of our purchasing and culinary departments. All product specifications are established on a global basis by the Purchasing Director. These specifications are disseminated to all locations through recipe books for all dishes served in our properties. 

&#160; 

We maintain consistent company-wide quality and pricing standards and procedures for all top volume purchases in our restaurants. Suppliers are selected and pricing is negotiated on a national level. We test new suppliers on a regional basis for an extended period prior to utilizing them on a national basis. We periodically review supplier consistency and satisfaction with our location chefs and continually research and evaluate products and supplies to ensure the meat, seafood and other menu ingredients that we purchase comply with our quality specifications. We have also utilized purchasing software in some of our locations that facilitates a true bidding process on a line by line basis of all local purchases that are made. In markets where we have not instituted this software, we are requiring local chefs to seek bids from multiple suppliers on all purchases to ensure competitive pricing. We believe we have strong relationships with national and regional foodservice distributors who can continue to supply us with our products on a consistent basis. Products are shipped directly to the restaurants from our suppliers. 

&#160; 

Our Corporate Beverage program creates significant guidelines for products carried in all properties. Beverage managers at each location are provided with national guidelines for standardized products. We utilize a third party company to conduct weekly beverage inventory and cost reviews to maximize our profitability at each location. 

&#160; 

On a company-wide basis, no supplier of food accounts for more than 30% of our total food and beverage purchases and no brand of alcohol accounts for more than 25% of such purchases. We believe that our food and beverage supplies are available from a significant number of alternate suppliers and that the loss of any one or a few suppliers would not have a material adverse effect on our costs of supplies. 

&#160; 

Advertising and Marketing 

&#160; 

The goals of our marketing efforts are to strengthen brand recognition in current operating markets and to create brand awareness in new markets prior to opening a new location in such market. We use digital media channels, targeted local media such as magazines, billboards and other out of home advertising, and a strong internal public relations team to increase the frequency with which our existing customers visit our facilities and to attract new customers. We conduct frequent promotional programs tailored to the city, brand and clientele of each location. The primary focus of our marketing is to increase awareness of our brand and our overall reputation for quality, service and delivering a high-energy experience. For example, our &#8220;Not Your Daddy&#8217;s Steakhouse&#8221; branding campaign for STK is integrated into marketing communications including digital, radio, print and outdoor advertisement. Additional marketing functions include the use of our website, www.togrp.com, to facilitate online reservations and gift card sales to drive revenue. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Due to the nature of our business, we experience competition from a variety of sources such as upscale steakhouse chains such as Del Frisco&#8217;s, Mastro&#8217;s, Fleming&#8217;s Prime Steakhouse and Wine Bar and The Capital Grille, as well as local upscale steakhouses. Further, there is also competition from non-steak but upscale and high-energy restaurants such as Nobu and Lavo as well as other high-end hospitality services companies such as the Gerber Group or Esquared Hospitality. In addition, to the extent that we operate lounges and similar venues in hotels and resorts we are subject to our host venues being able to compete effectively in attracting customers who would frequent our establishments. 

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

Our business also is subject to fluctuations due to season and adverse weather. Our results of operations have historically been impacted by seasonality. Our second and fourth quarters have traditionally had higher sales volume than other periods of the year. Severe weather may impact restaurant unit volumes in some of the markets where we operate and may have a greater impact should they occur during our higher volume months, especially the second and fourth quarters. For example, the adverse weather conditions in New York City in early 2015 negatively impacted our revenues during that period and as a result of these and other factors, our financial results for any given quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We depend on registered trademarks and service marks to maintain the identity of our locations. We currently own trademark applications or registrations for the following marks in the areas in which we operate in the applicable locations: 

&#160; 

STK 

CUCINA ASELLINA 

ASELLINA 

&#160; 

The unauthorized use or other misappropriation of our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue our business. See &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we employed 69 persons in our corporate office and an aggregate of 141 full-time salaried employees at our locations. In addition, we rely on hourly-wage employees for kitchen staff, servers, bussers, runners, polishers, hosts, bartenders, barbacks, reservationists, administrative support, and interns. Average head count for employees in our restaurants is 88. Combining full-time and part-time employees, we employ and manage over 1,600 persons worldwide. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

Our operations are subject to licensing and regulation by state and local health, safety, fire and other authorities, including licensing and regulation requirements for the sale of alcoholic beverages and food. We maintain the necessary restaurant, alcoholic beverage and retail licenses, permits and approvals. The development and construction of additional restaurants are also subject to compliance with applicable zoning, land use and environmental regulations. Federal and state labor laws govern our relationship with our employees and affect operating costs. These laws regulate, among other things, minimum wage, overtime, tips, tip credits, unemployment tax rates, workers&#8217; compensation rates, health insurance, citizenship requirements and other working conditions. Our restaurants are subject in each state in which we operate to &#8220;dram shop&#8221; laws, which allow, in general, a person to sue us if that person was injured by an intoxicated person who was wrongfully served alcoholic beverages at one of our restaurants. A judgment against us under a dram shop law could exceed our liability insurance coverage policy limits and could result in substantial liability for us and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our inability to continue to obtain such insurance coverage at reasonable costs also could have a material adverse effect on us. We are also subject to the Federal Americans with Disabilities Act, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations and employment. For more information on the impact of government regulations on our business, see &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors.&#8221;
