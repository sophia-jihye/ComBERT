Business. 

Unless otherwise indicated, we use &#8220;Opexa,&#8221; &#8220;the Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; and &#8220;us&#8221; to refer to the businesses of Opexa Therapeutics, Inc. 

Opexa is a biopharmaceutical company developing a personalized immunotherapy with the potential to treat major illnesses, including multiple sclerosis (MS) as well as other autoimmune diseases such as neuromyelitis optica (NMO). These therapies are based on our proprietary T-cell technology. Our mission is to lead the field of Precision Immunotherapy&#174; by aligning the interests of patients, employees and shareholders. Information related to our product candidates, Tcelna&#174; and OPX-212, is preliminary and investigative. Tcelna and OPX-212 have not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or other global regulatory agencies for marketing. 

MS is an inflammatory autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS), which is made up of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves, with a clinically heterogeneous and unpredictable course that persists for decades. MS attacks the covering surrounding nerve cells, or myelin sheaths, leading to loss of myelin (demyelination) and nerve damage. In addition to demyelination, the neuropathology of MS is characterized by variable loss of oligodendroglial cells and axonal degeneration and manifests in neurological deficits. Symptoms may be mild, such as numbness in the limbs, or severe, such as paralysis or loss of vision. This inflammatory, demyelinating, autoimmune disease has varied clinical presentations, ranging from relapses and remissions (relapsing remitting MS, or RRMS) to slow accumulation of disability with or without relapses (secondary progressive MS, or SPMS). There are approximately 450,000 MS patients in North America and over 2,000,000 patients worldwide according to estimates from The National MS Society. The portion of the MS patient population that can be classified as SPMS is estimated by various industry sources to be between 30-45% of the total MS patient population. 

We believe that our lead product candidate, Tcelna, has the potential to fundamentally address the root cause of MS by stopping the demyelination process and supporting the generation of new myelin sheaths where demyelination has occurred (remyelination). Tcelna is an autologous T-cell immunotherapy that is currently being developed for the treatment of SPMS and is specifically tailored to each patient&#8217;s immune response profile to myelin. Tcelna is designed to reduce the number and/or functional activity of specific subsets of myelin-reactive T-cells (MRTCs) known to attack myelin. This technology was originally licensed from Baylor College of Medicine in 2001. 

Tcelna is manufactured using our proprietary method for the production of an autologous T-cell product, which comprises the collection of blood from the MS patient and the expansion of MRTCs from the blood. Upon completion of the manufacturing process, an annual course of therapy consisting of five doses is cryopreserved. At each dosing time point, a single dose of Tcelna is formulated and attenuated by irradiation before returning the final product to the clinical site for subcutaneous administration to the patient. 

Tcelna has received Fast Track designation from the FDA in SPMS, and we believe it is positioned as a potential first-to-market personalized T-cell therapy for MS patients. The FDA&#8217;s Fast Track program is designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drug candidates intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. 

In addition to our ongoing clinical development of Tcelna, we are also in preclinical development of OPX-212 as an autologous T-cell immunotherapy for the treatment of NMO. NMO is an autoimmune disorder in which immune system cells and antibodies attack and destroy astrocytic/myelin cells in the optic nerves and the spinal cord leading to demyelination and loss of axons. There are currently no FDA-approved therapies for NMO, other than to treat an attack while it is happening, to reduce symptoms and to prevent relapses. OPX-212 is specifically tailored to each patient&#8217;s immune response to a protein, aquaporin-4, which is the targeted antigen in NMO. In NMO, the immune system recognizes aquaporin-4 as foreign, thus triggering the attack. We believe a mechanism of action of OPX-212 may be to reduce the number and/or regulate aquaporin-4 reactive T-cells (ARTC), thereby reducing the frequency of clinical relapses and subsequent progression in disability. See &#8220;&#8212;NMO &#8211; OPX-212&#8221; below for more information on our development plans for OPX-212 in NMO. 

Opexa was incorporated in Texas in March 1991. Our principal executive offices are located at 2635 Technology Forest Blvd., The Woodlands, Texas 77381, and our telephone number is (281) 775-0600.

&#160; 

Multiple Sclerosis&#8212;Background 

MS is a disease that is more common in females than males (2:1) between the ages of 20 and 40, with a peak onset of approximately 25 years of age. MS frequently causes impairment of motor, sensory, coordination and balance, visual, and/or cognitive functions, as well as urinary (bladder) or bowel dysfunction and symptoms of fatigue. The identified autoimmune mechanisms directed at myelin tissue of the CNS may play an important role in the pathogenesis of MS. Epidemiologic studies suggest that a variety of genetic, immunologic, and environmental factors including viral infections may play a role in defining the etiology and in triggering the onset and progression of MS. 

At the onset of MS, approximately 85% of MS patients have RRMS. Without disease-modifying medication, one-half of these RRMS patients will develop steadily progressive disease, SPMS, within 10 years, increasing to 90% within 25 years of MS diagnosis. The MS drug market was forecasted to reach as much as $16 billion in 2015. 

MS remains a challenging autoimmune disease to treat because the pathophysiologic mechanisms are diverse, and the chronic, unpredictable course of the disease makes it difficult to determine whether the favorable effects of short-term treatment will be sustained. Therapies that are easy to use and can safely prevent or stop the progression of disease represent the greatest unmet need in MS. 

In recent years, the understanding of MS pathogenesis has evolved to comprise an initial, T-cell-mediated inflammatory activity followed by selective demyelination (erosion of the myelin coating of the nerve fibers) and then neurodegeneration. The discovery of disease-relevant immune responses has accelerated the development of targeted therapeutic products for the treatment of the early stages of MS. Some subjects, who have the appropriate genetic background, have increased susceptibility for the in vivo activation and expansion of MRTCs. These MRTCs may remain dormant, but at some point they are activated in the periphery, thus enabling them to cross the blood-brain barrier and infiltrate the healthy tissue of the brain and spinal cord. The cascade of pathogenic events leads to demyelination of protrusions from nerve cells called axons, which causes nerve impulse transmissions to diffuse into the tissue resulting in disability to the individual. 

Tcelna for MS 

We believe that Tcelna works selectively on the MRTCs by harnessing the body&#8217;s natural immune defense system and feedback mechanisms to deplete these T-cells and induce favorable immune regulatory responses by rebalancing the immune system. Tcelna is a personalized immunotherapy that is specifically tailored to each patient&#8217;s disease profile. Tcelna is manufactured by using ImmPath&#174;, our proprietary method for the production of a patient-specific T-cell immunotherapy which encompasses the collection of blood from the MS patient, isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, generation of an autologous pool of MRTCs raised against selected peptides from myelin basic protein (MBP), myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) and proteolipid protein (PLP), expanding these MRTCs to a therapeutic dose ex-vivo, and attenuating them with gamma irradiation to prevent DNA replication and thereby cellular proliferation. These attenuated MRTCs are then injected subcutaneously into the body in therapeutic dosages. The body recognizes specific T-cell receptor molecules of these MRTCs as immunogenic and initiates an immune response reaction against them, resulting in the depletion and/or immunosuppression of circulating MRTCs carrying the peptide-specific T-cell receptor molecules. In addition, we believe that T-cell activation molecules on the surface of the activated MRTCs promote anti-inflammatory responses. We believe that because the therapy uses an individual&#8217;s own cells, the only direct identifiable side effect observed thus far is injection site reactions which typically are minor and generally clear within 24 hours. 

Tcelna Clinical Development Program 

Tcelna is a novel T-cell immunotherapy in Phase IIb clinical development for the treatment of patients with SPMS. It is also positioned to enter Phase III clinical development for the treatment of patients with RRMS, subject to the availability of sufficient resources or a strategic partnering commitment. 

The Tcelna clinical development program spans studies conducted by Baylor College of Medicine and by Opexa. 

Summary of Phase I Dose Escalation Study in MS 

A Phase 1 dose escalation study completed in 2006 was conducted in patients with both RRMS and SPMS who were intolerant or unresponsive to current approved therapies for MS. The open-label, dose escalation study evaluated safety and clinical benefit by administering a primary series of four treatments at one of three dose levels administered at baseline and weeks 4, 8 and 12. Results of the efficacy analyses provide some evidence of the effectiveness of Tcelna in the treatment of MS. Data from the Phase I study evaluating the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) showed improvements in some subjects in comparison to baseline for weeks 20 and 28. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Subjects showed statistically significant improvement in overall reduction of MRTC counts over baseline at all visits through week 52 for subjects receiving 30-45 million cells per dose, as assessed by total MRTC count percentage changes. These data indicate that Tcelna treatment causes a depletion or immunomodulation of these cells, most obvious at time points closer to the injections. These findings were published in Clinical Immunology (2009) 131, 202-215. 

Overall, results of the safety analyses indicate that treatment with Tcelna is well-tolerated. Reported adverse events were mostly mild or moderate in intensity. Mild injection site reactions were observed but all resolved rapidly without treatment. In conclusion, data from this study suggest that Tcelna is safe for the treatment of MS. 

Summary of Phase I/IIA Clinical Trial Data in MS 

The second clinical study performed by Opexa was an open-label extension study completed in 2007 to treat patients who were previously treated with T-cell immunotherapy but who saw a rebound in MRTC activity. The purpose of this extension study was to continue evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of Tcelna in patients with RRMS and SPMS with repeated administration of Tcelna. Results of the study provide evidence of the effectiveness of Tcelna in the treatment of MS with repeated dosing. Improvements from baseline at both week 28 and week 52 of the extension study were observed for the frequency of MS exacerbations, or annualized relapse rate (ARR). Evaluation of the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29) component scores suggests a trend for Tcelna therapy in the improvement of physical and psychological parameters assessed by the MSIS-29. The EDSS score analysis revealed an upward trend for the percentage of subjects that reported improvement and sustained improvement over baseline as a result of Tcelna treatment. 

Subjects showed statistically significant reduction over baseline in the MRTC counts for each time point through month nine of the extension study. Overall, results of the safety analyses indicate that repeated treatment with Tcelna is well-tolerated. Reported adverse events (AEs) were mostly mild or moderate in intensity. Mild injection site reactions were observed but all resolved rapidly without treatment. Furthermore, results from this study suggest that repeated dosing of Tcelna has a substantive effect in reduction of ARR in subjects with MS and was well-tolerated. 

Summary of TERMS Phase IIb Clinical Trial Data in RRMS 

Tovaxin for Early Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis (TERMS) was a Phase IIb clinical study of Tcelna in RRMS patients completed in 2008. Although the study did not show statistical significance in its primary endpoint (the cumulative number of gadolinium-enhanced brain lesions using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans summed at various points in the study), the study showed compelling evidence of efficacy in various clinical and other MRI endpoints. 

The TERMS study was a multi-center, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial in 150 patients with RRMS or high risk Clinically Isolated Syndrome. The inclusion criteria for TERMS was an EDSS score of 0 to 5.5. Patients received a total of five subcutaneous injections at weeks 0, 4, 8, 12 and 24. Key results from the TERMS trial included: 

&#9679; 

In the modified intent to treat patient population consisting of all patients who received at least one dose of study product and had at least one MRI scan at week 28 or later (n=142), the ARR for Tcelna-treated patients was 0.214 as compared to 0.339 for placebo-treated patients, which represented a 37% decrease in ARR for Tcelna as compared to placebo in the general population; 

&#9679; 

In a prospective group of patients with more active disease (ARR&#62;1, n=50), Tcelna demonstrated a 55% reduction in ARR as compared to placebo, an 88% reduction in whole brain atrophy and a statistically significant improvement in disability (EDSS) compared to placebo (p&#60;0.045) at week 52 during the 24-week period following the administration of the full course of treatment; and 

&#9679; 

In a retrospective analysis in patients na&#239;ve to previous disease modifying treatment, the results showed that patients, when treated with Tcelna, had a 56% to 73% reduction in ARR versus placebo for the various subsets and p values ranged from 0.009 to 0.06. 

We remain committed to further advancing Tcelna in RRMS at a later date assuming the availability of sufficient resources or a strategic partnering commitment. For Opexa, however, SPMS is an area which we believe represents a higher unmet medical need. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

SPMS Overview and Tcelna Mechanism of Action 

SPMS is characterized by a steady accrual of irreversible disability, despite, in some cases, relapses followed by remissions or clinical plateaus. Older age at onset of MS diagnosis is the strongest predictor of conversion to SPMS. Males have a shorter time to conversion to SPMS compared with females. Available immunomodulating and immunosuppressive therapies used for RRMS have not been effective in SPMS. In clinical trials, these therapies have demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties as measured by the reduction in number and volume of contrast-enhancing or acutely inflammatory CNS lesions most commonly seen in patients with RRMS. The typical SPMS patient, however, has little or no radiographic evidence of acute inflammation. It is commonly observed that contrast-enhancing CNS lesions are uncommon among these patients, despite a clearly deteriorating neurologic course. 

The lack of effect of conventional MS therapeutics in SPMS suggests that the cerebral deterioration characterizing progressive disease may be driven by factors other than acute inflammation. For instance, the immunopathology of SPMS is more consistent with a transition to a chronic T-cell dependent inflammatory type, which may encompass the innate immune response and persistent activation of microglia cells. Meningeal follicles close to cortical gray matter lesions suggests that adaptive immune responses involving antibody and complement contribute to progression in SPMS. Furthermore, chronic MRTCs may be contributing to the development of both innate and adaptive immune responses persisting in the CNS. 

Radiographic features that stand out among patients with SPMS include significantly more atrophy of gray matter compared with RRMS patients. Of note, long-term disability in MS in general appears more closely correlated to gray matter atrophy than to white matter inflammation. Such atrophy may be suggestive of progressive clinical disability. Both clinically and radiographically, SPMS represents a disease process with certain features distinct from those of RRMS, and one with extremely limited treatment options. 

Tcelna immunotherapy in SPMS may reduce the drivers of this chronic disease by down-regulating anti-myelin immunity through priming regulatory responses that may act in the periphery as well as within the CNS. We believe that our clinical results show therapeutic subcutaneous dosing of 30-45 million cells of Tcelna stimulates host reactivity to the over-represented MRTCs and, as a consequence, a dominant negative regulatory T-cell response is induced leading to down-regulation of similar endogenous disease-causing MRTCs. 

We believe that Tcelna has the potential to induce an up-regulation of regulatory cells, such as Foxp3+ Treg cells and IL-10 secreting Tr1 cells, which may effect a reduction in inflammation and provide neuroprotection should they gain entry to the CNS. Data from our TERMS study showed statistically significant changes from baseline (p=0.02) in Foxp3+ Treg cells for the subset of Tcelna patients who had ARR &#62;1. The placebo arm for this subset was not statistically different from its baseline levels. Three SPMS patients from prior clinical studies, whose blood samples were analyzed to measure Tr1 cells prior to treatment and post treatment, showed an increase in the levels of Tr1 cells from non-detectable levels to the range of healthy donor samples. These three patients who had relapses in the preceding 12-24 month period remained relapse free during the 52-week assessment period and also showed a 57% to 67% reduction in MRTCs. 

Current Treatment Options for SPMS 

Only one product, mitoxantrone, is currently approved for the indication of SPMS in the U.S. However, since 2005, this drug carries a black box warning, due to significant risks of decreased systolic function, heart failure, and leukemia. The American Academy of Neurology has issued a report indicating that these risks are even higher than suggested in the original report leading to the black box warning. Hence, a safe and effective treatment for SPMS remains a significant unmet medical need. 

Tcelna Clinical Overview in SPMS 

In multiple previously conducted clinical trials for the treatment of patients with MS (which have been weighted significantly toward patients with RRMS), Tcelna has demonstrated one of the safest side effect profiles for any marketed or development-stage MS therapy, as well as encouraging efficacy signals. A total of 144 MS patients have received Tcelna in previously conducted Opexa trials for RRMS and SPMS. The therapy has been well-tolerated in all subjects and has demonstrated an excellent overall safety profile. The most common side effect is mild to moderate irritation at the site of injection, which is typically resolved in 24 hours. Tcelna has been administered to a total of 36 subjects with SPMS across three previous clinical studies. 

In a pooled assessment of data from 36 SPMS patients treated in Phase I open label studies at the Baylor College of Medicine completed in 1998 and in Opexa-sponsored studies completed in 2006 and 2007, approximately 80% of the 35 SPMS patients who completed two years of treatment showed disease stabilization as measured by EDSS following two years of treatment with Tcelna, with the other 20% showing signs of progression. This compares to historical control data which showed a progression rate of 40% in SPMS patients (as reported in ESIMS Study published in Hommes Lancet 2004). The 10 SPMS patients in Opexa sponsored studies showed a substantial reduction in ARR at two years from 0.5 to an ARR less than 0.1. Only 1 out of the 10 patients experienced one episode of relapse during the two years of assessment. This same cohort showed no worsening of physical or psychological condition (key quality of life indicators as measured by the MS Impact Scale) after two years of treatment with Tcelna. Additionally, there were no reported serious adverse events (SAEs) in any of the patients. Based on preliminary data suggesting stabilized or improved disability among SPMS subjects receiving Tcelna, we believe that further development of this product candidate in SPMS is warranted. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Abili-T Trial: Phase IIb Clinical Study in Patients with SPMS 

In September 2012, we announced the initiation of a Phase IIb clinical trial of Tcelna in patients with SPMS. The trial is entitled: A Phase II Double-Blind, Placebo Controlled Multi-Center Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Tcelna in Subjects with Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis and has been named the &#8220;Abili-T&#8221; trial. The Abili-T trial is a double-blind, 1:1 randomized, placebo-controlled study in SPMS patients who demonstrate evidence of disease progression with or without associated relapses. The trial is being conducted at approximately 35 leading clinical sites in the U.S. and Canada and has enrolled patients who have Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores between 3.0 and 6.0. According to the study protocol, patients are receiving two annual courses of Tcelna treatment consisting of five subcutaneous injections per year at weeks 0, 4, 8, 12 and 24. We reached our enrollment target for the Abili-T trial in June 2014, and a total of 190 patients have been enrolled in this two-year study. 

The primary efficacy endpoint of the trial is the percentage of brain volume change (whole brain atrophy) at 24 months. Study investigators will also measure several important secondary outcomes commonly associated with MS including sustained disease progression as measured by EDSS, changes in EDSS, time to sustained progression, ARR, change in Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) assessment of disability and change in Symbol Digit Modality Test. Data on certain exploratory endpoints such as quality of life metrics as measured by the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life Inventory (MSQLI), MRI measures and immune monitoring metrics are also being collected. 

As part of the Abili-T trial, we are undertaking a comprehensive immune monitoring program for all patients enrolled in the study. The goals of this program are to further understand the biology behind the mechanism of action for Tcelna and to possibly identify novel biomarkers that are dominant in the pathophysiology of SPMS patients. The program encompasses an analysis of various pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory biomarkers and biomarker data is being gathered during the course of the trial on a blinded basis. We believe that directional movement of certain biomarkers, when corroborated with final clinical trial data, may be indicative of responders and disease stabilization or progression. 

A scheduled Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) meeting took place during the week of February 22, 2016, and a recommendation was made to continue the study. The DSMB also stated that because dosing has been completed and no concerns over safety had been noted to date, no further DSMB meetings would be required for the Abili-T study. 

The final dose for the last patient enrolled in the Abili-T study was completed during the week of February 22, 2016. We expect top-line data for the Abili-T trial to be available early in the fourth quarter of 2016. 

Option and License Agreement with Merck Serono 

On February 4, 2013, we entered into an Option and License Agreement with Ares Trading SA (&#8220;Merck Serono&#8221;), a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck Serono S.A. Pursuant to the agreement, Merck Serono has an option (the &#8220;Option&#8221;) to acquire an exclusive, worldwide (excluding Japan) license of our Tcelna program for the treatment of MS. The Option may be exercised by Merck Serono prior to or upon completion of our ongoing Abili-T trial of Tcelna in patients with SPMS. Under the terms of the agreement, we received an upfront payment of $5 million for granting the Option. If the Option is exercised, Merck Serono would pay us an upfront license fee of $25 million unless Merck Serono is unable to advance directly into a Phase III clinical trial of Tcelna for SPMS without a further Phase II clinical trial (as determined by Merck Serono), in which event the upfront license fee would be $15 million. After exercising the Option, Merck Serono would be solely responsible for funding development, regulatory and commercialization activities for Tcelna in MS, although we would retain an option to co-fund certain development in exchange for increased royalty rates. We would also retain rights to Tcelna in Japan, certain rights with respect to the manufacture of Tcelna, and rights to use for other indications outside of MS. 

Based upon the achievement of development milestones by Merck Serono for Tcelna in SPMS, we would be eligible to receive one-time milestone payments totaling up to $70 million as follows: (i) milestone payments aggregating $35 million if Tcelna is submitted for regulatory approval and commercialized in the United States; (ii) milestone payments aggregating $30 million if Tcelna is submitted for regulatory approval in Europe and commercialized in at least three major countries in Europe; and (iii) a milestone payment of $5 million if Tcelna is commercialized in certain markets outside of the United States and Europe. If Merck Serono elects to develop and commercialize Tcelna in RRMS, we would be eligible to receive milestone payments aggregating up to $40 million based upon the achievement by Merck Serono of various development, regulatory and first commercial sale milestones. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

If Tcelna receives regulatory approval and is commercialized by Merck Serono, we would be eligible to receive royalties pursuant to a tiered structure at rates ranging from 8% to 15% of annual net sales, with step-ups over such range occurring when annual net sales exceed $500 million, $1 billion and $2 billion. Any royalties would be subject to offset or reduction in various situations, including if third party rights are required or if patent protection is not available in an applicable jurisdiction. We would also be responsible for royalty obligations to certain third parties, such as Baylor College of Medicine from which we originally licensed related technology. If we were to exercise an option to co-fund certain of Merck Serono&#8217;s development, the royalty rates payable by Merck Serono would be increased to rates ranging from 10% to 18%. In addition to royalty payments, we would be eligible to receive one-time commercial milestones totaling up to $85 million, with $55 million of such milestones achievable at annual net sales targets in excess of $1 billion. 

On March 9, 2015, we entered into a First Amendment of Option and License Agreement with Merck Serono to amend the Merck Serono Agreement (the &#8220;Merck Serono Amendment&#8221;). We received a payment of $3 million in consideration for the following: 

&#9679; 

Creating a detailed plan for potential Phase III development of Tcelna (the &#8220;Pre-Phase III Plan&#8221;), including documenting all of the activities necessary for laboratory facilities both in the U.S. and Europe to reach operational readiness by the end of December 2016. The Joint Steering Committee (&#8220;JSC&#8221;) established pursuant to the Merck Serono Agreement will be responsible for reviewing, approving and ultimately overseeing our completion of the Pre-Phase III Plan. In the event the JSC has not approved the Pre-Phase III Plan prior to the end of the period in the Merck Serono Agreement within which Merck Serono may exercise its option, such period will be extended for 60 days following approval of the Pre-Phase III Plan by the JSC. 

&#9679; 

Providing Merck Serono with updates and analysis on a blinded basis, grouped in patient batches according to our analysis timetable, on the progress of our immune monitoring program being conducted in conjunction with our ongoing Abili-T clinical trial. 

&#160;

Tcelna Manufacturing 

&#160;

We manufacture Tcelna in our own current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) facility. Tcelna is a personalized autologous immunotherapy that is not only manufactured for every individual subject but also is tailored to match each subject&#8217;s evolving disease profile as defined by T-cell profiling against myelin antigens. In preparing Tcelna, the subject is pre-screened with our proprietary Epitope Profiling Assay (EPA) for immunodominant anti-myelin T-cell responses against specific peptides by assaying peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) reactivity against 109 peptides tested in pools of six derived from MBP, MOG and PLP. The EPA takes approximately 14 days to conduct and report data. The MRTC lines to each pool are expanded to therapeutic levels, mixed and cryopreserved until time for final formulation. The manufacturing and quality control process spans approximately 35 days. Prior to injection, the MRTCs are thawed, formulated and attenuated (by irradiation) to render them unable to replicate but viable for therapy. These attenuated T-cells are administered in a defined schedule of five subcutaneous injections. Patients are treated with a new, personalized treatment series (five subcutaneous injections) each year based on their altered disease profile, or epitope shift, and the re-manufacture of a new Tcelna product representing the emerging immunodominant T-cell response to myelin. 

&#160;

If Merck exercises its Option to acquire an exclusive, worldwide license for our Tcelna program for the treatment of MS, we retain certain rights with respect to the manufacture of Tcelna. 

&#160;

Personalized Therapy 

&#160;

The clinical symptoms of MS are the result of an immune attack against the myelin sheaths that insulate nerves in the brain and spinal cord that constitute the CNS. A subset of white cells, called T-cells, is the primary orchestrator of this immunity. Tcelna is an immunotherapy representing an enriched source of the patient&#8217;s own MRTCs that are used to invoke a protective response to limit further damage to the myelin sheaths within the patient&#8217;s CNS. Immunity to myelin in terms of the specificity of T-cells for myelin proteins varies between individuals. Therefore, Tcelna is further personalized by screening the immune response, and detecting those proteins that are preferentially targeted by T-cells on a per patient basis. This is achieved using protein fragments, called peptides, from the three major myelin proteins (MOG, MBP and PLP) as targets to finely map immunity to myelin. A limited number of peptides are chosen to which immunity appears greatest, and the Tcelna product is manufactured against these peptides. Thus, Tcelna is not only manufactured for each patient, but it is also tailored against each patient&#8217;s personalized T-cell immune response to myelin. In preparing Tcelna for a patient, the patient-specific MRTCs are expanded from a unit of whole blood using the selected myelin peptides in the presence of growth factors. 

&#160;

Tcelna Safety and Tolerability 

We believe that Tcelna treatment selectively targets and depletes and/or down-regulates the pathogenic T-cell population. It is not a general immune suppressant and, accordingly, it is not associated with the serious side effects seen by those MS treatments that function by systemically suppressing the immune system. In previously conducted clinical trials, there have been no SAEs associated with Tcelna treatment. We believe that this favorable safety profile may be an important advantage as patient compliance represents a significant challenge due to serious side effects associated with various MS treatments currently available and in development. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

NMO &#8211; OPX-212 

In addition to our ongoing clinical development of Tcelna, we are also developing OPX-212 as an autologous T-cell immunotherapy for the treatment of NMO. This program is currently in the preclinical development stage. NMO is an autoimmune disorder in which immune system cells and antibodies attack astrocytes leading to the secondary destruction of nerve cells (axons) in the optic nerves and the spinal cord. OPX-212 is specifically tailored to each patient&#8217;s immune response to a protein, aquaporin-4 expressed by astrocytes, which is the targeted antigen in NMO. In NMO, the immune system recognizes aquaporin-4 as foreign, thus triggering the attack. We believe a mechanism of action of OPX-212 may be to reduce the number and/or regulate aquaporin-4 reactive T-cells (ARTC), thereby reducing the frequency of clinical relapses and subsequent progression in disability. 

Patients with NMO present with acute, often severe, attacks of blindness in one or both eyes followed within days or weeks by varying degrees of paralysis in the arms and legs. Most patients have relapsing attacks (separated by months or years with partial recovery), with usually sequential index episodes of optic neuritis (ON) and myelitis. A relapsing course is more frequent in women, and nearly 90% of patients are female (typically late middle-aged). It is estimated that there are approximately 4,800 cases of NMO in the U.S. NMO has a worldwide estimated prevalence of 1-2 people per 100,000 population. 

There are currently no FDA-approved therapies for NMO. An initial attack is usually treated with a combination of corticosteroids and/or by plasma exchange to limit the severity of the attack. Although not approved for NMO, some physicians may utilize an immunosuppressant such as Rituximab as long-term therapy to provide protection from increasing neurological impairments through relapse. 

We expect to manufacture OPX-212 using ImmPath, our proprietary method for the production of an autologous T-cell product, which comprises the collection of a blood product from the NMO patient and the expansion of ARTC from the blood product. Upon completion of the manufacturing process, ARTC are cryopreserved in dose-equivalents until required for use. On demand, a dose-equivalent is thawed, formulated and attenuated by irradiation before being returned to the patient for subcutaneous injection, with the express purpose of inducing a regulatory immune response to reduce the frequency and/or function of pathogenic ARTC. 

We initiated development activities for OPX-212, our drug development candidate for NMO, in 2014 and have achieved a number of regulatory and early development milestones to date, which include conducting a pre-Investigational New Drug application (pre-IND) meeting with the U.S. FDA. We are continuing with preclinical development and IND enabling activities. Assuming it advances to clinical development, we believe OPX-212 for NMO will qualify for Orphan drug designation, and we also expect to apply for Fast Track designation. 

In November 2015, we announced that we had completed an animal study as part of our preclinical development activities to support OPX-212 in NMO. The results of this study show that T-cell immunotherapy with attenuated antigen-specific T-cells suppress the T-cell response to Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) in a dose-dependent manner, compared to vehicle control, as measured by reduction in both aquaporin-4 reactive T-cell (ARTC) proliferation and associated cytokine activity. The results were statistically significant. 

As part of our preclinical development activities for OPX-212, we conducted a bioactivity study to demonstrate the ability of T-cell immunotherapy using attenuated T-cells to suppress a T-cell response to the NMO-associated autoantigen, AQP4. No animal model of NMO has been described that exhibits both endogenous T-cell dependent immunity and autoantibody production to AQP4 and that subsequently leads to the immunopathology and clinical symptoms observed in human NMO. To study the bio-activity of attenuated T-cells on AQP4 T-cell immunity, mice were pre-treated with attenuated antigen-specific T-cells and subsequently primed with AQP4 antigen. 

In NMO, activated T-cells (ARTC) mount an attack against Aquaporin-4, the autoantigen in NMO, leading to secondary demyelination of nerve fibers within the optic nerves and the spinal cord, resulting in the clinical symptoms of the disease. Our therapeutic approach is to suppress or reduce the number of these activated ARTC in patients with NMO. The results of the preclinical animal study provide evidence that T-cell immunotherapy reduces the level of activated ARTC in a murine (mouse) model. 

Although we have previously indicated that an IND submission to the FDA and/or a CTA submission to Health Canada followed by commencement of a phase 1/2 proof of concept study of OPX-212 in NMO (assuming acceptance of such IND and/or CTA) may occur in the first half of 2016 assuming the availability of sufficient resources, we are currently uncertain with respect to both the pace of our ongoing preclinical development and manufacturing activities for OPX-212 in NMO as well as the potential outcome of such activities. OPX-212 in NMO remains an active preclinical program for Opexa, and we continue to believe that progress in this program is reasonably possible. However, we have been confronted with challenges in the development of OPX-212 in NMO, including with respect to the manufacture of OPX-212. For example, it has taken us longer than we expected to manufacture certain of the peptides associated with NMO due to their hydrophobic nature. We currently do not expect to provide further guidance in the foreseeable future on any timetable with respect to our development of OPX-212 in NMO, but instead to report substantive milestones only when and if they occur. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

On September 1, 2015, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with certain purchasers party thereto to fund our NMO program, pursuant to which we sold in tranche one of a private placement 113,636 shares of common stock for a per share purchase price of $4.40 and issued Series N warrants to purchase a like number of shares, for a total purchase price of $499,999. We also agreed to sell and the purchasers agreed to purchase an additional aggregate of $4.5 million of common stock in four additional tranches upon our achievement of certain milestones to further the clinical development of OPX-212. On March 14, 2016, we entered into an amendment to the Stock Purchase Agreement to extend the timeframes for achieving the milestones relating to the subsequent tranches. As part of the amendment, the expiration date of the Series N warrants issued to the purchasers as part of the Stock Purchase Agreement was extended from April 9, 2018 to October 9, 2018. As amended, subsequent tranches are based on the completion of the ongoing preclinical development and manufacturing activities and subsequent submission of an IND for OPX-212 in NMO no later than August 15, 2016; the review and acceptance of the IND by the FDA no later than November 15, 2016; enrollment of the first patient in a potential Phase 1/2 proof-of-concept study no later than February 28, 2017; and enrollment of 30% of the patients in such Phase 1/2 study no later than June 30, 2017. Each subsequent tranche will include the sale of common stock only (i.e., no additional warrants will be issued), with such shares priced at 90% of the 10-day volume weighted average price of Opexa&#8217;s common stock immediately preceding the occurrence of the related milestone. 

Other Opportunities 

Our proprietary T-cell technology has enabled us to develop intellectual property and a comprehensive sample database that may enable discovery of novel biomarkers associated with MS. Depending upon the outcome of further feasibility analysis, the T-cell platform may have applications in developing treatments for other autoimmune disorders. While the primary focus of Opexa remains the development of Tcelna in SPMS, as well as our development plans for OPX-212 in NMO, we continue to investigate the expansion of the T-cell platform into other autoimmune diseases as well as potential in-licensing of other novel technologies. 

Licenses, Patents and Proprietary Rights 

We believe that proprietary protection of our technologies is critical to the development of our business. We will continue to protect our intellectual property through patents and other appropriate means. We rely upon trade-secret protection for certain confidential and proprietary information and take active measures to control access to that information. We currently have non-disclosure agreements with all of our employees, consultants, vendors, advisory board members and contract research organizations. 

The initial T-cell technology on which Tcelna is based was originally discovered by researchers at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas. Baylor granted Opexa an exclusive, worldwide right and license to commercially exploit such technology, which includes rights to patents held by Baylor. Opexa has since expanded the development of technology related to Tcelna and T-cell technology. Currently, Opexa holds or has been licensed approximately 160 issued patents (inclusive of United States and international jurisdictions), including patents held by Opexa with respect to the specificity and veracity of antigens that have been discovered. Opexa also possesses substantial proprietary know-how surrounding the Tcelna development and manufacturing processes that is maintained as a trade secret. Consequently, we consider barriers to entry, relative to Tcelna for the treatment of MS, to be high. 

Our patent portfolio tracks our scientific development programs in autoimmune disease treatments, with an initial focus on MS. We believe that our scientific platform is adaptable in that any T-cell dependent autoimmune disease with known specific antigens, such as rheumatoid arthritis, may be a candidate for treatment, and we believe that our patent strategy is readily extendable to address these additional indications. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Competition 

The development of therapeutic agents for human disease is intensely competitive. Major pharmaceutical companies currently offer a number of pharmaceutical products to treat MS and other diseases for which our technologies may be applicable. Many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are investigating new drugs and therapeutic approaches for the same purposes, which may achieve new efficacy profiles, extend the therapeutic window for such products, alter the prognosis of these diseases, or prevent their onset. We believe that our products, when and if successfully developed, will compete with these products principally on the basis of improved and extended efficacy and safety and their overall economic benefit to the health care system. We expect competition to increase. We believe that our most significant competitors will be fully integrated pharmaceutical companies and more established biotechnology companies. Smaller companies may also be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies. Some of our primary competitors in the current treatment of, and in the development of treatments for, MS include Biogen-Idec, Roche Holdings AG, Elan, Merck-Serono (which is an affiliate of the entity that holds the Option), Teva, Bayer/Schering AG and Novartis. Some of our primary competitors in the development of treatments for NMO include Alexion, Biogen-Idec, Chugai Pharmaceuticals, Roche Holdings AG and Astra Zeneca. 

Sales and Marketing 

If Merck Serono exercises its Option to acquire an exclusive, worldwide license for our Tcelna program for the treatment of MS and pays us an upfront license fee, Merck Serono would be solely responsible for funding future commercialization activities for Tcelna in MS, although we would retain an option to co-fund certain development in exchange for increased royalty rates. We would also retain rights to Tcelna in Japan, certain rights with respect to the manufacture of Tcelna, and rights outside of MS. We would consider partnering with large biotech and pharmaceutical companies, if and when applicable, to assist with marketing and sales of an MS T-cell therapy in Japan as well as to assist with marketing and sales in indications beyond MS. 

If Merck Serono does not exercise its Option, we may choose to partner with large biotech or other pharmaceutical companies for sales and marketing, if and when applicable, or alternatively develop our own sales force to market our MS cell therapy products in the U.S. Given the concentration of MS treatment among a relatively small number of specialized neurologists in the U.S., we believe that a modest size sales force would be sufficient to market an MS product in the U.S. 

Government Regulation 

Our research and development activities and the future manufacturing and marketing of our potential products are, and will be, subject to regulation for safety and efficacy by a number of governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries. 

In the U.S., pharmaceuticals, biologicals and medical devices are subject to FDA regulation. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended, and the Public Health Service Act, as amended, the regulations promulgated thereunder, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the testing in human subjects, manufacture, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, export, record keeping, approval, marketing, advertising and promotion of our potential products. Product development and approval within this regulatory framework take a number of years and involve significant uncertainty combined with the expenditure of substantial resources. 

FDA Approval Process 

We will need to obtain FDA approval of any therapeutic product we plan to market and sell. The FDA will only grant marketing approval if it determines that a product is both safe and effective. The testing and approval process will require substantial time, effort and expense. The steps required before our products may be marketed in the U.S. include: 

Preclinical Laboratory and Animal Tests. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of the product candidate and animal studies in specific disease models to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate as well as the quality and consistency of the manufacturing process. 

Submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, Which Must Become Effective Before U.S. Human Clinical Trials May Commence . The results of the preclinical tests are submitted to the FDA, and the IND becomes effective 30 days following its receipt by the FDA, as long as there are no questions, requests for delay or objections from the FDA. The sponsor of an IND must keep the FDA informed during the duration of clinical studies through required amendments and reports, including adverse event reports. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Adequate and Well-Controlled Human Clinical Trials to Establish the Safety and Efficacy of the Product Candidate. Clinical trials, which test the safety and efficacy of the product candidate in humans, are conducted in accordance with protocols that detail the objectives of the studies, the parameters to be used to monitor safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. Any product candidate administered in a U.S. clinical trial must be manufactured in accordance with cGMP. 

The protocol for each clinical study must be approved by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, at the institution at which the study is conducted, and the informed consent of all participants must be obtained. The IRB will consider, among other things, the existing information on the product candidate, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects, the potential benefits of the therapy and the possible liability of the institution. 

Clinical development is traditionally conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap: 

&#9679; 

In Phase I, product candidates are typically introduced into healthy human subjects or into selected patient populations ( i.e., patients with a serious disease or condition under study, under physician supervision) to test for adverse reactions, dosage tolerance, absorption and distribution, metabolism, excretion and clinical pharmacology. 

&#9679; 

Phase II involves studies in a limited population of patients with the disease or condition under study to (i) determine the efficacy of the product candidates for specific targeted indications and populations, (ii) determine optimal dosage and dosage tolerance and (iii) identify possible and common adverse effects and safety risks. (Phase II may divided into Phase IIa and Phase IIb studies to address these issues.) When a dose is chosen and a candidate product is found to have preliminary evidence of effectiveness, and to have an acceptable safety profile in Phase II evaluations, Phase III trials begin. 

&#9679; 

Phase III trials are undertaken to develop additional safety and efficacy information from an expanded patient population, generally at multiple study sites. This information obtained is used to develop a better understanding of the risks and benefits of the product candidate and to determine appropriate labeling for use. 

Based on clinical trial progress and results, the FDA may request changes or may require discontinuance of the trials at any time if significant safety issues arise. 

Submission to the FDA of Marketing Authorization Applications and FDA Review. The results of the preclinical studies and clinical studies are submitted to the FDA as part of marketing approval authorization applications such as New Drug Applications (NDAs) or Biologics License Applications (BLAs). The FDA will evaluate such applications for the demonstration of safety and effectiveness. A BLA is required for biological products subject to licensure under the Public Health Service Act and must show that the product is safe, pure and potent. In addition to preclinical and clinical data, the BLA must contain other elements such as manufacturing materials, stability data, samples and labeling. FDA approval of a BLA is required prior to commercial sale or shipment of a biologic. A BLA may only be approved once the FDA examines the product and inspects the manufacturing establishment to assure conformity to the BLA and all applicable regulations and standards for biologics. 

The time for approval may vary widely depending on the specific product candidate and disease to be treated, and a number of factors, including the risk/benefit profile identified in clinical trials, the availability of alternative treatments, and the severity of the disease. Additional animal studies or clinical trials may be requested during the FDA review period, which might add substantially to the review time. 

The FDA&#8217;s marketing approval for a product is limited to the treatment of a specific disease or condition in specified populations in certain clinical circumstances, as described on the approved labeling. The approved use is known as the &#8220;indication.&#8221; After the FDA approves a product for the initial indication, further clinical trials may be required to gain approval for the use of the product for additional indications. The FDA may also require post-marketing testing (Phase IV studies) and surveillance to monitor for adverse effects, which could involve significant expense. The FDA may also elect to grant only conditional approval. 

Ongoing Compliance Requirements 

Even after product approval, there are a number of ongoing FDA regulatory requirements, including: 

&#9679; 

Registration and listing; 

&#9679; 

Regulatory submissions relating to changes in an NDA or BLA (such as the manufacturing process or labeling) and annual reports; 

&#9679; 

Adverse event reporting; 

&#9679; 

Compliance with advertising and promotion restrictions that relate to drugs and biologics; and 

&#9679; 

Compliance with GMP and biological product standards (subject to FDA inspection of facilities to determine compliance). 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Other Regulations 

In addition to safety regulations enforced by the FDA, we are also subject to regulations under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act and other present and potential future foreign, federal, state and local regulations. For instance, product manufacturing establishments located in certain states also may be subject to separate regulatory and licensing requirements. 

Outside the U.S., we will be subject to regulations that govern the import of drug products from the U.S. or other manufacturing sites and foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials and marketing approval for products. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursements vary widely from country to country. 

Research and Development 

Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were approximately $10.0 million, mainly reflecting the costs of the operation of the Abili-T clinical trial for Tcelna in patients with SPMS. Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were approximately $12.1 million, mainly reflecting the costs of the operation of the Abili-T clinical trial for Tcelna in patients with SPMS. 

Organizational History 

We have a limited operating history. Our predecessor company for financial reporting purposes was formed on January 22, 2003 to acquire rights to an adult stem cell technology. In November 2004, we acquired Opexa Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its MS treatment technology. Currently, we remain focused on developing our T-cell technology for MS and NMO. To date, we have not generated any commercial revenues from operations. As we continue to execute our business plan, we expect our development and operating expenses to increase. 

Employees 

As of March 10, 2016, we had 26 full-time employees. On March 2, 2016, we announced implementation of a restructuring initiative which included a reduction of approximately 30% of our then full-time workforce of 36 employees in order to reduce operating expenses and conserve cash resources. The restructuring initiative was driven by reduced operational demands associated with the Abili-T clinical trial for Tcelna in patients with SPMS following administration of the final dose to the last patient in such trial, which occurred in the last week of February 2016. It is intended to allow us to focus our resources on completion of the Abili-T clinical trial, for which top-line data is expected early in the fourth quarter of 2016. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. None of our employees are represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
