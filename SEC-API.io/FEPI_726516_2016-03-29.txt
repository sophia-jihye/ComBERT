 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

As used herein, the terms ("FEPI", "we", "us", "our", or "the Company") refer to First Equity Properties, Inc. a Nevada corporation organized on December 19, 1996. FEPI is the successor-in-interest to WESPAC Investors Trust III, a California real estate investment trust ("WESPAC") originally established August 22, 1983. The Company's fiscal year ends December 31 of each year.

Prior to January 1, 1997, the Company's business consisted of the management and operation of three motel properties in the Spokane, Washington area. During the fiscal years ended December 31, 1998 and 1999, the Company, through its subsidiaries, engaged in property, and real estate brokerage services. Between October 1999 and May 2004, the Company and its subsidiaries conducted no substantial business, but remained available to engage in property management and real estate brokerage activities.

Effective May 1, 2004, the Company sold all of the issued and outstanding common stock of a subsidiary company known as Carmel Realty, Inc., a Texas corporation ("Carmel") and a 99% limited partnership interest in Carmel Realty Services, Ltd., a Texas limited partnership ("CRSL") for an aggregate sale price of $2,072,540 (a basis equivalent to ten times capitalization of the management fees collected by Carmel and CRSL during 2003) to Regis. Regis paid cash of $250,000 to the Company and delivered a promissory note dated May 1, 2004 in the stated principal amount of $1,822,540 payable to the order of the Company on demand or, if no demand is made prior thereto, on December 31, 2011, with interest payable monthly as it accrues. This loan has been extended to December 31, 2015. Such promissory note is secured by a pledge of the common stock of Carmel and the partnership interest of CRSL sold.

Beginning in 1999 the principal source of revenue for the Company was interest income on notes receivable due from affiliated and/or related parties.

Management of the Company is exploring alternatives, seeking to establish or acquire new business operations for the Company. Management cannot predict or give any assurance that any new business enterprise will be acquired by the Company at any time in the near future.
