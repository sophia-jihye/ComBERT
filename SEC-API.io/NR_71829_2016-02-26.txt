 ITEM 1. 

Business 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

Newpark Resources, Inc. was organized in 1932 as a Nevada corporation. In 1991, we changed our state of incorporation to Delaware. We are a geographically diversified oil and gas industry supplier providing products and services primarily to the oil and gas exploration (&#8220;E&#38;P&#8221;) industry. We operate our business through two reportable segments: Fluids Systems and Mats and Integrated Services. Our Fluids Systems segment provides customized drilling fluids solutions to E&#38;P customers globally, operating through four geographic regions: North America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa (&#8220;EMEA&#8221;), Latin America, and Asia Pacific. Our Mats and Integrated Services segment provides composite mat rentals, well site construction and related site services to oil and gas customers at well, production, transportation and refinery locations in the U.S. In addition, mat rental activity is expanding into applications in other industries, including petrochemicals, utilities, and pipeline. We also sell composite mats to E&#38;P customers outside of the U.S., and to domestic customers outside of the oil and gas industry. In March 2014, we completed the sale of our Environmental Services business, which was historically reported as a third operating segment. For a detailed discussion of this matter, see &#8220;Note 2 - Discontinued Operations&#8221; to our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

When referring to &#8220;Newpark&#8221; and using phrases such as &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221;, our intent is to refer to Newpark Resources, Inc. and its subsidiaries as a whole or on a segment basis, depending on the context in which the statements are made. 

&#160; 

Industry Fundamentals 

&#160; 

Historically, several factors have driven demand for our products and services, including the supply, demand and pricing of oil and gas commodities, which drive E&#38;P drilling and development activity. Demand for most of our Fluids Systems&#8217; products and services is also driven, in part, by the level, type, depth and complexity of oil and gas drilling. Historically, drilling activity levels in North America have been volatile, primarily driven by the price of oil and natural gas. Starting in the fourth quarter of 2014 and continuing throughout 2015 and into the first quarter of 2016, the price of oil declined dramatically from the price levels in recent years. As a result, E&#38;P drilling activity has significantly declined in North America and many global markets over this period. The most widely accepted measure of activity for our North American operations is the Baker Hughes Rotary Rig Count. The average North America rig count was 1,170 in 2015, compared to 2,241 in 2014, and 2,114 in 2013. The weakness in North American rig activity has continued into 2016, and as of February 19, 2016, the North American rig count was at 720. The lower activity levels are expected to remain below prior year levels for the foreseeable future. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

The lower E&#38;P drilling activity levels reduced the demand for our services and negatively impacted customer pricing in our North American operations in 2015. The lower customer demand and elevated costs associated with workforce reductions negatively impacted our profitability in 2015. Further, due to the fact that our business contains high levels of fixed costs, including significant facility and personnel expenses, North American operating margins in both operating segments are negatively impacted by the lower customer demand. 

&#160; 

Outside of North America, drilling activity is generally more stable, as drilling activity in many countries is based upon longer term economic projections and multiple year drilling programs, which tend to reduce the impact of short term changes in commodity prices on overall drilling activity. While drilling activity in certain of our international markets, including Brazil, Australia, and India, has declined dramatically following the decline in oil prices, our international activities have continued to grow in recent years, driven by geographical expansion into new markets, as well as market share gains in existing markets. 

&#160; 

Reportable Segments 

&#160; 

Fluids Systems 

&#160; 

Our Fluids Systems business offers customized solutions, including highly technical drilling projects involving complex subsurface conditions such as horizontal, directional, geologically deep or deep water drilling. These projects require increased monitoring and critical engineering support of the fluids system during the drilling process. We provide drilling fluids products and technical services to markets in North America, EMEA, Latin America, and Asia Pacific regions. We also have industrial mineral grinding operations for barite, a critical raw material in drilling fluids products, which serve to support our activity in the North American drilling fluids market. We grind barite and other industrial minerals at four facilities, including locations in Texas, Louisiana and Tennessee. We use the resulting products in our drilling fluids business, and also sell them to third party users, including other drilling fluids companies. We also sell a variety of other minerals, principally to third party industrial (non-oil and gas) markets. Our Fluids Systems business also historically included a completion services and equipment rental business; however, during the fourth quarter of 2013, we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of this business. 

&#160; 

Raw Materials &#160;&#8212; We believe that our sources of supply for materials and equipment used in our drilling fluids business are adequate for our needs, however, we have experienced periods of short-term scarcity of barite ore, which have resulted in significant cost increases. Our specialty milling operation is our primary supplier of barite used in our drilling fluids business. Our mills obtain raw barite ore under supply agreements from foreign sources, primarily China and India. We obtain other materials used in the drilling fluids business from various third party suppliers. We have encountered no serious shortages or delays in obtaining these raw materials. 

&#160; 

Technology &#160;&#8212; We seek patents and licenses on new developments whenever we believe it creates a competitive advantage in the marketplace. We own the patent rights to a family of high-performance water-based fluids systems, which we market as Evolution &#174; , DeepDrill &#174; and FlexDrill &#8482; systems, which are designed to enhance drilling performance and provide environmental benefits. Proprietary technology and systems are an important aspect of our business strategy. We also rely on a variety of unpatented proprietary technologies and know-how in many of our applications. We believe that our reputation in the industry, the range of services we offer, ongoing technical development and know-how, responsiveness to customers and understanding of regulatory requirements are of equal or greater competitive significance than our existing proprietary rights. 

&#160; 

Competition &#160;&#8212; We face competition from larger companies, including Schlumberger, Halliburton and Baker Hughes, which compete vigorously on fluids performance and/or price. In addition, these companies have broad product and service offerings in addition to their drilling fluids. We also have smaller regional competitors competing with us mainly on price and local relationships. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our businesses include a combination of technical proficiency, reputation, price, reliability, quality, breadth of services offered and experience. We believe that our competitive position is enhanced by our proprietary products and services. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

Customers &#160;&#8212; Our customers are principally major integrated and independent oil and gas E&#38;P companies operating in the markets that we serve. During 2015, approximately 54% of segment revenues were derived from the 20 largest segment customers, and 51% of segment revenues were generated domestically. Typically, we perform services either under short-term standard contracts or under &#8220;master&#8221; service agreements. As most agreements with our customers can be terminated upon short notice, our backlog is not significant. We do not derive a significant portion of our revenues from government contracts. See &#8220;Note 12 - Segment and Related Information&#8221; in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information on financial and geographic data. 

&#160; 

Mats and Integrated Services &#160; 

&#160; 

We manufacture our DURA-BASE &#174; Advanced Composite Mats for use in our rental operations as well as for third party sales. Our mats provide environmental protection and ensure all-weather access to sites with unstable soil conditions. We sell composite mats direct to customers in areas around the world where we do not maintain an infrastructure for our mat rental activities. In addition, we provide mat rentals to E&#38;P customers in the Northeast U.S., onshore U.S. Gulf Coast, and Rocky Mountain Regions, and to non-E&#38;P customers in the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom. We also offer location construction and related well site services to E&#38;P customers in the Gulf Coast Region. We recently began offering the Defender&#8482; spill containment system to provide customers with an alternative to the use of plastic liners for spill containment and the EPZ Grounding System&#8482; for enhanced safety and efficiency for contractors working on power line maintenance and construction projects. 

&#160; 

Historically, our marketing efforts for the sale of composite mats remained focused in principal oil and gas industry markets outside the U.S., as well as markets outside the E&#38;P sector in the U.S. and Europe. We believe these mats have worldwide applications outside our traditional oilfield market, primarily in infrastructure construction, maintenance and upgrades of pipelines and electric utility transmission lines, and as temporary roads for movement of oversized or unusually heavy loads. In late 2013, we announced plans to significantly expand our manufacturing facility, in order to support our efforts to expand our markets globally. This project was completed in 2015, which nearly doubled our manufacturing capacity and significantly expanded our research and development capabilities. 

&#160; 

Raw Materials &#160;&#8212; We believe that our sources of supply for materials and equipment used in our business are adequate for our needs. We are not dependent upon any one supplier and we have encountered no serious shortages or delays in obtaining any raw materials. The resins, chemicals and other materials used to manufacture composite mats are widely available. Resin is the largest raw material component in the manufacturing of our composite mat products. 

&#160; 

Technology &#160;&#8212; We have obtained patents related to the design and manufacturing of our DURA-BASE mats and several of the components, as well as other products and systems related to these mats (including the Defender spill containment system and the EPZ Grounding System). Using proprietary technology and systems is an important aspect of our business strategy. We believe that these products provide us with a distinct advantage over our competition. We believe that our reputation in the industry, the range of services we offer, ongoing technical development and know-how, responsiveness to customers and understanding of regulatory requirements also have competitive significance in the markets we serve. 

&#160; 

Competition &#160;&#8212; Our market is fragmented and competitive, with many competitors providing various forms of site preparation products and services. The mat sales component of our business is not as fragmented as the rental and services segment with only a few competitors providing various alternatives to our DURA-BASE mat products, such as Signature Systems Group. This is due to many factors, including large capital start-up costs and proprietary technology associated with this product. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our businesses include product capabilities, price, reputation, and reliability. We also believe that our competitive position is enhanced by our proprietary products, services and experience. 

&#160; 

Customers &#160;&#8212; Our customers are principally integrated and independent oil and gas E&#38;P companies operating in the markets that we serve. Approximately 72% of our segment revenues in 2015 were derived from the 20 largest segment customers, of which, the largest customer represented 16% of our segment revenues. As a result of our recent efforts to expand beyond our traditional oilfield customer base, revenues from non-exploration customers increased in 2015 and represented approximately 44% of segment revenues in 2015, as compared to approximately 25% in 2014. Typically, we perform services either under short-term contracts or rental service agreements. As most agreements with our customers are cancelable upon short notice, our backlog is not significant. We do not derive a significant portion of our revenues from government contracts. See &#8220;Note 12 - Segment and Related Information&#8221; in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information on financial and geographic data. 

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

Sale of Environmental Services Segment 

&#160; 

In March 2014, we completed the sale of our Environmental Services business, which was historically reported as a third operating segment. For further discussion of this matter, see &#8220;Note 2 - Discontinued Operations&#8221; in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 

&#160; 

The Environmental Services business processed and disposed of waste generated by our oil and gas customers that was treated as exempt under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (&#8220;RCRA&#8221;). The Environmental Services business also processed E&#38;P waste contaminated with naturally occurring radioactive material. In addition, the business received and disposed of non-hazardous industrial waste, principally from generators of such waste in the U.S. Gulf Coast market, which produced waste that was not regulated under RCRA. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

At January 31, 2016, we employed approximately 1,980 full and part-time personnel none of which are represented by unions. We consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory. 

&#160; 

Environmental Regulation 

&#160; 

We seek to comply with all applicable legal requirements concerning environmental matters. Our business is affected by governmental regulations relating to the oil and gas industry in general, as well as environmental, health and safety regulations that have specific application to our business. Our activities are impacted by various federal and state regulatory agencies, and provincial pollution control, health and safety programs that are administered and enforced by regulatory agencies. 

&#160; 

Additionally, our business exposes us to environmental risks. We have implemented various procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable regulations and reduce the risk of damage or loss. These include specified handling procedures and guidelines for waste, ongoing employee training, and monitoring and maintaining insurance coverage. 

&#160; 

We also employ a corporate-wide web-based health, safety and environmental management system (&#8220;HSEMS&#8221;), which is ISO 14001:2004 compliant. The HSEMS is designed to capture information related to the planning, decision-making, and general operations of environmental regulatory activities within our operations. We also use the HSEMS to capture the information generated by regularly scheduled independent audits that are done to validate the findings of our internal monitoring and auditing procedures.
