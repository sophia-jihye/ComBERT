Company Overview 

&#160;

The business of ChromaDex Corporation is conducted by our principal subsidiaries, ChromaDex, Inc., ChromaDex Analytics, Inc. and Spherix Consulting, Inc. (&#8220;Spherix&#8221;). ChromaDex Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to herein as &#8220;ChromaDex&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221; or, in the first person as &#8220;we&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221;) is a natural products company that leverages its complementary business units to discover, acquire, develop and commercialize patented and proprietary ingredient technologies that address the dietary supplement, food, beverage, skin care and pharmaceutical markets. In addition to the Company&#8217;s proprietary ingredient technologies segment, the Company also has a core standards and contract services segment, which focuses on natural product fine chemicals (known as &#8220;phytochemicals&#8221;) and chemistry and analytical testing services and a regulatory consulting segment (known as Spherix Consulting). As a result of the Company&#8217;s relationships with leading universities and research institutions, the Company is able to discover and license early stage, intellectual property-backed ingredient technologies. The Company then utilizes the Company&#8217;s business segments to develop commercially viable proprietary ingredients. The Company&#8217;s proprietary ingredient portfolio is backed with clinical and scientific research, as well as extensive intellectual property protection. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Through ChromaDex Analytics, a part of our core standards and contract services business segment, we perform chemistry-based analytical services at our laboratory in Boulder, Colorado, supporting quality control or quality assurance activities for the dietary supplement industry. Through Spherix, our regulatory consulting segment, we provide scientific and regulatory consulting to the clients in the food, supplement and pharmaceutical industries to manage potential health and regulatory risks. For the fiscal years ended January 2, 2016, January 3, 2015 and December 28, 2013, our revenues were approximately $22,014,000 $15,313,000 $10,161,000 respectively. The following table summarizes the Company&#8217;s total sales for each of the business segments in the last 3 years.

&#160;

We are a leading provider of research and quality-control products and services to the natural products industry. Through our core standards and contract services segment, customers worldwide in the dietary supplement, food and beverage, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries use our products, which are small quantities of highly-characterized, research-grade, plant-based materials, to ensure the quality of their raw materials and finished products. Customers also use our analytical chemistry services to support their quality assurance activities, primarily to ensure the identity, potency and safety of their consumer products. We have conducted this core standards and contract services business since 1999. 

&#160;

We believe there is a growing need at both the manufacturing and government regulatory levels for reference standards, analytical methods and other quality assurance methods to ensure that products that contain plants, plant extracts and naturally occurring compounds distributed to consumers are safe. We further believe that this need is driven by the perception at the consumer level regarding a lack of adequate quality controls related to certain functional food or dietary supplement based products, as well as increased effort on the part of the Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) to assure Good Manufacturing Practices (&#8220;GMP&#8221;). 

&#160;

Our core standards and contract service business segment provides us with the opportunity to become aware of the results from research and screening activities performed on thousands of potential natural product candidates through our relationships with various universities and research institutions. By selecting the most promising ingredients leveraged from this market-based screening model, which is grounded by primary research performed through leading universities and institutions, followed by selective investments in further research and development, new proprietary ingredients can be identified and brought to various markets with a much lower investment cost and an increased chance of success. 

&#160;

Through our ingredients business segment, we develop and commercialize these new ingredients. One of our proprietary ingredients that we commercialized under this business model is nicotinamide riboside (&#8220;NR&#8221;), for which our brand name is NIAGEN&#174;. NR is found naturally in trace amounts in milk and other foods and is B3 vitamin. The potential beneficial effects of NR in humans include increased anti-aging properties, fatty acid oxidation, mitochondrial activity, resistance to negative consequences of high-fat diets, protection against oxidative stress, prevention of peripheral neuropathy and blocking muscle degeneration. Published research has shown that NR is a potent precursor to the co-enzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) in the mitochondria of animals. NAD+ is an important cellular co-factor for improvement of mitochondrial performance and energy metabolism. The Company has built a significant patent portfolio pertaining to NR by separately acquiring patent rights from Cornell University, Dartmouth College and Washington University. We have successfully completed the first human clinical trial using NR and the results demonstrated that a single dose of NR resulted in statistically significant increases in NAD+ in health human volunteers. In addition, NR was also found to be safe as no adverse events were observed throughout the clinical trial. In 2015, NR was recognized by the FDA as a &#8220;New Dietary Ingredient.&#8221; NR was also &#8220;Generally Recognized As Safe&#8221; by an independent panel of expert toxicologists. For years 2015, 2014, and 2013, NIAGEN&#174; accounted for approximately 68%, 54%, and 14% of our ingredient segment&#8217;s total sales, respectively. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Another one of these proprietary ingredients is pterostilbene, for which is marketed and sold under our brand name, pTeroPure&#174;. Pterostilbene is a polyphenol and a powerful antioxidant that shows promise in a range of health related fields. We have exclusive in-licensed patents and patents pending related to the use of pterostilbene for a number of these benefits, and have filed additional patents related to supplementary benefits, such as a patent jointly filed with University of California at Irvine related to its effects on non-melanoma skin cancer. We have successfully conducted a clinical trial, together with the University of Mississippi, related to its blood pressure lowering effects and expect to conduct additional clinical trials on pterostilbene and anticipate entering the dietary supplement and, if clinical results are favorable, the pharmaceutical market. We believe that we also have opportunities in the skin care market and will continue to investigate developing these opportunities internally or through third party partners. We anticipate conducting additional clinical trials on NR, pterostilbene and other compounds in our pipeline to provide differentiation as we market these proprietary ingredients and support various health-related claims or obtain additional regulatory clearances. 

Through our regulatory consulting segment (&#8220;Spherix&#8221;), we provide our clients in the food, supplement and pharmaceutical industries with effective scientific solutions to manage their potential health and regulatory risks. Our science-based solutions are for both new and existing products that may be subject to product liability and/or exposed to changing scientific standards or public perceptions; literature evaluations; and design and assessment of pre-clinical and clinical safety testing. We specialize in regulatory submissions for food and dietary supplement ingredients. For our clients involved in drug development within the pharmaceutical industry, we provide similar services as well as risk-based strategies, including intellectual property data and compliance gap identification, due diligence assessments and investigational new drug writing. Spherix has complemented and expanded our leadership in core standards and contract services business by providing a more comprehensive suite of science-based and regulatory services. Through Spherix, we have more efficiently advanced products in the dietary supplement, food and beverage, animal health, cosmetic and pharmaceutical markets. 

&#160;

Company Background 

&#160;

ChromaDex, Inc. was originally formed as a California corporation on February 19, 2000. On April 23, 2003, ChromaDex Inc. acquired the research and development group of a competing natural product company called Napro Biotherapeutics located in Boulder, Colorado. The assets acquired in this transaction were placed in a newly-formed, wholly-owned subsidiary of ChromaDex named ChromaDex Analytics, Inc., a Nevada corporation. On December 3, 2012, ChromaDex Inc. acquired Spherix Consulting Inc., a scientific and regulatory consulting company located in the greater Washington D.C. area and Spherix became a wholly-owned subsidiary of ChromaDex, Inc. In 2011, the Company launched its BluScience retail consumer line based on its proprietary ingredients. However, on March 28, 2013, the Company entered into an asset purchase and sale agreement with NeutriSci International Inc. (&#8220;NeutriSci&#8221;) and consummated the sale of the BluScience consumer product line to NeutriSci. 

&#160;

Our Strategy 

&#160;

Our business strategy is to identify, acquire, reduce-to-practice, and commercialize innovative new proprietary ingredients and technologies, with an initial industry focus on the dietary supplement, food, beverage, skin care and pharmaceutical markets. We plan to utilize our experienced management team to commercialize these proprietary ingredient technologies by advancing them through any required regulatory approval processes, selectively conducting clinical trials, arranging for reliable and cost-effective manufacturing, and ultimately either directly selling the products or licensing the intellectual property to third parties. We plan to conduct clinical trials to (a) reinforce the health benefits that may be associated with our proprietary ingredients in support of sales made into the dietary supplement and food, cosmetics and beverage markets, (b) potentially improve the quality or specificity of FDA approved claim we can make with respect to these health benefits, and (c) potentially lead us toward pharmaceutical applications for our proprietary ingredients. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Commercialization of intellectual property : We believe that many of our proprietary ingredients currently in development have the potential to spin off technologies that may themselves be independently capable of commercialization and becoming significant new revenue sources. We believe that new intellectual property can also be developed from our expansion into new markets. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Expansion and growth of the core business : Through our core standards and contract services segment, we intend to continue to expand our phytochemical standards and related contract services offerings. Currently, we have approximately 5,000 defined phytochemical reference standards. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Expansion into new markets : For both our ingredients segment and core standards and contract services segment, we are developing business in new domestic and international markets. These markets include both the domestic and international botanical drug market and the market for novel therapeutic botanicals from Asia, South America and Africa. We have also added what we believe to be new and innovative product offerings, including the screening of compound libraries and the offering of value-added raw materials. 

&#160;

Overview of our Products and Services 

&#160;

We are headquartered in Irvine, California, and our analytical and research laboratory facility, ChromaDex Analytics, is located in Boulder, Colorado. ChromaDex Analytics operates a facility with 13,000 square feet of laboratory and office space. While we perform many of the contract services and research for our clients, ChromaDex Analytics manufactures certain phytochemical reference standards, provides research and development, all analytical services and laboratory support for ChromaDex. 

&#160;

In December 2012, we acquired Spherix, located in the greater Washington D.C. area. Spherix provides its clients in the food, supplement and pharmaceutical industries with effective solutions to manage potential health and regulatory risks. 

&#160;

Current products and services provided are: 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Proprietary ingredient technologies (ingredients segment). We offer bulk raw materials for inclusion in dietary supplements, food, beverage and cosmetic products. This is an area where we are increasing our focus, as we believe we can secure and defend our market positions through patents and long-term manufacturing agreements with our customers and vendors. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Supply of reference standards, materials &#38; kits (core standards and contract services segment). We supply a wide range of products necessary to conduct quality control of raw materials and consumer products. Reference standards and materials and the kits created from them are used for research and quality control in the dietary supplements, cosmetics, food and beverages, and pharmaceutical industries. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Supply of fine chemicals and phytochemicals (core standards and contract services segment). As demand for new natural products and phytochemicals increases, we can scale up and supply our core products in the gram to kilogram scale for companies that require these products for research and new product development. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Contract services (core standards and contract services segment) . We provide a wide range of contract services ranging from routine contract analysis for the production of dietary supplements, cosmetics, foods and other natural products to elaborate contract research for clients in these industries. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Consulting services (regulatory consulting segment) . We provide a comprehensive range of consulting services in the areas of regulatory support, new ingredient or product development, risk management and litigation support. We provide and offer product regulatory approval and scientific advisory services. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Process development (core standards and contract services segment). Developing cost effective and efficient processes for manufacturing natural products can be very difficult and time consuming. We assist customers in creating processes for cost-effective manufacturing of natural products, using &#8220;green chemistry.&#8221; 

&#160;

Products and services in development: 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Nicotinamide riboside (ingredients segment) . We are working to develop and conduct additional clinical trials to reinforce the health benefits associated with NR, a recently discovered vitamin found naturally in milk. NR is the most efficient B3 vitamin to enhance NAD+ energetics. NR has shown promise for improving cardiovascular health, glucose levels and cognitive function and has demonstrated evidence of anti-aging effects. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Pterostilbene and caffeine co-crystal (ingredients segment). We are working to develop and conduct additional clinical trials to reinforce the benefits of the co-crystal ingredient comprised of caffeine and pterostilbene. The first human study of this ingredient demonstrated that it delivers 30 percent more caffeine, stays in the blood stream longer, and is absorbed more slowly than ordinary caffeine. With this ingredient, formulators of energy products may have the ability to reduce the total amount of caffeine in their products by as much as 50% without sacrificing consumers&#8217; expectations from such products. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Anthocyanin (ingredients segment) . We plan to develop an extraction process to concentrate the anthocyanins in Suntava&#174; Purple Corn which will be used to produce a highly concentrated anthocyanin ingredient. We will utilize the expertise of a toll manufacturer to produce the commercial ingredient. We believe there is a ready market for cost-effective concentrated anthocyanins having application in dietary supplements, sports nutrition, food &#38; beverage and skin care. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Quality verification seal program (core standards and contract services segment). We intend to further develop and expand our offering of &#8220;ChromaDex&#174; Quality Verified Seal&#8221; program which currently includes (i) supply chain facility audits and inspections to verify compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices as specified by the FDA; (ii) a comprehensive identity testing program for raw materials and finished products; (iii) finished product testing for potential contaminants such as microbials, heavy metals and residual solvents; and (iv) provisions for ongoing monitoring to be performed as part of a quality protocol design and managed by ChromaDex. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Phytochemical libraries (core standards and contract services segment). We intend to continue investing in the development of natural product based libraries by continuing to create these libraries internally as well as through product licensing. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Plant extracts libraries (core standards and contract services segment) . We intend to continue our efforts to create an extensive library of plant extracts using our already extensive list of botanical reference materials. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Databases for cross-referencing phytochemicals (core standards and contract services segment) . We are working on building a database for cross referencing phytochemicals against an extensive list of plants, including links to references to ethnopharmacological, ethnobotanical, and biological activity, as well as clinical evidence. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Intellectual property (ingredients segment). We plan to utilize our expertise in natural products to license and develop new intellectual property that can be licensed to clients in our target industries. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#9679;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Sales and Marketing Strategy 

&#160;

Our sales platform for the ingredients segment and core standards and contract services segment is based on a direct, inside technical sales model. We hire technical sales staff with appropriate scientific background in chemistry, biology, biochemistry or other related scientific fields. Our sales staff currently operates out of our Irvine, California office and performs sales duties by using combinations of telemarketing, e-mail, tradeshows and customer visits. It also has customer service responsibilities. We plan to add outside field sales representatives in the future as needed. All sales staff is compensated based on a uniform basic pay model based on salary and performance-based bonus. 

The regulatory consulting segment, operating out of Rockville, Maryland, generates scientific and regulatory consulting revenue from an existing well-established list of Fortune 1000 customers and referrals. Our sales staff for the ingredients, reference standards and analytical service business in Irvine, California also generate leads for Spherix. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Business Market 

According to the Natural Marketing Institute, the Dietary Supplement, Functional Food and Beverage, and Natural Personal Care markets represent more than $250 billion in annual worldwide sales. The quality control and assurance of some of the products in these markets are, as previously noted, largely &#8220;under regulated.&#8221; This scenario leads to the establishment of the basis of one of our business strategies: concentration on the overall content of products, as well as active/marker components, uniformity of production, and toxicology of products in these markets in ways similar to analysis by other companies focused in the pharmaceutical industry. There is an increasing demand for new products, ingredients and ideas for natural products. The pressure for new, innovative products, which are &#8220;natural&#8221; or &#8220;green&#8221; based, cuts across all markets including food, beverage, cosmetic and pharmaceutical. 

&#160;

While we believe that doctors and patients have become more receptive to the use of botanical and herbal-based and natural and dietary ingredients to prevent or treat illness and improve quality of life, the medical establishment has conditioned its acceptance on significantly improved demonstration of efficacy, safety and quality control comparable to that imposed on pharmaceuticals. Nevertheless, little is currently known about the constituents, active compounds and safety of many botanical and herbal natural ingredients and few qualified chemists and technology based companies exist to supply the information and products necessary to meet this burgeoning market need. Natural products are complex mixtures of many compounds, with significant variability arising from growing and extraction conditions. The following developments are some that highlight the need for standards control and quality assurance: 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#8226; 

The FDA published its draft guidance for GMPs for dietary supplements on March 13, 2003. The final rule from this guidance was made effective in June 2007, and full compliance was required by June 2010; and 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Regulatory agencies around the world have started to review the need for the regulation of herbal and natural supplements and are considering regulations that will include testing for the presence of toxic or adulterating compounds, drug/compound interactions and evidence that the products are biologically active for their intended use. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Business Model 

&#160;

We have taken advantage of both supply chain needs and regulatory requirements such as the GMPs for dietary supplements to build our core standards and contract services segment. We believe that we create value throughout the supply chain of the pharmaceutical, dietary supplements, functional foods and personal care markets. We do this by: 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Combining the analytical methodology and characterization of materials with the technical support for the sale of reference materials by our clients; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Helping companies to comply with government regulations; and 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Providing value-added solutions to every layer of the supply chain in order to increase the overall quality of products being produced. 

&#160;

In addition, through regulatory consulting segment, we provide product regulatory approval and scientific advisory services to our clients in the food, supplement and pharmaceutical industries with effective solutions to manage potential health and regulatory risks. Our science-based solutions are for both new and existing products that may be subject to product liability and/or exposed to changing scientific standards or public perceptions; literature evaluations; and design and assessment of pre-clinical and clinical safety testing. We specialize in regulatory submissions for food and dietary supplement ingredients. For our clients involved in drug development within the pharmaceutical industry, we provide similar services as well as risk-based strategies, including intellectual property data and compliance gap identification, due diligence assessments and investigational new drug writing. By providing a more comprehensive suite of science-based and regulatory services, we will be able to more efficiently advance products in the dietary supplement, food and beverage, animal health, cosmetic and pharmaceutical markets. 

&#160;

We will continue to expand this aspect of our business and, more importantly, capitalize on additional opportunities in product development and commercialization of various kinds of intellectual property that we have largely discovered and acquired through the sales process associated with our core standards and contract services segment. 

&#160;

Our core standards and contract services segment provides us with the opportunity to become aware of the results from research and screening activities performed on thousands of potential natural product candidates through our relationships with various universities and research institutions. By selecting the most promising ingredients leveraged from this market-based screening model, which is grounded by primary research performed through leading universities and institutions, followed by selective investments in further research and development, new proprietary ingredient technologies can be identified and brought to various markets with a much lower investment cost and an increased chance of success. 

&#160;

One of our proprietary ingredients that we commercialized under this business model through our ingredients segment is nicotinamide riboside (&#8220;NR&#8221;), for which our brand name is NIAGEN&#174;. NR is found naturally in trace amounts in milk and other foods and is the most efficient B3 vitamin. The potential beneficial effects of NR in humans include increased anti-aging properties, fatty acid oxidation, mitochondrial activity, resistance to negative consequences of high-fat diets, protection against oxidative stress, prevention of peripheral neuropathy and blocking muscle degeneration. Published research has shown that NR is a potent precursor to the co-enzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) in the mitochondria of animals.

We have successfully completed the first human clinical trial using NR and the results demonstrated that a single dose of NR resulted in statistically significant increases NAD+ in health human volunteers. In addition, NR was also found to be safe as no adverse events were observed throughout the clinical trial. In 2015, NR was recognized by the FDA as a &#8220;New Dietary Ingredient.&#8221; NR was also &#8220;Generally Recognized As Safe&#8221; by an independent panel of expert toxicologists. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Another one of these proprietary ingredients is pterostilbene, for which is marketed and sold under our brand name, pTeroPure&#174;. Pterostilbene is a polyphenol and a powerful antioxidant that shows promise in a range of health related fields. We have exclusive in-licensed patents and patents pending related to the use of pterostilbene for a number of these benefits, and have filed additional patents related to supplementary benefits, such as a patent jointly filed with University of California at Irvine related to its effects on non-melanoma skin cancer.

We anticipate conducting additional clinical trials on NR, pterostilbene and other compounds in our pipeline to provide differentiation as we market these proprietary ingredients and support various health-related claims or obtain additional regulatory clearances. 

&#160;

We continue to identify and in-license novel, proprietary ingredients with significant potential health benefits. Among these next generation compounds are pterostilbene and caffeine co-crystal, which allows formulators of energy products to reduce the amount of caffeine in their products, and anthocyanins, which are compounds responsible for the dark pigment found in certain berries and flowers. Like NIAGEN &#174; and pTeroPure &#174;, these compounds also have potential in multiple markets. 

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160;

Some of our operations for ingredients segment and core standards and contract services segment are subject to regulation by various United States federal agencies and similar state and international agencies, including the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission (&#8220;FTC&#8221;), the Department of Commerce, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Agriculture and other state and international agencies. These regulators govern a wide variety of production activities, from design and development to labeling, manufacturing, handling, selling and distributing of products. From time to time, federal, state and international legislation is enacted that may have the effect of materially increasing the cost of doing business or limiting or expanding our permissible activities. We cannot predict whether or when potential legislation or regulations will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect of such legislation, regulation, implementation, or any implemented regulations or supervisory policies would have on our financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the outcome of any litigation, investigations or enforcement actions initiated by state or federal authorities could result in changes to our operations being necessary and in increased compliance costs. 

&#160;

FDA Regulation 

&#160;

Dietary supplements are subject to FDA regulations. For example, the FDA&#8217;s final rule on GMPs for dietary supplements published in June 2007 requires companies to evaluate products for identity, strength, purity and composition. These regulations in some cases, particularly for new ingredients, require a notification that must be submitted to the FDA along with evidence of safety. In addition, depending on the type of product, whether a dietary supplement, cosmetic, food, or pharmaceutical, the FDA, under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, can regulate: 

&#160;

ingredient testing 

&#160;

&#160; &#8226;

The FDCA has been amended several times with respect to dietary supplements, most notably by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, known as &#8220;DSHEA.&#8221; DSHEA established a new framework for governing the composition and labeling of dietary supplements. Generally, under DSHEA, dietary ingredients that were marketed in the United States before October 15, 1994 may be used in dietary supplements without notifying the FDA. However, a &#8220;new&#8221; dietary ingredient (a dietary ingredient that was not marketed in the United States before October 15, 1994) is subject to a new dietary ingredient, or NDI, notification that must be submitted to the FDA unless the ingredient has previously been &#8220;present in the food supply as an article used for food&#8221; without being &#8220;chemically altered.&#8221; An NDI notification must provide the FDA with evidence of a &#8220;history of use or other evidence of safety&#8221; establishing that the use of the dietary ingredient &#8220;will reasonably be expected to be safe.&#8221; An NDI notification must be submitted to the FDA at least 75 days before the initial marketing of the NDI. There can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the evidence of safety for any NDIs that we may want to commercialize, and the FDA&#8217;s refusal to accept such evidence could prevent the marketing of such dietary ingredients. The FDA is in the process of developing guidance for the industry that will aim to clarify the FDA&#8217;s interpretation of the NDI notification requirements, and this guidance may raise new and significant regulatory barriers for NDIs. 

&#160;

In order for any new ingredient developed by us to be used in conventional food or beverage products in the United States, the product would either have to be approved by the FDA as a food additive pursuant to a food additive petition, or FAP, or be generally recognized as safe, or GRAS. The FDA does not have to approve a company&#8217;s determination that an ingredient is GRAS. However, a company can notify the FDA of its determination. There can be no assurance that the FDA will approve any FAP for any ingredient that we may want to commercialize, or agree with our determination that an ingredient is GRAS, either of which could prevent the marketing of such ingredient. 

&#160;

Advertising Regulation 

&#160;

In addition to FDA regulations, the FTC regulates the advertising of dietary supplements, foods, cosmetics, and over-the-counter, or OTC, drugs. In recent years, the FTC has instituted numerous enforcement actions against dietary supplement companies for failure to adequately substantiate claims made in advertising or for the use of false or misleading advertising claims. These enforcement actions have often resulted in consent decrees and the payment of civil penalties, restitution, or both, by the companies involved. We may be subject to regulation under various state and local laws that include provisions governing, among other things, the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising and distribution of dietary supplements, foods, cosmetics and OTC drugs. 

In addition, The National Advertising Division of the Council of Better Business Bureaus (the &#8220;NAD&#8221;) reviews national advertising for truthfulness and accuracy. The NAD uses a form of alternative dispute resolution, working closely with in-house counsel, marketing executives, research and development departments and outside consultants to decide whether claims have been substantiated. 

&#160;

International 

&#160;

Our international sales for the ingredients segment are subject to foreign government regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval, and the requirements may differ. In addition, the export by us of certain of our products that have not yet been cleared or approved for domestic distribution may be subject to FDA export restrictions. We may be unable to obtain on a timely basis, if at all, any foreign government or United States export approvals necessary for the marketing of our products abroad. 

&#160;

Regulation in Europe is exercised primarily through the European Union, which regulates the combined market of each of its member states. Other countries, such as Switzerland, have voluntarily adopted laws and regulations that mirror those of the European Union with respect to dietary ingredients. 

&#160;

&#160;

Major Customers 

For our ingredients segment, there were two customers who accounted for more than 10% the Company&#8217;s total sales in the last three years. In 2015, Customer B in our ingredients segment accounted for 11.0% of the Company&#8217;s total sales. Customer B accounted for less than 10% of the Company&#8217;s total sales for the years 2014 and 2013. During the year 2014, Customer A in our ingredients segment accounted for 10.2% of the Company&#8217;s total sales. Customer A accounted for less than 10% of the Company&#8217;s total sales for the years 2015 and 2013. 

Generally, we do not depend upon a single customer, or a few customers and the loss of any one or more would not have a material adverse effect on the ingredients segment or the Company. However, due to the volume of ingredients we are selling in relation to the overall Company&#8217;s sales, we do expect that few of our customers at times may account for more than 10% of the Company&#8217;s sales. 

For the core standards and contract services segment and the regulatory consulting segment, we did not have any customers who accounted for more than 10% of the Company&#8217;s total sales in the last three years. 

&#160;

Competitive Business Conditions 

&#160;

For our ingredients segment, we face little direct competition as the new ingredients we offer, such as NIAGEN&#174; and pTeroPure&#174; are backed by intellectual properties exclusively licensed to us. We, however, face strong indirect competition from other ingredient suppliers who may supply alternative ingredients that may have similar characteristics compared to the ingredients we offer. Below is a list of some of the competitors for our ingredients segment. 

&#160;

Sabinsa Corporation (India/USA) 

&#160;

For the core standards and contract services segment, we face competition within the standardization and quality testing niche of the natural products market, though we know of no other companies that offer both reference standards and testing to their customers. Below is a current list of certain competitors. These competitors have already developed reference standards or contract services or are currently taking steps to develop botanical standards or contract services. Of the competitors listed, some currently sell fine chemicals, which, by default, are sometimes used as reference standards, and others are closely aligned with our market niche so as to reduce any barriers to entry if these companies wish to compete. Some of these competitors currently offer similar services and have the scale and resources to compete with us for larger customer accounts. Because some of our competitors are larger in total size and capitalization, they likely have greater access to capital markets, and are in a better position than we are to compete nationally and internationally.

For the regulatory consulting segment, there are numerous competitors, including some that are much larger companies with more resources. The success in winning and retaining clients is heavily dependent on the efforts and reputation of our consultants. We believe the barriers to entry in particular areas of our consulting expertise are low. 

&#160;

&#160;

Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises, Concessions, Royalty Agreements or Labor Contracts, Including Duration 

&#160;

For our ingredients segment, we currently protect our intellectual property through patents, trademarks, designs and copyrights on our products and services. Our business strategies is to use the intellectual property harnessed from our core standards and contract services segment as the basis for providing new proprietary ingredients to our customers. Our strategy is to develop these proprietary ingredients on our own as well as to license our intellectual property to companies who will commercialize it. We anticipate that the net result will be a long term flow of intellectual property milestone and royalty payments for us.

Manufacturing 

&#160;

For our ingredients segment and our core standards and contract services segment, we currently utilize third-party manufacturers to produce and supply the ingredients. Following the receipt of products or product components from third-party manufacturers, we currently inspect products, as needed. We expect to reserve the right to inspect and ensure conformance of each product and product component to our specifications. We will also consider manufacturing certain products or product components internally, if our capacity permits, when demand or quality requirements make it appropriate to do so. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

For certain reference standards, ChromaDex Analytics operates laboratory operations and a manufacturing facility for our core standards and contract services segment. We currently maintain our own manufacturing equipment and have the ability to manufacture certain products in limited quantities, ranging from milligrams to kilograms. We intend to contract for the manufacturing of products that we develop and enter into strategic relationships or license agreements for sales and marketing of products that we develop when the quantities we require exceed our capacity at our Boulder, Colorado facility. 

&#160;

We intend to work with manufacturing companies that can meet the standards imposed by the FDA, the International Organization for Standardization, or &#8220;ISO,&#8221; and the quality standards that we will require for our own internal policies and procedures. We expect to monitor and manage supplier performance through a corrective action program developed by us. We believe these manufacturing relationships can minimize our capital investment, help control costs, and allow us to compete with larger volume manufacturers of dietary supplements, phytochemicals and ingredients. 

&#160;

Following the receipt of products or product components from third-party manufacturers, we currently inspect products, as needed. We expect to reserve the right to inspect and ensure conformance of each product and product component to our specifications. We will also consider manufacturing certain products or product components internally, if our capacity permits, when demand or quality requirements make it appropriate to do so. 

&#160;

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials and the Names of Principal Suppliers 

&#160;

We believe that we have identified reliable sources and suppliers of ingredients, chemicals, phytochemicals and reference materials that will provide products in compliance with our guidelines. 

&#160;

Research and Development 

&#160;

For our ingredients segment, we have completed the first human clinical trial on our proprietary ingredient nicotinamide riboside (&#8220;NR&#8221;) and the results demonstrated that a single dose of NR resulted in statistically significant increases in the co-enzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) in healthy human volunteers. In addition, NR was also found to be safe as no adverse events were observed. I n 2015, NR was recognized by the FDA as a &#8220;New Dietary Ingredient.&#8221; NR was also &#8220;Generally Recognized As Safe&#8221; by an independent panel of expert toxicologists. 

&#160;

We have also successfully conducted a clinical trial, together with the University of Mississippi, on our proprietary ingredient pterostilbene for its blood pressure lowering effects. We expect to conduct additional clinical trials on this compound and we anticipate entering the dietary supplement and, if clinical results are favorable, possibly the pharmaceutical markets as well. We also have completed a study on our proprietary ingredient pterostilbene with caffeine co-crystal. The first human study of this ingredient demonstrated that it delivers 30 percent more caffeine, stays in the blood stream longer, and is absorbed more slowly than ordinary caffeine. We anticipate conducting additional clinical trials on NR and other compounds in our pipeline to provide differentiation as we market these proprietary ingredients and support various health-related claims or obtain additional regulatory clearances. 

Research and development costs for our ingredients segment for the fiscal years ended January 2, 2016, January 3, 2015 and December 28, 2013 were approximately $892,000, $514,000 and $134,000, respectively. 

&#160;

Environmental Compliance 

&#160;

We will incur significant expense in complying with GMPs and safe handling and disposal of materials used in our research and manufacturing activities. We do not anticipate incurring additional material expense in order to comply with Federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Working Capital 

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s working capital at the end of years 2015, 2014 and 2013 was approximately $4.4 million, $2.2 million and $1.6 million, respectively. The Company measures working capital by adding trade receivables and inventories, and subtracting accounts payable. The majority of the working capital is consumed by our ingredients segment as the operations require a large amount of inventory to be on hand. As the ingredients segment grows, more working capital will likely be needed to support the operations. As of January 2, 2016, the Company had approximately $7.2 million of inventory for our ingredients segment, which represented approximately 38% of the Company&#8217;s total assets. 

&#160;

Backlog Orders 

&#160;

For our ingredients segment, we have minimal backlog orders as we carry inventory on hand for most of the ingredients we offer and we ship upon the receipt of customer&#8217;s purchase orders. 

&#160;

For the core standards and contract services segment, we normally have a small backlog of orders for reference standards. These orders amount to approximately $25,000 or less. Because we carry 5,000 different reference standards, we may not always have the items in stock at the time of customers&#8217; orders. These backlog orders are normally fulfilled within 2 to 3 months. 

&#160;

Facilities 

For information on our facilities, see &#8220;Properties&#8221; in Item 2 of this Form 10-K. 

&#160;

Employees 

As of January 2, 2016, ChromaDex (including ChromaDex Analytics and Spherix Consulting, Inc.) had 82 employees, 80 of whom were full-time and 2 of whom were part-time. We consider our relationships with our employees to be satisfactory. None of our employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
