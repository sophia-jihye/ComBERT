 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

Our Company 

We own, operate and franchise two fast-casual restaurant brands, Pollo Tropical&#174; and Taco Cabana&#174;, which have almost 30 and 40 years, respectively, of operating history and loyal customer bases. Our Pollo Tropical restaurants offer a wide variety of freshly prepared Caribbean inspired food, while our Taco Cabana restaurants offer a broad selection of hand-made, freshly prepared and authentic Mexican food. We believe that both brands are differentiated from other restaurant concepts and offer a unique dining experience. Our brands are positioned within the value-oriented fast-casual restaurant segment. Additionally, nearly all of our restaurants offer the convenience of drive-thru windows. 

For the fiscal year ended January 3, 2016 , the average annual sales per restaurant was approximately $2.6 million &#32;for our company-owned Pollo Tropical restaurants and approximately $1.9 million &#32;for our company-owned Taco Cabana restaurants, which we believe are among the highest in the fast-casual and quick-service segments based on industry data from Technomic. As of January 3, 2016 , we owned and operated 155 &#32;Pollo Tropical restaurants in the southeast and south central United States, and 162 &#32;Taco Cabana restaurants primarily located in Texas, for a total of 317 &#32;restaurants across five states. We franchise our Pollo Tropical restaurants primarily in international markets, and as of January 3, 2016 , we had 30 &#32;franchised Pollo Tropical restaurants outside the United States and five domestic non-traditional licensed locations on college campuses. As of January 3, 2016 , we had four Taco Cabana franchised restaurants and two non-traditional Taco Cabana licensed domestic locations. For the fiscal year ended January 3, 2016 , we generated consolidated revenues of $687.4 million , and comparable restaurant sales increased 3.8% &#32;for Pollo Tropical and 4.4% &#32;for Taco Cabana. 

Recent Developments. On February 24, 2016, we announced that as the next step in our long-term strategy, we intend to separate the Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana businesses in 2017 or 2018 through a tax-efficient distribution of 100% of Taco Cabana&#8217;s stock to Fiesta shareholders and rename Fiesta as Pollo Tropical. To facilitate this, we expect to build two fully independent management teams and gradually invest in corporate infrastructures. At the same time, we intend to continue to focus on executing our business plan, including building scale in our new Pollo Tropical markets to reach media efficiency as quickly as possible, thereby driving brand awareness and higher sales volumes, and beginning to accelerate new restaurant development at Taco Cabana. 

Over time, we intend to develop more detailed plans for a proposed separation transaction. The separation plan, including transaction structure, timing, composition of senior management, capital structure and other matters will all be subject to approval by our Board of Directors and regulatory and other approvals, among other things. Further details will be disclosed at a later date as our plans evolve. 

Our Brands. Our restaurants operate in the fast-casual restaurant segment, combining the convenience and value of quick-service restaurants in an appealing atmosphere with the menu variety, use of fresh ingredients, food quality and decor more typical of casual dining restaurants with limited table service and competitive pricing. 

Pollo Tropical. Our Pollo Tropical restaurants offer Caribbean inspired menu items, featuring our bone-in chicken marinated in a proprietary blend of tropical fruit juices and grilled over an open flame. Our menu also includes a line of TropiChops &#174; &#32;(a create your own casserole bowl of grilled chicken breast, roast pork or grilled vegetables, or in some markets beef, served over white, brown or yellow rice and red or black beans and topped with a variety of freshly-made sauces and salsas), a variety of sandwiches, wraps and salads offered with an array of Caribbean style made-from-scratch side dishes, including black beans and rice, fried yuca and sweet plantains, as well as more traditional menu items such as waffle fries, Caesar salad and corn. We also offer a self-service "Saucing Island" which includes a wide selection of made-from-scratch salsas, sauces, jalape&#241;os, cilantro, onions and other items which allows our guests to further customize their orders. Our restaurants offer Caribbean dessert favorites, such as flan and tres leches. Our beverage offerings include fountain soft drinks and fruit-based Refrescas, and at certain locations, we offer rum-based drinks and beer. Most menu items are prepared daily in each of our restaurants, which feature open display cooking on large, open-flame grills. We offer both individual and family meal-sized portions which enable us to provide a home meal replacement for our guests. We also offer catering for parties and corporate events. 

Our Pollo Tropical restaurants feature dining areas designed to create an inviting, festive and tropical atmosphere. We also provide our guests the option of take-out, including the ability to order on-line in advance, and nearly all of our restaurants provide the convenience of drive-thru windows. In some locations, delivery is available. Our Pollo Tropical restaurants are generally open for lunch, dinner and late night seven days a week. As of January 3, 2016 , substantially all of our company-owned Pollo Tropical restaurants were freestanding buildings. Our typical freestanding Pollo Tropical restaurant ranges from 2,800 to 3,700 square feet and provides interior seating for approximately 70 to 90 guests. For the year ended January 3, 2016 , the average sales transaction at our company- 

owned Pollo Tropical restaurants was $10.76 , with dinner representing the largest day-part at 53.2% . For the year ended January 3, 2016 , our Pollo Tropical brand generated total revenues of $366.7 million &#32;and Adjusted EBITDA of $59.3 million , including pre-opening costs of $4.3 million &#32;(which include costs incurred prior to opening a new restaurant, including restaurant employee wages and related expenses, travel expenditures, recruiting, training, promotional costs associated with the restaurant opening and rent, including any non-cash rent expense recognized during the construction period). 

Pollo Tropical opened its first restaurant in 1988 in Miami, Florida. As of January 3, 2016 , we owned and operated a total of 155 &#32;Pollo Tropical restaurants, of which 117 &#32;were located in Florida, 23 &#32;were located in Texas, eleven &#32;were located in Georgia and four &#32;were located in Tennessee. In 2014, we introduced a new building design in Texas that we believe better differentiates our Pollo Tropical brand with a bolder, more Caribbean inspired look while continuing to utilize the elevated, limited table service and menu format that has been in place in certain locations outside of our core South Florida markets since 2009. We believe the elevated format and new design better position the brand for a broader target audience and growth outside of Florida. In addition, in 2015 we began a reimaging program to conform select existing Pollo Tropical restaurants to the new building design, beginning with our restaurants located in the Orlando and Nashville markets. As of January 3, 2016, we had reimaged 17 Pollo Tropical restaurants. 

We are franchising our Pollo Tropical restaurants primarily internationally, and as of January 3, 2016 , we had 30 &#32;franchised Pollo Tropical restaurants located in Puerto Rico, Honduras, Trinidad &#38; Tobago, the Bahamas, Venezuela, Panama and Guatemala, and five non-traditional licensed locations on college campuses in Florida. We have agreements for the continued development of franchised Pollo Tropical restaurants in certain of our existing franchised markets, and we have commitments for additional non-traditional locations in U.S. markets in which we currently operate. 

Taco Cabana. Our Taco Cabana restaurants serve fresh, authentic Mexican-inspired food, including flame-grilled steak and chicken fajitas served on sizzling iron skillets, quesadillas, hand-rolled flautas, enchiladas, burritos, tacos, fresh-made flour tortillas, customizable salads served in our Cabana Bowl &#174; , and our popular breakfast tacos. We also offer a self-serve salsa bar which includes a wide selection of made-from-scratch salsas, sauces, sliced jalape&#241;os, chopped cilantro, chopped onions and other items which allow our guests to further customize their orders. Our beverage offerings include fountain soft drinks, our signature frozen margaritas and beer as well as bottled Mexican Coke and Fanta Orange soda made with real cane sugar. Most menu items are freshly-prepared at each restaurant daily. 

Taco Cabana restaurants feature open display cooking that enables guests to observe fajitas cooking on an open grill, a tortilla machine pressing and grilling fresh flour tortillas and the fresh preparation of other menu items. Our Taco Cabana restaurants feature interior dining areas as well as semi-enclosed and outdoor patio areas, which provide a vibrant, contemporary decor and relaxing atmosphere. Additionally, we provide our guests the option of take-out, including the ability to order on-line in advance, as well as the convenience of drive-thru windows and catering. Our typical freestanding Taco Cabana restaurants average approximately 3,500 square feet (exclusive of the exterior dining area) and provide seating for approximately 80 guests, with additional outside patio seating for approximately 50 guests. As of January 3, 2016 , substantially all of our company-owned Taco Cabana restaurants were freestanding buildings. 

Taco Cabana pioneered the Mexican patio cafe concept with its first restaurant in San Antonio, Texas in 1978. As of January 3, 2016 , we owned and operated 162 &#32;Taco Cabana restaurants, of which 161 &#32;were located in Texas and one &#32;was located in Oklahoma. As of January 3, 2016 , we also had four Taco Cabana franchised restaurants located in New Mexico and two non-traditional Taco Cabana licensed locations in Texas. A majority of our Taco Cabana restaurants are open 24 hours a day, generating guest traffic and restaurant sales balanced across multiple day-parts. For the year ended January 3, 2016 , dinner sales represented the largest day-part at 25.4% &#32;and the average sales transaction at our company-owned Taco Cabana restaurants was $9.16 . For the year ended January 3, 2016 , our Taco Cabana brand generated total revenues of $320.7 million &#32;and Adjusted EBITDA of $39.7 million , including pre-opening costs of $0.3 million . 

In 2010 we began initiatives to enhance the building design and d&#233;cor, service and menu offerings with the goal of providing guests with an elevated fast-casual experience and to better position the brand for sustainable growth. As of January 3, 2016 , substantially all of the planned Taco Cabana renovations have been completed. 

As of January 3, 2016, we had four franchised Taco Cabana restaurants located in New Mexico and two non-traditional Taco Cabana licensed locations in Texas. 

Our Competitive Strengths 

We believe the success of our Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana brands is a result of the following key attributes: 

Well Positioned in the Fast Growing Fast-Casual Segment. As of January 3, 2016 , we owned, operated and franchised 358 &#32;fast-casual restaurants under our Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana brands which have almost 30 and 40 years, respectively, of operating history. According to Technomic, the fast-casual segment is the fastest growing segment of the restaurant industry with sales growth of 13.1% in 2014 over 2013 for fast-casual chains in the Technomic Top 500 restaurant chains as compared to 4.0% growth for the overall Top 500 restaurant chains. In addition, at $2.6 million &#32;and $1.9 million , respectively, Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana have two of the highest average annual sales per restaurant in the fast- and quick-casual segments according to Technomic. However, average annual sales per restaurant for our Pollo Tropical restaurants could decrease as we open restaurants in newer markets, which have lower annual sales per restaurant than our mature markets. We believe our brands are well positioned to continue to benefit from the growing consumer demand for fast-casual restaurants because of our high quality, freshly-prepared food, value and differentiation of flavor profiles. In addition, we believe our brand elevation initiatives and reimaging programs have enhanced our Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana restaurants in certain existing and new markets by providing our guests with an elevated fast-casual experience while better positioning our brands for successful and sustainable future growth. 

Two Leading, Differentiated Brands Serving Fresh, High Quality Foods With Broad Appeal and a Compelling Value Proposition. Our Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana brands are differentiated from other dining options and offer distinct flavor profiles and healthful menu choices at affordable prices that we believe have broad consumer appeal, provide guests with a compelling value proposition, attract a more diverse customer base and drive guest frequency and loyalty. Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana are committed to serving made-from-scratch, freshly-prepared food using quality ingredients that are made-to-order and customized for each guest. Both of our brands offer a wide range of menu offerings with regional taste profiles and home meal replacement options in generous portion sizes and at affordable price points which appeal to a broad customer base. Our open display kitchen format allows guests to view and experience our food being freshly-prepared and cooked to order. Pollo Tropical&#8217;s menu offers dishes inspired from various regions throughout the Caribbean, including our featured bone-in chicken marinated in a proprietary blend of spices and tropical fruit juices and grilled over an open flame. Taco Cabana&#8217;s menu offers favorites such as sizzling fajitas served hot on an iron skillet and other authentic Mexican dishes. In order to provide variety to our guests and to address changes in consumer preferences, we frequently enhance our menu with seasonal offerings at our Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana restaurants. We also selectively use promotions and limited time offers which are intended to reinforce our value proposition and to introduce new products. Additionally, our menus include a number of options to address consumers&#8217; increasing focus on healthful eating, and we offer our guests drive-thru service at the majority of our restaurants in order to provide a fast, convenience option including home meal replacement and family meals. 

Accelerating Development with Significant Potential. Since our spin-off in 2012, we have focused our strategy on growing both of our brands, although Pollo Tropical has been our primary growth vehicle. Our long-term business model is based on 8% to 10% company-owned restaurant growth each year. In 2015, we opened 34 new company-owned restaurants comprised of 32 Pollo Tropical restaurants and two Taco Cabana restaurants. For 2016, we are planning to open 36 to 40 new company-owned Pollo Tropical restaurants and up to four new company-owned Taco Cabana restaurants in existing markets. Our planned growth in 2016 focuses on existing markets in order to improve our restaurant penetration levels outside of our core South Florida markets. In each market, we endeavor to reach restaurant penetration levels which will support broadcast media to build brand awareness and sales growth. 

Compelling Business Model and Strong Financial Results. &#32;&#32;We enjoy significant brand recognition due to high market penetration of company-owned restaurants in our core markets which provides operating, marketing and distribution efficiencies, convenience for our guests and the ability to effectively manage and enhance brand awareness. As a result of this brand recognition and the three factors discussed above, we believe that both of our brands enjoy strong financial results, which reinforces our compelling business model. Both of our brands enjoy segment-leading average annual sales volumes, as noted above, with compelling Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA margins. 

Growth Strategies 

Our strategies for growth primarily include: 

Develop New Restaurants Within and Outside of Our Existing Markets. We believe that we have significant opportunities to develop additional Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana restaurants within our existing primary markets in Florida and Texas, as well as expansion opportunities into other regions of the United States that match our targeted demographic and site selection criteria, which initially include markets in the Southeast. We expect Pollo Tropical to be our primary growth vehicle. We believe both brands can operate successfully in the same markets as we continue to move the Pollo Tropical brand west from Florida, thereby leveraging the real estate knowledge and operating infrastructure already in place in Texas. We are currently targeting new restaurant openings in high profile areas with target household incomes and population density. In 2014, Pollo Tropical developed a new format which we believe will better enable it to be accepted as a general market concept with a broad 

target audience. This format includes a new exterior design and a more upscale d&#233;cor that we believe better differentiates our brand with a more Caribbean inspired look; new menu offerings including rum-based beverages in some locations and beer; and numerous other enhancements, while continuing to utilize the elevated, limited table service platform and format that has been in place in certain locations since 2009. The new format serves as the model for Pollo Tropical&#8217;s expansion outside its core South Florida markets. 

We target opening freestanding company-owned restaurants in order to provide drive-thru service which is an important convenience and sales component for our brands. Results may vary by market depending on restaurant penetration, brand awareness and media spend in the market, and the location of the restaurant. Although new company-owned restaurants in new markets that have not yet reached media efficiency typically open at lower sales volumes than restaurants opened in existing, media-efficient markets, we continue to believe that investing in these new markets is an important part of our growth strategy. 

We believe that the location of our restaurants is a critical component of each restaurant&#8217;s success. We evaluate potential new sites on many critical criteria including accessibility, visibility, costs, surrounding traffic patterns, competition and demographic characteristics. Our senior management team determines the acceptability of all new sites, based upon analyses prepared by our real estate, financial and operations professionals as well as a third party vendor that employs proprietary location research technology and performs site evaluations on our behalf. Historically, this process has typically resulted in entering into a long-term lease for the land or, to a lesser extent, the acquisition of the land, in either case followed by construction of the building using cash generated from our operations or with borrowings under our senior credit facility. If we acquire the land, we may consider seeking to include the land and building in a sale and leaseback arrangement as a form of financing in order to reinvest the proceeds in additional restaurants. 

The following table includes the recent historical initial interior cost (including equipment, seating, signage and other interior costs) of a typical new or converted freestanding restaurant, as well as the historical exterior cost (including building and site improvements) and land if acquired.

N/A 

The cost of securing real estate and building and equipping new restaurants can vary significantly and depends on a number of factors, including the local economic conditions, geographic considerations and the characteristics of a particular site. Accordingly, the cost of opening new restaurants in the future may differ substantially from the historical cost of restaurants previously opened. 

Increase Comparable Restaurant Sales. We intend to continue to increase comparable restaurant sales by attracting new customers and increasing guest frequency through the following strategies: 

&#8226; 

Focus on consistency of operations and food quality : We believe the quality, consistency and accuracy of our operations result in an enjoyable guest experience, which drives guest frequency. We will continue to refine our menu offerings, supply chain and food preparation processes to ensure high quality, freshness and consistency of our food which we believe are critical components to the continued success of our brands. 

&#8226; 

New product innovation : Across both brands, our menus are centered on fresh, high quality food offerings that we believe have both broad appeal and provide everyday value. Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana each have separate teams of product research and development professionals that enables us to continually refine our menu offerings and develop new products. Maintaining a strong product pipeline is critical to keeping our offerings compelling, and we intend to introduce innovative new items and enhancements to existing menu favorites throughout the year to drive further guest traffic and maximize guest frequency. Also, the addition of portable menu items, such as wraps, sandwiches, bowls and salads, as well as home meal replacement and family meals will continue to be a key focus for both brands as we look to capture more meal occasions for people on the go. 

&#8226; 

Focus on effective advertising to highlight our everyday value proposition : Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana utilize an integrated, multi-level marketing approach that includes periodic chain-wide promotions, direct mail, outdoor marketing including billboards, in-store promotions, local store marketing, social media marketing and web-based and other strategies, including the use of radio and television advertising and limited-time offer menu item promotions. The type, mix and volume of advertising spend is heavily influenced by number of restaurants in each market, so that in new markets we achieve certain restaurant penetration levels prior to launching more expensive and broad-based radio and television advertising. We plan to continue to refine our advertising and media strategy to continue to reinforce the key attributes of our brands which include high quality, freshly-prepared food, an enhanced guest experience and everyday value. We have experienced success emphasizing the attractive price 

points of our menu. Additionally, we revamped our Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana websites as part of our initiative to elevate our brand positioning across all guest touch points and seek to leverage social media marketing. Through our websites, we now provide guests with the opportunity to sign up for our respective eClubs to stay informed regarding product and promotional launches. As a percentage of Pollo Tropical restaurant sales, Pollo Tropical&#8217;s advertising expenditures were 2.6% &#32;in 2015, 2.5% in 2014 and 2.2% in 2013. As a percentage of Taco Cabana restaurant sales, Taco Cabana&#8217;s advertising expenditures were 3.8% &#32;in 2015, 3.9% in 2014 and 3.9% in 2013. In 2016, we plan to pilot and introduce a loyalty program at both brands to further connect with our repeat guests. 

&#8226; 

Grow our off premise sales: &#32;While both Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana offer family meals and catering, we believe both brands have significant opportunities to grow their off premise sales. In addition to launching a redesigned website with enhanced on-line ordering capabilities and a smart phone app, we are also offering delivery on a trial basis in certain markets. 

&#8226; 

Continue our brand elevation and reimage program : We believe that our elevated brand position continues to resonate with guests by enhancing the quality of the guest experience at our restaurants by aligning our image and service with our high quality food offerings. We continue to implement restaurant enhancement initiatives to elevate the dining experience at our Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana restaurants in select markets. We believe these enhancements improve our brands&#8217; positioning in the fast-casual segment while appealing to a broader demographic. Our restaurant enhancements create an updated, contemporary look that we believe is more relevant to today&#8217;s consumers and include changes to both the interior and exterior of our restaurants with the addition of new tables and chairs, upgraded salsa bars and the addition of photos and murals to create a more inviting feel and highlight our fresh ingredients. Our Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana elevated formats also feature limited table service, Wi-Fi and new menu items, as well as hand-held menus and real plates and silverware in certain locations. We believe our elevated Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana restaurants continue to differentiate us from our competitors. Additionally, we plan to continue our restaurant reimaging efforts as we refresh and upgrade our entire system. As of January 3, 2016 , we have substantially completed a multi-year reimaging program at Taco Cabana and are in the second year of a reimaging program at Pollo Tropical. As of January 3, 2016, we have reimaged 17 Pollo Tropical restaurants, and plan to continue to reimage additional Pollo Tropical restaurants, which we believe will further differentiate our Pollo Tropical brand with a more Caribbean inspired look, help us maintain a quality restaurant environment, and further drive incremental sales and profitability. 

Improve Profitability and Optimize Our Infrastructure. We believe our Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA margins, at 24.8% &#32;&#32;for Pollo Tropical and 19.0% &#32;for Taco Cabana, are among the best in the fast- and quick-casual segments. However, through new restaurant development, growing comparable restaurant sales and growing franchise revenues, we believe we will further grow our Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA and related margins. We also believe that our large restaurant base, skilled management team, operating systems and training and development programs support our strategy of enhancing operating efficiencies for our existing restaurants while concurrently growing our restaurant base. We continue to focus on maximizing cost efficiencies, including implementing profit enhancement initiatives focused on food and labor costs and leveraging our scale, as well as enhancing our supply chain expertise with the result of reduced costs and improved food quality, consistency and yield. In addition, as we continue to grow our restaurant base we believe that we will be able to further leverage our size to realize certain benefits from economies of scale. 

However, because our company-owned restaurants in new markets have lower sales than our company-owned restaurants in markets that have achieved media efficiency and we need to build regional support structures in advance of new company-owned restaurant openings, our average annual sales per restaurant and Adjusted EBITDA margins, which include general and administrative costs, have been and could continue to be impacted as we open new company-owned restaurants in new markets. 

Competition 

The restaurant industry is highly competitive with respect to price, service, location and food quality. In each of our markets, our restaurants compete with a large number of national and regional restaurant chains, as well as locally owned restaurants, offering low and medium-priced fare. We also compete with convenience stores, delicatessens and prepared food counters in supermarkets, grocery stores, cafeterias and other purveyors of moderately priced and quickly prepared foods. 

We believe that: 

&#8226; 

product quality and taste; 

&#8226; 

brand differentiation and recognition; 

&#8226; 

convenience of location; 

&#8226; 

speed of service; 

&#8226; 

menu variety; 

&#8226; 

value perception; 

&#8226; 

ambiance; 

&#8226; 

cleanliness; and 

&#8226; 

hospitality 

are among the most important competitive factors in the fast-casual restaurant segment and that our two concepts effectively compete in that category. 

Pollo Tropical&#8217;s competitors include national and regional chicken-based concepts, as well as other types of quick-service and fast-casual restaurants. 

Taco Cabana&#8217;s restaurants compete with Mexican concepts, including those in the quick-service and casual dining segments and other fast-casual restaurants.

(1) Average annual sales for company-owned restaurants are derived by dividing restaurant sales for such year for the applicable segment by the average number of company-owned restaurants for the applicable segment for such year. For comparative purposes, the calculation of average annual sales per company-owned restaurant is based on a 52-week fiscal year. Restaurant sales data for the extra week in the fiscal year ended January 3, 2016 have been excluded for purposes of calculating average annual sales per company-owned restaurant. 

Seasonality 

Our business is moderately seasonal due to regional weather conditions. Sales from our restaurants located in south and central Florida are generally higher during the winter months than during the summer months, while sales from our restaurants located in Texas, north Florida, Nashville and Atlanta are generally higher during the summer months than during the winter months. Accordingly, we believe this seasonal impact is not material to our business as a whole because of the offsetting seasonality of our concepts. 

Operations 

Management Structure 

We conduct substantially all of our marketing and operations support functions from our Pollo Tropical division headquarters in Miami, Florida, and our Taco Cabana division headquarters in San Antonio, Texas. The management structure for Pollo Tropical consists of our Chief Operating Officer, Danny Meisenheimer, who has over 25 years of experience in the restaurant industry, and two Vice Presidents of Operations supported by four Regional Directors, 24 District Managers and five Assistant District Managers. The management structure of Taco Cabana consists of our Chief Operating Officer, Todd Coerver, who has over 20 years of restaurant industry experience, and a Vice President of Operations supported by two Regional Directors, three Senior District Managers, 24 District Managers and two Assistant District Managers. The two Chief Operating Officers report to our Chief Executive Officer and President, and are supported by a number of divisional and corporate executives with responsibility for operations, marketing, product development, purchasing, human resources, training, real estate and finance. For each of our brands, a district manager is responsible for the direct oversight of the day-to-day operations of an average of approximately seven restaurants. Typically, district managers have previously served as restaurant managers at one of our restaurants. Regional directors, district managers and restaurant managers are compensated with a fixed salary plus an incentive bonus based upon the performance of the restaurants under their supervision. Typically, our restaurants are staffed with hourly employees who are supervised by a salaried restaurant or general manager and two or three salaried assistant managers. 

Our executive management functions are primarily conducted from our corporate headquarters in Addison, Texas. Our management team is led by Timothy P. Taft, who serves as our Chief Executive Officer and President. Lynn Schweinfurth serves as our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, Joseph A. Zirkman serves as our General Counsel and Secretary, John Todd serves as our Chief Development Officer and Joseph W. Brink serves as our Chief Procurement Officer. 

Training 

We maintain a comprehensive training and development program for all of our restaurant personnel and provide both classroom and in-restaurant training for our salaried and hourly personnel. The program emphasizes system-wide operating procedures, food preparation methods and guest service standards for each of the concepts. The first six months of a new manager&#8217;s time is spent in initial training with close oversight and a limited span of control. This period covers basic shift control, team member supervision, procedural and technical skills and management development. Eight weeks of this time is spent under direct supervision of a dedicated field training manager. The ensuing four months contain intense classroom training with an emphasis on skills building. The next phase is an intensive, self-paced ongoing development program designed to prepare the participant for the next level of management. 

Our training process for new restaurant openings has been developed over the last five years as we expanded into new territory. Dedicated trainers, a new restaurant opening support team and a well-documented training and logistics process to assist us in ensuring execution of the brand standards at openings. Menu authenticity and knowledge, passion for our food and a culture of caring are our strengths in our traditional markets. Our opening processes help to instill these in our teams in new markets. 

Management Information Systems 

Our management information systems provide us the ability to efficiently and effectively manage our restaurants and to ensure consistent application of operating controls at our restaurants. 

In all corporate-owned restaurants, we use computerized management information systems, which we believe are scalable to support our future growth plans. We use touch-screen point-of-sale (POS) systems designed specifically for the restaurant industry that facilitate accuracy and speed of order taking, are user-friendly, require limited cashier training and improve speed-of-service through the use of conversational order-taking techniques. The POS systems are integrated with above-store enterprise applications that are designed to facilitate financial and management control of our restaurant operations. All products sold and related prices at our company-owned restaurants are programmed into the system from our central support office. 

We provide in-store access to enterprise systems that assist in labor scheduling and food cost management, allow on-line ordering from distributors, and reduce managers&#8217; administrative time. Critical information from such systems is available in near real-time to our restaurant managers, who are expected to react quickly to trends or situations in their restaurant. Our district managers also receive near real-time information from all restaurants under their control and have access to key operating data on a remote basis. Management personnel at all levels, from the restaurant manager through senior management, utilize key restaurant performance indicators to manage our business. 

These enterprise systems provide daily tracking and reporting of traffic counts, menu item sales, labor and food data including costs, and other key operating information for each restaurant. These systems also provide the ability to monitor labor utilization and sales trends on a real-time basis at each restaurant and provide analyses, reporting and tools to enable all levels of management to review a wide-range of financial, product mix and operational data. 

We use an integrated digital ordering system that is integrated with our POS system at each restaurant. Individual, group or catering orders placed on our website, mobile app or through our call center are transmitted electronically to the restaurants to provide a seamless ordering, payment and pickup experience for our guests. 

We expect to continue to make substantial investments in technology that will drive sales and transaction growth through improved customer engagement and off-premise service offerings, improve the effectiveness of labor and inventory management, and improve efficiencies with our core enterprise systems. 

Suppliers and Distributors 

For our Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana restaurants, we have negotiated directly with local and national suppliers for the purchase of food and beverage products and supplies to ensure consistent quality and freshness and to obtain competitive prices. Food and supplies for both brands are ordered from approved suppliers and are shipped to the restaurants via distributors. Both brands are responsible for monitoring quality control, for the supervision of these suppliers and for conducting inspections to observe preparations and ensure the quality of products purchased. 

For both our Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana restaurants, we have long-term service agreements with our primary distributors of food and paper products. In 2014, we consolidated our food distribution with Performance Food Group, Inc., which is now our primary distributor of food and beverage products and supplies for both our Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana restaurants under a distribution services agreement that expires on July 26, 2019. For our restaurants in the Southeast, Kelly Food Service is our primary chicken distributor under an agreement that expires on December 31, 2017. We also currently rely on six suppliers for chicken for our Pollo Tropical restaurants under agreements that expire on December 31, 2016. 

Quality Assurance 

Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana are committed to obtaining quality ingredients and creating made-from-scratch, freshly-prepared food in a safe manner. In addition to operating in accordance with quality assurance and health standards mandated by federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations regarding minimum cooking times and temperatures, maximum time standards for holding prepared food, food handling guidelines and cleanliness, among other things, we have also developed our own internal quality control standards. We require our suppliers to adhere to our high quality control standards, and we regularly inspect their products and production and distribution facilities to ensure that they conform to those standards. In addition, we have implemented certain procedures to ensure that we serve safe, quality meals to our guests. As an example, we utilize the nationally-recognized ServSafe program to train our kitchen staff and managers in proper food handling and preparation techniques. In addition, our quality assurance team conducts unscheduled inspections of our restaurants, and restaurant managers conduct internal inspections for taste, quality, cleanliness and food safety on a regular basis. 

In addition to food safety, our operational focus at each of our two concepts is closely monitored to achieve a high level of guest satisfaction via speed of service, order accuracy and quality of service. Our senior management and restaurant management staffs are principally responsible for ensuring compliance with our operating policies. We have uniform operating standards and specifications relating to the quality, preparation and selection of menu items, maintenance and cleanliness of the restaurants and employee conduct. In order to maintain compliance with these operating standards and specifications, we distribute to our restaurant operations management team detailed reports measuring compliance with various guest service standards and objectives, including feedback obtained directly from our guests. The guest feedback is monitored by an independent agency and by us and consists of evaluations of speed of service, quality of service, quality of our menu items and other operational objectives including the cleanliness of our restaurants. We also have our own in-house guest service representatives that handle guest inquiries and feedback. 

Trademarks 

We believe that our trademarks, service marks, trade dress, logos and other proprietary intellectual property are important to our success. We have registered the principal Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana logos and designs with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on the Principal Register as a service mark for our restaurant services. We also have secured or have applied for state and federal registrations for several other advertising or promotional marks, including variations of the Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana principal marks as well as those related to our core menu offerings. In connection with our current and potential international franchising activities, we have applied for or been granted registrations in foreign countries of the Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana principal marks and several other marks. 

Other than the Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana trademarks and the logo and trademark of Fiesta Restaurant Group (including Internet domain names and addresses) and proprietary rights relating to certain of our core menu offerings, we have no proprietary intellectual property. 

Government Regulation 

Various federal, state and local laws affect our business, including various health, sanitation, fire and safety standards. Restaurants to be constructed or reimaged are subject to state and local building code and zoning requirements. In connection with the development and reimaging of our restaurants, we may incur costs to meet certain federal, state and local regulations, including regulations promulgated under the Americans with Disabilities Act. 

We are subject to the federal Fair Labor Standards Act and various other federal and state laws governing employment matters. While we pay, on average, rates that are above the federal minimum wage, and where applicable, state minimum wage, increases in those minimum wages have in the past increased wage rates at our restaurants and in the future will affect our labor costs. In addition, changes to the salary level used to determine exempt status that will become effective in late 2016 may increase our labor costs. Also, certain provisions of the comprehensive federal health care reform law enacted in 2010 became effective in 2015. We believe that a combination of labor management, cost reduction initiatives, technology and menu price increases can offset the potential increased costs associated with these regulations for 2016. 

Taco Cabana and Pollo Tropical are subject to alcoholic beverage control regulations that require state, county or municipal licenses or permits to sell alcoholic beverages at each restaurant location that sells alcoholic beverages. Typically, licenses must be renewed annually and may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. Licensing entities, authorized with law enforcement authority, may issue violations and conduct audits and investigations of the restaurant&#8217;s records and procedures. Alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of the daily operations of our Taco Cabana restaurants and certain of our Pollo Tropical restaurants, including minimum age for consumption, certification requirements for employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventory control and handling, storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. These regulations also prescribe certain required banking and accounting practices related to alcohol sales and purchasing. Our Taco Cabana restaurants and certain of our Pollo Tropical restaurants are subject to state &#8220;dram-shop&#8221; laws. Dram-shop laws provide a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated or minor patron. We have specific insurance that covers claims arising under dram-shop laws. However, we cannot ensure that this insurance will be adequate to cover any claims that may be instituted against us. 

Employees 

As of January 3, 2016 , we employed approximately 11,550 persons, of which approximately 200 were corporate and administrative personnel and approximately 11,350 were restaurant operations and other supervisory personnel. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that overall relations with our employees are good.
