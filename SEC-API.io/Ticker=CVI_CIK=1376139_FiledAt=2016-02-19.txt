 Item 1. Business 

Overview 

CVR Energy, Inc. and, unless the context otherwise requires, its subsidiaries ("CVR Energy," the "Company," "we," "us," or "our") is a diversified holding company primarily engaged in the petroleum refining and nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing industries through its holdings in CVR Refining, LP ("CVR Refining" or the "Refining Partnership") and CVR Partners, LP ("CVR Partners" or the "Nitrogen Fertilizer Partnership"). The Refining Partnership is an independent petroleum refiner and marketer of high value transportation fuels. The Nitrogen Fertilizer Partnership produces and markets nitrogen fertilizers in the form of UAN and ammonia. We own the general partner and a majority of the common units representing limited partner interests in each of the Refining Partnership and the Nitrogen Fertilizer Partnership. CVR Energy's common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol "CVI," the Refining Partnership's common units are listed on the NYSE under the symbol "CVRR" and the Nitrogen Fertilizer Partnership's common units are listed on the NYSE under the symbol "UAN." 

We operate under two business segments: petroleum (the petroleum and related businesses operated by the Refining Partnership) and nitrogen fertilizer (the nitrogen fertilizer business operated by the Nitrogen Fertilizer Partnership). Throughout the remainder of this document, our business segments are referred to as the "petroleum business" and the "nitrogen fertilizer business," respectively. 

For the fiscal years ended December 31, &#32; 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , we generated consolidated net sales of $5.4 billion , $9.1 billion &#32;and $9.0 billion , respectively, and operating income of $421.6 million , $264.3 million &#32;and $710.5 million , respectively. The petroleum business generated $5.2 billion , $8.8 billion &#32;and $8.7 billion &#32;of net sales and the nitrogen fertilizer business generated $289.2 million , $298.7 million &#32;and $323.7 million &#32;of net sales, in each case, for the years ended December 31, &#32; 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. The petroleum business generated operating income of $361.7 million , $207.2 million &#32;and $603.0 million &#32;and the nitrogen fertilizer business generated operating income of $68.7 million , $82.8 million &#32;and $124.9 million , in each case, for the years ended December 31, &#32; 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. Our consolidated results of operations include certain other unallocated corporate activities and the elimination of intercompany transactions and, therefore, are not a sum of the operating results of the petroleum and nitrogen fertilizer businesses. 

Refer to Item 1, "Petroleum Business" and Item 1, "Nitrogen Fertilizer Business" for further details on our business segments. 

Our History 

The Coffeyville refinery, which began operations in 1906, and the nitrogen fertilizer plant, built in 2000, were operated as components of Farmland Industries, Inc. ("Farmland") until March 3, 2004, the date on which Coffeyville Resources, LLC ("CRLLC") completed the acquisition of these assets through a bankruptcy court auction. 

On June 24, 2005, Coffeyville Acquisition LLC ("CALLC"), which was formed by certain funds affiliated with Goldman, Sachs &#38; Co. and Kelso &#38; Company, L.P. (the "Goldman Sachs Funds" and the "Kelso Funds," respectively), acquired these businesses. CALLC operated our business from June 24, 2005 until CVR Energy's initial public offering in October 2007. 

CVR Energy was formed in September 2006 as a subsidiary of CALLC in order to consummate an initial public offering of its businesses. CVR Energy consummated its initial public offering on October 26, 2007. The Goldman Sachs Funds and the Kelso Funds completely sold their ownership interests by February 2011 and May 2011, respectively. 

On April 13, 2011, the Nitrogen Fertilizer Partnership completed the Nitrogen Fertilizer Partnership IPO. The Nitrogen Fertilizer Partnership sold 22,080,000 &#32;common units at a price of $16.00 &#32;per common unit, resulting in gross proceeds of $353.3 million . The Nitrogen Fertilizer Partnership's common units are listed on the NYSE and are traded under the symbol "UAN." In connection with the Nitrogen Fertilizer Partnership IPO, the Nitrogen Fertilizer Partnership paid approximately $24.7 million &#32;in underwriting fees and incurred approximately $4.4 million &#32;of other offering costs. As a result of the Nitrogen Fertilizer Partnership IPO and through May 27, 2013, CVR Energy indirectly owned approximately 70% of the Nitrogen Fertilizer Partnership's outstanding common units and 100% &#32;of the Nitrogen Fertilizer Partnership's general partner with its non-economic general partner interest. 

On December 15, 2011, CVR Energy acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of WEC. Assets acquired include a 70,000 &#32;bpcd rated capacity refinery in Wynnewood, Oklahoma and approximately 2.0 million &#32;barrels of company-owned storage tanks. 

On April 18, 2012, CVR Energy entered into a Transaction Agreement (the "Transaction Agreement") with an affiliate of Icahn Enterprises L.P. ("IEP"). Pursuant to the Transaction Agreement, IEP's affiliate offered (the "Offer") to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of CVR Energy's common stock for a price of $30.00 &#32;per share in cash, without interest, less any applicable withholding taxes, plus one &#32;non-transferable contingent cash payment ("CCP") right for each share, which represented the contractual right to receive an additional cash payment per share if a definitive agreement for the sale of CVR Energy was executed on or before August 18, 2013 and such transaction closed. As no sale of the Company was executed by the date outlined in the Transaction Agreement, the CCPs expired on August 19, 2013. 

In May 2012, IEP's affiliate acquired a majority of the common stock of CVR Energy through the Offer. As of December 31, 2015 , IEP and its affiliates owned approximately 82% &#32;of CVR Energy&#8217;s outstanding common stock. 

&#160; 

On January 23, 2013, the Refining Partnership completed the Refining Partnership IPO. The Refining Partnership sold 24,000,000 &#32;common units at a price of $25.00 &#32;per unit, resulting in gross proceeds of $600.0 million . Of the common units issued, 4,000,000 &#32;units were purchased by an affiliate of IEP. Additionally, on January 30, 2013, the underwriters closed their option to purchase an additional 3,600,000 &#32;common units at a price of $25.00 &#32;per unit resulting in gross proceeds of $90.0 million . The common units, which are listed on the NYSE, began trading on January 17, 2013 under the symbol "CVRR." In connection with the Refining Partnership IPO, the Refining Partnership paid approximately $32.5 million &#32;in underwriting fees and incurred approximately $3.9 million &#32;of other offering costs. 

Immediately following the Refining Partnership IPO and through May 19, 2013, CVR Energy indirectly owned approximately 81% &#32;of the total Refining Partnership common units and 100% &#32;of the Refining Partnership's general partner, which holds a non-economic general partner interest. Prior to the Refining Partnership IPO, CVR Energy owned 100% &#32;of the Refining Partnership and net income earned during this period was fully attributable to the Company. 

On May 20, 2013, the Refining Partnership completed an underwritten offering (the "Underwritten Offering") by selling 12,000,000 &#32;common units to the public at a price of $30.75 &#32;per unit. American Entertainment Properties Corporation ("AEPC"), an affiliate of IEP, also purchased an additional 2,000,000 &#32;common units at the public offering price in a privately negotiated transaction with a subsidiary of CVR Energy, which was completed on May 29, 2013. In connection with the Underwritten Offering, on June 10, 2013, the Refining Partnership sold an additional 1,209,236 &#32;common units to the public at a price of $30.75 &#32;per unit in connection with a partial exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional common units. The transactions described in this paragraph are collectively referred to as the "Transactions." In connection with the Transactions, the Refining Partnership paid approximately $12.2 million &#32;in underwriting fees and approximately $0.4 million &#32;in offering costs. 

&#160; 

The Refining Partnership utilized net proceeds of approximately $394.0 million &#32;from the Underwritten Offering (including the underwriters' option) to redeem 13,209,236 &#32;common units from CVR Refining Holdings, LLC ("CVR Refining Holdings"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of CVR Energy. The net proceeds to a subsidiary of CVR Energy from the sale of 2,000,000 &#32;common units to AEPC were approximately $61.5 million . The Refining Partnership did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of common units by CVR Energy to AEPC. 

&#160; 

Immediately following the closing of the Transactions and prior to June 30, 2014, public security holders held approximately 29% &#32;of the total Refining Partnership common units (including units owned by affiliates of IEP representing 4% &#32;of total Refining Partnership common units), and CVR Refining Holdings held approximately 71% &#32;of the total Refining Partnership common units.

The net proceeds to CRLLC from the Secondary Offering were approximately $292.6 million , after deducting approximately $9.2 million &#32;in underwriting discounts and commissions. The Nitrogen Fertilizer Partnership did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of common units by CRLLC. In connection with the Secondary Offering, the Nitrogen Fertilizer Partnership incurred approximately $0.5 million &#32;in offering costs. 

Immediately subsequent to the closing of the Secondary Offering and as of December 31, 2015 , public security holders held approximately 47% &#32;of the total Nitrogen Fertilizer Partnership common units, and CRLLC held approximately 53% &#32;of the 

total Nitrogen Fertilizer Partnership common units. In addition, CRLLC owns 100% &#32;of the Nitrogen Fertilizer Partnership&#8217;s general partner, CVR GP, LLC, which only holds a non-economic general partner interest. 

&#160; 

On June 30, 2014, the Refining Partnership completed a second underwritten offering (the "Second Underwritten Offering") by selling 6,500,000 &#32;common units to the public at a price of $26.07 &#32;per unit. The Refining Partnership paid approximately $5.3 million &#32;in underwriting fees and approximately $0.5 million &#32;in offering costs. The Refining Partnership utilized net proceeds of approximately $164.1 million &#32;from the Second Underwritten Offering to redeem 6,500,000 &#32;common units from CVR Refining Holdings. Immediately subsequent to the closing of the Second Underwritten Offering and through July 23, 2014, public security holders held approximately 33% &#32;of the total Refining Partnership common units, and CVR Refining Holdings held approximately 67% &#32;of the total Refining Partnership common units. 

&#160; 

On July 24, 2014, the Refining Partnership sold an additional 589,100 &#32;common units to the public at a price of $26.07 &#32;per unit in connection with the underwriters' exercise of their option to purchase additional common units. The Refining Partnership utilized net proceeds of approximately $14.9 million &#32;from the underwriters' exercise of their option to purchase additional common units to redeem an equal amount of common units from CVR Refining Holdings. Additionally, on July 24, 2014, CVR Refining Holdings sold 385,900 &#32;common units to the public at a price of $26.07 &#32;per unit in connection with the underwriters' exercise of their remaining option to purchase additional common units. CVR Refining Holdings received net proceeds of $9.7 million . 

Immediately subsequent to the closing of the underwriters' option for the Second Underwritten Offering and as of December 31, 2015 , public security holders held approximately 34% &#32;of the total Refining Partnership common units (including units owned by affiliates of IEP, representing 4% &#32;of the total Refining Partnership common units), and CVR Refining Holdings held approximately 66% &#32;of the total Refining Partnership common units, in addition to owning 100% &#32;of the Refining Partnership's general partner. 

On August 9, 2015, CVR Partners entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with Rentech Nitrogen Partners, L.P. ("Rentech Nitrogen") and Rentech Nitrogen GP, LLC ("Rentech Nitrogen GP"), pursuant to which CVR Partners would acquire Rentech Nitrogen and Rentech Nitrogen GP by merging two newly-created direct wholly-owned subsidiaries of CVR Partners with and into those entities with Rentech Nitrogen and Rentech Nitrogen GP continuing as surviving entities and wholly-owned subsidiaries of CVR Partners (together, the "mergers"). Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 1 ("Organization and History of the Company") &#32;of this Report for further discussion of the mergers. 

Organizational Structure and Related Ownership 

The following chart illustrates our organizational structure and the organizational structure of the Refining Partnership and the Nitrogen Fertilizer Partnership as of the date of this Report. 

Petroleum Business 

The petroleum business, operated by the Refining Partnership, includes a complex full coking medium-sour crude oil refinery in Coffeyville, Kansas with a rated capacity of 115,000 &#32;bpcd and a complex crude oil refinery in Wynnewood, Oklahoma with a rated capacity of 70,000 &#32;bpcd capable of processing 20,000 &#32;bpcd of light sour crude oil (within its rated capacity of 70,000 &#32;bpcd). The combined crude capacity represents approximately 22% &#32;of the region's refining capacity. The Coffeyville refinery located in southeast Kansas is approximately 100 &#32;miles from Cushing, Oklahoma, a major crude oil trading and storage hub. The Wynnewood refinery is located approximately 65 &#32;miles south of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and approximately 130 &#32;miles from Cushing, Oklahoma. 

For the year ended December 31, 2015 , the Coffeyville refinery's product yield included gasoline ( 46% ), diesel fuel (primarily ultra-low sulfur diesel) ( 43% ), and pet coke and other refined products such as natural gas liquids ("NGL") (propane and butane), slurry, sulfur and gas oil ( 11% ). The Wynnewood refinery's product yield included gasoline ( 52% ), diesel fuel (primarily ultra-low sulfur diesel) ( 36% ), asphalt ( 5% ), jet fuel ( 4% ) and other products ( 3% ). 

The petroleum business also includes the following auxiliary operating assets: 

&#8226; 

Crude Oil Gathering System. The petroleum business owns and operates a crude oil gathering system serving Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Missouri, Colorado and Texas. The system has field offices in Bartlesville and Pauls Valley, Oklahoma and Plainville, Winfield and Iola, Kansas. The gathering system includes approximately 336 &#32;miles of active owned and leased pipelines and approximately 150 &#32;crude oil transports and associated storage facilities, which allows it to gather crude oils from independent crude oil producers. The crude oil gathering system has a gathering capacity of over 65,000 &#32;bpd. Gathered crude oil provides an attractive and competitive base supply of crude oil for the Coffeyville and Wynnewood refineries. During 2015 , the petroleum business gathered an average of approximately 69,000 &#32;bpd. The petroleum business also has 35,000 bpd of contracted capacity on the Keystone and Spearhead pipelines that allow it to supply price-advantaged Canadian and Bakken crudes to its refineries. It also has contracted capacity on the Pony Express and White Cliffs pipelines, which both became in-service during 2015. Both the Pony Express and White Cliffs pipelines originate in Colorado and extend to Cushing, Oklahoma. 

&#8226; 

Pipelines and Storage Tanks. The petroleum business owns a proprietary pipeline system capable of transporting approximately 170,000 &#32;bpd of crude oil from its Broome Station facility located near Caney, Kansas to its Coffeyville refinery. Crude oils sourced outside of the proprietary gathering system are delivered by common carrier pipelines into various terminals in Cushing, Oklahoma, where they are blended and then delivered to the Broome Station tank farm via a pipeline owned by Plains Pipeline L.P. ("Plains"). The petroleum business owns approximately (i) 1.5 million &#32;barrels of crude oil storage capacity that supports the gathering system and the Coffeyville refinery, (ii) 0.9 million &#32;barrels of crude oil storage capacity at the Wynnewood refinery and (iii) 1.5 million &#32;barrels of crude oil storage capacity in Cushing, Oklahoma. The petroleum business also leases additional crude oil storage capacity of approximately (iv) 2.8 million &#32;barrels in Cushing, (v) 0.2 million &#32;barrels in Duncan, Oklahoma and (vi) 0.1 million &#32;barrels at the Wynnewood refinery. In addition to crude oil storage, the petroleum business owns over 4.5 million &#32;barrels of combined refined products and feedstocks storage capacity. 

&#8226; 

Marketing and Product Supply. The petroleum business also has a rack marketing division supplying product through tanker trucks directly to customers located in close geographic proximity to Coffeyville, Kansas and Wynnewood, Oklahoma and to customers at throughput terminals on Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P. ("Magellan") and NuStar Energy, LP's ("NuStar") refined products distribution systems. 

The refineries' complexity allows the petroleum business to optimize the yields (the percentage of refined product that is produced from crude oil and other feedstocks) of higher value transportation fuels (gasoline and diesel). Complexity is a measure of a refinery's ability to process lower quality crude oil and feedstocks in an economic manner. The two refineries' capacity weighted average complexity is 13.0 . As a result of key investments in its refining assets and the addition of process units to comply with gasoline quality regulations, both of the refinery's complexities have increased. The Coffeyville refinery's complexity score is 13.3 , and the Wynnewood refinery's complexity score is 12.6 . The petroleum business' higher complexity provides it the flexibility to increase its refining margin over comparable refiners with lower complexities. The petroleum business has achieved significant increases in its refinery crude throughput rates over historical levels. As a result of the increasing complexities, the petroleum business is capable of processing a variety of crudes, including WTS, WTI, sweet and sour Canadian, and locally gathered crudes. 

&#160; 

Crude and Feedstock Supply 

The Coffeyville refinery has the capability to process blends of a variety of crude oil ranging from heavy sour to light sweet crude oil. Currently, the Coffeyville refinery crude oil slate consists of a blend of mid-continent domestic grades and various Canadian medium and heavy sours, and it has recently introduced North Dakota Bakken and other similarly sourced crudes into its crude slate. While crude oil has historically constituted over 90% &#32;of the Coffeyville refinery's total throughput over the last five years, other feedstock inputs include normal butane, natural gasoline, alkylation feeds, naphtha, gas oil and vacuum tower bottoms. 

The Wynnewood refinery has the capability to process blends of a variety of crude oil ranging from medium sour to light sweet crude oil, although isobutane, gasoline components, and normal butane are also typically used. Historically most of the Wynnewood refinery's crude oil has been acquired domestically, mainly from Texas and Oklahoma, but it can also access and process various light and medium Canadian grades. 

Crude oil is supplied to the Coffeyville and Wynnewood refineries through the wholly-owned gathering system and by pipeline. The petroleum business has continued to increase the number of barrels of crude oil supplied through its crude oil gathering system in 2015 &#32;and it now has the capacity of supplying over 65,000 &#32;bpd of crude oil to the refineries. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , the gathering system supplied approximately 39% &#32;of both of the Coffeyville and Wynnewood refineries' crude oil demand. Locally produced crude oils are delivered to the refineries at a discount to WTI, and although sometimes slightly heavier and more sour, offer good economics to the refineries. These crude oils are light and sweet enough to allow the refineries to blend higher percentages of lower cost crude oils such as heavy sour Canadian crude oil while maintaining their target medium sour blend with an API gravity of between 28 &#32;and 36 &#32;degrees and between 0.9% &#32;and 1.2% &#32;sulfur. Crude oils sourced outside of the proprietary gathering system are delivered to Cushing, Oklahoma by various pipelines including the Keystone and Spearhead pipelines, and subsequently to the Broome Station facility via the Plains pipeline. In May 2015 and November 2015, the petroleum business' contracted capacity included the Pony Express and White Cliffs pipelines, respectively. From the Broome Station facility, crude oil is delivered to the Coffeyville refinery via the petroleum business' 170,000 &#32;bpd proprietary pipeline system. Crude oils are delivered to the Wynnewood refinery by three separate pipelines, and received into storage tanks at terminals located on or near the refinery. 

For the year ended December 31, 2015 , the Coffeyville refinery's crude oil supply blend was comprised of approximately 85.4% &#32;light sweet crude oil, 12.8% &#32;heavy sour crude oil and 1.8% &#32;light/medium sour crude oil. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , the Wynnewood refinery's crude oil supply blend was comprised of approximately 99.5% &#32;light sweet crude oil and 0.5% &#32;light/medium sour crude oil. The light sweet crude oil supply blend includes its locally gathered crude oil. 

The Coffeyville refinery is connected to the mid-continent natural gas liquids commercial hub of Conway, Kansas by the inbound Enterprise Pipeline Blue Line. Natural gas liquids feedstock supplies such as butanes and natural gasoline are sourced and delivered directly into the refinery. In addition, Coffeyville's proximity to Conway provides access to the natural gas liquid and liquid petroleum gas fractionation and storage capabilities as well as the commercial markets available at Conway. 

Crude Oil Supply Agreement 

On August 31, 2012, Coffeyville Resources Refining and Marketing, LLC ("CRRM") and Vitol Inc. ("Vitol") entered into an Amended and Restated Crude Oil Supply Agreement (as amended, the "Vitol Agreement"). Under the Vitol Agreement, Vitol supplies the petroleum business with crude oil and intermediation logistics, which helps the petroleum business to reduce its inventory position and mitigate crude oil pricing risk. The Vitol Agreement will automatically renew for successive one -year terms (each such term, a "Renewal Term") unless either party provides the other with notice of nonrenewal at least 180 days prior to expiration of any Renewal Term. The Vitol Agreement currently extends through December 31, 2016. 

&#160; 

Marketing and Distribution 

The petroleum business focuses its Coffeyville petroleum product marketing efforts in the central mid-continent area, because of its relative proximity to the refinery and pipeline access. Coffeyville also has access to the Rocky Mountain area. Coffeyville engages in rack marketing, which is the supply of product through tanker trucks directly to customers located in close geographic proximity to the refinery and to customers at throughput terminals on the refined products distribution systems of Magellan and NuStar. Coffeyville also makes bulk sales (sales into third-party pipelines) into the mid-continent markets and other destinations utilizing the product pipeline networks owned by Magellan, Enterprise and NuStar. The outbound Enterprise Pipeline Red Line provides Coffeyville with access to the NuStar Refined Products Pipeline system. This allows gasoline and ULSD product sales from Kansas up into North Dakota. 

The Wynnewood refinery ships its finished product via pipeline, railcar, and truck. It focuses its efforts in the southern portion of the Magellan system which covers all of Oklahoma, parts of Arkansas as well as eastern Missouri, and all other Magellan terminals. The pipeline system is also able to flow in the opposite direction, providing access to Texas markets as well as some adjoining states with pipeline connections. Wynnewood also sells jet fuel to the U.S. Department of Defense via its segregated truck rack and can offer asphalts, solvents and other specialty products via both truck and rail. 

Customers 

Customers for the refined petroleum products primarily include retailers, railroads, and farm cooperatives and other refiners/marketers in Group 3 of the PADD II region because of their relative proximity to the refineries and pipeline access. The petroleum business sells bulk products to long-standing customers at spot market prices based on a Group 3 basis differential to prices quoted on the New York Mercantile Exchange ("NYMEX"), which are reported by industry market-related indices such as Platts and Oil Price Information Service. 

The petroleum business also has a rack marketing business supplying product through tanker trucks directly to customers located in proximity to the Coffeyville and Wynnewood refineries, as well as to customers located at throughput terminals on refined products distribution systems run by Magellan and NuStar. Rack sales are at posted prices that are influenced by competitor pricing and Group 3 spot market differentials. Additionally, the Wynnewood refinery supplies jet fuel to the U.S. Department of Defense. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , the two largest customers accounted for approximately 14% &#32;and 9% &#32;of the petroleum business net sales and approximately 53% &#32;of the petroleum business net sales were made to its ten largest customers. 

Competition 

The petroleum business competes primarily on the basis of price, reliability of supply, availability of multiple grades of products and location. The principal competitive factors affecting its refining operations are cost of crude oil and other feedstock costs, refinery complexity, refinery efficiency, refinery product mix and product distribution and transportation costs. The location of the refineries provides the petroleum business with a reliable supply of crude oil and a transportation cost advantage over its competitors. The petroleum business primarily competes against five refineries operated in the mid-continent region. In addition to these refineries, the refineries compete against trading companies, as well as other refineries located outside the region that are linked to the mid-continent market through an extensive product pipeline system. These competitors include refineries located near the Gulf Coast and the Texas panhandle region. The petroleum business refinery competition also includes branded, integrated and independent oil refining companies, such as Phillips 66, HollyFrontier, CHS, Valero and Flint Hills Resources. 

Seasonality 

The petroleum business experiences seasonal effects as demand for gasoline products is generally higher during the summer months than during the winter months due to seasonal increases in highway traffic and road construction work. Demand for diesel fuel is higher during the planting and harvesting seasons. As a result, the petroleum business' results of operations for the first and fourth calendar quarters are generally lower compared to its results for the second and third calendar quarters. In addition, unseasonably cool weather in the summer months and/or unseasonably warm weather in the winter months in the markets in which the petroleum business sells its petroleum products can impact the demand for gasoline and diesel fuel. The demand for asphalt is also seasonal and is generally higher during the months of March through October. 

Nitrogen Fertilizer Business 

The nitrogen fertilizer business, operated by the Nitrogen Fertilizer Partnership, is the only nitrogen fertilizer plant in North America that utilizes a pet coke gasification process to produce nitrogen fertilizer products, which are used primarily by farmers to improve the yield and quality of their crops. The nitrogen fertilizer facility includes a 1,300 &#32;ton-per-day ammonia unit, a 3,000 &#32;ton-per-day UAN unit and a gasifier complex having a capacity of 89 million &#32;standard cubic feet per day of hydrogen. The nitrogen fertilizer business' principal products are UAN and ammonia. These products are manufactured at its facility in Coffeyville, Kansas. The nitrogen fertilizer business' product sales are heavily weighted toward UAN and all of its products are sold on a wholesale basis. 

Raw Material Supply 

The nitrogen fertilizer facility's primary input is pet coke. In contrast, substantially all of the nitrogen fertilizer business' competitors use natural gas as their primary raw material feedstock. Historically, pet coke has been less expensive than natural gas on a per ton of fertilizer produced basis. The nitrogen fertilizer facility's pet coke gasification process results in a significantly higher percentage of fixed costs than a natural gas-based fertilizer plant. 

During the past five years, over 70% &#32;of the nitrogen fertilizer business' pet coke requirements on average were supplied by CVR Refining's adjacent crude oil refinery pursuant to a renewable long-term agreement. Historically the nitrogen fertilizer business has obtained the remainder of its pet coke requirements from third parties such as other Midwestern refineries or pet coke brokers at spot-prices. The Nitrogen Fertilizer Partnership is party to a pet coke supply agreement with HollyFrontier Corporation. The term of this agreement expires in December 2016. If necessary, the gasification process can be modified to operate on coal as an alternative, which provides an additional raw material source. There are significant supplies of coal within a 60-mile radius of the nitrogen fertilizer plant. 

Linde LLC ("Linde") owns, operates, and maintains the air separation plant that provides contract volumes of oxygen, nitrogen, and compressed dry air to the facility for a monthly fee. The nitrogen fertilizer business provides and pays for all utilities required for operation of the air separation plant. The agreement with Linde expires in 2020. 

Although the nitrogen fertilizer plant has its own boiler that is used to create start-up steam, it also has the ability to import start-up steam for the nitrogen fertilizer plant from the adjacent Coffeyville crude oil refinery and then export steam back to the crude oil refinery once all units in the nitrogen fertilizer plant are in service. Monthly charges and credits are recorded with the steam valued at the natural gas price for the month. 

Nitrogen Production Process 

The nitrogen fertilizer plant was built in 2000 with two separate gasifiers to provide redundancy and reliability. The plant uses a gasification process to convert pet coke to high purity hydrogen for subsequent conversion to ammonia. The nitrogen fertilizer plant is capable of producing approximately 1,300 &#32;tons per day of ammonia. Substantially all of the ammonia produced is converted to approximately 3,000 &#32;tons per day of UAN, which has historically commanded a premium price over ammonia. Typically, approximately 0.41 &#32;tons of ammonia is required to produce one ton of UAN. The nitrogen fertilizer business completed a significant two-year plant expansion in February 2013, which increased UAN production capacity by 400,000 &#32;tons or approximately 50% , per year. The expanded facility was operating at full rates at the end of the first quarter of 2013. In 2015 , the nitrogen fertilizer business produced 928,600 tons of UAN and 385,400 tons of ammonia. Approximately 96% &#32;of the produced ammonia tons and the majority of the purchased ammonia were upgraded into UAN. 

The nitrogen fertilizer business schedules and provides routine maintenance to its critical equipment using its own maintenance technicians. Pursuant to a Technical Services Agreement with an affiliate of the General Electric Company ("General Electric"), which licenses the gasification technology to the nitrogen fertilizer business, General Electric provides technical advice and technological updates from their ongoing research as well as other licensees' operating experiences. The pet coke gasification process is licensed from General Electric pursuant to a perpetual license agreement that is fully paid. The license grants the nitrogen fertilizer business perpetual rights to use the pet coke gasification process on specified terms and conditions. 

Distribution, Sales and Marketing 

The primary geographic markets for the nitrogen fertilizer business' fertilizer products are Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Colorado and Texas. The nitrogen fertilizer business markets the UAN products to agricultural customers and the ammonia products to industrial and agricultural customers. 

UAN and ammonia are distributed by truck or by railcar. If delivered by truck, products are sold on a freight-on-board basis, and freight is normally arranged by the customer. The nitrogen fertilizer business leases and owns a fleet of railcars for use in product delivery. The nitrogen fertilizer business incurs costs to maintain and repair its railcar fleet that include expenses related to regulatory inspections and repairs. For example, many of the nitrogen fertilizer business' railcars require specific regulatory inspections and repairs due on ten-year intervals. The extent and frequency of railcar fleet maintenance and repair costs are generally expected to change based partially on when regulatory inspections and repairs are due for its railcars under the relevant regulations. The nitrogen fertilizer business operates eight rail loading and two truck loading racks for UAN. It also operates four rail loading and two truck loading racks for ammonia. 

The nitrogen fertilizer business owns all of the truck and rail loading equipment at the nitrogen fertilizer facility. The nitrogen fertilizer business also utilizes two separate UAN storage tanks and related truck and railcar load-out facilities. Each of these facilities, located in Phillipsburg and Dartmouth, Kansas, has a UAN storage tank that has a capacity of two million gallons, or approximately 10,000 tons. The Phillipsburg property that the terminal was constructed on is owned by a subsidiary of CVR Refining, which operates the terminal. The Dartmouth terminal is located on leased property owned by the Pawnee County Cooperative Association, which operates the terminal. The purpose of the UAN terminals is to collectively distribute approximately 40,000 &#32;tons of UAN fertilizer annually. 

The nitrogen fertilizer business markets agricultural products to destinations that produce strong margins. The UAN market is primarily located near the Union Pacific Railroad lines or destinations that can be supplied by truck. The ammonia market is primarily located near the Burlington Northern Santa Fe or Kansas City Southern Railroad lines or destinations that can be supplied by truck. 

The nitrogen fertilizer business often uses forward sales of fertilizer products to optimize its asset utilization, planning process and production scheduling. These sales are made by offering customers the opportunity to purchase product on a forward basis at prices and delivery dates that it proposes. The nitrogen fertilizer business uses this program to varying degrees during the year and between years depending on market conditions and has the flexibility to increase or decrease forward sales depending on management's view as to whether price environments will be increasing or decreasing. Fixing the selling prices of nitrogen fertilizer products months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers typically causes the nitrogen fertilizer business reported selling prices and margins to differ from spot market prices and margins available at the time of shipment. Cash received as a result of prepayments is recognized as deferred revenue on the Consolidated Balance Sheet upon receipt, and revenue and resultant net income and EBITDA are recorded as the product is delivered to the customer. 

Customers 

The nitrogen fertilizer business sells UAN products to retailers and distributors. In addition, it sells ammonia to agricultural and industrial customers. Some of its larger customers include Crop Production Services, Inc., Gavilon Fertilizer, LLC, Interchem, J.R. Simplot, Inc., MFA and United Suppliers, Inc. Given the nature of its business, and consistent with industry practice, the nitrogen fertilizer business does not have long-term minimum purchase contracts with its UAN and ammonia customers. 

For the year ended December 31, 2015 , the top five customers in the aggregate represented 39% &#32;of the nitrogen fertilizer business' net sales. The nitrogen fertilizer business' top two customers on a consolidated basis accounted for approximately 14% &#32;and 10% , respectively, of the nitrogen fertilizer business' net sales. 

Competition 

Competition in the nitrogen fertilizer industry is dominated by price considerations. However, during the spring and fall application seasons, farming activities intensify and delivery capacity is a significant competitive factor. The nitrogen fertilizer business maintains a large fleet of leased and owned railcars and seasonally adjusts inventory to enhance its manufacturing and distribution operations. 

The nitrogen fertilizer business' major competitors include Agrium, Inc.; Koch Nitrogen Company, LLC; Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan, Inc.; CF Industries Holdings, Inc. and Terra Nitrogen Company, LP. Domestic competition is intense due to customers' sophisticated buying tendencies and competitor strategies that focus on cost and service. The nitrogen fertilizer business also encounters competition from producers of fertilizer products manufactured in foreign countries. In certain cases, foreign producers of fertilizer who export to the United States may be subsidized by their respective governments. 

Based on third-party expert data regarding total United States demand for UAN and ammonia, we estimate that the nitrogen fertilizer plant's UAN capacity in 2015 &#32;represented approximately 7% &#32;of total U.S. UAN demand and that the net ammonia produced and marketed at its facility represented less than 1% &#32;of total U.S. ammonia demand. 

Seasonality 

Because the nitrogen fertilizer business primarily sells agricultural commodity products, its business is exposed to seasonal fluctuations in demand for nitrogen fertilizer products in the agricultural industry. As a result, the nitrogen fertilizer business typically generates greater net sales in the first half of each calendar year, which is referred to as the planting season, and its net sales tend to be lower during the second half of each calendar year, which is referred to as the fill season. 

Environmental Matters 

The petroleum and nitrogen fertilizer businesses are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state and local, environmental and health and safety laws and regulations governing the emission and release of hazardous substances into the environment, the treatment and discharge of waste water, the storage, handling, use and transportation of petroleum and nitrogen products, and the characteristics and composition of gasoline and diesel fuels. These laws and regulations, their underlying regulatory requirements and the enforcement thereof impact the petroleum business and operations and the nitrogen fertilizer business and operations by imposing: 

&#8226; 

restrictions on operations or the need to install enhanced or additional controls; 

&#8226; 

the need to obtain and comply with permits, licenses and authorizations; 

&#8226; 

requirements for the investigation and remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater at current and former facilities (if any) and liability for off-site waste disposal locations; and 

&#8226; 

specifications for the products marketed by the petroleum business and the nitrogen fertilizer business, primarily gasoline, diesel fuel, UAN and ammonia. 

Our operations require numerous permits, licenses and authorizations. Failure to comply with these permits or environmental laws and regulations could result in fines, penalties or other sanctions or a revocation of our permits. In addition, the laws and regulations to which we are subject are often evolving and many of them have become more stringent or have become subject to more stringent interpretation or enforcement by federal or state agencies. The ultimate impact on our business of complying with evolving laws and regulations is not always clearly known or determinable due in part to the fact that our operations may change over time and certain implementing regulations for laws, such as the federal Clean Air Act, have not yet been finalized, are under governmental or judicial review or are being revised. These laws and regulations could result in increased capital, operating and compliance costs. 

The principal environmental risks associated with our businesses are outlined below with additional details included in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors and Part II, Item 8, Note 13 ("Commitments and Contingencies") &#32;of this Report. 

The Federal Clean Air Act 

The federal Clean Air Act and its implementing regulations, as well as the corresponding state laws and regulations that regulate emissions of pollutants into the air, affect the petroleum business and the nitrogen fertilizer business both directly and indirectly. Direct impacts may occur through the federal Clean Air Act's permitting requirements and/or emission control requirements relating to specific air pollutants, as well as the requirement to maintain a risk management program to help prevent accidental releases of certain regulated substances. The federal Clean Air Act indirectly affects the petroleum business and the nitrogen fertilizer business by extensively regulating the air emissions of sulfur dioxide ("SO 2 "), volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxides and other substances, including those emitted by mobile sources, which are direct or indirect users of our products. 

Some or all of the standards promulgated pursuant to the federal Clean Air Act, or any future promulgations of standards, may require the installation of controls or changes to the petroleum business or the nitrogen fertilizer facilities in order to comply. If new controls or changes to operations are needed, the costs could be material. These new requirements, other requirements of the federal Clean Air Act, or other presently existing or future environmental regulations could cause us to expend substantial amounts to comply and/or permit our facilities to produce products that meet applicable requirements. 

The regulation of air emissions under the federal Clean Air Act requires that we obtain various construction and operating permits and incur capital expenditures for the installation of certain air pollution control devices at the petroleum and nitrogen fertilizer operations when regulations change or we add new equipment or modify existing equipment. Various regulations specific to our operations have been implemented, such as National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants ("NESHAP"), New Source Performance Standards ("NSPS") and New Source Review/Prevention of Significant Deterioration ("PSD"). We have incurred, and expect to continue to have to make, substantial capital expenditures to attain or maintain compliance with these and other air emission regulations that have been promulgated or may be promulgated or revised in the future. 

On September 12, 2012, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA") published in the Federal Register final revisions to its NSPS for process heaters and flares at petroleum refineries. The EPA originally issued final standards in June 2008, but the portions of the rule relating to process heaters and flares were stayed pending reconsideration of certain provisions. The final standards regulate emissions of nitrogen oxide from process heaters and emissions of SO 2 &#32;from flares, as well as require certain work practice and monitoring standards for flares. We do not believe that the costs of complying with the rule will be material. 

On August 14, 2012, the EPA sent both the Wynnewood and Coffeyville refineries letters regarding the EPA's 2012 enforcement alert entitled EPA Enforcement Targets Flaring Efficiency Violations &#32;signaling the agency's intention to begin a national enforcement program to conduct compliance evaluations and take enforcement actions against petroleum refining companies that operate flares that are not in compliance with standards articulated in the Enforcement Alert. The Enforcement Alert identified new standards that refiners are required to meet for flaring combustion efficiency. The EPA entered into consent decrees with several refining companies. Because the EPA has not specifically told us that our operations are not in compliance, we cannot say with certainty whether or when we may become an enforcement target under this initiative. 

Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 13 ("Commitments and Contingencies") &#32;of this Report for further discussion of recent environmental matters related to the Clean Air Act including the "Flood, Crude Oil Discharge and Insurance" and certain "Environmental, Health and Safety ("EHS") Matters," such as the "Coffeyville Second Consent Decree," "Wynnewood Clean Air Act Compliance" and other compliance evaluations. 

The Coffeyville refinery's Clean Air Act Title V operating permit has expired, and has not yet been re-issued. The Coffeyville refinery timely submitted an application for renewal, and therefore is authorized under the regulations to operate under the current permit until the permit is re-issued. The permit renewal process has begun, and capital costs or expenses, if any, related to changes to these permits are not known yet, but are not expected to be material. 

The Federal Clean Water Act 

The federal Clean Water Act ("CWA") and its implementing regulations, as well as the corresponding state laws and regulations that regulate the discharge of pollutants into the water, affect the petroleum business and the nitrogen fertilizer business. Direct impacts occur through the CWA's permitting requirements, which establish discharge limitations based on technology standards, water quality standards, and restrictions on the total maximum daily load of pollutants that may be released to a particular water body based on its use. In addition, water resources are becoming and in the future may become scarcer, and many refiners, including CRRM and Wynnewood Refining Company, LLC ("WRC"), are subject to restrictions on their ability to use water in the event of low availability conditions. Both CRRM and WRC have contracts in place to receive additional water during low-flow conditions, but these conditions could change over time if water becomes scarce. 

The Wynnewood refinery's CWA permit ("OPDES permit") has expired. The refinery timely submitted their renewal application, and therefore is authorized to continue discharging under the expired permit until the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality ("ODEQ") re-issues the permit. The permit renewal process has begun, and capital costs or expenses related to changes to this permit, if any, are not expected to be material. 

Release Reporting 

The release of hazardous substances or extremely hazardous substances into the environment is subject to release reporting requirements under federal and state environmental laws. Our facilities periodically experience releases of hazardous substances and extremely hazardous substances. For example, the nitrogen fertilizer facility periodically experiences minor releases of hazardous and extremely hazardous substances from its equipment. Our facilities periodically have excess emission events from flaring and other planned and unplanned start-up, shutdown and malfunction events. Such releases are reported to the EPA and relevant state and local agencies. From time to time, the EPA has conducted inspections and issued information requests to us with respect to our compliance with release reporting requirements under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA") and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act. If we fail to timely or properly report a release, or if the release violates the law or our permits, it could cause us to become the subject of a governmental enforcement action or third-party claims. Government enforcement or third-party claims relating to releases of hazardous or extremely hazardous substances could result in significant expenditures and liability. 

Fuel Regulations 

Tier 2, Low Sulfur Fuels. In February 2000, the EPA promulgated the Tier 2 Motor Vehicle Emission Standards Final Rule for all passenger vehicles, establishing standards for sulfur content in gasoline that were required to be met by 2006. In addition, in January 2001, the EPA promulgated its on-road diesel regulations, which required a 97% &#32;reduction in the sulfur content of diesel fuel sold for highway use by June 1, 2006, with full compliance by January 1, 2010. The refineries are in compliance with the EPA's low sulfur gasoline and diesel fuel standards. 

Tier 3. In April 2014, the EPA promulgated the Tier 3 Motor Vehicle Emission and Fuel Standards, which will require that gasoline contain no more than ten parts per million of sulfur on an annual average basis. Refineries must be in compliance with the more stringent emission standards by January 1, 2017; however, compliance with the rule is extended until January 1, 2020 for approved small volume refineries and small refiners. In March 2015, the EPA approved the Wynnewood refinery's application requesting "small volume refinery" status; therefore, it's compliance deadline is January 1, 2020. It is not anticipated that the refineries will require additional controls or capital expenditures to meet the anticipated new standard. 

&#160; 

Mobile Source Air Toxic II Emissions 

In 2007, the EPA promulgated the Mobile Source Air Toxic II ("MSAT II") rule that requires the reduction of benzene in gasoline by 2011. The MSAT II projects for CRRM and WRC were completed within the compliance deadline of November 1, 2014. The projects were completed at a total cost of approximately $48.3 million &#32;and $89.0 million , excluding capitalized interest, by CRRM and WRC, respectively. 

Renewable Fuel Standards 

Refer to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, If sufficient RINs are unavailable for purchase, if the petroleum business has to pay a significantly higher price for RINs or if the petroleum business is otherwise unable to meet the EPA's Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS) mandates, the petroleum business' financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected , and Part II, Item 8, Note 13 ("Commitments and Contingencies") , "Environmental, Health and Safety ("EHS") Matters" of this Report for further discussion of the "Renewable Fuel Standards." 

&#160; 

Greenhouse Gas Emissions 

Refer to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, Climate change laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, of this Report for further discussion of the Greenhouse Gas ("GHG") Emissions regulations. 

RCRA 

Our operations are subject to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA") requirements for the generation, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. When feasible, RCRA-regulated materials are recycled instead of being disposed of on-site or off-site. RCRA establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes. Besides governing current waste disposal practices, RCRA also addresses the environmental effects of certain past waste disposal practices, the recycling of wastes and the regulation of underground storage tanks containing regulated substances. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 13 ("Commitments and Contingencies") , "Environmental, Health and Safety ("EHS") Matters" for further discussion of "RCRA Compliance Matters." 

&#160; 

Waste Management. There are two closed hazardous waste units at the Coffeyville refinery and eight other hazardous waste units in the process of being closed pending state agency approval. There is one closed hazardous waste unit and one active hazardous waste storage tank at the Wynnewood refinery. In addition, one closed interim status hazardous waste land farm located at the now-closed Phillipsburg terminal is under long-term post closure care. 

Impacts of Past Manufacturing. The 2004 Consent Decree that CRRM signed with the EPA and the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (the "KDHE") required us to assume two RCRA corrective action orders issued to Farmland, the prior owner of the Coffeyville refinery. We are subject to a 1994 EPA administrative order related to investigation of possible past releases of hazardous materials to the environment at the Coffeyville refinery. In accordance with the order, we have documented existing soil and groundwater conditions, which require investigation or remediation projects. The now-closed Phillipsburg terminal is subject to a 1996 EPA administrative order related to investigation of releases of hazardous materials to the environment at the Phillipsburg terminal, which operated as a refinery until 1991. Remediation at both sites, if necessary, will be based on the results of the investigations. The Wynnewood refinery operates under a RCRA permit. A RCRA facility 

investigation has been completed in accordance with the terms of the permit. Based on the facility investigation and other available information, ODEQ and WRC have entered into a Consent Order requiring further investigations of groundwater conditions and enhancements of existing remediation systems. Additional remediation, if necessary, will be based upon the results of the further investigation. 

The anticipated investigation and remediation costs through 2019 &#32;were estimated, as of December 31, 2015 , to be as follows:

These estimates are based on current information and could increase or decrease as additional information becomes available through our ongoing remediation and investigation activities. At this point, we have estimated that, over ten years starting in 2016 , we will spend approximately $7.3 million &#32;to remedy impacts from past manufacturing activity at the Coffeyville refinery and to address existing soil and groundwater contamination at the now-closed Phillipsburg terminal and at the Wynnewood refinery. It is possible that additional costs will be required after this ten year period. We spent approximately $2.1 million &#32;in 2015 &#32;associated with related remediation. 

Financial Assurance. We are required under the 2004 Consent Decree to establish financial assurance to secure the projected clean-up costs posed by the Coffeyville and the now-closed Phillipsburg facilities in the event we fail to fulfill our clean-up obligations. In accordance with the 2004 Consent Decree as modified by a 2010 agreement between CRRM, Coffeyville Resources Terminal, LLC, the EPA and the KDHE, this financial assurance is currently provided by a bond in the amount of $4.3 million &#32;for clean-up obligations at the Phillipsburg terminal and a letter of credit in the amount of $0.2 million &#32;for estimated costs to close regulated hazardous waste management units at the Coffeyville refinery. Additional self-funded financial assurance of approximately $4.9 million &#32;and $2.4 million &#32;is required by our post-closure care obligations and the 2004 Consent Decree for clean-up costs at the Coffeyville refinery and Phillipsburg terminal, respectively. The $4.3 million &#32;bond amount is reduced each year based on actual expenditures for corrective actions and the letter of credit and the self-funded mechanisms are re-evaluated and adjusted on an annual basis. Current RCRA financial assurance requirements for the Wynnewood refinery total $0.2 million &#32;for hazardous waste storage tank closure and post-closure monitoring of a closed storm water retention pond. 

Environmental Remediation 

Under the CERCLA, RCRA, and related state laws, certain persons may be liable for the release or threatened release of hazardous substances. These persons include the current owner or operator of property where a release or threatened release occurred, any persons who owned or operated the property when the release occurred, and any persons who disposed of, or arranged for the transportation or disposal of, hazardous substances at a contaminated property. Liability under CERCLA is strict, and under certain circumstances, joint and several, so that any responsible party may be held liable for the entire cost of investigating and remediating the release of hazardous substances. Similarly, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 generally subjects owners and operators of facilities to strict, joint and several liability for all containment and clean-up costs, natural resource damages, and potential governmental oversight costs arising from oil spills into the waters of the United States, which has been broadly interpreted to include most water bodies including intermittent streams. 

As is the case with all companies engaged in similar industries, we face potential exposure from future claims and lawsuits involving environmental matters, including soil and water contamination, personal injury or property damage allegedly caused by crude oil or hazardous substances that we manufactured, handled, used, stored, transported, spilled, disposed of or released. We cannot assure you that we will not become involved in future proceedings related to our release of hazardous or extremely hazardous substances or crude oil or that, if we were held responsible for damages in any existing or future proceedings, such costs would be covered by insurance or would not be material. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 13 ("Commitments and Contingencies") , "Flood, Crude Oil Discharge and Insurance" of this Report for discussion of the environmental remediation associated with the discharge of crude oil on July 1, 2007 at the Coffeyville refinery. 

Environmental Insurance 

We are covered by a site pollution legal liability insurance policy with an aggregate limit of $50.0 million &#32;per pollution condition, subject to a self-insured retention of $1.0 million . The policy includes business interruption coverage, subject to a 5 -day waiting period deductible. This insurance expires on March 1, 2016 and is expected to be renewed without any material changes in terms. The policy insures any location owned, leased or rented or operated by the Company, including the Coffeyville refinery, the Wynnewood refinery and the nitrogen fertilizer facility. The policy insures certain pollution conditions at or migrating from a covered location, certain waste transportation and disposal activities and business interruption. 

In addition to the site pollution legal liability insurance policy, we maintain umbrella and excess casualty insurance policies having an aggregate and occurrence limit of $200.0 million , subject to a self-insured retention of $2.0 million . This insurance provides coverage due to named perils for claims involving pollutants where the discharge is sudden and accidental and first commenced at a specific day and time during the policy period. The casualty insurance policies, including umbrella and excess policies, expire on March 1, 2016 and are expected to be renewed or replaced by insurance policies containing materially equivalent sudden and accidental pollution coverage with no reduction in limits. 

The site pollution legal liability policy and the pollution coverage provided in the casualty insurance policies contain discovery requirements, reporting requirements, exclusions, definitions, conditions and limitations that could apply to a particular pollution claim, and there can be no assurance such claim will be adequately insured for all potential damages. 

Safety, Health and Security Matters 

We are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations related to safety, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act ("OSHA") and comparable state statutes, the purpose of which are to protect the health and safety of workers. We also are subject to OSHA Process Safety Management regulations, which are designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals. 

&#160; 

We operate a comprehensive safety, health and security program, with participation by employees at all levels of the organization. We have developed comprehensive safety programs aimed at preventing OSHA recordable incidents. Despite our efforts to achieve excellence in our safety and health performance, there can be no assurances that there will not be accidents resulting in injuries or even fatalities. We routinely audit our programs and consider improvements in our management systems. 

The Wynnewood refinery has been the subject of a number of OSHA inspections since 2006. As a result of these inspections, the Wynnewood refinery has entered into four OSHA settlement agreements in 2008, pursuant to which it has agreed to undertake certain studies, conduct abatement activities, and revise and enhance certain OSHA compliance programs. The remaining costs associated with implementing these studies, abatement activities and program revisions are not expected to exceed $1.0 million . 

Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 13 ("Commitments and Contingencies") , "Wynnewood Refinery Incident" of this Report for further discussion of OSHA matters related to the Wynnewood refinery boiler explosion. 

Process Safety Management. We maintain a process safety management ("PSM") program. This program is designed to address all aspects of the OSHA guidelines for developing and maintaining a comprehensive PSM program. We will continue to audit our programs and consider improvements in our management systems as well as our operations. 

Emergency Planning and Response. We have an emergency response plan that describes the organization, responsibilities and plans for responding to emergencies in our facilities. This plan is communicated to local regulatory and community groups. We have on-site warning siren systems and personal radios. We will continue to audit our programs and consider improvements in our management systems and equipment. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , 968 &#32;employees were employed by the petroleum business, 149 &#32;employees were employed by the nitrogen fertilizer business and 215 &#32;employees were employed by the Company at our offices in Sugar Land, Texas and Kansas City, Kansas. As of December 31, 2015 , these employees are covered by health insurance, disability and retirement plans established by the Company. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good. 

As of December 31, 2015 , the Coffeyville refinery employed 610 &#32;of the petroleum business' employees, about 54% &#32;of whom were covered by a collective bargaining agreement. These employees are affiliated with five unions of the Metal Trades Department of the AFL-CIO ("Metal Trade Unions") and the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union, AFL-CIO-CLC ("United Steelworkers"). The petroleum business is a party to a collective bargaining agreement with the Metal Trade Unions covering union members who work directly at the Coffeyville refinery. The agreement expires in March 2019. In addition, a collective bargaining agreement with the United Steelworkers, which covers the balance of the petroleum business' unionized employees who work in crude transportation, expires in March 2017 and automatically renews on an annual basis thereafter unless a written notice is received sixty days in advance of the relevant expiration date. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015 , the Wynnewood refinery employed 317 &#32;of the petroleum business' employees, about 59% &#32;of whom were represented by the International Union of Operating Engineers. The collective bargaining agreement with the International Union of Operating Engineers with respect to the Wynnewood refinery expires in June 2017.
