History 

Lear was founded in Detroit in 1917 as American Metal Products, a manufacturer of seating assemblies and other components for the automotive and aircraft industries, and was incorporated in Delaware in 1987. Through a management-led buyout in 1988, Lear Corporation established itself as a privately-held seat assembly operation for the North American automobile market with annual sales of approximately $900 million. We completed an initial public offering in 1994 and developed into a global supplier through organic growth and a series of acquisitions. 

In May 1999, we acquired UT Automotive, Inc. ("UT Automotive") for a purchase price of approximately $2.3 billion from United Technologies Corporation. UT Automotive was a leading supplier of automotive electrical distribution systems. The acquisition of UT Automotive represented our entry into automotive electrical and electronic systems and was the basis for our current electrical segment. In addition to electrical distribution systems, UT Automotive produced a broad portfolio of automotive interior products, which were subsequently included in the transfer of substantially all of the assets of our interior business to International Automotive Components Group in October 2006 (European assets) and March 2007 (North American assets). 

We have subsequently augmented our internal growth plans with selective acquisitions to expand our component capabilities and global footprint, as well as expand our technology portfolio. In May 2012, we acquired Guilford Mills, a leading supplier of automotive seat and interior fabric, from Cerberus Capital Management, L.P., for approximately $243 million. In January 2015, we acquired Everett Smith Group, Ltd., the parent company of Eagle Ottawa, LLC ("Eagle Ottawa"), the world's leading provider of leather for the automotive industry, for approximately $844 million. In August 2015, we acquired intellectual property and technology from Autonet Mobile, a developer of wireless communication software and devices for automotive applications. In November 2015, we completed the acquisition of Arada Systems Inc., an automotive technology company that specializes in vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure ("V2X") communications.

Key trends that have been specifically affecting our business include automotive manufacturers&#8217; utilization of global vehicle platforms, a shift among many automotive manufacturers away from integrated systems to directed component sourcing, increasing demand for luxury and performance features and content and China&#8217;s emergence as the single largest major automotive market in the world with above average long-term growth expectations. 

Our strategy is built on addressing these trends and the major imperatives for success as an automotive supplier: quality, cost and efficiency and innovation and technology. We have expanded key component and software capabilities through organic investment and acquisitions to ensure a full complement of the highest quality solutions for our customers. We have restructured, and continue to align, our manufacturing and engineering footprint to attain a leading competitive position globally. We have established or expanded activities in new and growing markets, especially China, in support of our customers&#8217; growth and global platform initiatives. These initiatives have helped us achieve our financial goals overall, as well as a more balanced regional, customer and vehicle segment diversification in our business. 

In addition, three major mega-trends have broadly emerged as major drivers of change and growth in the automotive industry: connectivity, safety and efficiency. These mega-trends have become widely accepted and also are attracting new, non-traditional entrants to the automotive industry that are leveraging technology, vehicle electrification and consumer relationships to exploit growth opportunities in the industry. Regulation is also a major influence with these mega-trends, as government mandates (e.g., for vehicles to meet or be equipped with minimum fuel economy and emissions standards or certain safety-related 

components) are driving vehicle design and technology plans. We believe that the following mega-trends are likely to be at the forefront of our industry for the foreseeable future with each of these trends converging long-term toward a vision of fully-autonomous driving: 

&#8226; 

Connectivity &#32;&#8212; Customer and consumer demand to have constant communication and information exchange. This trend began with consumer demand to extend and integrate their mobile connectivity into the vehicle by connecting mobile devices with vehicle infotainment systems. Connectivity requirements will continue to grow as we believe that vehicles will increasingly have direct communication with cellular networks, satellites and other vehicles in the grid to enable more advanced safety and fuel efficiency functionality. Vehicles are effectively becoming smart devices on wheels as the automobile is increasingly becoming a platform connected to various types of communication networks. We expect these trends to continue, making the vehicle a constantly connected device, receiving and transmitting data through a variety of signals, which communicate directly with the on-board vehicle network. 

&#8226; 

Safety &#32;&#8212; Customer and consumer demand for safety features and systems that protect vehicle occupants when a crash occurs, and also, with an increasing prevalence, for advanced driver assistance systems that proactively respond to driving situations to reduce the likelihood or severity of a crash. 

&#8226; 

Efficiency &#32;&#8212; Customer and consumer demand for more energy efficient vehicles that meet increasingly strict fuel economy and emission standards and reduce the environmental impact of automobiles. This requires further use of electronically controlled powertrains and related components to improve fuel efficiency, adoption of alternative energy powertrains, such as hybrid, electric and other powertrain technologies that facilitate high power electrification of the vehicle, and use of lighter weight materials throughout the car. 

We are well positioned for growth capitalizing on these mega-trends as we supply high value systems and components that drive critical functionality and core elements of the vehicle&#8217;s architecture and design. The systems and components that we design, develop and manufacture facilitate connectivity of various vehicle systems, impact a vehicle&#8217;s safety and crashworthiness and support more fuel efficient alternative powertrains. Many of our systems and components also directly impact the consumer, providing us with the opportunity to offer our automotive customers technology, solutions and designs that will differentiate their vehicles in the consumer marketplace. 

We are well positioned to directly participate in the connectivity mega-trend as we design, develop and supply systems and components that connect the various electrical and electronic systems within the vehicle into integrated on-board power and data communication networks. We further have the technology and expertise to wirelessly and securely connect these on-board vehicle networks and systems with external networks over various standards and protocols. This expertise allows us to offer our automotive customers electronic modules, such as connected gateway modules, that offer functionality such as over-the-air software updates or cellular communication of vehicle performance data to the automotive manufacturers, their dealers or the vehicle owners. Further, our expertise in dedicated short range communications (&#8220;DSRC&#8221;) technology allows us to provide modules and software that facilitate direct, high speed communication between vehicles and roadside infrastructures. 

Furthermore, a seat is an active part of the vehicle safety system. As a result of our innovative product design and technology capabilities, we are able to provide seats with enhanced safety features, such as the active head restraint and seat structures that withstand collision impact well in excess of what is demanded by regulatory agencies. We have developed products and materials to reduce cost and enhance seat design and packaging flexibility, including our mini recliners and micro adjust tracks. Another way in which we are well-positioned to benefit from this mega-trend related growth is our belief that the seat system will become increasingly more sophisticated, dynamic and connected to both the occupants and the vehicle. The seat is the logical focal point for monitoring the driver and passenger and for facilitating feedback between the vehicle and the occupants. Most recently, the addition of DSRC and other V2X capabilities positions us to provide high speed communication between vehicles, even in extreme weather conditions, potentially reducing crashes through real time advisories alerting drivers to imminent hazards in the roadway ahead, including other vehicles on a potential path for collision. 

Continued growth in more fuel efficient, complex and electronically controlled powertrains is helping to drive growth in the vehicle's electrical distribution system. The emergence and continued development of alternative energy powertrains, including electric, hybrid electric and other technologies, is driving growth in high power electrical systems and components. Hybrid and electric vehicles incorporate both high power and low power components. As a result, they offer a significant incremental content opportunity for us. These trends all support continued growth in electrical and electronic content on the vehicle, as well as associated software. This content growth will require far more complex vehicle electrical architectures. Our significant experience designing and manufacturing highly integrated and standardized architectures that optimize size, performance and quality leaves us well positioned to take advantage of the growth in electrical content and the increasingly complex architectures. 

We believe that the potential long-term convergence of these mega-trends and eventual wide-spread adoption of autonomous vehicles will benefit both our seating and electrical segments. We believe that autonomous vehicles will likely have seat designs and requirements that are far more flexible and demanding in both autonomous and piloted driving states and the transitions between the two. Further, more active monitoring of the driver and the driver&#8217;s position and physical state will likely be required. We also believe that autonomous vehicles will not only need to be fully connected and networked to maximize their safety and efficiency, they will have much higher levels of power consumption to support the array of sensors and processing power required to operate such vehicles.

The electrical segment consists of the design, development, engineering, manufacture, assembly and supply of electrical distribution systems, electronic modules and related components and software for light vehicles globally. We are a leader in managing power and distributing signals within the vehicle for traditional vehicle architectures, as well as high power and hybrid electric systems. We have added connectivity software and hardware capabilities that facilitate secure, wireless communication between the vehicle&#8217;s electrical and electronic architecture and external networks, as well as other vehicles. 

Electrical Distribution Systems 

Electrical distribution systems are networks of wiring and associated components that route and manage electrical power and electronic signals within a vehicle. Our product offerings allow us to provide the complete electrical distribution system of the vehicle and span four primary product areas: wire harnesses, terminals and connectors, junction boxes and advanced efficiency systems. 

Wire harness assemblies are a collection of wiring and terminals and connectors that link all of the various electrical and electronic devices within the vehicle to each other and/or to a power source. Wire harness assemblies are a collection of individual circuits fabricated from raw and insulated wire, which is automatically cut to length and terminated during the manufacturing process. Individual circuits are assembled together on a jig or table, inserted into connectors and wrapped or taped to form wire harness assemblies. The assembly process is labor intensive, and as a result, production is generally performed in low-cost labor sites in Mexico, Honduras, Eastern Europe, Africa, China, the Philippines, Brazil and Thailand. 

Terminals and connectors include conductive metal components and connector housings that join wire harness assemblies together at their respective end points or connect devices to wire harness assemblies. Terminals and connectors can vary significantly in size and complexity depending on the amount of power or data being transferred and the number of connections being made at any particular point in the electrical distribution system. Terminals and connectors are currently manufactured in Germany, China, Eastern Europe and the United States. 

Junction boxes are centrally located modules within the vehicle that contain fuses and/or relays for circuit and device protection and serve as a connection point for multiple wire harnesses. Junction boxes are manufactured in Mexico, Northern Africa, Europe, China and the Philippines with a proprietary, capital-intensive assembly process using printed circuit boards, a portion of which are purchased from third-party suppliers. Certain materials, particularly certain specialized electronic components, are available from a limited number of suppliers. Proprietary features have been developed to improve the function of these junction boxes in harsh environments, including extreme temperatures and humidity. 

Our advanced efficiency systems group is dedicated to the development of high power and hybrid electrical systems and components, including wiring, terminals and connectors and power electronics. We have products and technologies that enable the varying degrees of powertrain electrification being employed by automotive manufacturers today from mild hybrid vehicles to full electric vehicles. Our products include on-board charging systems, charge cord sets, high voltage electrical distribution systems and battery monitoring technology.

In our electrical segment, we also design, develop, engineer and manufacture electronics, which control various functions within the vehicle, as well as develop and integrate the associated software for these electronic modules. Our electronic modules include body control modules, smart junction boxes, gateway modules, wireless control modules, lighting control modules and audio amplifiers. Our engineering and development activities for electronics are in Southfield, Michigan, Santa Rosa, California, Spain, Germany, China and India. We assemble these modules using high-speed surface mount placement equipment in Mexico, China, the Philippines, Morocco, Spain and Germany. 

Body control modules primarily control vehicle interior functions outside of the vehicle&#8217;s head unit or infotainment system. Depending on the vehicle&#8217;s electrical and electronic architecture, these modules can be either highly integrated, consolidating multiple functional controls into a single module, or focus on a specific function, such as seat position and comfort controls or the door zone control module which controls features such as window lift, door lock and power mirrors. As electronic control modules become increasingly centralized and integrated, we developed "smart junction boxes," which are junction boxes augmented with integrated electronic functionality that otherwise would be contained in other body control modules. The integration of functionality in our smart junction boxes eliminates interconnections, increases overall system reliability and can consolidate the number of electronic modules within the vehicle. This can lead to reduced cost and complexity. We believe that our expertise in consolidating functional controls into integrated modules and integrating these modules into the vehicle&#8217;s electrical and electronic architecture is a competitive strength. 

We develop and produce gateway modules, which facilitate secure access to, and communication with, all of the vehicle systems at a central point and translate various signals to facilitate data exchange across vehicle domains. This gateway becomes increasingly important as formerly distinct vehicle systems increasingly must work in concert with one another. We also offer wireless functionality in both integrated and stand-alone modules, which send and receive signals using radio frequency technology. Our wireless systems include passive entry systems, remote keyless entry and dual range/dual function remote keyless entry systems. We are building on both our core gateway and wireless capabilities as we add and develop higher levels of data and signal connectivity in and out of the vehicle. 

Our electronics product offerings also include lighting control modules, which provide the electronic control logic and diagnostics for increasingly advanced and complex vehicle lighting systems. We supply LED lighting control systems for vehicle interiors and exteriors. The audio segment includes premium audio amplifiers and complete vehicle sound system development capabilities with advanced audio tuning. 

The higher level of complexity and processing power in these electronic control modules is driving rapid increases in software requirements associated with these modules. Accordingly, we continue to build on our knowledge and capabilities in software in order to design and develop more complex and integrated electronic control modules capable of more efficiently managing the distribution of power and data signals through the vehicle. 

Connectivity 

We are building connectivity capabilities that facilitate secure, wireless communication between the vehicle&#8217;s systems and external networks, as well as other vehicles. Our connectivity strategy is based on leveraging our expertise in vehicle electrical and electronic architecture design and development, electronic module functional integration, gateway module data exchange and core wireless signals. We are building capabilities organically through internal investment and through acquisition and partnership. In August 2015, we acquired intellectual property and technology from Autonet Mobile, a Santa Rosa, California- based developer of software and devices for automotive applications. This transaction added technology that directly connects on-board vehicle systems with cloud-based applications using proprietary, secure data exchange capabilities via cellular networks. In November 2015, we acquired Arada Systems Inc., a Troy, Michigan-based automotive technology company that specializes in V2X communications. This transaction added V2X software and hardware solutions utilizing expertise in 5.9 

GHz DSRC and other wireless communications protocols, notably GPS satellite communications. Arada has developed software solutions to permit highly secure V2X communications and defend against cyber-security attacks. 

These acquisitions, combined with our vehicle electrical and electronic architecture expertise and products, will allow us to offer our customers embedded modules and software that facilitate direct and secure connectivity between the vehicle and external networks. Products that we can offer will include connected gateway modules with an array of features including over-the-air software update capabilities, embedded cellular communication modules, e-Call modules that automatically contact emergency services in the event of a crash and both on-board and roadside DSRC units that facilitate V2X communications.

Competition 

We estimate the global target market for our electrical business to be approximately $70 billion. Our major competitors in electrical distribution systems include Delphi Automotive PLC, Leoni AG, Molex Incorporated (a subsidiary of Koch Industries Inc.), Sumitomo Corporation, TE Connectivity and Yazaki Corporation. Our major competitors in electronic modules, including connectivity solutions, include Continental AG, Delphi Automotive PLC, Denso Corporation and Robert Bosch GmbH. 

Technology 

The electrical segment is technology driven and typically requires higher investment as a percentage of sales than our seating segment. Our complete electrical distribution system design capabilities, coupled with certain market-leading component technologies, allow access to our customers&#8217; development teams, which provides an early indication of our customers&#8217; product needs and enables us to develop system design efficiencies. Our ability to design and integrate electronic modules creates a competitive advantage as we support customers with complete electrical architecture development. Our expertise is developed and delivered by over 2,000 engineers across fourteen countries and is led by four global technology centers of excellence in China, Germany, Spain and the United States for each of our major product lines in this segment, which are described below. 

In electrical distribution systems, our technology includes expertise in the design and use of alternative conductor materials, such as aluminum, copper-clad steel and other hybrid alloys. Alternative conductor materials can enable the use of ultra small gauge conductors, which reduce the weight and packaging size of electrical distribution systems. We were the first to implement copper-clad steel cabling in series production. We also have developed proprietary manufacturing process technologies, such as our vertical manufacturing system that features three dimensional wire harness assembly boards. Our expertise in terminals and connectors technology facilitates our ability to implement these small gauge and alternative alloy conductors. We have developed advanced capabilities in aluminum terminals and aluminum wire termination, ultra small gauge termination, and high voltage terminals and connectors. We have developed high packaging density in-line connectors and new small gauge terminals that will enable wire gauge reduction and provide our customers with smaller and lower cost solutions. Our high voltage terminals and connectors are a part of our advanced efficiency systems capabilities, and we have established a leading capability in power density (power per packaging size) that is being adopted by multiple automakers. Our advanced efficiency systems and components for high voltage vehicle applications have achieved industry leading efficiency, packaging and reliability. We have nearly 600 patents and patents pending in advanced efficiency systems. 

In electronics, we are a market leader in smart junction box technology and will begin production of our Automotive News PACE Award winning Solid State Smart Junction Box&#8482; in 2016. We continue to refine our smart junction box technology, including the development of aluminum printed circuit boards. We have developed body control modules with dual core microprocessors that allow body control and gateway functionality in a single module. We are a leader in gateway module technology and have capabilities to enable our gateway and other electronic control modules to efficiently and securely manage the increasing amount of both wired and wireless signals running throughout, as well as within and outside of, the vehicle. We also have developed wireless products, such as lower-cost passive entry systems with improved security using ultra wide band technology and that feature our 2-way remote keyless entry systems that enable the vehicle to provide feedback to the consumer, such as verification that the doors have locked or that the engine has started. In lighting, we have developed advanced technology electronic controls in this area, including a Matrix LED Control System capable of individually dimming and switching on/off up to 100 LEDs. This system enables steerable light beams and other advanced lighting features and can be paired with driver assistance system sensors for functionality, such as automatic high beam management and obstacle highlighting. In audio, we have developed an ethernet / AVB amplifier that facilitates faster processing of digital data at a lower cost. 

Software remains a critical element of our electrical business. Software capabilities are becoming more important in the management of complex and highly sophisticated electrical architectures. Software within the vehicle is rapidly growing as a key element of technological innovation and a cost effective way to provide new features and functions. We currently employ over 500 software engineers globally and are pursuing expansion of specialized capabilities in vehicle networking, encryption, cyber-security and connectivity protocols. With our acquisition of technology from Autonet Mobile and the purchase of Arada Systems Inc., we have further expanded our software development capabilities with particular expertise in wireless communication software. 

For additional factors that may impact our electrical segment&#8217;s business, financial condition, operating results and/or cash flows, see Item 1A, "Risk Factors." 

Customers 

In 2015, Ford and General Motors, two of the largest automotive and light truck manufacturers in the world, accounted for 23% and 20% of our net sales, respectively. In addition, BMW accounted for approximately 10% of our net sales. We supply and have expertise in all vehicle segments of the automotive market. Our sales content tends to be higher on those vehicle platforms and segments which offer more features and functionality. The popularity of particular vehicle platforms and segments varies over time and by regional market. We expect to continue to win new business and grow sales at a greater rate than overall automotive industry production. For further information related to our customers and domestic and foreign sales and operations, see Note 12 , " Segment Reporting ," to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report. 

Our customers award business to their suppliers in a number of ways, including the award of complete systems, which allows suppliers either to manufacture components internally or to purchase components from other suppliers at their discretion. Certain of our customers also elect to award certain components directly to component suppliers and independent of the award of the complete system. We have been selectively expanding our component capabilities and investing in manufacturing capacity in low-cost regions in order to maximize our participation in such component sourcing. 

Our customers typically award contracts several years before actual production is scheduled to begin. Each year, the automotive manufacturers introduce new models, update existing models and discontinue certain models and, recently, even complete brands. In this process, we may be selected as the supplier on a new model, we may continue as the supplier on an updated model or we may lose a new or updated model to a competitor. Our sales backlog reflects anticipated net sales from formally awarded new programs, less lost and discontinued programs. We measure our sales backlog based on contracts to be executed in the next three years. This measure includes the sales backlog at Eagle Ottawa and excludes the sales backlog at our non-consolidated joint ventures. As of January 2016, our 2016 to 2018 sales backlog is $2.0 billion, consistent with our 2015 to 2017 sales backlog as of January 2015. Our current sales backlog reflects $0.8 billion related to 2016 and 75% and 25% related to seating and electrical, respectively. Our current sales backlog assumes volumes based on the independent industry projections of IHS Automotive as of December 2015 and a Euro exchange rate of $1.10 / Euro. This sales backlog is generally subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including vehicle production volumes on new and replacement programs and foreign exchange rates, as well as the timing of production launches and changes in customer development plans. For additional information regarding risks that may affect our sales backlog, see Item 1A, "Risk Factors," and Part II &#8212; Item 7, "Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Forward-Looking Statements." 

We receive purchase orders from our customers that generally provide for the supply of a customer&#8217;s annual requirements for a particular vehicle model and assembly plant, or in some cases, for the supply of a customer&#8217;s requirements for the life of a 

particular vehicle model, rather than for the purchase of a specified quantity of products. Although most purchase orders may be terminated by our customers at any time, such terminations have been minimal and have not had a material impact on our operating results. We are subject to risks that an automotive manufacturer will produce fewer units of a vehicle model than anticipated or that an automotive manufacturer will not award us a replacement program following the life of a vehicle model. To reduce our reliance on any one vehicle model, we produce automotive systems and components for a broad cross-section of both new and established models. However, larger cars and light trucks, as well as vehicle platforms that offer more features and functionality, such as luxury, sport utility and crossover vehicles, typically have more content and, therefore, tend to have a more significant impact on our operating performance. Our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015, consisted of 13% compact, 47% mid-size, 22% full-size/luxury and 18% full frame and were comprised of 50% cars and 50% light trucks. 

Our agreements with our major customers generally provide for an annual productivity price reduction. Historically, cost reductions through product design changes, increased manufacturing productivity and similar programs with our suppliers have generally offset these customer-imposed price reduction requirements. However, raw material, energy and commodity costs can be volatile. Although we have developed and implemented strategies to mitigate the impact of higher raw material, energy and commodity costs, these strategies, together with commercial negotiations with our customers and suppliers, typically offset only a portion of the adverse impact. Certain of these strategies also may limit our opportunities in a declining commodity environment. In addition, we are exposed to increasing market risk associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange as a result of our low-cost footprint and vertical integration strategies. We use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. For additional information regarding our foreign exchange and commodity price risk, see Part II &#8212; Item 7, "Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Liquidity and Financial Condition &#8212; Foreign Exchange" and "&#8212; Commodity Prices." 

Seasonality 

Our principal operations are directly related to the automotive industry. Consequently, we may experience seasonal fluctuations to the extent automotive vehicle production slows, such as in the summer months when many customer plants close for model year changeovers, in December when many customer plants close for the holidays and during periods of high vehicle inventory. See Note 14 , " Quarterly Financial Data ," to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report. 

Raw Materials 

The principal raw materials used in our seat systems, electrical distribution systems and electronics are generally available and obtained from multiple suppliers under various types of supply agreements. Components, such as fabric, foam, leather, seat structures and mechanisms, terminals and connectors and certain other components are either manufactured by us internally or purchased from multiple suppliers under various types of supply agreements. The majority of the steel used in our products is comprised of fabricated components that are integrated into a seat system, such as seat frames, recliner mechanisms, seat tracks and other mechanical components. Therefore, our exposure to changes in steel prices is primarily indirect, through these purchased components. With the exception of certain terminals and connectors, the materials that we use to manufacture wire harness assemblies are substantially purchased from suppliers, including extruded and insulated wire and cable. The majority of our copper purchases are comprised of extruded wire and cable that we integrate into electrical wire harnesses and are generally subject to price index agreements with our customers. We utilize a combination of short-term and long-term supply contracts to purchase key components. We generally retain the right to terminate these agreements if our supplier does not remain competitive in terms of cost, quality, delivery, technology or customer support.

A substantial number of our employees are members of unions or national trade organizations. We have collective bargaining agreements with several North American unions, including the United Auto Workers, Unifor, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and Workers United. Each of our unionized facilities in the United States and Canada has a separate 

collective bargaining agreement with the union that represents the workers at such facility, with each such agreement having an expiration date that is independent of the other agreements. The majority of our employees in Mexico and Europe are members of industrial trade union organizations or confederations within their respective countries. Many of these organizations and confederations operate under national contracts, which are not specific to any one employer. We have occasionally experienced labor disputes at our plants. We have been able to resolve all such labor disputes and believe our relations with our employees are generally good. 

See Item 1A, "Risk Factors &#8212; A significant labor dispute involving us or one or more of our customers or suppliers or that could otherwise affect our operations could adversely affect our financial performance," and Part II &#8212; Item 7, "Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Forward-Looking Statements." 

Intellectual Property 

Worldwide, we have approximately 2,000 patents and patent applications pending. While we believe that our patent portfolio is a valuable asset, no individual patent or group of patents is critical to the success of our business. We also license selected technologies to automotive manufacturers and to other automotive suppliers. We continually strive to identify and implement new technologies for use in the design and development of our products. 

Advanced technology development is conducted worldwide at our six advanced technology centers and at our product engineering centers. At these centers, we engineer our products to comply with applicable safety standards, meet quality and durability standards, respond to environmental conditions and conform to customer and consumer requirements. Our global innovation and technology center located in Southfield, Michigan, develops and integrates new concepts and is our central location for consumer research, benchmarking, craftsmanship and industrial design activity. 

We have numerous registered trademarks in the United States and in many foreign countries. The most important of these marks include LEAR CORPORATION &#174; &#32;(including our stylized version thereof) and LEAR &#174; , which are widely used in connection with our products and services. Our other principal brands include GUILFORD TM &#32;and EAGLE OTTAWA &#174; . AVENTINO &#174; &#32;leather, LEAR CONNEXUS TM &#32;signal and data communications, PROACTIVE POSTURE TM &#32;seating, ProTec &#174; &#32;active head restraints, SMART JUNCTION BOX TM &#32;technology, STRUCSURE TM &#32;systems and TeXstyle TM &#32;fabrics are some of the other trademarks used in connection with certain of our product lines. 

We will continue to dedicate resources to engineering and development. Engineering and development costs incurred in connection with the development of new products and manufacturing methods within one year of launch, to the extent not recoverable from our customers, are charged to cost of sales as incurred. Such costs are charged to selling, general and administrative expenses when incurred more than one year prior to launch. Engineering and development costs charged to selling, general and administrative expenses totaled approximately $127 million , $102 million &#32;and $108 million &#32;for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. Engineering and development costs for which reimbursement is contractually guaranteed by our customers are capitalized. Engineering and development costs capitalized totaled approximately $194 million , $232 million &#32;and $202 million &#32;for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. 

Environmental Matters 

We are subject to local, state, federal and foreign laws, regulations and ordinances which govern activities or operations that may have adverse environmental effects and which impose liability for clean-up costs resulting from past spills, disposals or other releases of hazardous wastes and environmental compliance. For a description of our outstanding environmental matters and other legal proceedings, see Note 11 , " Commitments and Contingencies ," to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report. 

In addition, our customers are subject to significant environmentally focused state, federal and foreign laws and regulations that regulate vehicle emissions, fuel economy and other matters related to the environmental impact of vehicles. To the extent that such laws and regulations ultimately increase or decrease automotive vehicle production, such laws and regulations would likely impact our business. See Item 1A, "Risk Factors." 

Furthermore, we currently offer products with environmentally friendly features, and our expertise and capabilities are allowing us to expand our product offerings in this area. We will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area. 

Joint Ventures and Noncontrolling Interests 

We form joint ventures in order to gain entry into new markets, expand our product offerings and broaden our customer base. In particular, we believe that certain joint ventures have provided us, and will continue to provide us, with the opportunity to expand our business relationships with Asian automotive manufacturers, particularly in emerging markets. We also partner with companies having significant local experience in commerce, customs and capacity to reduce our financial risk and enhance our potential for achieving expected financial returns. In some cases, these joint ventures may be located in North America or Europe and used to expand our customer relationships. 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had 24 operating joint ventures located in seven countries. Of these joint ventures, eight are consolidated and sixteen are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Sixteen of the joint ventures operate in Asia, seven operate in North America (including one that is dedicated to serving Asian automotive manufacturers) and one operates in Europe. Net sales of our consolidated joint ventures accounted for approximately 12% of our net sales in 2015 . As of December 31, 2015 , our investments in non-consolidated joint ventures totaled $157 million . 

A summary of our non-consolidated operating joint ventures, including ownership percentages, is shown below.
