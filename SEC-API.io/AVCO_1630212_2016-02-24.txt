 Item 1. Business. 

&#160; 

We were incorporated in the State of Delaware on July 28, 2014 and are a development stage company. Our Company's business plan involves the development of a software solution that will connect via Bluetooth or similar technology (our &#34;Back Office Software&#34;) to a Tablet or iPad that is connected to the cash register at a wide variety of retail outlets (our &#34;Vendors&#34;). Our plan is to market and sell Vendors licenses for our Back Office Software to Vendors based upon a Vendor yearly service package. The Back Office Software will run on a standard Tablet, connected via Bluetooth, cable, or other technology to the Vendor&#8217;s computerized cash register. Vendors will have the option for using other devices such as an iPad or laptop. 

&#160; 

In standard operation, after the cash register tallies the total purchase for each client, the receipt is saved to the network where it can be accessed at any time. For our solution, the Vendor will configure the cash register to save the receipt to the Tablet (or other device, as detailed above). The receipt will automatically be saved in a file with a configurable name to include such elements as the time and date, name of the store, etc. The Back Office Software running on the Tablet will archive the receipt. It will also transfer it to the application running on the end user&#8217;s iPhone or similar device (&#34;SmartPhone&#34;. The transfer will be accomplished by Bluetooth or through use of a cable connection. Once the receipt is transferred to the purchaser&#8217;s Smartphone, in a non-editable format such as an image or protected PDF format, it will be logged into the Front Office. The end user can configure the Front Office application to store receipts by month, location or other customizable settings. Each receipt will be saved under a unique file name which will should include the date and time stamp. One of the main benefits of this solution will be the elimination of a paper receipt. Once the receipt has been transferred to the purchaser electronically, there is no need to print the receipt at the store and it is less likely that the receipt will be misplaced. The Front Office application, located on the purchaser&#8217;s Smartphone, will have an interface for the end-user that will enable them to sort, view, delete or email receipts that have been saved to their iPhone. In this way, the end-user should be able to print the receipt if necessary, but avoid printing and save paper, if the receipt is only used for reference purposes. 

&#160; 

To promote the solution, initially planned for iOS operating systems running on iPhone and iPad devices, the Company will create a website from which Vendors can purchase the Back Office and from which users can download the Front Office application, which we believe will be offered at no cost. The company will generate income via a yearly service charge to Vendors and advertisements that appear while the application is in use.

While the Company's operations will be based in Israel, we anticipate that our Back Office Solutions can and will be marketed globally. The Company also expects to build a website which will serve as both a base for marketing as well as offers of customer service. The website, which has not been designed yet, should include a Knowledge Base with articles detailing use and benefits of the application and may include a Partner Portal to allow Vendors to sign up and get additional technical support regarding setup and configuration of the Back Office application required to communicate between the store&#8217;s computer cash register and the tablet hosting the back office application. The company plans to work with an outside development team and web developer to create the guidelines for an initial design, or prototype, of the full solution, including the Back and Front Office parts of the solution, and then license the idea to a third party for development, global marketing, and management. At this time, we do not anticipate any hardware-related requirements other than a standard device such as a laptop or tablet that will connect via USB to the Vendor&#8217;s cash register, and the end-user&#8217;s personal Smartphone, currently planned for iOS systems running on iPhone devices. 

&#160; 

It is likely that we will have to engage marketing and social media experts to determine the best way to promote the application, the website, and the brand of our offering. In later stages of the development of the product, development teams may be needed to assess the feasibility of also developing this solution for Android-based devices such as standard Tablets and Smartphones. We will also need to hire user interface experts to optimize the graphic user interface of both the Back Office Software and the Front Office application seen by iPhone and iPad users. 

&#160; 

In addition to application-specific advertising on the website and within the end-user application, we plan to monetize the site through several means including topic-based advertisement; local, national, global and corporate sponsors, and more. While the base service will be free to end-users, additional for-pay services may be added both on the site and for the Vendors. Cloud-based service accounts can be offered to end-users to enable them to store their records in a place that can then be accessed by their other devices and computers simply by logging into the repository and accessing a secure, password-protected account. Our third party licensing partner will need to define the terms of this service in terms of cost, length of time the service is offered, etc.. A full set of for-pay end-user benefits will need to be discussed with the development agency we hire. Some of the initially planned features may need to be shifted to later development cycles. Certain features of the proposed services for both Vendor and end-users may not be developed without proper funding.
