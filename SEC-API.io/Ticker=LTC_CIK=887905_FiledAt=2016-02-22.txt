 Item 1. BUSINESS 

General 

LTC Properties, Inc., a health care real estate investment trust (or REIT), was incorporated on May 12, 1992 in the State of Maryland and commenced operations on August 25, 1992. We invest primarily in senior housing and health care properties through acquisitions, development, mortgage loans and other investments. We conduct and manage our business as one operating segment, rather than multiple operating segments, for internal reporting and internal decision making purposes. Our primary objectives are to create, sustain and enhance stockholder equity value and provide current income for distribution to stockholders through real estate investments in senior housing and health care properties managed by experienced operators. Our primary senior housing and health care property types include skilled nursing centers (or SNF), assisted living communities (or ALF), independent living communities (or ILF), memory care communities (or MC) and combinations thereof. To meet these objectives, we attempt to invest in properties that provide opportunity for additional value and current returns to our stockholders and diversify our investment portfolio by geographic location, operator, property type and form of investment. 

Skilled nursing facilities provide restorative, rehabilitative and nursing care for people not requiring the more extensive and sophisticated treatment available at acute care hospitals. Many skilled nursing facilities provide ancillary services that include occupational, speech, physical, respiratory and IV therapies, as well as sub &#8209;acute care services which are paid either by the patient, the patient&#8217;s family, private health insurance, or through the federal Medicare or state Medicaid programs. 

Assisted living facilities serve elderly persons who require assistance with activities of daily living, but do not require the constant supervision skilled nursing facilities provide. Services are usually available 24 hours a day and include personal supervision and assistance with eating, bathing, grooming and administering medication. The facilities provide a combination of housing, supportive services, personalized assistance and health care designed to respond to individual needs. 

Independent living facilities, also known as retirement communities or senior apartments, offer a sense of community and numerous levels of service, such as laundry, housekeeping, dining options/meal plans, exercise and wellness programs, transportation, social, cultural and recreational activities, on &#8209; site security and emergency response programs. Many offer on &#8209;site conveniences like beauty/barber shops, fitness facilities, game rooms, libraries and activity centers. 

Memory care facilities offer specialized options for seniors with Alzheimer&#8217;s disease and other forms of dementia. Purpose built, free &#8209;standing memory care facilities offer an attractive alternative for private &#8209;pay residents affected by memory loss in comparison to other accommodations that typically have been provided within a secured unit of an assisted living or skilled nursing facility. These facilities offer dedicated care and specialized programming for various conditions relating to memory loss in a secured environment that is typically smaller in scale and more residential in nature than traditional assisted living facilities. Residents require a higher level of care and more assistance with activities of daily living than in assisted living facilities. Therefore, these facilities have staff available 24 hours a day to respond to the unique needs of their residents. 

We were organized to qualify, and intend to continue to qualify, as a REIT. So long as we qualify, with limited exceptions, we may deduct distributions, both preferred dividends and common dividends, to our stockholders from our taxable income. We have made distributions, and intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders, in order to eliminate any federal tax liability. 

Portfolio 

Our real estate investment in senior housing and health care properties is managed and conducted as a single operating segment for internal reporting and for internal decision &#8209;making purposes.

&#160;

Owned properties are leased pursuant to non &#8209;cancelable operating leases generally with an initial term of 10 to 15 years. Many of the leases contain renewal options. The leases provide for fixed minimum base rent during the initial and renewal periods. The majority of our leases contain provisions for specified annual increases over the rents of the prior year and that increase is generally computed in one of four ways depending on specific provisions of each lease: 

(i) 

a specified percentage increase over the prior year&#8217;s rent, generally between 2.0% and 3.0%; 

(ii) 

a calculation based on the Consumer Price Index; 

(iii) 

as a percentage of facility revenues in excess of base amounts or 

(iv) 

specific dollar increases. 

Each lease is a triple net lease which requires the lessee to pay all taxes, insurance, maintenance and repairs, capital and non &#8209;capital expenditures and other costs necessary in the operations of the facilities. Generally our leases provide for one or more of the following: security deposits, property tax impounds, and credit enhancements such as corporate or personal guarantees or letters of credit. In addition, our leases are typically structured as master leases and multiple master leases with one operator are generally cross defaulted. The following table summarizes our top ten operators of owned properties for 2015 and percentage of rental revenue for those operators for 2015 and 2014:

Includes a parcel of land secured under a short-term mortgage loan. 

In general, the mortgage loans may not be prepaid except in the event of the sale of the collateral property to a third party that is not affiliated with the borrower, although partial prepayments (including the prepayment premium) are often permitted where a mortgage loan is secured by more than one property upon a sale of one or more, but not all, of the collateral properties to a third party which is not an affiliate of the borrower. The terms of the mortgage loans generally impose a premium upon prepayment of the loans depending upon the period in which the prepayment occurs, 

&#160;

whether such prepayment was permitted or required, and certain other conditions such as upon the sale of the property under a pre &#8209;existing purchase option, destruction or condemnation, or other circumstances as approved by us. On certain loans, such prepayment amount is based upon a percentage of the then outstanding balance of the loan, usually declining ratably each year. For other loans, the prepayment premium is based on a yield maintenance formula. A mortgage loan secured by 15 skilled nursing centers in Michigan had a one &#8209;time option between November 2015 and October 2025 to prepay up to 50% of the then outstanding loan balance without penalty. However, during the year ended December 31, 2015, the borrower forfeited the prepayment option in conjunction with a modification of the loan in exchange for our commitment of $20.0 million to fund the redevelopment of two of the properties securing the loan. In addition to a lien on the mortgaged property, the loans are generally secured by certain non &#8209;real estate assets of the properties and contain certain other security provisions in the form of letters of credit, pledged collateral accounts, security deposits, cross &#8209; default and cross &#8209;collateralization features and certain guarantees. See Item 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;Note 5. Real Estate Investments for further description. 

Investment and Other Policies 

Objectives and Policies. Our investment policy is to invest primarily in income &#8209;producing senior housing and health care properties. Over the past three years 2013 through 2015, we acquired skilled nursing, assisted living, independent living, memory care properties and combinations thereof, plus a behavioral health care hospital and 15 parcels of land for a total of approximately $249.3 million. Also over the past three years, we completed the development, re-development and expansion of nine assisted living communities and three skilled nursing centers for an aggregate investment of $102.1 million, excluding acquisition of parcels of land and we invested approximately $205.9 million in mortgage loans. We believe our liquidity and various sources of available capital are sufficient to fund operations and development commitments, meet debt service obligations (both principal and interest), make dividend distributions and finance future investments should we determine such future investments are financially feasible. The timing, source and amount of cash flows provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to the capital markets environment, especially to changes in interest rates. We continuously evaluate the availability of cost &#8209;effective capital and believe we have sufficient liquidity for additional capital investments in 2016. 

Our primary marketing and business development strategy is to increase awareness of our presence and build long term relationships in the seniors housing and care industry by supporting targeted industry trade organizations, attending industry specific conferences and events patronized by seniors housing and care providers, and seeking out speaking engagements at industry related events as well as interviews in industry publications. We believe this targeted marketing and business development effort has increased deal flow and continues to provide opportunities for new investments in 2016. Since competition from investors as well as other capital providers for large transactions consisting of fully-marketed, multi-property portfolios generally result in valuations above our targeted investment criteria, our marketing and business development efforts focus on sourcing relationships with regionally based operating companies to execute on single property transactions (for acquisition, mortgage financing or development), or smaller multi-property portfolios that are not broadly marketed by third-party intermediaries which complement our historic investment execution and are priced at yields that are accretive to our stockholders. 

Historically our investments have consisted of: 

&#183; 

fee ownership of seniors housing and skilled nursing properties that are leased to providers; 

&#183; 

mortgage loans secured by seniors housing and skilled nursing properties; or 

&#183; 

participation in such investments indirectly through investments in mezzanine loans and real estate partnerships or other entities that themselves make direct investments in such loans or properties. 

In evaluating potential investments, we consider factors such as: 

&#183; 

type of property; 

&#183; 

the location; 

&#160;

&#183; 

competition within the local market and evaluation of the impact resulting from any potential new development projects in construction or anticipated to be approved by local authorities; 

&#183; 

construction quality, condition and design of the property; 

&#183; 

the property&#8217;s current and anticipated cash flow and its adequacy to meet operational needs and lease obligations or debt service obligations; 

&#183; 

the experience, reputation and solvency of the operating companies providing services; 

&#183; 

the payor mix of private, Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid patients; 

&#183; 

the growth, tax and regulatory environments of the communities in which the properties are located; 

&#183; 

the occupancy and demand for similar properties in the area surrounding the property; and 

&#183; 

the Medicaid reimbursement policies and plans of the state in which the property is located. 

Prior to every investment, we conduct a property site review to assess the general physical condition of the property and the potential of additional services. In addition, we review third-party environmental reports, land surveys, and markets studies (if applicable) as well as conducting a thorough financial due diligence review of the property before the investment is made. 

We believe skilled nursing facilities are the lowest cost provider for certain levels of acuity; therefore, such facilities play a vital role in our nation&#8217;s health care delivery system. Our investments include direct ownership, development and mortgages secured by skilled nursing centers. We prefer to invest in a property that has a significant market presence in its community and where state certificate of need and/or licensing procedures limit the entry of competing properties. 

We believe that assisted living, independent living and memory care facilities are an important sector in the long term care market and our investments include direct ownership, development, joint ventures, a mezzanine loan and mortgages secured by assisted living, independent living and/or memory care communities. We have attempted to diversify our portfolio both geographically and across product levels. 

Borrowing Policies. We may incur additional indebtedness when, in the opinion of our Board of Directors, it is advisable. We may incur such indebtedness to make investments in additional senior housing and health care properties or to meet the distribution requirements imposed upon REITs under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. For other short &#8209;term purposes, we may, from time to time, negotiate lines of credit, or arrange for other short &#8209;term borrowings from banks or otherwise. We may also arrange for long term borrowings through public or private offerings or from institutional investors. 

In addition, we may incur mortgage indebtedness on real estate which we have acquired through purchase, foreclosure or otherwise. We may also obtain mortgage financing for unleveraged or underleveraged properties in which we have invested or may refinance properties acquired on a leveraged basis. 

Competition 

In the health care industry, we compete for real property investments with health care providers, other health care related REITs, real estate partnerships, banks, private equity funds, venture capital funds and other investors. Many of our competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial resources and lower cost of capital than we have available to us. Our ability to compete successfully for real property investments will be determined by numerous factors, including our ability to identify suitable acquisition targets, our ability to negotiate acceptable terms for any such acquisition and the availability and our cost of capital. 

The lessees and borrowers of our properties compete on a local, regional and, in some instances, national basis with other health care providers. The ability of the lessee or borrower to compete successfully for patients or residents at our properties depends upon several factors, including the levels of care and services provided by the lessees or 

&#160;

borrowers, the reputation of the providers, physician referral patterns, physical appearances of the properties, family preferences, financial condition of the operator and other competitive systems of health care delivery within the community, population and demographics. 

Government Regulation 

The health care industry is heavily regulated by the government. Our borrowers and lessees who operate health care facilities are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local governments. These laws and regulations are subject to frequent and substantial changes resulting from legislation, adoption of rules and regulations, and administrative and judicial interpretations of existing law. These changes may have a dramatic effect on the definition of permissible or impermissible activities, the relative costs associated with doing business and the amount of reimbursement by both government and other third-party payors. These changes may be applied retroactively. The ultimate timing or effect of these changes cannot be predicted. The failure of any borrower of funds from us or lessee of any of our properties to comply with such laws, requirements and regulations could result in sanctions or remedies such as denials of payment for new Medicare and Medicaid admissions, civil monetary penalties, state oversight and loss of Medicare and Medicaid participation or licensure. Such action could affect our borrower&#8217;s or lessee&#8217;s ability to operate its facility or facilities and could adversely affect such borrower&#8217;s or lessee&#8217;s ability to make debt or lease payments to us. 

The properties we own and the manner in which they are operated are affected by changes in the reimbursement, licensing and certification policies of federal, state and local governments. Properties may also be affected by changes in accreditation standards or procedures of accrediting agencies. In addition, expansion (including the addition of new beds or services or acquisition of medical equipment) and occasionally the discontinuation of services of health care facilities are, in some states, subjected to state and regulatory approval through &#8220;certificate of need&#8221; laws and regulations. 

The ability of our borrowers and lessees to generate revenue and profit determines the underlying value of that property to us. Revenues of our borrowers and lessees of skilled nursing centers are generally derived from payments for patient care. Sources of such payments for skilled nursing facilities include the federal Medicare program, state Medicaid programs, private insurance carriers, managed care organizations, preferred provider arrangements, and self-insured employers, as well as the patients themselves. 

A significant portion of the revenue of our skilled nursing center borrowers and lessees is derived from governmentally-funded reimbursement programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Because of significant health care costs paid by such government programs, both federal and state governments have adopted and continue to consider various health care reform proposals to control health care costs. In many instances, revenues from Medicaid programs are insufficient to cover the actual costs incurred in providing care to Medicaid patients. Moreover, the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured stated in October 2015 that 35 states enacted new Medicaid rate restrictions for at least one provider type in fiscal year 2015, while 38 states plan rate restrictions for fiscal year 2016. On the other hand, the Kaiser Commission notes that due to improving state finances, more states are enhancing rates than restricting rates for major categories of providers in fiscal year 2015 (47 states) and in 2016 (45 states). With regard to nursing home rates in particular, 37 states increased rates in fiscal year 2015 and 29 adopted rate increases for fiscal year 2016, compared to nursing home rate restrictions being adopted in 14 states in fiscal year 2015 and 21 states in fiscal year 2016. In addition, many states have been making changes to their long term care delivery systems that emphasize home and community-based long term care services, in some cases coupled with cost controls for institutional providers. According to the Kaiser Commission, 46 states in fiscal years 2015 and 2016 took action to expand home and community-based service programs. The federal government also has adopted various policies to promote community-based alternatives to institutional services. As states and the federal government continue to respond to budget pressures, future reduction in Medicaid payments for skilled nursing facility services could have an adverse effect on the financial condition of our borrowers and lessees which could, in turn, adversely impact the timing or level of their payments to us. 

Over the years there also have been fundamental changes in the Medicare program that resulted in reduced levels of payment for a substantial portion of health care services, including skilled nursing facility services. The Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services (&#8220;CMS&#8221;) annually updates Medicare skilled nursing facility prospective 

&#160;

payment system rates and other policies . On August 5, 2014, CMS published its final Medicare skilled nursing facility payment rate update for fiscal year 2015, which began on October 1, 2014. CMS estimated that the final rule would increase aggregate Medicare skilled nursing facility payments by $750 million, or 2%, compared to fiscal year 2014 levels. On July 30, 2015, CMS released its final skilled nursing facility prospective payment system update for fiscal year 2016, which began October 1, 2015. CMS projects that aggregate Medicare payments to skilled nursing facilities will increase by $430 million, or 1.2%, under the final rule. This increase reflects a 2.3% market basket increase, reduced by both a 0.6 percentage point forecast error adjustment and a 0.5 percentage point multifactor productivity adjustment mandated by the Affordable Care Act. In addition, on July 13, 2015, CMS released a proposed rule that would revise the requirements that long term care facilities must meet to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This major rule addresses requirements for improving quality of care and patient safety, nursing facility staffing, care planning, binding arbitration agreements, infection control, residents&#8217; rights, compliance and ethics programs, and several other areas. CMS estimates that the rule, if adopted as proposed, would impose an average cost of $46,491 per facility in the first year and $40,685 per facility in subsequent years. There can be no assurance that any future reductions in Medicare skilled nursing facility payment rates or other policy changes impacting long term care facilities would not have an adverse effect on the financial condition of our borrowers and lessees which could, in turn, adversely impact the timing or level of their payments to us. 

Moreover, health care facilities continue to experience pressures from private payors attempting to control health care costs, and reimbursement from private payors has in many cases effectively been reduced to levels approaching those of government payors. Governmental and public concern regarding health care costs may result in significant reductions in payment to health care facilities, and there can be no assurance that future payment rates for either governmental or private payors will be sufficient to cover cost increases in providing services to patients. Any changes in reimbursement policies which reduce reimbursement to levels that are insufficient to cover the cost of providing patient care could adversely affect revenues of our skilled nursing center borrowers and lessees and to a much lesser extent our assisted living community borrowers and lessees and thereby adversely affect those borrowers&#8217; and lessees&#8217; abilities to make their debt or lease payments to us. Failure of the borrowers or lessees to make their debt or lease payments would have a direct and material adverse impact on us. 

Various federal and state laws govern financial and other arrangements between health care providers that participate in, receive payments from, or make or receive referrals for work in connection with government funded health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. These laws, known as the fraud and abuse laws, include the federal anti-kickback statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration directly or indirectly in return for, or to induce, the referral, or arrange for the referral, of an individual to a person for the furnishing of an item or service for which payment may be made under federal health care programs. In addition, the federal physician self-referral law, commonly known as the Stark Law, prohibits physicians and certain other types of practitioners from making referrals for certain designated health services paid in whole or in part by Medicare and Medicaid to entities with which the practitioner or a member of the practitioner&#8217;s immediate family has a financial relationship, unless the financial relationship fits within an applicable exception to the Stark Law. The Stark Law also prohibits the entity receiving the referral from seeking payment under the Medicare program for services rendered pursuant to a prohibited referral. Sanctions for violating the Stark Law include civil monetary penalties of up to $15,000 per prohibited service provided, assessments equal to three times the dollar value of each such service provided and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Many states have enacted similar fraud and abuse laws which are not necessarily limited to items and services for which payment is made by federal health care programs. Violations of these laws may result in fines, imprisonment, denial of payment for services, and exclusion from federal and/or other state-funded programs. Other federal and state laws authorize the imposition of penalties, including criminal and civil fines and exclusion from participation in federal health care programs for submitting false claims, improper billing and other offenses. Federal and state government agencies have continued rigorous enforcement of criminal and civil fraud and abuse laws in the health care arena. Our borrowers and lessees are subject to many of these laws, and some of them could in the future become the subject of a governmental enforcement action. 

Health Care Reform and Other Legislative Developments 

Congress and the state legislatures regularly consider, and in some cases adopt, legislation impacting health care providers, including long term care providers. For instance, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 enacted significant 

&#160;

changes to the Medicare and Medicaid programs designed to modernize payment and health care delivery systems while achieving substantial budgetary savings. Among other things, the law established the Medicare prospective payment system for skilled nursing facility services to replace the cost-based reimbursement system, which resulted in significant reductions in Medicare payments to skilled nursing facilities. Over the years, Congress adopted legislation to somewhat mitigate the impact of the new payment system, including a temporary payment add-on for high-acuity patients, which subsequently expired, and a temporary payment add-on for residents with AIDS that still is in effect through fiscal year 2016. Other legislation enacted by Congress in recent years has reduced certain Medicare skilled nursing facility bad debt payments, strengthened Medicaid asset transfer restrictions for persons seeking to qualify for Medicaid long term care coverage, reduced Medicaid provider taxes that are used by many states to finance state health programs, and given states greater flexibility to expand access to home and community-based services. 

In March 2010, the President signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which subsequently was amended by the Health Care and Education and Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively referred to as the &#8220;Affordable Care Act&#8221;). The Affordable Care Act is designed to expand access to affordable health insurance, contain health care costs, and institute a variety of health policy reforms. The provisions of the sweeping law may affect us directly, as well as impact our lessees and borrowers. While certain provisions, such as expanding the insured population, may positively impact the revenues of our lessees and borrowers, other provisions, particularly those intended to reduce federal health care spending, could have a negative impact on our lessees and borrowers. Among other things, the Affordable Care Act: reduces Medicare skilled nursing facility reimbursement by a so-called &#8220;productivity adjustment&#8221; based on economy-wide productivity gains; requires the development of a value-based purchasing program for Medicare skilled nursing facility services; establishes a national voluntary pilot program to bundle Medicare payments for hospital and post-acute services that could lead to changes in the delivery of post-acute services; and provides incentives to state Medicaid programs to promote community-based care as an alternative to institutional long term care services. The Affordable Care Act also includes provisions intended to expand public disclosure about nursing home ownership and operations, institute mandatory compliance and quality assurance programs, increase penalties for noncompliance, and expand fraud and abuse enforcement and penalty provisions that could impact our operators. In addition, the Affordable Care Act impacts both us and our lessees and borrowers as employers, including new requirements related to the health insurance we offer to our respective employees. Many aspects of the Affordable Care Act are being implemented through regulations and subregulatory guidance. We cannot predict at this time what effect, if any, the various provisions of the Affordable Care Act will have on our lessees and borrowers or our business when fully implemented. There can be no assurances, however, that the Affordable Care Act will not adversely impact the operations, cash flows or financial condition of our lessees and borrowers, which subsequently could materially adversely impact our revenue and operations. 

Under the terms of the Budget Control Act of 2011, as modified by the American Taxpayer Relief Act, President Obama issued a sequestration order on March 1, 2013 that mandates a 2% cut to Medicare payments to providers and health plans. The cuts generally apply to Medicare fee-for-service claims with dates-of-service or dates-of-discharge on or after April 1, 2013. As amended by subsequent legislation, the Medicare sequestration cuts are currently scheduled to be applied through fiscal year 2025, although Congress and the Administration could enact legislation to modify sequestration at any time, including through alternative budget legislation that includes alternative Medicare or Medicaid savings. There can be no assurances that enacted or future budget control mechanisms will not have an adverse impact on the financial condition of our borrowers and lessees, which subsequently could materially adversely impact our company. 

The Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 requires the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to develop a skilled nursing facility &#8220;value-based purchasing program,&#8221; which will tie Medicare payments to skilled nursing facilities to their performance on certain new readmissions measures, applicable to services furnished beginning October 1, 2018. Furthermore, the Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014 requires the collection of standardized post-acute care assessment data, which eventually could be used as the basis for developing changes to Medicare post-acute care reimbursement policy. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 sets the annual skilled nursing facility prospective payment system update for fiscal year 2018 at 1%. Additional reforms affecting the payment for and availability of health care services have been proposed at the state level and adopted by certain states. Increasingly state Medicaid programs are providing coverage through managed care programs under contracts with private health plans, which is intended to decrease state Medicaid costs. 

&#160;

Congress and state legislatures can be expected to continue to review and assess alternative health care delivery systems and payment methodologies, including potential changes in Medicare and Medicaid payment policy for skilled nursing facility services and other types of post-acute care. For instance, on November 24, 2015, CMS published a final rule that requires hospitals in selected geographic areas to participate in a new Medicare Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement model beginning April 1, 2016, under which CMS will provide a &#8220;bundled&#8221; payment to participant hospitals for an &#8220;episode of care&#8221; for lower extremity joint replacement surgery, covering all services provided during the inpatient admission through 90 days post-discharge, including skilled nursing facility care. Additional changes in laws, new interpretations of existing laws, or other changes in payment methodologies may have a dramatic effect on the definition of permissible or impermissible activities, the relative costs associated with doing business and the amount of reimbursement by the government and other third party payors. 

Environmental Matters 

Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner of real property or a secured lender (such as us) may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at, under or disposed of in connection with such property, as well as other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances (including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property). Such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or secured lender knew of, or was responsible for, the presence or disposal of such substances and may be imposed on the owner or secured lender in connection with the activities of an operator of the property. The cost of any required remediation, removal, fines or personal or property damages and the owner&#8217;s or secured lender&#8217;s liability therefore could exceed the value of the property, and/or the assets of the owner or secured lender. In addition, the presence of such substances, or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner&#8217;s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which, in turn, would reduce our revenues. 

Although the mortgage loans that we provide and leases covering our properties require the borrower and the lessee to indemnify us for certain environmental liabilities, the scope of such obligations may be limited and we cannot assure that any such borrower or lessee would be able to fulfill its indemnification obligations. 

Insurance 

It is our current policy, and we intend to continue this policy, that all borrowers of funds from us and lessees of any of our properties secure adequate comprehensive property and general and professional liability insurance that covers us as well as the borrower and/or lessee. Even though that is our policy, certain borrowers and lessees have been unable to obtain general and professional liability insurance in the specific amounts required by our leases or mortgages because the cost of such insurance and some insurers have stopped offering such insurance for long term care facilities. Additionally, in the past, insurance companies have filed for bankruptcy protection leaving certain of our borrowers and/or lessees without coverage for periods that were believed to be covered prior to such bankruptcies. The unavailability and associated exposure as well as increased cost of such insurance could have a material adverse effect on the lessees and borrowers, including their ability to make lease or mortgage payments. Although we contend that as a non &#8209;possessory landlord we are not generally responsible for what takes place on real estate we do not possess, claims including general and professional liability claims, may still be asserted against us which may result in costs and exposure for which insurance is not available. Certain risks may be uninsurable, not economically insurable or insurance may not be available and there can be no assurance that we, a borrower or lessee will have adequate funds to cover all contingencies. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of our properties, we could be subject to an adverse claim including claims for general or professional liability, could lose the capital that we have invested in the properties, as well as the anticipated future revenue for the properties and, in the case of debt which is with recourse to us, we would remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the properties. Certain losses, such as losses due to floods or seismic activity if insurance is available, may be insured subject to certain limitations including large deductibles or co &#8209;payments and policy limits. 

&#160;

Employees 

At December 31, 2015, we employed 22 people. Our employees are not members of any labor union, and we consider our relations with our employees to be excellent. 

Taxation of our Company 

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code (or the Code). We believe that we have been organized and have operated in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code commencing with our taxable year ending December 31, 1992. We intend to continue to operate in such a manner, but there is no assurance that we have operated or will continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified. 

If we continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal corporate income taxes on our net income that is currently distributed to our stockholders. This treatment substantially eliminates the &#8220;double taxation&#8221; (once at the corporate level when earned and once at stockholder level when distributed) that generally results from investment in a non &#8209;REIT corporation. 

However, we will be subject to federal income tax as follows: 

First , we will be taxed at regular corporate rates on any undistributed taxable income, including undistributed net capital gains. 

Second , under certain circumstances, we may be subject to the alternative minimum tax, if our dividend distributions are less than our alternative minimum taxable income. 

Third , if we have (i) net income from the sale or other disposition of foreclosure property which is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business or (ii) other non &#8209;qualifying income from foreclosure property, we may elect to be subject to tax at the highest corporate rate on such income, if necessary to maintain our REIT status. 

Fourth , if we have net income from &#8220;prohibited transactions&#8221; (as defined below), such income will be subject to a 100% tax. 

Fifth , if we fail to satisfy the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test (as discussed below), but nonetheless maintain our qualification as a REIT because certain other requirements have been met, we will be subject to a 100% tax on an amount equal to (a) the gross income attributable to the greater of the amount by which we fail the 75% or 95% test multiplied by (b) a fraction intended to reflect our profitability. 

Sixth , if we fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of (i) 85% of our ordinary income for such year, (ii) 95% of our REIT capital gain net income for such year, and (iii) any undistributed taxable income from prior periods, we will be subject to a 4% excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over the amounts actually distributed. 

Seventh , if we acquire an asset which meets the definition of a built &#8209;in gain asset from a corporation which is or has been a C corporation (i.e., generally a corporation subject to full corporate &#8209;level tax) in certain transactions in which the basis of the built &#8209;in gain asset in our hands is determined by reference to the basis of the asset in the hands of the C corporation, and if we subsequently recognize gain on the disposition of such asset during the ten &#8209;year period, called the recognition period, beginning on the date on which we acquired the asset, then, to the extent of the built &#8209;in gain (i.e., the excess of (a) the fair market value of such asset over (b) our adjusted basis in such asset, both determined as of the beginning of the recognition period), such gain will be subject to tax at the highest regular corporate tax rate, pursuant to IRS regulations. 

Eighth , if we have taxable REIT subsidiaries and they are required to be reported on a consolidated basis, we would be subject to corporate tax on the taxable income of the taxable REIT subsidiaries. In addition, we will also be subject to a tax of 100% on the amount of any rents from real property, redetermined TRS service income, deductions or excess interest paid to us by any of our taxable REIT subsidiaries that would be reduced through reapportionment under certain federal income tax principles in order to more clearly reflect income for the taxable REIT subsidiary. 

&#160;

Ninth, if we fail to satisfy any of the REIT asset tests, as described below, by more than a de minimus amount, due to reasonable cause and we nonetheless maintain our REIT qualification because of specified cure provisions, we will be required to pay a tax equal to the greater of $50,000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the non &#8209;qualifying assets that caused us to fail such test. 

Tenth , if we fail to satisfy any provision of the Code that would result in our failure to qualify as a REIT (other than a violation of the REIT gross income tests or certain violations of the asset tests described below) and the violation is due to reasonable cause, we may retain our REIT qualification but we will be required to pay a penalty of $50,000 for each such failure. 

Finally, if we own a residual interest in a real estate mortgage investment conduit (or REMIC), we will be taxed at the highest corporate rate on the portion of any excess inclusion income that we derive from the REMIC residual interests equal to the percentage of our shares that is held in record name by &#8220;disqualified organization.&#8221; A &#8220;disqualified organization&#8221; includes the United States, any state or political subdivision thereof, any foreign government or international organization, any agency or instrumentality of any of the foregoing, any rural electrical or telephone cooperative and any tax &#8209; exempt organization (other than a farmer&#8217;s cooperative described in Section 521 of the Code) that is exempt from income taxation and from the unrelated business taxable income provisions of the Code. However, to the extent that we own a REMIC residual interest through a taxable REIT subsidiary, we will not be subject to this tax. 

Requirements for Qualification. The Code defines a REIT as a corporation, trust or association: 

(1) 

which is managed by one or more trustees or directors; 

(2) 

the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares, or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest; 

(3) 

which would be taxable, but for Sections 856 through 860 of the Code, as a domestic corporation; 

(4) 

which is neither a financial institution nor an insurance company subject to certain provisions of the Code; 

(5) 

the beneficial ownership of which is held by 100 or more persons; 

(6) 

during the last half of each taxable year not more than 50% in value of the outstanding stock of which is owned, actually or constructively, by five or fewer individuals (including specified entities); 

(7) 

which meets certain other tests, described below, regarding the amount of its distributions and the nature of its income and assets; 

(8) 

that elects to be a REIT, or has made such election for a previous year, and satisfies the applicable filing and administrative requirements to maintain qualifications as a REIT; and 

(9) 

that adopts a calendar year accounting period. 

The Code provides that conditions (1) to (4), inclusive, must be met during the entire taxable year and that condition (5) must be met during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months, or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months. Conditions (5) and (6) do not apply until after the first taxable year for which an election is made to be taxed as a REIT. For purposes of condition (6), pension funds and certain other entities are treated as individuals, subject to a &#8220;look &#8209; through&#8221; exception. 

Pursuant to the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations, in order to be able to elect to be taxed as a REIT, we must maintain certain records and request certain information from our stockholders designed to disclose the actual ownership of our stock. Based on publicly available information, we believe we have satisfied the share ownership requirements set forth in conditions (5) and (6). In addition, Sections 9.2 and 9.3 of our Charter provide for restrictions regarding the transfer and ownership of shares. These restrictions are intended to assist us in continuing to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in conditions (5) and (6). These restrictions, however, may not ensure that we will, in all cases, be able to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in conditions (5) and (6). 

We have complied with, and will continue to comply with, regulatory rules to send annual letters to certain of our stockholders requesting information regarding the actual ownership of our stock. If despite sending the annual letters, 

&#160;

we do not know, or after exercising reasonable diligence would not have known, whether we failed to satisfy the ownership requirement set forth in condition (6) above, we will be treated as having satisfied such condition. If we fail to comply with these regulatory rules, we will be subject to a monetary penalty. If our failure to comply was due to intentional disregard of the requirement, the penalty would be increased. However, if our failure to comply was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect, no penalty would be imposed. 

Income Tests. There presently are two gross income requirements that we must satisfy to qualify as a REIT: 

&#183; 

First, at least 75% of our gross income (excluding gross income from &#8220;prohibited transactions,&#8221; as defined below) for each taxable year must be derived directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property, including rents from real property, or from certain types of temporary investment income. 

&#183; 

Second, at least 95% of our gross income for each taxable year must be directly or indirectly derived from income that qualifies under the 75% test, and from dividends (including dividends from taxable REIT subsidiaries), interest and gain from the sale or other disposition of stock or securities. 

Cancellation of indebtedness income generated by us is not taken into account in applying the 75% and 95% income tests discussed above. A &#8220;prohibited transaction&#8221; is a sale or other disposition of property (other than foreclosure property) held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. Any gain realized from a prohibited transaction is subject to a 100% penalty tax. 

Rents received by us will qualify as &#8220;rents from real property&#8221; for purposes of satisfying the gross income tests for a REIT only if several conditions are met: 

&#183; 

The amount of rent must not be based in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person, although rents generally will not be excluded merely because they are based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales. 

&#183; 

Rents received from a tenant will not qualify as rents from real property if the REIT, or an owner of 10% or more of the REIT, also directly or constructively owns 10% or more of the tenant, unless the tenant is our taxable REIT subsidiary and certain other requirements are met with respect to the real property being rented. 

&#183; 

If rent attributable to personal property leased in connection with a lease of real property is greater than 15% of the total rent received under the lease, then the portion of rent attributable to the personal property will not qualify as rents from real property. 

&#183; 

We generally must not furnish or render services to tenants, other than through a taxable REIT subsidiary or an &#8220;independent contractor&#8221; from whom we derive no income, except that we may directly provide services that are &#8220;usually or customarily rendered&#8221; in the geographic area in which the property is located in connection with the rental of real property for occupancy only, or are not otherwise &#8220;rendered to the occupant for his convenience.&#8221; 

For taxable years beginning after August 5, 1997, a REIT has been permitted to render a de minimus amount of impermissible services to tenants and still treat amounts received with respect to that property as rents from real property. The amount received or accrued by the REIT during the taxable year for the impermissible services with respect to a property may not exceed 1% of all amounts received or accrued by the REIT directly or indirectly from the property. If the amount received or accrued by the REIT during the taxable year for impermissible services with respect to a property exceeds 1% of the total amounts received or accrued with respect to such property, then none of the rents received or accrued from such property shall be treated as rents from real property. The amount received for any service or management operation for this purpose shall be deemed to be not less than 150% of the direct cost of the REIT in furnishing or rendering the service or providing the management or operation. Furthermore, impermissible services may be furnished to tenants by a taxable REIT subsidiary subject to certain conditions, and we may still treat rents received with respect to the property as rent from real property. 

&#160;

The term &#8220;interest&#8221; generally does not include any amount if the determination of the amount depends in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person, although an amount generally will not be excluded from the term &#8220;interest&#8221; solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage of receipts or sales. 

If we fail to satisfy one or both of the 75% or 95% gross income tests for any taxable year, we may nevertheless qualify as a REIT for the year if we are eligible for relief. These relief provisions will be generally available if our failure to meet the tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect and following the identification of the failure to satisfy one or both income tests, a description of each item of gross income is filed in accordance with IRS regulations. 

It is not now possible to determine the circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions. If these relief provisions apply, a 100% tax is imposed on an amount equal to (a) the gross income attributable to the greater of the amount by which we failed the 75% or 95% test, multiplied by (b) a fraction intended to reflect our profitability. 

Asset Tests. At the close of each quarter of our taxable year, we must also satisfy several tests relating to the nature and diversification of our assets. At least 75% of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets, cash, cash items (including receivables arising in the ordinary course of our operations), and government securities and qualified temporary investments. Although the remaining 25% of our assets generally may be invested without restriction, we are prohibited from owning securities representing more than 10% of either the vote or value of the outstanding securities of any issuer other than a qualified REIT subsidiary, another REIT or a taxable REIT subsidiary (the &#8220;10% vote and value test&#8221;). Further, no more than 25% of our total assets may be represented by securities of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries (for tax years beginning prior to July 30, 2008 and after December 31, 2017, 20% of the total value of our assets) and no more than 5% of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities of any non &#8209;governmental issuer other than a qualified REIT subsidiary, another REIT or a taxable REIT subsidiary (or TRS). Each of the 10% vote and value test and the 25% and 5% asset tests must be satisfied at the end of any quarter. There are special rules which provide relief if the value related tests are not satisfied due to changes in the value of the assets of a REIT. 

Investments in Taxable REIT Subsidiaries. For taxable years beginning after December 1, 2000, REITs may own more than 10% of the voting and value of securities in a TRS. A TRS is a corporation other than a REIT in which a REIT directly or indirectly holds stock, and that has made a joint election with the REIT to be treated as a TRS. A TRS also includes any corporation other than a REIT with respect to which a TRS owns securities possessing more that 35% of the total voting power or value of the outstanding securities of such corporation. Other than some activities relating to lodging and health care facilities, a TRS may generally engage in any business, including the provision of customary or non &#8209;customary services to tenants of its parent REIT. A TRS is subject to income tax as a regular C corporation. In addition, a TRS may be prevented from deducting interest on debt funded directly or indirectly by its parent REIT if certain tests regarding the TRS&#8217;s debt to equity ratio and interest expense are not satisfied. A REIT&#8217;s ownership of a TRS will not be subject to the 10% or 5% asset tests described above, and its operations will be subject to the provisions described above. At this time, we do not have any taxable REIT subsidiaries. 

REMIC. A regular or residual interest in a REMIC will be treated as a real estate asset for purposes of the REIT asset tests, and income derived with respect to such interest will be treated as interest on an obligation secured by a mortgage on real property, assuming that at least 95% of the assets of the REMIC are real estate assets. If less than 95% of the assets of the REMIC are real estate assets, only a proportionate share of the assets of and income derived from the REMIC will be treated as qualifying under the REIT asset and income tests. All of our historical REMIC certificates were secured by real estate assets, therefore we believe that our historic REMIC interests fully qualified for purposes of the REIT income and asset tests. 

Ownership of Interests in Partnerships, Limited Liability Companies and Qualified REIT Subsidiaries. We own interests in various partnerships and limited liabilities companies. In the case of a REIT which is a partner in a partnership, or a member in a limited liability company treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, Treasury Regulations provide that the REIT will be deemed to own its proportionate share of the assets of the partnership or limited liability company, based on its interest in partnership capital, subject to special rules relating to the 10% REIT asset test described above. Also, the REIT will be deemed to be entitled to its proportionate share of income of that entity. The assets and items 

&#160;

of gross income of the partnership or limited liability company retain the same character in the hands of the REIT for purposes of Section 856 of the Code, including satisfying the gross income tests and the asset tests. Thus, our proportionate share of the assets and items of income of partnerships and limited liability companies taxed as partnerships, in which we are, directly or indirectly through other partnerships or limited liability companies taxed as partnerships, a partner or member, are treated as our assets and items of income for purposes of applying the REIT qualification requirements described in this Annual Report on Form 10 &#8209;K (including the income and asset tests previously described). 

We also own interests in a number of subsidiaries which are intended to be treated as qualified REIT subsidiaries. The Code provides that such subsidiaries will be ignored for federal income tax purposes and that all assets, liabilities and items of income, deduction and credit of such subsidiaries will be treated as assets, liabilities and such items of our company. If any partnership or qualified real estate investment trust subsidiary in which we own an interest were treated as a regular corporation (and not as a partnership or qualified real estate investment trust subsidiary) for federal income tax purposes, we would likely fail to satisfy the REIT asset test prohibiting a REIT from owning greater than 10% of the voting power of the stock or value of securities of any issuer, as described above, and would therefore fail to qualify as a REIT. We believe that each of the partnerships and subsidiaries in which we own an interest will be treated for tax purposes as a partnership or qualified REIT subsidiary, respectively, although no assurance can be given that the IRS will not successfully challenge the status of any such entity. 

Annual Distribution Requirements. In order to qualify as a REIT, we are required to distribute dividends (other than capital gain dividends) to our stockholders annually in an amount at least equal to: 

(1) 

the sum of: 

(a) 

90% of our &#8220;real estate investment trust taxable income&#8221; (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain); and 

(b) 

90% of the net income, if any (after tax), from foreclosure property; minus 

(2) 

the excess of certain items of non &#8209;cash income over 5% of our real estate investment trust taxable income. 

In addition, if we dispose of any asset we acquired from a corporation which is or has been a C corporation in a transaction in which our basis in the asset is determined by reference to the basis of the asset in the hands of that C corporation, within the ten &#8209;year period following our acquisition of such asset, we would be required to distribute at least 90% of the after &#8209;tax gain, if any, we recognized on the disposition of the asset, to the extent that gain does not exceed the excess of (a) the fair market value of the asset on the date we acquired the asset over (b) our adjusted basis in the asset on the date we acquired the asset. 

We must pay these annual distributions (1) in the taxable year to which they relate or (2) in the following year if (i) we pay these distributions during January to stockholders of record in either October, November, or December of the prior year or (ii) we elect to declare the dividend before the due date of the tax return (including extensions) and pay on or before the first regular dividend payment date after such declaration. 

Amounts distributed prior to January 1, 2015, must not be preferential; that is, every stockholder of the class of stock with respect to which a distribution is made must be treated the same as every other stockholder of that class, and no class of stock may be treated otherwise than in accordance with its dividend rights as a class. 

To the extent that we do not distribute all of our net long term capital gain or distribute at least 90% but less than 100%, of our &#8220;real estate investment trust taxable income,&#8221; as adjusted, we will be subject to tax on such amounts at regular corporate tax rates. Furthermore, if we should fail to distribute during each calendar year (or, in the case of distributions with declaration and record dates in the last three months of the calendar year, by the end of the following January) at least the sum of: 

(1) 

85% of our real estate investment trust ordinary income for such year, 

(2) 

95% of our real estate investment trust capital gain net income for such year, and 

&#160;

(3) 

100% of taxable income from prior periods less 100% of distributions from prior periods 

We would be subject to a 4% excise tax on the excess of such required distributions over the amounts actually distributed. Any real estate investment trust taxable income and net capital gain on which this excise tax is imposed for any year is treated as an amount distributed during that year for purposes of calculating such tax. 

We intend to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy these annual distribution requirements and to avoid the imposition of the 4% excise tax. 

Failure to Qualify. If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any taxable year, and certain relief provisions do not apply, we will be subject to tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. Distributions to stockholders in any year in which we fail to qualify as a REIT will not be deductible by us, nor will any distributions be required to be made. Unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions, we will also be disqualified from re &#8209;electing our REIT status for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost. It is not possible to state whether we would be entitled to the statutory relief in all circumstances. Failure to qualify as a REIT for even one year could substantially reduce distributions to stockholders and could result in our incurring substantial indebtedness (to the extent borrowings are feasible) or liquidating substantial investments in order to pay the resulting taxes. 

State and local taxation. We may be subject to state or local taxation in various state or local jurisdictions, including those in which we transact business or reside. The state and local tax treatment of our Company may not conform to the federal income tax consequences discussed above. 

Taxation of our Stockholders 

Taxation of Taxable U.S. Stockholders. The following summary applies to you only if you are a &#8220;U.S. stockholder.&#8221; A U.S. stockholder is a stockholder of our shares of stock who, for United State federal income tax purposes, is: 

&#61623; a citizen or resident alien of the United States; 

&#61623; a corporation or partnership or other entity classified as a corporation or partnership for these purposes, created or organized in or under laws of the United States or of any state or in the District of Columbia, unless, in the case of a partnership, Treasury Regulations provide otherwise; 

&#61623; an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source; or 

&#61623; a trust whose administration is subject to the primary supervision of a United States court and which has one or more United States persons, within the meaning of the Code who have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust. 

If a partnership or an entity treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes holds our stock, the federal income tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner in a partnership holding our stock, you should consult your tax advisor regarding the consequences of the ownership and disposition of shares of our stock by the partnership. 

As long as we qualify as a REIT, distributions made to our taxable U.S. stockholders out of current or accumulated earnings and profits (and not designated as capital gain dividends) will be taken into account by such U.S. stockholders as ordinary income and will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction for corporations. Distributions that are designated as capital gain dividends will be taxed as long-term capital gains (to the extent they do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year or are designated as unrecaptured &#167;1250 gain distributions, which are taxable at a 25% rate) without regard to the period for which the stockholder has held its stock. However, corporate stockholders may be required to treat up to 20% of certain capital gain dividends as ordinary income. 

The Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 generally reduced the maximum tax rate applicable on long term capital gains recognized on the sale or other disposition of shares of our stock from 20% to 15%. The Jobs 

&#160;

and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 also generally reduced the maximum marginal rate of tax payable by individuals on dividends received from corporations that are subject to a corporate level of tax. As a result of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, qualified dividends and long term capital gains realized by noncorporate taxpayers are subject to a 20% maximum tax rate (instead of the prior 15% maximum rate). Except in limited circumstances, this reduced tax rate does not apply to dividends paid to you by us on shares of our stock, because generally we are not subject to federal income tax on the portion of our REIT taxable income or capital gains distributed to our stockholders. The reduced maximum federal income tax rate will apply to that portion, if any, of dividends received by you with respect to shares of our stock held by you that are attributable to (1) dividends received by us from non-REIT corporations or taxable REIT subsidiaries, (2) income from the prior year with respect to which we were required to pay federal corporate income tax during the prior year (if, for example, we did not distribute 100% of our REIT taxable income for the prior year) and (3) distributions by us that we designate as long-term capital gains dividends (except for some distributions taxable to you at a maximum rate of 25%). 

Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits will not be currently taxable to you to the extent that they do not exceed the adjusted basis of your stock, but rather will reduce the adjusted basis of such stock. To the extent that distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits exceed the adjusted basis of your stock, such distributions will be included in income as long-term capital gain (or short-term capital gain if the stock has been held for one year or less) assuming you hold the stock as a capital asset. In addition, any distribution declared in October, November or December of any year and payable to you as a stockholder of record on a specified date in any such month, will be treated as both paid by us and received by you on December 31 of the applicable year, provided that we actually pay the distribution during January of the following calendar year. Stockholders may not include in their individual income tax returns any of our net operating losses or capital losses. 

If we elect to retain and pay income tax on any net long-term capital gain, you would include in income, as long-term capital gain, your proportionate share of this net long-term capital gain. You would also receive a refundable tax credit for your proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these retained capital gains and you would have an increase in the basis of your shares of our stock in an amount equal to your includable capital gains less your share of the tax deemed paid. 

We will be treated as having sufficient earnings and profits to treat as a dividend any distribution up to the amount required to be distributed in order to avoid imposition of the 4% excise tax discussed under &#8220;Taxation of Our Company&#8212;General&#8221; and &#8220;Taxation of Our Company &#8212;Annual Distribution Requirements&#8221; above. As a result, you may be required to treat as taxable dividends certain distributions that would otherwise result in a tax-free return of capital. Moreover, any &#8220;deficiency dividend&#8221; will be treated as a dividend (an ordinary dividend or a capital gain dividend, as the case may be), regardless of our earnings and profits. Any other distributions in excess of current or accumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable to you to the extent these distributions do not exceed the adjusted tax basis of your shares of our stock. You will be required to reduce the tax basis of your shares of our stock by the amount of these distributions until the basis has been reduced to zero, after which these distributions will be taxable as capital gain, if the shares of our stock are held as a capital asset. The tax basis as so reduced will be used in computing the capital gain or loss realized upon sale of the shares of our stock. Any loss upon a sale or exchange of shares of our stock which were held for six months or less (after application of certain holding period rules) will generally be treated as a long-term capital loss to the extent you previously received capital gain distributions with respect to these shares of our stock. 

Upon the sale or exchange of any shares of our stock to or with a person other than us or a sale or exchange of all shares of our stock (whether actually or constructively owned) with us, you will generally recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your adjusted tax basis in these shares of our stock. This gain or loss will be capital if you held these shares of our stock as a capital asset. 

If we redeem any of your shares in us, the treatment can only be determined on the basis of particular facts at the time of redemption. In general, you will recognize gain or loss (as opposed to dividend income) equal to the difference between the amount received by you in the redemption and your adjusted tax basis in your shares redeemed if such redemption results in a &#8220;complete termination&#8221; of your interest in all classes of our equity securities, is a &#8220;substantially disproportionate redemption&#8221; or is &#8220;not essentially equivalent to a dividend&#8221; with respect to you. In applying these tests, there must be taken into account your ownership of all classes of our equity securities (e.g., 

&#160;

Common Stock or Preferred Stock). You also must take into account any equity securities that are considered to be constructively owned by you. 

If, as a result of a redemption by us of your shares, you no longer own (either actually or constructively) any of our equity securities or only own (actually and constructively) an insubstantial percentage of our equity securities, then it is probable that the redemption of your shares would be considered &#8220;not essentially equivalent to a dividend&#8221; and, thus, would result in gain or loss to you. However, whether a distribution is &#8220;not essentially equivalent to a dividend&#8221; depends on all of the facts and circumstances, and if you rely on any of these tests at the time of redemption, you should consult your tax advisor to determine their application to the particular situation. 

Generally, if the redemption does not meet the tests described above, then the proceeds received by you from the redemption of your shares will be treated as a distribution taxable as a dividend to the extent of the allocable portion of current or accumulated earnings and profits. If the redemption is taxed as a dividend, your adjusted tax basis in the redeemed shares will be transferred to any other shareholdings in us that you own. If you own no other shareholdings in us, under certain circumstances, such basis may be transferred to a related person, or it may be lost entirely. 

Gain from the sale or exchange of our shares held for more than one year is taxed at a maximum long-term capital gain rate, which is currently 20% for noncorporate taxpayers (prior to the effective date of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, described above, the maximum long-term capital gain rate was 15%). Pursuant to Internal Revenue Service guidance, we may classify portions of our capital gain dividends as gains eligible for the long-term capital gains rate or as gain taxable to individual stockholders at a maximum rate of 25%. 

Taxation of Tax-Exempt Stockholders. In general, a stockholder that is a tax-exempt entity not subject to tax on its investment income will not be subject to tax on our distributions. In Revenue Ruling 66-106, 1966-1 C.B. 151, the IRS ruled that amounts distributed as dividends by a REIT do not constitute unrelated business taxable income as defined in the Code when received by a qualified plan. Based on that ruling, regardless of whether we incur indebtedness in connection with the acquisition of properties, our distributions paid to a stockholder that is a tax-exempt entity will not be treated as unrelated business taxable income, provided that (i) the tax-exempt entity has not financed the acquisition of its stock with acquisition indebtedness within the meaning of the Code and the stock otherwise is not used in an unrelated trade or business of the tax-exempt entity and (ii) we are not a pension-held REIT. This ruling applies to a stockholder that is an organization that qualifies under Code Section 401(a), an IRA or any other tax-exempt organization that would compute unrelated business taxable income, if any, in accordance with Code Section 512(a)(1). However, if we are a pension-held REIT and a qualified plan owns more than 10% of the value of all of our stock, such stockholder will be required to recognize as unrelated business taxable income that percentage of the dividends that it receives from us as is equal to the percentage of our gross income that would be unrelated business taxable income to us if we were a tax-exempt entity required to recognize unrelated business taxable income. A REIT is a pension-held REIT if at least one qualified trust holds more than 25% of the value of all of our stock or one or more qualified trusts, each of whom own more than 10% of the value of all of our stock, hold more than 50% of the value of all of our stock. 

For social clubs, voluntary employee benefit associations, supplemental unemployment benefit trusts and qualified group legal services plans exempt from federal income taxation under Code Sections 501(c)(7), (c)(9), (c)(17) and (c)(20), respectively, income from an investment in us will constitute unrelated business taxable income unless the organization is able to deduct amounts set aside or placed in reserve for certain purposes so as to offset the unrelated business taxable income generated by its investment in us. Such prospective stockholders should consult their own tax advisors concerning these &#8220;set aside&#8221; and reserve requirements. 

Taxation of Foreign Stockholders. The rules governing U.S. federal income taxation of nonresident alien individuals, foreign corporations, foreign partnerships and other foreign stockholders are complex. We have not attempted to provide more than a summary of these rules. Prospective non-U.S. stockholders should consult with their own tax advisors to determine the impact of federal, state and local income tax laws with regard to an investment in stock, including any reporting requirements. 

Distributions that are not attributable to gain from our sales or exchanges of U.S. real property interests and not designated by us as capital gains dividends will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent that they are 

&#160;

made out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits. Such distributions will ordinarily be subject to a withholding tax equal to 30% of the gross amount of the distribution unless an applicable tax treaty reduces or eliminates that tax. However, if income from the investment in the stock is treated as effectively connected with the non-U.S. stockholder&#8217;s conduct of a U.S. trade or business, the non-U.S. stockholder generally will be subject to a tax at graduated rates, in the same manner as U.S. stockholders are taxed with respect to such distributions and may also be subject to the 30% branch profits tax in the case of a stockholder that is a foreign corporation. We expect to withhold U.S. income tax at the rate of 30% on the gross amount of any such distributions made to a non-U.S. stockholder unless (i) a lower treaty rate applies and the holder provides us with a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN (or successor form) or (ii) the non-U.S. stockholder provides us with a properly executed IRS Form W-8ECI (or successor form) claiming that the distribution is effectively connected income. 

Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable to a stockholder to the extent that such distributions do not exceed the adjusted basis of the stockholder&#8217;s stock, but rather will reduce the adjusted basis of such stock. To the extent that distributions in excess of current accumulated earnings and profits exceed the adjusted basis of a non-U.S. stockholder&#8217;s stock, such distributions will give rise to tax liability if the non-U.S. stockholder would otherwise be subject to tax on any gain from the sale or disposition of our stock, as described below. If it cannot be determined at the time a distribution is made whether or not distributions will be in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profit, the distributions will be subject to withholding at the same rate as dividends. However, amounts thus withheld are refundable if it is subsequently determined that such distribution was, in fact, in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. 

We are required to withhold 15% (10% for distributions prior to February 16, 2016) of any distribution that exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits, subject to certain exceptions provided in the applicable Treasury Regulations. Thus, to the extent we do not withhold 30% on the entire amount of any distribution, we will withhold at a rate of 15% on any portion of a distribution not subject to withholding at a rate of 30%. 

For any year in which we qualify as a REIT, distributions that are attributable to gain from our sales or exchanges of U.S. real property interests will be taxed to a non-U.S. stockholder under the provisions of the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980 or FIRPTA. Under FIRPTA, distributions attributable to gain from sales of U.S. real property interests are taxed to a non-U.S. stockholder as if such gain were effectively connected with a U.S. business. Non-U.S. stockholders would thus be taxed at the normal capital gain rates applicable to U.S. stockholders (subject to applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals) for distributions that are designated as capital gain dividends and at the normal graduated rates for US shareholders on distributions that are not so designated. Also, distributions subject to FIRPTA may be subject to a 30% branch profits tax if a foreign corporate stockholder is not entitled to treaty exemption. We are required by applicable Treasury Regulations to withhold 35% for foreign individuals and 35% for foreign corporations of any distribution that we could designate as a capital gains dividend. This amount is creditable against the non-U.S. stockholder FIRPTA tax liability. If we designate prior distributions as capital gains dividends, then subsequent distributions up to the amount of such prior distributions will be treated as capital gains dividends for purposes of withholding. 

Gain recognized by a non-U.S. stockholder upon a sale of our equity securities generally will not be taxed under FIRPTA if we are a &#8220;domestically controlled real estate investment trust,&#8221; defined generally as a real estate investment trust in which at all times during a specified testing period less than 50% in value of the stock were held directly or indirectly by foreign persons. We currently anticipate that we will be a &#8220;domestically controlled real estate investment trust,&#8221; and therefore the sale of equity securities will not be subject to taxation under FIRPTA. Additionally, the sale of our equity securities will not be taxed under FIRPTA if the class of stock is regularly traded on an established securities market and the selling non-U.S. stockholder has not held more than 10% (5% prior to December 18, 2015) of the class of stock at any time during the preceding five-year period. However, gain not subject to FIRPTA will be taxable to a non-U.S. stockholder if the investment in the stock is effectively connected with the non-U.S. stockholder&#8217;s U.S. trade or business, in which case the non-U.S. stockholder will be subject to the same treatment as U.S. stockholders with respect to such gain. Also, if the non-U.S. stockholder is a nonresident alien individual who was present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year and has a &#8220;tax home&#8221; in the United States, the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a 30% tax (unless reduced or exempted by treaty) on the individual&#8217;s capital gains. A non-resident alien individual could, however, elect to treat such gain as effectively connected income and pay tax as a U.S. stockholder 

&#160;

would. If the gain on the sale of stock were to be subject to taxation under FIRPTA, the non-U.S. stockholder will be subject to the same treatment as U.S. stockholders with respect to such gain. 

If the proceeds of a disposition of our equity securities are paid by or through a U.S. office of a broker, the payment is subject to information reporting and to backup withholding unless the disposing non-U.S. stockholder certifies as to his name, address and non-U.S. status or otherwise establishes an exemption. Generally, U.S. information reporting and backup withholding will not apply to a payment of disposition proceeds if the payment is made outside the United States through a non-U.S. office of a non-U.S. broker. U.S. information reporting requirements (but not backup withholding) will apply, however, to a payment of disposition proceeds outside the United States if (i) the payment is made through an office outside the United States of a broker that is either (a) a U.S. person, (b) a foreign person that derives 50% or more of its gross income for certain periods from the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, (c) a controlled foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or (d) a foreign partnership more than 50% of the capital or profits of which is owned by one or more U.S. persons or which engages in a U.S. trade or business and (ii) the broker fails to initiate documentary evidence that the stockholder is a non-U.S. stockholder and that certain conditions are met or that the non-U.S. stockholder otherwise is entitled to an exemption. 

Recently enacted legislation will generally impose a 30% withholding tax on dividends paid on our stock, interest paid on our notes, and the gross proceeds of a disposition of our stock or notes paid to a foreign financial institution, unless such institution enters into an agreement with the U.S. government to collect and provide to the U.S. tax authorities substantial information regarding U.S. account holders of such institution (which includes certain equity and debt holders of such institution, as well as certain account holders that are foreign entities with U.S. owners). This legislation will also generally impose a 30% withholding tax on dividends paid on our stock, interest paid on our notes, and the gross proceeds of a disposition of our stock or notes paid to a non-financial foreign entity unless such entity provides the withholding agent with a certification identifying the direct and indirect U.S. owners of the entity. Under certain circumstances, a non-U.S. holder of our common stock might be eligible for refunds or credits of such taxes and may be required to file a U.S. federal income tax return to claim such refunds or credits. Under recently promulgated Treasury Regulations, these rules will be phased in over the next several years. Investors are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the possible implications of this legislation on their investment in our stock and notes. 

Other Tax Consequences. You should recognize that the present federal income tax treatment of an investment in us may be modified by legislative, judicial or administrative action at any time and that any action may affect investments and commitments previously made. The rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department, resulting in revisions of regulations and revised interpretations of established concepts as well as statutory changes. Revisions in federal tax laws and interpretations of these laws could adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in us.
