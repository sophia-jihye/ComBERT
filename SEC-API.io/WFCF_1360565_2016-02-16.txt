 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160;

GENERAL 

&#160;

Where Food Comes From, Inc. and its subsidiaries (&#8220;WFCF&#8221;, &#8220;the Company&#8221;, &#8220;our&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221;, or &#8220;us&#8221;) is a leading North American trusted resource for third-party verification of food production practices. The Company supports more than 10,000 farmers, ranchers, processors, retailers, distributors, and restaurants with a wide variety of value-added services provided through its family of verifiers, including IMI Global, International Certification Services, Validus Verification Services, and Sterling Solutions. In order to have credibility, product claims such as gluten free, non-GMO, non-hormone treated, humane handling, and others require verification by an independent third-party such as Where Food Comes From. The Company&#8217;s principal business is conducting both on-site and desk audits to verify that claims being made about livestock, crops and other food products are accurate. In addition, the Company&#8217;s Where Food Comes From&#174; retail and restaurant labeling program connects consumers directly to the source of the food they purchase by requiring all product carrying the label to be sourced from third-party verified suppliers. With the use of Quick Response Code (&#8220;QR&#8221;) technology, consumers can instantly access information about the producers behind their food.

WFCF was founded in 1996 and incorporated in the state of Colorado as a subchapter C corporation on January 1, 2005. The Company&#8217;s shares of common stock trade on the OTCQB marketplace under the stock ticker symbol, &#8220;WFCF&#8221;.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s original name &#8211; Integrated Management Information, Inc. (d.b.a. IMI Global, Inc.) &#8211; was changed to Where Food Comes From, Inc. in 2012 to better reflect the Company&#8217;s mission. Early growth was attributable to source and age verification services for beef producers who wanted access to markets overseas following the discovery of &#8220;mad cow&#8221; disease in the U.S. Over the years, Where Food Comes From has expanded its portfolio to include verification services for most food groups and more than 30 standards. This growth has been achieved both organically and through the acquisition of other companies.

&#160;

BUSINESS OVERVIEW 

&#160; 

What We Do 

&#160; 

The Company is one of the nation&#8217;s largest independent, third-party provider of food production audits and uses rigorous verification processes to ensure that claims made by food producers and processors are accurate.

&#160;

The Where Food Comes From&#174; labeling program offers food retailers and restaurants a means of connecting consumers to information on where and how the food they purchase has been grown or raised.

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s business benefits from growing demand by consumers, retailers and government for increased transparency into food production practices.

Consumers: Due to concerns about food safety, animal welfare and an overall increase in health consciousness, consumers are demanding more information about the food they purchase.

Retailers: Responding to consumer demands for increased transparency as well as to the negative impact food scandals have on their bottom lines, retailers are requiring their suppliers to adhere to more stringent traceability and verification of product claims.

Government Regulation: The U.S. Department of Agriculture&#8217;s Animal Disease Traceability program, being phased in over the next few years, gluten-free testing requirements, and ingredient labeling regulations are all impacting product verification.

&#160; 

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160; 

Growth Strategy 

Due to organic growth in our portfolio of auditing standards, consumer demand and acquisitions, our sales have grown rapidly from $1.1 million in 2006 to $10.4 million in 2015, a 9-year compounded annual growth rate of approximately 28%.

&#160;

Our growth strategy is as follows:

&#160;

&#183; To cover more food groups than any other verification provider. Currently we verify beef, lamb, pork, poultry, dairy, eggs, produce and grain. In the future we hope to include seafood, beverages and other produce. &#183; To offer solutions for ALL participants in the food supply chain including feed and input providers, ranchers, producers, packers, auction barns, processors, distributors, restaurants, retailers and consumers. 

&#183; To expand on the industry&#8217;s largest solutions portfolio. We currently are verifying or certifying to more than 30 certification standards or guidelines. To our knowledge, that is the most in the industry. 

&#183; To continue organic growth. We leverage our &#8216;bundling&#8217; capability to aggressively pursue new customers; while sustaining our recurring revenue model and high retention rates. 

&#183; To continue growth through merger and acquisition opportunities. Through selective acquisitions, we can expand our footprint, add new services, food groups and revenue streams. &#160; 

In line with our growth strategy, we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities as a means of achieving our long-term strategic objectives.

&#160; 

Acquisition of Validus Verification Services, LLC 

&#160; 

On September 16, 2013, we entered into an Asset Purchase and Contribution Agreement (the &#8220;Asset Purchase Agreement&#8221;), by and among the Company, Validus Verification Services LLC (the &#8220;Buyer&#8221; or &#8220;Validus&#8221;), and Praedium Ventures, LLC, formerly known as Validus Ventures LLC (the &#8220;Seller&#8221;).

&#160;

Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, WFCF caused Validus to be organized to purchase and acquire certain audit, assessment and verification business assets of the Seller. The Company acquired a 60% interest in Validus in exchange for aggregate consideration of approximately $1.5 million, which included $565,000 in cash and 708,681 shares of common stock of WFCF valued at approximately $940,000 based upon the closing price of our stock on September 16, 2013, of $1.32 per share. The Company has the first right of refusal on the remaining 40% of the outstanding stock of Validus and intends to exercise this right during the first quarter of 2016.

&#160;

INDUSTRY BACKGROUND 

&#160;

The value-added food industry has been growing rapidly for the past several years in response to increased consumer interest about food production. Per the 2010 U.S. Census, less than 1% of United States citizens are involved in producing food; thus there is a growing interest from consumers regarding how their food is produced. We are also in an increasingly global food market with food products traveling around the world, and brands differentiating themselves in the market. These key drivers are increasing the number of food labeling claims made on food products. Natural and/or organic are examples of food labels that indicate that the food or other agricultural product has been produced a certain way.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160; 

Natural and organic sales are only part of the story of how consumers look for the verification of practices tied to food labeling claims. Other factors are also becoming increasingly more important to consumers, evidenced on menus and product labels. While not an exhaustive list, some of the issues that farms, ranches, producers, processors, restaurants and retailers are addressing include: how animals are cared for and handled, how a product&#8217;s production impacts the environment and societies, and what inputs were used in the production of food items (like antibiotics).

As consumers want more assurance about the trustworthiness of labeling claims, there is a growing trend for verification of raising practices. Additionally, as the agriculture, livestock and food industry continues to mature and expand internationally, there is an increasing need to record, manage, report and verify information regarding the source, age, genetic background, animal treatment, nutrition, and other credence attributes. We believe verification of labeling claims by an independent third-party can meet consumer demands and expectations. Third-party verification also benefits producers, processors, distributors, restaurants, and retailers by addressing marketplace differentiation and global competitiveness.

&#160; 

Current Marketplace Opportunities 

Because of growing demand for increased transparency into food production practices, we believe there are three main market drivers to promote forward momentum for our business:

1) Consumer awareness and expectations 

&#183; A recent survey conducted by Acosta, a leading full-service sales and marketing agency in the consumer packaged goods industry, which was released in 2015, indicates consumers are actually changing their shopping habits in the grocery store. Increasingly more Americans are shopping the perimeter of the grocery store rather than stocking their pantries, and choosing to cook healthy meals at home, even if it comes at a higher cost. 

&#183; According to the US Grocery Shopper Trends 2014 Report, more than 25% of consumers surveyed are seeking products that are minimally processed, locally grown or produced, with recognizable and a short list of ingredients. Per Jenny Zegler, Global Food and Drink Analyst at Mintel, said &#8220;these trends explore how consumers&#8217; evolving priorities, opportunities from advancements in functional formulation and the almost inescapable reach of technology will affect food and drink in the coming year. Consumers are not only the influencers, as shifting economics, natural phenomena and social media are shaping what, how, where and with whom consumers are choosing to eat and drink&#8230;&#8221; 

&#183; Based on a survey in the March 13, 2014 Cone Communication Food Issues Trend Tracker, food safety and nutritional value rose to the top as the most important factors when hitting the grocery aisles. Additionally, at least two-thirds of Americans prioritized the following as other significant factors when deciding what makes it into the shopping cart: locally produced, sustainable packaging, animal welfare, non-GMO, protection and renewal of natural resources. 

&#183; Three in five Americans are on the lookout for non GMO-labeled foods when shopping. Per the March 13, 2014 Cone Communication Food Issues Trend Tracker, 39% believe that non-GMO foods are healthier, 32% are concerned about the effects on the environment, and 24% question the ethics behind the use of GMO&#8217;s. 

&#183; According to the USDA website, the U.S. market for certified organic products was estimated at more than $39 billion as of October 2015 while USDA-approved organic operations have grown more than 250% since 2002. Increasing consumer demand for healthy, better-for-you products produced with sustainable agricultural practices is driving growth in the organic market. 

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160; 

2) Global competitiveness among retailers 

&#183; Restaurant chains and retailers with dominant market shares and large buying power, like McDonald&#8217;s and Wal-Mart, are leading the way in prioritizing sustainable food supply initiatives in answer to consumer demands. With information literally at our fingertips, Google searches and smart phone apps are making it easier to expose where sustainable food supply chains are, and where they are not. 

&#183; Producers, packers, distributors and retailers understand that verification, identification and traceability are key competitive differentiators, and many times is necessary for export into international markets, including Korea, Russia and the European Union. 

3) Government regulation 

&#183; In January 2013, the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) issued two major proposed rules regarding preventive controls in human food and produce safety. Compliance dates for some businesses will begin September 2016. We have begun to see significant movement in companies requesting our consulting expertise to developing programs designed to assist them in maintaining compliance with the new rules. 

&#183; The Animal Disease Traceability Rule primarily covers beef cattle 18 months of age or older. Under the final rule, unless specifically exempted, livestock moved interstate must be officially identified and accompanied by an interstate certificate of veterinary inspection or other documentation, such as owner-shipper statements or brand certificates. &#160;

&#183; In July 2013, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) issued rules on importer foreign supplier verification and accreditation of third-party auditors. The accredited third parties will verify the safety of imports with FDA oversight. These rules help to ensure that imported foods meet the same safety standards that domestic foods do. &#183; In October 2013, the FDA released its proposed rules for preventative controls for animal food. Compliance dates for some businesses will begin September 2016. The rules for animal food controls call on the industry to enact many of the practices that are required of producers and processers of human food. Most notably is the requirement for conducting a Hazard Analysis, establishing controls for identified hazards and enacting monitoring, verification and record-keeping protocols. 

Current Concerns in Our Industry 

&#160;

U.S. beef exports to the European Union (EU) must be third-party verified as High Quality Beef (a USDA feeding claim) and non-hormone treated cattle (NHTC). With duty-free access to the EU lowering the cost of doing business in Europe, we believe that it offers significantly more potential for third-party NHTC verification services and High Quality Beef verification services. However, due to the current strength of the US dollar, we are seeing downward pressure on NHTC cattle prices causing the momentum of these programs to slow.

&#160;

In early 2014, Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDv) negatively impacted the pork/sow industry. The total number of known positive PEDv laboratory swine accessions grew rapidly each week with no vaccines against the virus. In February 2014, in order to prevent the spread of PEDv, the USDA published a request that pig farmers submit accurate on-farm inventory, birth, and death rates in an effort to minimize persons sent to farms to collect data. While the impact of this news significantly delayed the number of onsite pork verifications scheduled in 2014, we believe that we have diversified our product offerings such that the impact was not catastrophic to our 2014 or 2015 annual consolidated results.

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160; 

Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, more commonly known as Bird Flu, refers to strains of influenza that primarily affect several types of birds, including farmed poultry, i.e. chickens, geese, turkeys and ducks. The virus spreads through infected birds, via their saliva, nasal secretions, feces, and feed. According to ThePoultrySite.com, on April 29, 2015, poultry movements in North Dakota were limited to control the spread of avian influenza in the state following two recent outbreaks in commercial poultry. As a result of this news release, the virus delayed the number of onsite verifications performed, and negatively impacted supplies, including eggs. During second quarter 2015, we received a delay notification in our verification schedule from one of our egg producers. We have proposed an acceptable solution; however, more recently several other state poultry associations in the South are bracing for potential outbreaks and on January 17, 2016, the USDA announced detection of a new strain of the virus in a turkey flock located in Indiana. Autumn and winter months bring the possibility that migrating wild birds will carry the virus to the lower half of the United States. We believe we have diversified our product offerings such that the impact was not material to our 2015 consolidated results. However, at this time we have no way to reasonably estimate the future impact it could have on our business.

&#160;

We believe that our experience in bio-security considerations and the core competency needed to deal with verification system design gives us a competitive advantage creating a barrier to entry for less sophisticated third-party verification companies.

&#160;

SALES 

&#160;

Our revenues are generated primarily from third-party verification services, hardware sales and our labeling program, Where Food Comes From&#174;. We sell our products and services directly to customers at various levels in the agriculture, food and livestock supply chain. Our customers include some of the largest U.S. beef and pork packers, organic producers and processors, and specialty retail chains. No single customer generated more than 10% of total net revenue in 2015 or 2014.

&#160;

Service Revenues 

&#160;

We offer a wide array of verification and certification services to help food producers, brands and consumers differentiate certain attributes and production methods in the marketplace. We are recognized and utilized by numerous standard setting bodies as an accredited verification or certification service provider. We enable food producers and brands to make certain claims on live animals or packaged food products by verifying that they are meeting the standards or guidelines associated with the claim(s) they are making.

&#160;

Most of our service offerings can be bundled to provide a &#8220;one-stop shop&#8221; for customers that have multiple levels of verification and certification needs, such as source verification and food safety certification.

&#160;

We also offer consulting, program development and web-based development services on a customized basis to meet special customer requirements. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our third-party verification programs provided 87.3% and 86.3% of our total revenue, respectively.

&#160;

Hardware Sales 

&#160; 

In support of our third-party verification service offerings, we offer hardware products (primarily cattle identification ear tags) to our customers. While these hardware products have lower profit margins than our proprietary offerings, they allow us to offer our customers a comprehensive solution. Approximately 11.6% and 12.4% of our total revenue was provided by the sale of hardware during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

&#160; 

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Other Revenue 

&#160;

All of our verification products that are source-verified qualify for our WhereFoodComesFrom&#174; verification seal of approval. As a third-party verification service provider, we must review each individual producer&#8217;s or food company&#8217;s claim and system to ensure that 100 percent of the supply is managed through a third-party verification program recognized by the USDA, ISO and/or another internationally recognized standard setting body. This revenue stream primarily represents a price per pound fee for use of our WhereFoodComesFrom&#174; label.

&#160;

The WhereFoodComesFrom&#174; labeling program offers food retailers and restaurants a means of connecting consumers to information on where and how the food they purchase has been grown or raised. Grocery stores and restaurants can display the Where Food Comes From&#174; label along with a QR code consumers can scan with smart phones to access information on the farmers and ranchers who produce food for that establishment.

&#160;

We offer incentives to select producers and processors who exclusively use our verification and certification services in connection with our distinctive brand.

&#160; 

MARKETING 

&#160;

Our marketing strategy includes direct marketing, advertising, event sponsorship, and trade show participation. From a public relations perspective, our staff is frequently quoted in industry trade journals and requested as speakers at various industry events as subject matter experts on the topics of animal identification, traceability, branding, third-party verification and certification, and the USDA verification programs.

&#160;

In order to reach additional customers, we continually develop strategic marketing partnerships with leading companies in the industry with complementary abilities and products. We do not currently rely on any third-party contracts with distributors, licenses or manufacturers in conducting our business.

&#160;

We also use social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter to help promote our business, market our product offerings, and connect consumers with current topics in the agriculture, livestock and food industry.

&#160; 

COMPETITION 

&#160; 

The competition for third-party verification services in the food and agriculture industry is growing more intense, especially within the organic market. We estimate that there are approximately 7 key competitors serving the food and agricultural industry, including Quality Assurance International, California Certified Organic Farmers, Oregon Tilth, Organic Crop Improvement Association, FoodChain ID, NSF International and SCS Global Services. Differentiation hinges upon understanding all facets of food verification and the complex compliance challenges to make product verifications efficient, cost-effective, and seamless. Our core business and expertise focuses on the &#8220;on farm&#8221; verifications to a variety of standards, guidelines and criteria including source verification, natural, animal care and well-being, sustainability verification.

&#160;

SEASONALITY 

&#160; 

Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Significant portions of our revenues are typically realized during the second and third quarters of the fiscal year when the calf marketings and crop production are at their peak. Because of the seasonality of the business and our industry, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for any other quarter or for the full fiscal year.
