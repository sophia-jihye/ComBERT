 ITEM 1 BUSINESS 

&#160;

Background -- The Company was incorporated in Delaware in 2010 under the name DE Acquisition 6, Inc. The Company had no active business operations until December 2015 when it merged with Fision Holdings, Inc., an operating Minnesota corporation which is now its wholly-owned subsidiary (the "Merger"). Shortly preceding the Merger, the Company changed its corporate name in Delaware to FISION Corporation. Prior to the Merger, there were no material relationships that existed between the officers, directors and affiliates of FISION Corporation, the parent Delaware corporation, and the officers, directors and affiliates of Fision Holdings, Inc., now our wholly-owned Minnesota subsidiary corporation. The Merger became effective on December 28, 2015.

&#160;

When used in this report, the terms "Fision," "we," "us," and "our," refer to FISION Corporation, a Delaware corporation and its wholly-owned operating subsidiary Fision Holdings, Inc., a Minnesota corporation. The term "the Company" refers to the Delaware corporation prior to the Merger and to the combined Delaware and Minnesota corporations after the Merger.

&#160;

At the effective time of the Merger, each common share of Fision Holdings, Inc., the Minnesota corporation, was converted automatically into one share of common stock of FISION Corporation, the Delaware corporation. In addition, all pre-merger outstanding derivative securities of the Minnesota corporation that were exercisable, convertible or exchangeable into its common stock were exchanged automatically for similar derivative securities of the Delaware corporation based upon equivalent share amounts, exercise or conversion prices, and other terms as existed under the pre-merger derivative securities of the Minnesota corporation.

&#160;

&#160; 3 

&#160; 

&#160;

As a result of the Merger, pre-merger shareholders plus pre-merger holders of derivative securities of the Delaware corporation now own less than five percent (5%) of our total combined post-merger outstanding common stock plus reserved stock for derivative securities. Also effective with the closing of the Merger, the former sole officer and sole director of the Delaware corporation resigned from all management positions, and the following persons were appointed to serve for the parent FISION Corporation immediately in the following capacities:

&#160;

Name 

Position 

Michael Brown 

Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Board Chairman and Director

Garry Lowenthal 

Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Director

&#160;

Messrs. Brown and Lowenthal formerly held and currently hold the same management positions with our operating subsidiary Minnesota corporation.

&#160;

The Merger did not involve a public offering of our securities, and accordingly our common stock and derivative securities issued or to be issued incident to the Merger were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933 in reliance upon an exemption from such registration. Accordingly, these securities may not be offered or sold in the United States absent their registration under applicable securities laws or an available exemption from such registration requirements.

&#160;

At the effective time of the Merger, (i) a change of control of the Delaware parent corporation occurred, and (ii)the parent Delaware corporation assumed and agreed to carry on and operate the business of the Minnesota corporation as its sole line of business. Following the Merger, the Company continued to be a "smaller reporting company" as defined in Regulation S-K of the SEC. 

&#160;

The Merger has been accounted for as a "reverse merger" and recapitalization. Accordingly, for financial reporting purposes, our Minnesota subsidiary was the acquirer and the Delaware parent was the acquired company. Consequently, the assets and liabilities and operations reflected in our historical financial statements prior to the Merger are those of our Minnesota subsidiary and will be recorded at their historical cost basis; and the consolidated financial statements after the Merger will include assets and liabilities of both the Delaware and Minnesota corporations as well as the post-merger combined historical operations of both corporations.

&#160;

The tax treatment of the Merger is intended to constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as relating to such tax free reorganization exemption.

&#160;

Business of Company 

&#160;

Our business is conducted through our operating Minnesota subsidiary which is based in Minneapolis. Fision was founded and incorporated in Minnesota in 2010 by our current management to develop and create proprietary software solutions to support marketing and sales operations of both private businesses and public entities. Since then, we have developed and successfully commercialized a unique cloud-based software platform which automates and integrates digital marketing assets and marketing communications, and thus "bridges the gap" between marketing and sales of an enterprise. We believe that our innovative Fision platform, proprietary technology, forward-looking strategy, and experienced management have now positioned us to become a leader in the software marketing and sales enablement segment of the rapidly-growing software-as-a-service (SaaS) industry.

&#160;

&#160; 4 

&#160; 

&#160;

We are a global cloud-based software development and licensing company offering a proprietary software platform to automate many marketing functions in order to promote and improve sales enablement of any entity. Our innovative software system is readily scalable to adapt to fast business growth of any customer, regardless of size. Since our founding, we have been engaged primarily in the development of our software platform along with commercializing, servicing and supporting our initial customers. Except for future customary software enhancements and periodic upgrades, the development of our automated marketing platform has been completed.

&#160;

Our Fision software platform enables our customers to easily and quickly create and implement marketing campaigns to support their sales personnel while still emphasizing, protecting and enhancing their valuable brand assets. Use of our software solutions by our customers reduces substantially the time and cost incurred by them to produce and present marketing and sales campaigns and presentations for specific products or services.

&#160;

Our proprietary marketing software enables every member of our customers' marketing and sales teams, by having easy and automated access to all their digital marketing and media assets, to leverage the full power of their distinctive brands and marketing assets in every interaction with their consumers or buyers, while at the same time assuring that central marketing maintains control of the brands and related corporate integrity.

&#160;

Our current and targeted customer base ranges across diverse industries of all sizes, including banks and other financial institutions, insurance companies, hotels and other hospitality enterprises, healthcare and fitness companies, software and other technology companies, telecommunications companies, and the numerous other companies selling familiar branded products or services.

&#160;

Fision software provides three major benefits to our customers, which are (i) accelerating their revenues, (ii) improving their marketing and brand effectiveness, and (iii) reducing significantly their marketing and sales costs.

&#160;

We generate our revenues primarily from software licensing contracts typically having terms of one to three years and requiring monthly subscription fees based on the customer's number of users and locations where used. We have long-term contracts with eighteen (18) customers, and we are engaged in various stages of negotiation with or procurement of a substantial number of additional material customers. The majority of our revenues are recurring, due to the nature of our contracts.

&#160;

We have licensed our proprietary software platform primarily through direct sales obtained by our management and other direct sales personnel. In late 2014, we also implemented a secondary sales channel utilizing experienced independent national sales agencies, our "channel partners." To date we have entered into three channel partnership arrangements, and we have already realized material revenues from the efforts of these channel partners.

&#160;

The Fision Platform - Our Fision marketing software centrally collects, stores, prioritizes, organizes, streamlines, integrates and distributes the numerous digital marketing assets of our customers including videos, images, logos and other brand materials, presentations, social content and any other material marketing assets. Using Fision's automated software technology, these digital assets then become readily available for user access as determined by our customers. Our system is designed to allow any corporate marketing department the ability to instantly and seamlessly update its users with the latest digital marketing content and materials, while providing them with a simple, intuitive software interface to quickly find what they need on any digital device, anytime and anywhere. Even customers with extensive global sales networks have the ability to quickly and efficiently create and deliver customized sales campaigns or presentations to selectively targeted consumer audiences while conveying a positive, personalized and consistent brand experience.We believe that the use of our software marketing solutions by our customers results in a substantial increase in their return on investment (ROI) and their profitability.

&#160;

Advantages of our Fision platform include the following:

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Reducing the time and cost to localize marketing content, resulting in shortening the sales cycle for faster speed to market.

&#160;

&#183; 

Responding quickly to changing consumer market conditions.

&#160;

&#183; 

Enhancing the effectiveness of digital distribution to targeted consumers or buyers whether through print, email, mobile, website or social media.

&#160;

&#183; 

Providing autonomy to scattered sales force personnel to enable them to independently and quickly create locally relevant content and launch their own selling campaigns.

&#160;

&#183; 

Distribution of specialized content to selected consumer or buyer groups.

&#160;

&#183; 

Maintaining corporate and brand integrity.

&#160;

&#183; 

Facilitating regulatory compliance.

&#160;

&#183; 

Improving marketing and sales performance analytics.

&#160; Our Customers - Our potential customer base is global and virtually unlimited, since our automated marketing software solutions are totally cloud-based and scalable, and provide a multitude of digital tools and solutions which can benefit any company selling products or services, regardless of their size.

&#160;

We have written licensing agreements with eighteen (18) customers using our marketing software solutions platform. Our customers typically "stick" with us and our Fision platform, and accordingly we have received substantial recurring revenues from them on a consistent basis. Certain key customers have maintained written contracts with us for several years, including Aveda, Renewal by Andersen, PostNet, and the Vitality Group. And during recent years, we have continued to realize revenues from Flannery Hotels in 2013, Grand Casino, IronPlanet, and Full Circle Group/RAZR in 2014, and Summit Reinsurance, Life Time Fitness, Frontier Communications, and VitalityHealth/PruHealth in 2015.

&#160;

We regard our high percentage of recurring revenues received on a consistent basis to be particularly significant to our marketing strategy which emphasizes long-term relationships with our customers under written contracts. We believe that our ability to realize high recurring revenues is a keystone feature of our business model.

&#160; &#160; 

Recent Significant Marketing Developments - Our recent marketing efforts have been successful with large companies in three different industries. In late 2015, we entered into and closed two important contracts with Capella Education Co. and Pekin Insurance Company; and in 2016 we are scheduled to close a significant contract with Ariba Inc. We believe these significant new clients will result in a substantial increase in our recurring revenues from our cloud-based Fision software platform in 2016 and beyond. These three companies are as follows:

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Capella Education Co. (Capella) - Capella is a leading nationwide company in the online for-profit education industry and is based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Through its accredited, nationally-recognized and wholly-owned Capella University, Capella provides numerous online college and post-college education courses and degrees in many fields. Capella is a publicly-traded NASDAQ company with annual revenues in excess of $400 Million.

&#160;

&#183; 

Pekin Insurance Company (Pekin) &#160;- Pekin is a leading regional insurance company based in Pekin, Illinois (near Peoria) and primarily serving most Midwestern states, particularly Illinois, Ohio and Indiana. Pekin offers its customers many forms of auto, life, health, and property insurance.

&#160;

&#183; 

Ariba (a SAP company) &#160;- Ariba Inc. is a leading worldwide provider of SaaS software technology based in Sunnyvale, California, and offers procurement and contract management software services through its business commerce network. When Ariba was acquired by SAP in 2012, it produced annual revenues of $335 Million.

&#160;

In addition, our current ongoing commercial negotiations with prospective customers include a considerable number of other potential new clients, and we expect to close material contracts with 3-4 of them in the near future.

&#160;

Cloud-Based Platform - Since 2011, storage and operation of our software solutions along with the digital marketing assets and related data of our customers have been outsourced by us to take place in the "cloud." Providers of cloud services are typically referred to as "virtual servers" since they provide all digital data storage and software application services to their clients. The cloud-based service provider used by us now and for the past couple years is an established Minneapolis-based company, which offers readily scalable and secure cloud services capable of satisfying any increasing demand or changing circumstances in the needs of our customers or us. We do not have a formal long-term contract with our cloud service provider, but rather we pay $6,100 monthly on a month-to-month basis for these services and our position in their cloud. 

&#160;

We regard the hosting of our software applications, the ready digital interface with our customers, and the storage of unlimited customer data, with our cloud provider as being crucial to our operating strategy. Our major savings in expensive computer equipment, high salaried technology personnel, and costly security measures through our use of the cloud is vital to our cost of doing business. In addition, we believe that our highly qualified and experienced cloud provider is more effective in delivering our automated software solutions to our customers than we could perform in any event

&#160;

Research and Development - Since inception, the Company has committed substantial financial, personnel and other resources toward research and development efforts and activities related to the integration, commercialization and improvement of the Fision proprietary software platform. 

&#160;

&#160; 7 

&#160; 

&#160;

Our development activities are conducted both internally from our Minneapolis headquarters facility by our experienced and well-qualified development programmers and software architects, and externally from outsourced contracts with experienced independent software development companies and individuals. We own considerable servers and other computer equipment located at our Minneapolis facility, which are used by our development personnel to develop and enhance our marketing software platform.

&#160;

Our Industry 

&#160;

We are positioned in the marketing/sales segment of the broad software-as-a-service (SaaS) industry, which segment we believe from available industry data now represents annual revenues of about $22 Billion, while the entire SaaS industry has annual revenues of $76 Billion.

&#160;

Corporate spending on computer software applications and other intellectual technology (IT) has been growing at a rapid pace for many years in order to capitalize on the benefits of digital information technology. Moreover, a large amount of that spending now is being directed to support and enhance corporate marketing and sales efforts and activities. For many corporations, marketing software technologies have evolved to become a fundamental driver of IT purchasing. Indeed, a leading industry analyst recently predicted that by 2017, Chief Marketing Officers will spend more on IT than their counterpart Chief Information Officers.

&#160;

Marketing 

&#160;

We market and sell licensing rights to our proprietary software platform under written contracts with our customers which typically have one to three-year terms. Our historical customers and revenues were procured primarily through direct sales obtained by our management and direct sales force.

&#160;

Our marketing and related sales efforts and activities include generating sales leads and contract proposals with customers through our direct sales force, our management and their personal business contacts, and other persons affiliated or associated with us. Our direct marketing and sales efforts are supported by various secondary activities including participation in selected industry trade shows and conventions, certain print and digital media advertising and promotion, and solution overviews and presentations posted on our website. 

&#160;

In late 2014, we implemented a secondary sales channel which involves targeting independent national sales agencies to sell (license) our branded software products as agents paid based on their actual sales. We regard and refer to these sales agencies as our "channel partners." To date we have entered into two channel partner arrangements with experienced agencies, and we have already realized material revenues from their sales efforts. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

We currently have seven (7) full-time employees, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President of Sales, Controller/Office Manager, Customer Support Specialist, and two Programmer/Developers. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. We also intend to add a few new employees soon to support our projected business plan and growth.
