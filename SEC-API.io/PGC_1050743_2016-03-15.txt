 Item 1. BUSINESS &#160; 

The disclosures set forth in this Form 10-K are qualified by Item 1A-Risk Factors and the section captioned &#8220;Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; in Item 7-Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report and other cautionary statements set forth elsewhere in this report. The terms &#8220;Peapack,&#8221; &#8220;the Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; and &#8220;us&#8221; refer to Peapack-Gladstone Financial Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries unless otherwise indicated or the context requires otherwise.

&#160;

Peapack-Gladstone Bank&#8217;s Private Wealth Management Division 

&#160;

The Bank&#8217;s Private Wealth Management Division, is one of the largest New Jersey-based trust and investment businesses with $3.32 billion of assets under administration as of December 31, 2015. It is headquartered in Bedminster, with additional private banking locations in Morristown, Princeton and Teaneck, NJ, as well as at the Bank&#8217;s subsidiary, PGB Trust &#38; Investments of Delaware, in Greenville, DE. The Bank&#8217;s Private Wealth Management Division is known for its integrity, client service and broad range of fiduciary, investment management and tax services, designed specifically to meet the needs of high net-worth individuals, families, foundations and endowments.

&#160;

We believe our wealth management business differentiates us from our competition and adds significant value. We intend to grow this business further both in and around our market areas through our Delaware Trust subsidiary; through our existing wealth, loan and depository client base; and through our innovative private banking service model, which utilizes private bankers working together to provide fully integrated client solutions. Throughout the wealth management division and all other business lines, we will continue to provide the unparalleled personalized, high-touch service our valued clients have come to expect.

&#160; 

Our Markets 

&#160;

Our current market is defined as the NY-NJ-PA metropolitan statistical area. Our primary market areas are located in New Jersey and New York City, among the most attractive banking markets in the United States, each with a total population exceeding 8.4 million and a median household income of $72,062 for New Jersey and $52,737 for New York City as of 2010-2014, compared to the U.S. median household income of $53,482 as of 2010-2014, according to estimates from the United States Census Bureau. Somerset County, where we are headquartered, is among one of the wealthiest in New Jersey, with a 2010-2014 median household income of $100,903 according to estimates from the United States Census Bureau. We believe that these markets have economic and competitive dynamics that are consistent with our objectives and favorable to executing our growth strategy.

&#160;

Our Business Strategy 

&#160;

We began our growth strategy &#8211; Expanding Our Reach &#8211; in 2013 to principally address three industry headwinds:

&#160;

&#183; that we believed the low interest rate and tight spread environment would likely continue; &#183; that we believed costs associated with compliance and risk management would increase significantly; and &#183; that we believed our clients would continue to shift from traditional branches in favor of electronic channels. &#160;

Through 2015 the key elements of our business strategy have included:

&#183; enhanced risk management; &#183; expansion of our multifamily , and to a lesser extent our commercial real estate lending business; &#183; expansion of our commercial and industrial (C&#38;I) lending business through Private Bankers and/or Private Banking teams, who lead with deposit gathering and wealth management; and expansion of our wealth management business. &#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

In particular, we have focused on the following areas of our business: 

&#160; 

&#183; Wealth Management . We have been in the wealth management business since 1972. The business adds significant value to our Company and differentiates us from many of our competitors. Conversations with all clients and potential clients across all lines of business have included and will continue to include a wealth management discussion. The market value of the assets under administration of the wealth management division was $3.32 billion at December 31, 2015. &#160;

&#183; Commercial Lending . We have been helping businesses emerge, expand and evolve for many years. Through 2015 we grew our multifamily and to a lesser extent other commercial real estate lending businesses. We introduced a more comprehensive C&#38;I lending program designed to service individuals, professional service firms, foundations, and privately owned businesses. This C&#38;I lending program, similar to our wealth management business, has been fully integrated into our private banking platform. Private bankers focus holistically on C&#38;I lending, wealth advisory and deposit solutions to provide a high-touch, &#8220;white-glove&#8221; client service. Growth in 2016 and beyond will focus on C&#38;I lending. &#160;

&#160; &#183; &#160; Retail Banking &#8211; Deposits . We see a lot of opportunity for growth in our core markets. We continued with the concept of high-touch relationship-style banking, which we introduced in 2013, to support the affluent segment of our branch network. Much like the private banking service model, this team has intimate knowledge of all Bank products and services and serves as the primary contact for clients seeking wealth, lending and deposit solutions. The structure of this team enables our existing branch network to maintain its primary objective of providing unique and unparalleled client service. Additionally, our private banking platform has and we believe it will continue to contribute significantly to our retail deposit growth, not only through stand-alone deposit relationships, but through comprehensive new relationships associated with C&#38;I lending. &#160;

&#160; 

Governmental Policies and Legislation 

&#160; 

The banking industry is highly regulated. Statutory and regulatory controls increase a bank holding company&#8217;s cost of doing business and limit the options of its management to deploy assets and maximize income. Proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations and taxation of banks, bank holding companies and other financial institutions are frequently made in Congress, in state legislatures and before various bank regulatory agencies. The likelihood of any major changes and the impact such changes might have on the Company or the Bank is impossible to predict. The following discussion is not intended to be a complete list of all the activities regulated by the banking laws or of the impact of such laws and regulations on the Bank. It is intended only to briefly summarize some material provisions.

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly changed the bank regulatory landscape and has impacted and will continue to impact the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies.

&#160;

&#160;

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;) took over responsibility over the principal federal consumer protection laws, such as the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and the Truth in Saving Act, among others, on July 21, 2011. Institutions that have assets of $10 billion or less, such as the Bank, will continue to be supervised in this area by their primary federal regulators (in the case of the Bank, the Federal Reserve Board (&#8220;FRB&#8221;)). The Dodd-Frank Act also gave the CFPB expanded data collecting powers for fair lending purposes for both small business and mortgage loans, as well as expanded authority to prevent unfair, deceptive and abusive practices.

&#160;

In January 2013, the CFPB issued a series of final rules related to mortgage loan origination and mortgage loan servicing. In particular, the CFPB issued a final rule amending Regulation Z to implement certain amendments to the Truth in Lending Act. The rule implemented statutory changes that lengthen the time for which a mandatory escrow account established for a higher-priced mortgage loan must be maintained. The rule also exempted certain transactions from the statute&#8217;s escrow requirement. The CFPB issued a final rule implementing amendments to the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. The rule amended Regulation Z by expanding the types of mortgage loans that are subject to the protections of the Home Ownership and Equity Protections Act of 1994 (&#8220;HOEPA&#8221;), revised and expanded the tests for coverage under HOEPA, and imposed additional restrictions on mortgages that are covered by HOEPA, including a pre-loan counseling requirement. The rule also amended Regulation Z and Regulation X by imposing other requirements related to homeownership counseling.

&#160;

In addition, the CFPB amended Regulation B to implement changes to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. The revisions to Regulation B require creditors to provide applicants with free copies of all appraisals and other written valuations developed in connection with an application for a loan to be secured by a first lien on a dwelling, and require creditors to notify applicants in writing that copies of appraisals will be provided to them promptly. The CFPB also amended Regulation Z to implement requirements and restrictions to the Truth in Lending Act concerning loan originator compensation, qualifications of, and registration or licensing of loan originators, compliance procedures for depository institutions, mandatory arbitration, and the financing of single-premium credit insurance. These amendments revised or provided additional commentary on Regulation Z&#8217;s restrictions on loan originator compensation, including application of these restrictions to prohibitions on dual compensation and compensation based on a term of a transaction or a proxy for a term of a transaction, and to recordkeeping requirements. This rule also established tests for when loan originators can be compensated through certain profits-based compensation arrangements. The amendments to &#167; 1026.36(h) and (i) became effective on June 1, 2013, while the other provisions of the rule became effective on January 10, 2014.

&#160;

The final rules also implemented the ability-to-repay and qualified mortgage (QM) provisions of the Truth in Lending Act, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act (the &#8220;QM Rule&#8221;). The ability-to-repay provision requires creditors to make reasonable, good faith determinations that borrowers are able to repay their mortgages before extending the credit based on a number of factors and consideration of financial information about the borrower from reasonably reliable third-party documents. Under the Dodd-Frank Act and the QM Rule, loans meeting the definition of &#8220;qualified mortgage&#8221; are entitled to a presumption that the lender satisfied the ability-to-repay requirements. The presumption is a conclusive presumption/safe harbor for prime loans meeting the QM requirements, and a rebuttable presumption for higher-priced/subprime loans meeting the QM requirements. The definition of a &#8220;qualified mortgage&#8221; incorporates the statutory requirements, such as not allowing negative amortization or terms longer than 30 years. The QM Rule also added an explicit maximum 43 percent debt-to-income ratio for borrowers if the loan is to meet the QM definition, though some mortgages that meet GSE, FHA 

6&#160;

&#160;

and VA underwriting guidelines may, for a period not to exceed seven years, meet the QM definition without being subject to the 43 percent debt-to-income limits.

&#160;

The CFPB may issue additional final rules regarding mortgages in the future. We cannot assure you that existing or future regulations will not have a material adverse impact on our residential mortgage loan business.

&#160;

On December 10, 2013, the FRB, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the &#8220;OCC&#8221;), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the &#8220;FDIC&#8221;), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the &#8220;CFTC&#8221;) and the SEC issued final rules to implement the Volcker Rule contained in section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which generally became effective on July 21, 2015. The Volcker Rule prohibits an insured depository institution and its affiliates (referred to as &#8220;banking entities&#8221;) from: (i) engaging in &#8220;proprietary trading&#8221; and (ii) investing in or sponsoring certain types of funds (&#8220;covered funds&#8221;) subject to certain limited exceptions. The rule also effectively prohibits short-term trading strategies by any U.S. banking entity if those strategies involve instruments other than those specifically permitted for trading and prohibits the use of some hedging strategies.

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Act contains numerous other provisions affecting financial institutions of all types, many of which may have an impact on our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways. Consequently, the Dodd-Frank Act is likely to continue to increase our cost of doing business, it may limit or expand our permissible activities, and it may affect the competitive balance within our industry and market areas. The nature and extent of future legislative and regulatory changes affecting financial institutions, including as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, remains very unpredictable at this time.

&#160;

Capital Requirements 

&#160;

Pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (&#8220;FDICIA&#8221;), each federal banking agency has promulgated regulations, specifying the levels at which a financial institution would be considered &#8220;well capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;adequately capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;undercapitalized,&#8221; &#8220;significantly undercapitalized,&#8221; or &#8220;critically undercapitalized,&#8221; and to take certain mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions based on the capital level of the institution. To qualify to engage in financial activities under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, all depository institutions must be &#8220;well capitalized.&#8221; The financial holding company of a national bank will be put under directives to raise its capital levels or divest its activities if the depository institution falls from that level.

&#160;

In July 2013, the FRB published final rules establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations, referred to herein as the Basel Rules. The FDIC and the OCC have adopted substantially identical rules (in the case of the FDIC, as interim final rules). The Basel Rules implemented the Basel Committee&#8217;s December 2010 framework, commonly referred to as Basel III, for strengthening international capital standards as well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, as discussed below. The Basel Rules substantially revised the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions, including the Company and the Bank, compared to the existing U.S. risk-based capital rules. The Basel Rules defined the components of capital and addressed other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions&#8217; regulatory capital ratios. The Basel Rules also addressed risk weights and other issues affecting the denominator in banking institutions&#8217; regulatory capital ratios and replaced the existing risk-weighting approach, which was derived from Basel I capital accords of the Basel Committee, with a more risk-sensitive approach based, in part, on the standardized approach in the Basel Committee&#8217;s 2004 Basel II capital accords. The Basel Rules also implemented the requirements of Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act to remove references to credit ratings from the federal banking agencies&#8217; rules. The Basel Rules became effective for us on January 1, 2015 (subject to phase-in periods for certain components).

&#160;

The Basel Rules, among other things, (i) introduced a new capital measure called &#8220;Common Equity Tier 1,&#8221; or CET1, (ii) specified that Tier 1 capital consist of CET1 and &#8220;Additional Tier 1 capital&#8221; instruments meeting specified requirements, (iii) applied most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures to CET1 and not to the other components of capital, thus potentially requiring higher levels of CET1 in order to meet minimum ratios, and (iv) expanded the scope of the reductions/adjustments from capital as compared to existing regulations.

&#160;

Under the Basel Rules, the minimum capital ratios for the Company and the Bank as of January 1, 2015 are as follows:

&#160;

&#183; 4.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets. &#183; 6.0% Tier 1 capital (i.e., CET1 plus Additional Tier 1) to risk-weighted assets. &#183; 8.0% Total capital (i.e., Tier 1 plus Tier 2) to risk-weighted assets. 

7&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#183; 4.0% Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements (known as the &#34;leverage ratio&#34;). &#160;

When fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the Basel Rules will also require the Company and the Bank to maintain a 2.5% &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221;, composed entirely of CET1, on top of the minimum risk-weighted asset ratios, effectively resulting in minimum ratios of (i) CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7.0%, (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.5%, and (iii) total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5%. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of (i) CET1 to risk-weighted assets, (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets or (iii) total capital to risk-weighted assets above the respective minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers based on the amount of the shortfall. The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and will increase by 0.625% on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019.

&#160;

The Basel Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in common equity issued by nonconsolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1.

&#160;

Under current capital standards, the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income items included in capital are excluded for the purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios. Under the Basel Rules, the effects of certain accumulated other comprehensive items are not excluded; however, non-advanced approaches banking organizations, including the Company and the Bank, may make a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items effective as of January 1, 2015. This election was made by the Company. The deductions and other adjustments to CET1 are being phased in incrementally between January 1, 2015 and January 1, 2018.

&#160;

With respect to the Bank, the Basel Rules also revised the &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; regulations pursuant to Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, by (i) introducing a CET1 ratio requirement at each capital quality level (other than critically undercapitalized); (ii) increasing the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category; and (iii) requiring a leverage ratio of 5% to be well-capitalized. An institution will be classified as &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0 percent, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0 percent, (iii) has a CET1 ratio of at least 6.5 percent, (iv) has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5.0 percent, and (v) meets certain other requirements. An institution will be classified as &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0 percent, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.0 percent, (iii) has a CET1 ratio of at least 4.5 percent, (iv) has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 4.0 percent, and (v) does not meet the definition of &#8220;well capitalized.&#8221; An institution will be classified as &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0 percent, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0 percent, (iii) has a CETI ratio of less than 4.5 percent or (iv) has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 4.0 percent. An institution will be classified as &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0 percent, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0 percent, (iii) has a CET1 ratio of less than 3.0 percent or (iv) has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 3.0 percent. An institution will be classified as &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a tangible equity to total assets ratio that is equal to or less than 2.0 percent. An insured depository institution may be deemed to be in a lower capitalization category if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating. Similar categories apply to bank holding companies. When the capital conservation buffer is fully phased in, the capital ratios applicable to depository institutions under the Basel Rules will exceed the ratios to be considered well-capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations.

&#160;

The Basel Rules prescribe a standardized approach for calculating risk-weighted assets that expand the risk-weighting categories from the current four Basel I-derived categories (0%, 20%, 50% and 100%) to a much larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. Government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures, and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories. In addition, the Basel Rules also provide more advantageous risk weights for derivatives and repurchase-style transactions cleared through a qualifying central counterparty and increase the scope of eligible guarantors and eligible collateral for purposes of credit risk mitigation.

&#160;

The Bank&#8217;s capital ratios were all above the minimum levels required for it to be considered a &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; financial institution at December 31, 2015 under the &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; regulations in effect as of such date.

&#160;

8&#160;

&#160;

Insurance Funds Legislation 

&#160;

The Bank&#8217;s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the &#8220;FDIC&#8221;). The Deposit Insurance Fund is the successor to the Bank Insurance Fund and the Savings Association Insurance Fund, which were merged in 2006. Under the FDIC&#8217;s risk-based system, insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors with less risky institutions paying lower assessments on their deposits.

&#160;

In February 2011, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC approved a final rule that revised the assessment base to consist of average consolidated total assets during the assessment period minus the average tangible equity during the assessment period. In addition, the final revisions eliminated the adjustment for secured borrowings, including Federal Home Loan Bank advances, and made certain other changes to the impact of unsecured borrowings and brokered deposits on an institution&#8217;s deposit insurance assessment. The final rule also revised the assessment rate schedule to provide initial base assessment rates ranging from 5 to 35 basis points and total base assessment rates ranging from 2.5 to 45 basis points after adjustment.

&#160;

As previously noted above, the Dodd-Frank Act makes permanent the $250 thousand limit for federal deposit insurance. The FDIC has authority to further increase insurance assessments. A significant increase in insurance premiums may have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank. Management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future.

&#160; 

Restrictions on the Payment of Dividends 

&#160; 

The holders of the Company&#8217;s common stock are entitled to receive dividends, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors of the Company out of funds legally available. The only statutory limitation is that such dividends may not be paid when the Company is insolvent. Since the principal source of income for the Company will be dividends on Bank common stock paid to the Company by the Bank, the Company&#8217;s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders will depend on whether the Bank pays dividends to it. As a practical matter, restrictions on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends act as restrictions on the amount of funds available for the payment of dividends by the Company. As a New Jersey chartered commercial bank, the Bank is subject to the restrictions on the payment of dividends contained in the New Jersey Banking Act of 1948, as amended (the &#8220;Banking Act&#8221;). Under the Banking Act, the Bank may pay dividends only out of retained earnings, and out of surplus to the extent that surplus exceeds 50% of stated capital. Under the Financial Institutions Supervisory Act, the FDIC has the authority to prohibit a state-chartered bank from engaging in conduct that, in the FDIC&#8217;s opinion, constitutes an unsafe or unsound banking practice. Under certain circumstances, the FDIC could claim that the payment of a dividend or other distribution by the Bank to the Company constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice. The Company is also subject to FRB policies, which may, in certain circumstances, limit its ability to pay dividends. The FRB policies require, among other things, that a bank holding company maintain a minimum capital base and serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary bank. The FRB by supervisory letters has advised holding corporations that it is has supervisory concerns when the level of dividends is too high and would seek to prevent dividends if the dividends paid by the holding company exceeded its earnings. The FRB would most likely seek to prohibit any dividend payment that would reduce a holding company&#8217;s capital below these minimum amounts.

&#160;

Incentive Compensation 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies and the SEC to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities, such as the Company and the Bank, with at least $1 billion in total assets that encourage inappropriate risks by providing an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits or that could lead to material financial loss to the entity. In addition, these regulators must establish regulations or guidelines requiring enhanced disclosure to regulators of incentive-based compensation arrangements. The agencies proposed such regulations in April 2011, but the regulations have not been finalized. If the regulations are adopted in the form initially proposed, they will impose limitations on the manner in which the Company may structure compensation for its executives.

&#160;

In June 2010, the FRB, OCC and FDIC issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization&#8217;s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not 

9&#160;

&#160;

encourage risk-taking beyond the organization&#8217;s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization&#8217;s board of directors. These three principles are incorporated into the proposed joint compensation regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act, discussed in the immediately preceding paragraph.

&#160;

The FRB will review, as part of its regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as the Company, that are not &#8220;large, complex banking organizations.&#8221; These reviews will be tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization&#8217;s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization&#8217;s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization&#8217;s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization&#8217;s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.

&#160; 

Consumer Protection Regulations 

&#160; 

The Bank is subject to federal consumer protection statutes and regulations promulgated under those laws, including, but not limited to the following:

&#160;

&#183; Truth-In-Lending Act and Regulation Z, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers; &#183; Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and Regulation C, requiring financial institutions to provide certain information about home mortgage and refinanced loans; &#183; Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed, or other prohibited factors in extending credit; &#183; Fair Credit Reporting Act and Regulation V, governing the provision of consumer information to credit reporting agencies and the use of consumer information; and &#183; Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies. &#160;

The Bank&#8217;s deposit operations are also subject to the following federal statutes and regulations, among others:

&#160;

&#183; The Truth in Savings Act and Regulation DD, which requires disclosure of deposit terms to consumers; &#183; Regulation CC, which relates to the availability of deposit funds to consumers; &#183; The Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain the confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; and &#183; Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E, governing automatic deposits to, and withdrawals from, deposit accounts and customers&#8217; rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services. &#160;

Many of the foregoing laws and regulations are subject to change resulting from the provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act, which in many cases calls for revisions to implementing regulations, such as the amendments described above in the discussion on the Dodd-Frank Act.

Holding Company Supervision 

&#160;

The Company is a bank holding company within the meaning of the Holding Company Act. As a bank holding company, the Company is supervised by the FRB and is required to file reports with the FRB and provide such additional information as the FRB may require.

&#160;

The Holding Company Act prohibits the Company, with certain exceptions, from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than five percent of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank and from engaging in any business other than that of banking, managing and controlling banks or furnishing services to subsidiary banks, except that it may, upon application, engage in, and may own shares of companies engaged in, certain businesses found by the FRB to be so closely related to banking &#8220;as to be a proper incident thereto.&#8221; The Holding Company Act requires prior approval by the FRB of the acquisition by the Company of more than five percent of the voting stock of any additional bank. Satisfactory capital ratios, Community Reinvestment Act ratings and anti-money laundering policies are generally prerequisites to obtaining federal regulatory approval to make acquisitions. The policy of the FRB provides that a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support the subsidiary bank in circumstances in which it might not do so absent that policy. Acquisitions through the Bank require the approval of the FRB and the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance (&#8220;NJDOBI&#8221;).

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 

&#160; 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (&#8220;Sarbanes-Oxley Act&#8221;) added new legal requirements for public companies affecting corporate governance, accounting and corporate reporting.

&#160;

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act provides for, among other things:

&#160;

&#183; a prohibition on personal loans made or arranged by the issuer to its directors and executive officers (except for loans made by a bank subject to Regulation O); &#183; independence requirements for audit committee members; &#183; independence requirements for company auditors; &#183; certification of financial statements within the Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q by the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer; &#183; the forfeiture by the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of bonuses or other incentive-based compensation and profits from the sale of an issuer&#8217;s securities by such officers in the twelve month period following initial publication of any financial statements that later require restatement due to corporate misconduct; &#183; disclosure of off-balance sheet transactions; &#183; two-business day filing requirements for insiders filing on Form 4; &#183; disclosure of a code of ethics for financial officers and filing a Current Report on Form 8-K for a change in or waiver of such code; &#183; the reporting of securities violations &#8220;up the ladder&#8221; by both in-house and outside attorneys; &#183; restrictions on the use of non-GAAP financial measures in press releases and SEC filings; &#183; the formation of a public accounting oversight board; &#183; various increased criminal penalties for violations of securities laws; &#183; an assertion by management with respect to the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting; and &#183; a report by the company&#8217;s external auditor on management&#8217;s assertion and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. &#160;

Each of the national stock exchanges, including the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ) Global Select Market where the Company&#8217;s securities are listed, have implemented corporate governance listing standards, including rules strengthening director independence requirements for boards, and requiring the adoption of charters for the nominating and audit committees. As noted above, in 2012, the SEC adopted rules under the Dodd-Frank Act requiring the stock exchanges to adopt rules addressing the independence of Compensation Committee members and consideration of the independence of compensation advisers, and each of the exchanges, including the NASDAQ Global Select Market, have adopted such rules.

USA PATRIOT Act 

&#160; 

As part of the USA PATRIOT Act, Congress adopted the International Money Laundering Abatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001 (the &#8220;Anti Money Laundering Act&#8221;). The Anti Money Laundering Act authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the heads of other government agencies, to adopt special measures applicable to financial institutions such as banks, bank holding companies, broker-dealers and insurance companies. Among its other provisions, the Anti Money Laundering Act requires each financial institution: (i) to establish an anti-money laundering program; (ii) to establish due diligence policies, procedures and controls that are reasonably designed to detect and report instances of money laundering in United States private banking accounts and correspondent accounts maintained for non-United States persons or their representatives; and (iii) to avoid establishing, maintaining, administering, or managing correspondent accounts in the United States for, or on behalf of, a foreign shell bank that does not have a physical presence in any country. In addition, the Anti Money Laundering Act expands the circumstances under which funds in a bank account may be forfeited and requires covered financial institutions to respond under certain circumstances to requests for information from federal banking agencies within 120 hours.

&#160;

Regulations implementing the due diligence requirements, require minimum standards to verify customer identity and maintain accurate records, encourage cooperation among financial institutions, federal banking agencies, and law enforcement authorities regarding possible money laundering or terrorist activities, prohibit the anonymous use of &#8220;concentration accounts,&#8221; and requires all covered financial institutions to have in place an anti-money laundering compliance program. Federal and state banking agencies have strictly enforced various anti-money laundering and suspicious activity reporting requirements using formal and informal enforcement tools to cause banks to comply with these provisions.

&#160;

The Anti Money Laundering Act amended the Holding Company Act and the Bank Merger Act to require the federal banking agencies to consider the effectiveness of any financial institution involved in a proposed merger transaction in combating money laundering activities when reviewing an application under these acts.

Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act 

&#160; 

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Modernization Act of 1999 (&#8220;Modernization Act&#8221;) became effective in early 2000. The Modernization Act:

&#160;

&#183; allows bank holding companies meeting management, capital and Community Reinvestment Act standards to engage in a substantially broader range of non-banking activities than was previously permissible, including insurance underwriting; &#183; allows insurers and other financial services companies to acquire banks; &#183; removes various restrictions that previously applied to bank holding company ownership of securities firms and mutual fund advisory companies; and &#183; establishes the overall regulatory structure applicable to bank holding companies that also engage in insurance and securities operations. &#160;

If a bank holding company elects to become a financial holding company, it files a certification, effective in 30 days, and thereafter may engage in certain financial activities without further approvals. The Company has not elected to become a financial holding company.

&#160;

The Modernization Act modified other financial laws, including laws related to financial privacy and community reinvestment.
