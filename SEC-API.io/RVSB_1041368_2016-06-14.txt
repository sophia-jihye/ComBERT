 Item 1. Business 

General

Riverview Bancorp, Inc., a Washington corporation, is the savings and loan holding company of Riverview Community Bank (the "Bank"). At March 31, 2016, the Company had total assets of $921.2 million, total deposits of $779.8 million and shareholders' equity of $108.3 million. The Company's executive offices are located in Vancouver, Washington.

The Company is subject to regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Systems ("Federal Reserve"). Substantially all of the Company's business is conducted through the Bank which is regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC"), its primary regulator, and by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"), the insurer of its deposits. The Bank's deposits are insured by the FDIC up to applicable legal limits under the Deposit Insurance Fund ("DIF"). The Bank has been a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System ("FHLB") of Des Moines, which is one of the 11 regional banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System ("FHLB System").

As a progressive, community-oriented financial services company, the Company emphasizes local, personal service to residents of its primary market area. The Company considers Clark, Cowlitz, Klickitat and Skamania counties of Washington and Multnomah and Marion counties of Oregon as its primary market area. The counties of Multnomah, Clark and Skamania are part of the Portland metropolitan area as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau. The Company is engaged predominantly in the business of attracting deposits from the general public and using such funds in its primary market area to originate commercial business, commercial real estate, multi-family real estate, land, real estate construction, residential real estate and other consumer loans. The Company's loan portfolio totaled $614.9 million at March 31, 2016 compared to $569.0 million a year ago.

Most recently, the Company's primary focus has been on increasing commercial business loans and owner occupied commercial real estate loans with a specific focus on medical professionals and the medical industry. Beginning in 2014, the Company began purchasing from time to time pools of automobile loans from another financial institution as a way to further diversify its loan portfolio and to earn a higher yield than earned on its cash or short-term investments. These automobile loans are originated through a single dealership group located outside the Company's primary market area. The collateral for these loans is comprised of a mix of used automobiles. These loans are purchased with servicing retained by the seller

The Company's strategic plan includes targeting the commercial banking customer base in its primary market area for loan originations and deposit growth, specifically small and medium size businesses, professionals and wealth building individuals. In pursuit of these goals, the Company will seek to increase the loan portfolio consistent with its strategic plan and asset/liability and regulatory capital objectives, which includes maintaining a significant amount of commercial and commercial real estate loans in its loan portfolio. Significant portions of our new loan originations &#8211; which are mainly concentrated in commercial business, commercial real estate and multifamily loans &#8211; carry adjustable rates, higher yields or shorter terms and higher credit risk than traditional fixed-rate consumer real estate one-to-four family mortgages.

At March 31, 2016, checking accounts totaled $323.9 million, or 41.5% of our total deposit mix compared to $267.4 million or 37.1% a year ago. Our strategic plan also stresses increased emphasis on non-interest income, including increased fees for asset management through the Bank's subsidiary, Riverview Asset Management Corp. ("RAMCorp"), a trust and financial services company, and deposit service charges. The strategic plan is designed to enhance earnings, reduce interest rate risk and provide a more complete range of financial services to customers and the local communities the Company serves.

Market Area

The Company conducts operations from its home office in Vancouver and 17 branch offices located in Camas, Washougal, Stevenson, White Salmon, Battle Ground, Goldendale, Vancouver (seven branch offices) and Longview, Washington and Portland, Gresham and Aumsville, Oregon. We believe we are well positioned to attract new customers and to increase our market share through our branch network. RAMCorp is located in downtown Vancouver, Washington, and provides full-service brokerage activities, trust and asset management services. Riverview Mortgage, a mortgage broker division of the Bank, originates mortgage loans for various mortgage companies predominantly in the Vancouver/Portland metropolitan areas, as well as for the Bank. The Bank's Business and Professional Banking Division, with two lending offices in Vancouver and one lending office in Portland, Oregon offers commercial and business banking services. The Bank also operates a lending office for mortgage banking activities in Vancouver.

Vancouver is located in Clark County, Washington, which is just north of Portland, Oregon. Many businesses are located in the Vancouver area because of the favorable tax structure and lower energy costs in Washington as compared to Oregon. Companies located in the Vancouver area include Sharp Microelectronics, Hewlett Packard, Georgia Pacific, Underwriters Laboratory, Wafer Tech, Nautilus, Barrett Business Services, PeaceHealth and Fisher Investments, as well as several support industries. In addition to this industry base, the Columbia River Gorge Scenic Area and the Portland metropolitan area are sources of tourism, which has helped to transform the area from its past dependence on the timber industry.

Economic conditions in the Company's market areas have continued to improve from the recent recessionary downturn. According to the Washington State Employment Security Department, unemployment in Clark County decreased to 6.3% at March 31, 2016 compared to 6.7% at March 31, 2015. According to the Oregon Employment Department, unemployment in Portland decreased to 3.9% at March 31, 2016 compared to 4.8% at March 31, 2015. According to the Regional Multiple Listing Services ("RMLS"), residential home inventory levels in Portland, Oregon have decreased to 1.3 months at March 31, 2016 compared to 1.9 months at March 31, 2015. Residential home inventory levels in Clark County have decreased to 1.7 months at March 31, 2016 compared to 2.6 months at March 31, 2015. According to the RMLS, closed home sales in March 2016 in Clark County increased 14.2% compared to March 2015. Closed home sales during March 2016 in Portland increased 4.4% compared to March 2015. The Company has also seen an increase in sales activity for building lots during the past twelve months. Commercial real estate leasing activity and the residential real estate market in the Portland/Vancouver area have been thriving and the vacancy rates in the Portland/Vancouver area have been relatively low.

Commercial Business Lending. At March 31, 2016, the commercial business loan portfolio totaled $69.4 million, or 11.1% of total loans. Commercial business loans are typically secured by business equipment, accounts receivable, inventory or other property. The Company's commercial business loans may be structured as term loans or as lines of credit. Commercial term loans are generally made to finance the purchase of assets and usually have maturities of five years or less. Commercial lines of credit are typically made for the purpose of providing working capital and usually have a term of one year or less. Lines of credit are made at variable rates of interest equal to a negotiated margin above an index rate and term loans are at either a variable or fixed rate. The Company also generally obtains personal guarantees from financially capable parties based on a review of personal financial statements.

Commercial lending involves risks that are different from those associated with residential and commercial real estate lending. Although commercial business loans are often collateralized by equipment, inventory, accounts receivable or other business assets, the liquidation of collateral in the event of default is often an insufficient source of repayment because accounts receivable may be uncollectible and inventories may be obsolete or of limited use, among other things. Accordingly, the repayment of commercial business loans depends primarily on the cash flow and credit worthiness of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. Additionally, the borrower's cash flow may be unpredictable and collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value.

Other Real Estate Mortgage Lending. At March 31, 2016, the other real estate lending portfolio totaled $399.5 million, or 63.9% of total loans. The Company originates other real estate loans including office buildings, warehouse/industrial, retail, assisted living facilities and single-purpose facilities (collectively "commercial real estate loans"); as well as land and multi-family loans primarily located in its market area. At March 31, 2016, owner occupied properties accounted for 34.7% and non-owner occupied properties accounted for 65.3% of the Company's commercial real estate portfolio.

Commercial real estate and multi-family loans typically have higher loan balances, are more difficult to evaluate and monitor, and involve a higher degree of risk than one-to-four family residential loans. As a result, commercial real estate and multi-family loans are generally priced at a higher rate of interest than residential one-to-four family loans. Often payments on loans secured by commercial properties are dependent on the successful operation and management of the property securing the loan or business conducted on the property securing the loan; therefore, repayment of these loans may be affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. Real estate lending is generally considered to be collateral based lending with loan amounts based on predetermined loan to collateral values and liquidation of the underlying real estate collateral being viewed as the primary source of repayment in the event of borrower default. The Company seeks to minimize these risks by generally limiting the maximum loan-to-value ratio to 80% and strictly scrutinizing the financial condition of the borrower, the quality of the collateral and the management of the property securing the loan. Loans are secured by first mortgages and often require specified debt service coverage ("DSC") ratios depending on the characteristics of the collateral. The Company generally imposes a minimum DSC ratio of 1.20 for loans secured by income producing properties. Rates and other terms on such loans generally depend on our assessment of credit risk after considering such factors as the borrower's financial condition and credit history, loan-to-value ratio, DSC ratio and other factors.

The Company actively pursues commercial real estate loans. New loan originations within the Company's market area were very competitive in fiscal year 2016 as stabilizing economic conditions resulted in an increase in loan demand from creditworthy borrowers and permitted existing borrowers with non-accrual loans to return to a current payment status and refinance elsewhere. At March 31, 2016, the Company had two commercial real estate loans totaling $1.6 million on non-accrual status compared to four commercial real estate loans totaling $3.3 million at March 31, 2015. For more information concerning risks related to commercial real estate loans, see Item 1A. "Risk Factors &#8211; Our emphasis on commercial real estate lending may expose us to increased lending risks."

Land acquisition and development loans are included in the other real estate mortgage portfolio balance, and represent loans made to developers for the purpose of acquiring raw land and/or for the subsequent development and sale of residential lots. Such loans typically finance land purchases and infrastructure development of properties (i.e. roads, utilities, etc.) with the aim of making improved lots ready for subsequent sales to consumers or builders for ultimate construction of residential units. The primary source of repayment is generally the cash flow from developer sale of lots or improved parcels of land, secondary sources and personal guarantees, which may provide an additional measure of security for such loans. In recent months, statistics reflect an increase in demand and sales of building lots in the Company's primary market area resulting in an increase in the number of closed sales for land and building lots as compared to previous years. At March 31, 2016, land acquisition and development loans totaled $12.0 million, or 1.93% of total loans compared to $15.4 million, or 2.65% of total loans at March 31, 2015. The largest land acquisition and development loan had an outstanding balance at March 31, 2016 of $1.7 million and was performing according to its original payment terms. At March 31, 2016, all of the land acquisition and development loans were secured by properties located in Washington and Oregon. At both March 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had one land acquisition and development loan totaling $801,000 on non-accrual status.

Real Estate Construction. The Company originates three types of residential construction loans: (i) speculative construction loans, (ii) custom/presold construction loans and (iii) construction/permanent loans. The Company also originates construction loans for the development of business properties and multi-family dwellings. All of the Company's real estate construction loans were made on properties located in Washington and Oregon.

(1) &#160; Includes undisbursed funds of $42.7 million and $21.2 million at March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

At March 31, 2016, the balance of the Company's construction loan portfolio, including undisbursed funds, was $69.5 million compared to $51.7 million at March 31, 2015. The $17.7 million increase was primarily due to an increase of $5.2 million in speculative construction loans, $5.1 million increase in commercial/multi-family construction loans and $6.4 million increase in custom/presold construction loans. The Company plans to continue to proactively manage its construction loan portfolio in fiscal year 2017 and will continue to originate new construction loans to selected customers.

Speculative construction loans are made to home builders and are termed "speculative" because the home builder does not have, at the time of loan origination, a signed contract with a home buyer who has a commitment for permanent financing with either the Company or another lender for the finished home. The home buyer may be identified either during or after the construction period, with the risk that the builder will have to service the speculative construction loan and finance real estate taxes and other carrying costs of the completed home for a significant time after the completion of construction until a home buyer is identified. The largest speculative construction loan at March 31, 2016 was a loan to finance the construction of a single family home totaling $261,000. This loan is to a single borrower that is secured by a property located in the Company's market area. At March 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had no speculative construction loans on non-accrual.

Unlike speculative construction loans, presold construction loans are made for homes that have buyers. Presold construction loans are made to homebuilders who, at the time of construction, have a signed contract with a home buyer who has a commitment for permanent financing for the finished home from the Company or another lender. Presold construction loans are generally originated for a term of 12 months. At March 31, 2016 and 2015, presold construction loans totaled $5.0 million and $1.2 million, respectively.

Unlike speculative and presold construction loans, custom construction loans are made directly to the homeowner. At March 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had no custom construction loans. Construction/permanent loans are originated to the homeowner rather than the homebuilder along with a commitment by the Company to originate a permanent loan to the homeowner to repay the construction loan at the completion of construction. The construction phase of a construction/permanent loan generally lasts six to nine months. At the completion of construction, the Company may either originate a fixed rate mortgage loan or an adjustable rate mortgage ("ARM") loan or use its mortgage brokerage capabilities to obtain permanent financing for the customer with another lender. At completion of construction, the interest rate of the Company-originated fixed rate permanent loan is set at a market rate. For adjustable rate loans, the interest rates adjust on their first adjustment date. See "&#8212;Mortgage Brokerage," and "&#8212;Mortgage Loan Servicing." At March 31, 2016, construction/permanent loans totaled $1.9 million, the largest of which had an outstanding balance of $551,000 and was performing according to its original repayment terms.

The Company provides construction financing for non-residential business properties and multi-family dwellings. At March 31, 2016, such loans totaled $16.7 &#160; million, or 62.53% of total real estate construction loans and 2.68% of total loans. Borrowers may be the business owner/occupier of the building who intends to operate their business from the property upon construction, or non-owner developers. The expected source of repayment of these loans is typically the sale or refinancing of the project upon completion of the construction phase. In certain circumstances, the Company may provide or commit to take-out financing upon construction. Take-out financing is subject to the project meeting specific underwriting guidelines. No assurance can be given that such take-out financing will be available upon project completion. These loans are secured by office buildings, retail rental space, mini storage facilities, assisted living facilities and multi-family dwellings located in the Company's market area. At March 31, 2016, the largest commercial construction loan had a balance of $4.3 million and was performing according to its original repayment terms. At March 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had no commercial construction loans on non-accrual status.

Construction lending affords the Company the opportunity to achieve higher interest rates and fees with shorter terms to maturity than the rates and fees generated by its single-family permanent mortgage lending. Construction lending, however, generally involves a higher degree of risk than single-family permanent mortgage lending because of the inherent difficulty in estimating both a property's value at completion of the project and the estimated cost of the project, as well as the time needed to sell the property at completion. The nature of these loans is such that they are generally more difficult to evaluate and monitor. Because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs, as well as the market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation of real property, it is relatively difficult to evaluate accurately the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan-to-value ratio. Changes in the demand, such as for new housing and higher than anticipated building costs may cause actual results to vary significantly from those estimated. This type of lending also typically involves higher loan principal amounts and is often concentrated with a small number of builders. As a result, construction loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property or refinance the indebtedness, rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest. If the appraisal of the value of the completed project proves to be overstated, we may have inadequate security for the repayment of the loan upon completion of construction of the project and may incur a loss. Increases in market rates of interest may have a more pronounced effect on construction loans by rapidly increasing the end-purchasers' borrowing costs, thereby reducing the overall demand for the project. Properties under construction are often difficult to sell and typically must be completed in order to be successfully sold which also complicates the process of working out problem construction loans. This may require us to advance additional funds and/or contract with another builder to complete construction. Further, in the case of speculative construction loans, there is the added risk associated with identifying an end-purchaser for the finished project. For additional information concerning the risks related to construction lending, see Item 1A. "Risk Factors &#8211; Our real estate construction and land acquisition or development loans expose us to risk."

The Company has originated construction and land acquisition and development loans where a component of the cost of the project was the interest required to service the debt during the construction period of the loan, sometimes known as interest reserves. The Company allows disbursements of this interest component as long as the project is progressing as originally projected and if there has been no deterioration in the financial standing of the borrower or the underlying project. If the Company makes a determination that there is such deterioration, or if the loan becomes nonperforming, the Company halts any disbursement of those funds identified for use in paying interest. In some cases, additional interest reserves may be taken by use of deposited funds or through credit lines secured by separate and additional collateral.

Consumer Lending. Consumer loans totaled $129.2 million at March 31, 2016, comprised of $67.6 million of one-to-four family mortgage loans, $18.8 million of home equity lines of credit, $2.4 million of land loans to consumers for the future construction of one-to-four family homes and $40.4 million of other secured and unsecured consumer loans, which primarily consisted of purchased automobile loans.

One-to-four family residences located in the Company's primary market area secure the majority of the residential loans. Underwriting standards require that one-to-four family portfolio loans generally be owner occupied and that loan amounts not exceed 80% (95% with private mortgage insurance) of the lesser of current appraised value or cost of the underlying collateral. Terms typically range from 15 to 30 years. The Company also offers balloon mortgage loans with terms of either five or seven years and originates both fixed rate mortgages and ARMs with repricing based on the one-year constant maturity U.S. Treasury index or other index. At March 31, 2016, the Company had three residential real estate loans totaling $251,000 on non-accrual status compared to six loans totaling $1.2 million at March 31, 2015. All of these loans were secured by properties located in Oregon and Washington.

The Company also purchases, from time to time, pools of automobile loans from another financial institution as a way to further diversify its loan portfolio and to earn a higher yield than on its cash or short-term investments. These indirect automobile loans are originated through a single dealership group located outside the Company's primary market area. The collateral for these loans is comprised of a mix of used automobiles. These loans are purchased with servicing retained by the seller. The Company purchased a total of $15.6 million and $20.8 million of automobile loans during fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company may purchase additional automobile loans during fiscal year 2017, subject to these loans meeting our investment criteria, underwriting standards and internal loan concentration limits. At March 31, 2016, eight of the purchased automobile loans were on non-accrual status totaling $83,000. At March 31, 2015, two of the purchased automobile loans were on non-accrual status totaling $18,000.

The Company originates a variety of installment loans, including loans for debt consolidation and other purposes, automobile loans, boat loans and savings account loans. These consumer loans generally entail greater risk than do residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or secured by assets that depreciate rapidly, such as mobile homes, automobiles, boats and recreational vehicles. At March 31, 2016 and 2015, excluding the purchased automobile loans noted above, the Company had no installment loans on non-accrual status.

Loan Maturity. The following table sets forth certain information at March 31, 2016 regarding the dollar amount of loans maturing in the Company's total loan portfolio based on their contractual terms to maturity but does not include potential prepayments. Demand loans, loans having no stated schedule of repayments or stated maturity and overdrafts are reported as due in one year or less. Loan balances are reported net of deferred fees (in thousands).

Loan Commitments . The Company issues commitments to originate commercial loans, other real estate mortgage loans, construction loans, residential mortgage loans and other installment loans conditioned upon the occurrence of certain events. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. Commitments to originate loans are conditional and are honored for up to 45 days subject to the Company's usual terms and conditions. Collateral is not required to support commitments. At March 31, 2016, the Company had outstanding commitments to originate loans of $41.9 million compared to $17.1 million at March 31, 2015.

Mortgage Brokerage. In addition to originating mortgage loans for retention in its portfolio, the Company employs commissioned brokers who originate mortgage loans (including construction loans) for various mortgage companies, as well as for the Company. The loans brokered to mortgage companies are closed in the name of, and funded by the purchasing mortgage company and are not originated as an asset of the Company. In return, the Company receives a fee ranging from 1.5% to 2.0% of the loan amount that it shares with the commissioned broker. Loans brokered to the Company are closed on the Company's books and the commissioned broker receives a portion of the origination fee. During the year ended March 31, 2016, brokered loans totaled $43.3 million (including $39.1 million brokered to the Company) compared to $43.1 million (including $32.7 million brokered to the Company) of brokered loans in fiscal year 2015. Gross fees of $608,000, which includes brokered loan fees and loans sold to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Company ("FHLMC"), were earned for the year ended March 31, 2016. The interest rate environment has a strong influence on the loan volume and amount of fees generated from the mortgage broker activity. In general, during periods of rising interest rates, the volume of loans and the amount of loan fees generally decrease as a result of slower mortgage loan demand. Conversely, during periods of falling interest rates, the volume of loans and the amount of loan fees generally increase as a result of the increased mortgage loan demand.

Mortgage Loan Servicing. &#160; The Company is a qualified servicer for the FHLMC. The Company generally sells fixed-rate residential one-to-four family mortgage loans that it originates with maturities of 15 years or more and balloon mortgages to the FHLMC as part of its asset liability strategy. Mortgage loans are sold to the FHLMC on a non-recourse basis whereby foreclosure losses are the responsibility of the FHLMC and not the Company. The Company's general policy is to close its residential loans on the FHLMC modified loan documents to facilitate future sales to the FHLMC. Upon sale, the Company continues to collect payments on the loans, supervise foreclosure proceedings, and otherwise service the loans. At March 31, 2016, total loans serviced for others were $122.1 million, of which $117.1 million were serviced for the FHLMC.

Nonperforming Assets. &#160; Nonperforming assets were $3.3 million or 0.36% of total assets at March 31, 2016 compared with $6.9 million or 0.81% of total assets at March 31, 2015. The Company also had net recoveries totaling $273,000 during fiscal 2016 compared to $11,000 during fiscal 2015. Credit quality challenges continued to lessen in the past fiscal year and the real estate market in our primary market area has improved steadily. Although it appears the economic conditions have stabilized, a prolonged weak economy in our market area could result in increases in nonperforming assets, increases in the provision for loan losses and charge-offs in the future.

Loans are reviewed regularly and it is the Company's general policy that when a loan is 90 days delinquent or when collection of principal or interest appears doubtful, it is placed on non-accrual status, at which time the accrual of interest ceases and a reserve for any unrecoverable accrued interest is established and charged against operations. In general, payments received on non-accrual loans are applied to reduce the outstanding principal balance on a cash-basis method.

The Company has continued to focus on managing the residential construction and land acquisition and development portfolios. At March 31, 2016, the Company's residential construction and land acquisition and development loan portfolios were $10.0 million and $12.0 million, respectively as compared to $2.5 million and $15.4 million, respectively, at March 31, 2015. At March 31, 2016 and 2015, there were no nonperforming loans in the residential construction loan portfolio. At March 31, 2016 and 2015, the percentage of nonperforming loans in the land acquisition and development portfolios was 6.65% and 5.21%, respectively. For the year ended March 31, 2016, the charge-off (recovery) ratio for the residential construction and land development portfolios was (0.09)% and (2.41)%, respectively compared to 0.00% and (1.72)%, respectively, for the year ended March 31, 2015.

The following table sets forth information regarding the Company's nonperforming loans at the dates indicated (dollars in thousands).

Nonperforming loans decreased as a result of the Company's aggressive efforts to work out problem loans, seek full repayment or pursue foreclosure proceedings. All of these loans are to borrowers with properties located in Oregon and Washington, with the exception of nine automobile loans totaling $103,000 (eight nonaccrual automobile loans totaling $83,000 and one accruing automobile loan contractually 90 days past due totaling $20,000). At March 31, 2016, 86.93% of the Company's nonperforming loans, totaling $2.4 million, were measured for impairment. These loans have been charged down to the estimated fair market value of the collateral less selling costs or carry a specific reserve to reduce the net carrying value. There were no reserves associated with these impaired loans at March 31, 2016. At March 31, 2016, the largest single nonperforming loan was a commercial real estate loan totaling $1.3 million. This loan was measured for impairment during fiscal year 2016 and management determined that a specific reserve was not required.

The balance of nonperforming assets included $595,000 in real estate owned ("REO") at March 31, 2016. The REO was comprised of a residential building lot totaling $26,000 (which subsequently sold in April 2016), a land development property totaling $271,000 and a one-to-four family real estate property totaling $298,000. All of the REO properties are located in Oregon and Washington. As a result of the Company's decision to aggressively price its REO properties for quicker liquidation, the Company had $369,000 in write-downs on existing REO properties during fiscal year 2016. Total REO sales were $937,000 during fiscal year 2016. During fiscal year 2016, maintenance and operating expenses for these properties totaled $198,000. The orderly resolution of nonperforming loans and REO properties remains a priority for management. Because of the uncertain nature of the real estate market, no assurance can be given as to the timing of ultimate disposition of such assets or that the selling price will be at or above the carrying value. Declines in real estate values in our area could lead to additional valuation adjustments, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

Other loans of concern consist of loans where the borrowers have cash flow problems, or the collateral securing the respective loans may be inadequate. In either or both of these situations, the borrowers may be unable to comply with the present loan repayment terms, and the loans may subsequently be included in the non-accrual category. Management considers the allowance for loan losses to be adequate to cover the probable losses inherent in these and other loans.

At March 31, 2016, loans delinquent 30 to 89 days were 0.10% of total loans compared to 0.26% at March 31, 2015. There were no delinquent loans 30 to 89 days past due in our commercial real estate ("CRE") and commercial business loan portfolios. CRE loans represent the largest portion of our loan portfolio at 56.62% of total loans and the commercial business loans represent 11.11% of total loans.

Troubled debt restructurings ("TDRs") are loans where the Company, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower's financial condition, has granted a concession to the borrower that it would otherwise not consider. A TDR typically involves a modification of terms such as a reduction of the stated interest rate or face amount of the loan, a reduction of accrued interest, or an extension of the maturity date(s) at a stated interest rate lower than the current market rate for a new loan with similar risk.

TDRs are considered impaired loans and as such, when a loan is deemed to be impaired, the amount of the impairment is measured using discounted cash flows using the original note rate, except when the loan is collateral dependent. In these cases, the estimated fair value of the collateral (less any selling costs, if applicable) is used. Impairment is recognized as a specific component within the allowance for loan losses if the estimated value of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan. When the amount of the impairment represents a confirmed loss, it is charged off against the allowance for loan losses. At March 31, 2016, the Company had TDRs totaling $13.9 million of which $11.8 million were on accrual status. The $2.1 million of TDRs accounted for on a non-accrual basis at March 31, 2016, are included as nonperforming loans in the nonperforming asset table above. However, all of the Company's TDRs are paying as agreed except for one of the Company's commercial real estate TDRs that totaled $1.3 million at March 31, 2016, that was restructured during fiscal year 2014 and defaulted subsequent to modification. The related amount of interest income recognized on these TDRs was $644,000 for the year ended March 31, 2016.

The Company has determined that, in certain circumstances, it is appropriate to split a loan into multiple notes. This typically includes a nonperforming charged-off loan that is not supported by the cash flow of the relationship and a performing loan that is supported by the cash flow. These may also be split into multiple notes to align portions of the loan balance with the various sources of repayment when more than one exists. Generally the new loans are restructured based on customary underwriting standards. In situations where they were not, the policy exception qualifies as a concession, and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties, the loans are accounted for as TDRs.

The accrual status of a loan may change after it has been classified as a TDR. The Company's general policy related to TDRs is to perform a credit evaluation of the borrower's financial condition and prospects for repayment under the revised terms. This evaluation includes consideration of the borrower's sustained historical repayment performance for a reasonable period of time. A sustained period of repayment performance generally would be a minimum of six months and may include repayments made prior to the restructuring date. If repayment of principal and interest appears doubtful, it is placed on non-accrual status.

In accordance with the Company's policy guidelines, unsecured loans are generally charged-off when no payments have been received for three consecutive months unless an alternative action plan is in effect. Consumer installment loans delinquent six months or more that have not received at least 75% of their required monthly payment in the last 90 days are charged-off. In addition, loans discharged in bankruptcy proceedings are charged-off. Loans under bankruptcy protection with no payments received for four consecutive months will be charged-off. The outstanding balance of a secured loan that is in excess of the net realizable value is generally charged-off if no payments are received for four to five consecutive months. However, charge-offs are postponed if alternative proposals to restructure, obtain additional guarantors, obtain additional assets as collateral or a potential sale would result in full repayment of the outstanding loan balance. Once any of these or other potential sources of repayment are exhausted, the impaired portion of the loan is charged-off, unless an updated valuation of the collateral reveals no impairment. Regardless of whether a loan is unsecured or collateralized, once an amount is determined to be a confirmed loan loss it is promptly charged off.

Asset Classification. The OCC has adopted various regulations regarding problem assets of savings institutions. The regulations require that each insured institution review and classify its assets on a regular basis. In addition, in connection with examinations of insured institutions, OCC examiners have authority to identify problem assets and, if appropriate, require them to be classified. There are three classifications for problem assets: substandard, doubtful and loss (collectively "classified loans"). Substandard assets have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values questionable, and there is a high possibility of loss. An asset classified as loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the institution is not warranted.

When the Company classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, we may establish a specific allowance in an amount we deem prudent to address the risk specifically or we may allow the loss to be addressed in the general allowance. General allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been specifically allocated to particular problem assets. When a problem asset is classified by us as a loss, we are required to charge off the asset in the period in which it is deemed uncollectible.

The aggregate amount of the Company's classified loans (comprised entirely of substandard loans), general loss allowances, specific loss allowances and charge&#8209;offs were as follows at the dates indicated (in thousands):

All of the loans on non-accrual status as of March 31, 2016 were categorized as classified loans. Classified loans at March 31, 2016 were comprised of five commercial business loans totaling $363,000, six commercial real estate loans totaling $2.8 million (the largest of which was the $1.3 million TDR discussed above), one multi-family loan totaling $12,000, one land development loan totaling $801,000, three one-to-four family real estate loans totaling $251,000 and eight purchased automobile loans totaling $83,000.

Allowance for Loan Losses. The Company maintains an allowance for loan losses to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The adequacy of the allowance is evaluated monthly to maintain the allowance at levels sufficient to provide for inherent losses existing at the balance sheet date. The key components to the evaluation are the Company's internal loan review function by its credit administration, which reviews and monitors the risk and quality of the loan portfolio; as well as the Company's external loan reviews and its loan classification systems. Credit officers are expected to monitor their portfolios and make recommendations to change loan grades whenever changes are warranted. Credit administration approves any changes to loan grades and monitors loan grades. For additional discussion of the Company's methodology for assessing the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses see Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Critical Accounting Policies."

At March 31, 2016, the Company had an allowance for loan losses of $9.9 million, or 1.58% of total loans, compared to $10.8 million, or 1.86% at March 31, 2015. The decrease in the balance of the allowance for loan losses at March 31, 2016 reflects the continuing trend of lower levels of delinquent, nonperforming and classified loans and decreased charge-offs, as well as stabilizing real estate values in our market areas compared to the prior fiscal year, which resulted in the Company recording a recapture of loan losses of $1.2 million for the year ended March 31, 2016. Nonperforming loans decreased $2.6 million and 30-89 day delinquent loans also decreased $875,000 during the year ended March 31, 2016. Classified loans were $4.3 million at March 31, 2016 compared to $13.3 million at March 31, 2015. The decrease in nonperforming and classified assets can be attributed to the Company's efforts to reduce its level of nonperforming and classified assets through write-downs, collections and modifications.

The coverage ratio of allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans was 364.22% at March 31, 2016 compared to 202.37% at March 31, 2015. This coverage ratio increased from March 31, 2015 primarily as a result of the decrease in nonperforming loans. The Company's general valuation allowance to non-impaired loans was 1.60% and 1.90% at March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Management considers the allowance for loan losses to be adequate at March 31, 2016 to cover probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio based on the assessment of various factors affecting the loan portfolio and the Company believes it has established its existing allowance for loan losses in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("generally accepted accounting principles" or "GAAP"). However, a decline in local economic conditions, results of examinations by the Company's regulators, or other factors could result in a material increase in the allowance for loan losses and may adversely affect the Company's financial condition and results of operations. In addition, because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses will be adequate or that substantial increases will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate or should collateral values decline as a result of the factors discussed elsewhere in this document . 

The following table sets forth an analysis of the Company's allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands).

The Company's allowance consists of specific, general and unallocated components. The Company's specific allowance decreased from the prior year due to a decrease in the balance of impaired loans during the year. The general component also decreased from the prior year due to a decrease in the balance of classified and nonperforming loans and a decrease in charge-offs during the year. The unallocated component also decreased from the prior year as a result of the economic improvement noted in the Company's primary market area.

The following table sets forth the breakdown of the allowance for loan losses by loan category as of the date of the allocation for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands).

Investment Activities

The Board sets the investment policy of the Company. The Company's investment objectives are: to provide and maintain liquidity within regulatory guidelines; to maintain a balance of high quality, diversified investments to minimize risk; to provide collateral for pledging requirements; to serve as a balance to earnings; and to optimize returns. The policy permits investment in various types of liquid assets permissible under OCC regulation, which includes U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various federal agencies, "bank qualified" municipal bonds, certain certificates of deposit of insured banks, repurchase agreements, federal funds and mortgage-backed securities ("MBS"), but does not permit investment in non-investment grade bonds. The policy also dictates the criteria for classifying securities into one of three categories: held to maturity, available for sale or trading. At March 31, 2016, no investment securities were held for trading. See Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Critical Accounting Policies."

The Company primarily purchases agency securities with maturities of five years or less and purchases a combination of mortgage-backed securities backed by government agencies (FHLMC, Fannie Mae ("FNMA"), U.S. Small Business Administration ("SBA") or Ginnie Mae ("GNMA")). At March 31, 2016, the Company owned no privately issued mortgage-backed securities. Our real estate mortgage investment conduits ("REMICS") consist of FHLMC and FNMA securities and our CRE mortgage-backed securities consist of FNMA securities. The Company does not believe that it has any exposure to sub-prime lending in its investment securities portfolio. See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.

The following table sets forth the investment securities portfolio and carrying values at the dates indicated (dollars in thousands).

(1) For available for sale securities carried at estimated fair value, the weighted average yield is computed using amortized cost without a tax 

&#160; equivalent adjustment for tax-exempt obligations.

Management reviews investment securities quarterly for the presence of other than temporary impairment ("OTTI"), taking into consideration current market conditions, the extent and nature of changes in estimated fair value, issuer rating changes and trends, financial condition of the underlying issuers, current analysts' evaluations, the Company's ability and intent to hold investments until a recovery of estimated fair value, which may be maturity, as well as other factors. A $1.8 million investment security that the Company currently holds is a single collateralized debt obligation ("CDO") which is secured by a pool of trust preferred securities issued by other bank holding companies. There was no impairment charge of this security for the years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 or 2014. Management believes that it is probable that principal payments will exceed the Company's recorded investment in this security, that the Company does not intend to sell this security and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell this security before the anticipated recovery of the remaining amortized cost basis. The Company estimated the fair value of the security at March 31, 2016 to be $1.8 million.

For additional information related to this security and our Level 3 estimated fair value measurements see &#160; Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Comparison of Financial Condition at March 31, 2016 and 2015," "Estimated Fair Value of Level 3 Assets," and Notes 3 and 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds

General. Deposits, loan repayments and loan sales are the major sources of the Company's funds for lending and other investment purposes. Loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows and loan prepayments are significantly influenced by general interest rates and money market conditions. Borrowings may be used on a short-term basis to compensate for reductions in the availability of funds from other sources. They may also be used on a longer-term basis for general business purposes.

Deposit Accounts. The Company attracts deposits from within its primary market area by offering a broad selection of deposit instruments, including demand deposits, negotiable order of withdrawal ("NOW") accounts, money market accounts, regular savings accounts, certificates of deposit and retirement savings plans. The Company has focused on building customer relationship deposits which includes both business and consumer depositors. Deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required, the time periods the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate, among other factors. In determining the terms of its deposit accounts, the Company considers the rates offered by its competition, profitability to the Company, matching deposit and loan products and customer preferences and concerns.

The following table sets forth the average balances of deposit accounts held by the Company at the dates indicated (dollars in thousands).

Deposit accounts totaled $779.8 million at March 31, 2016 compared to $720.9 million at March 31, 2015. The Company did not have any wholesale-brokered deposits at March 31, 2016 and 2015. The Company continues to focus on core deposits and growth around customer relationships as opposed to obtaining deposits through the wholesale markets. The Company has continued to experience increased competition for customer deposits within its market area. Customer branch deposit balances increased $53.1 million since March 31, 2015. The Company had $27.1 million, or 3.5% of total deposits, in Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service ("CDARS") and Insured Cash Sweep ("ICS") deposits, which were gathered from customers within the Company's primary market-area. CDARS and ICS deposits allow customers access to FDIC insurance on deposits exceeding the $250,000 FDIC insurance limit.

At March 31, 2016 and 2015, deposits from RAMCorp totaled $4.9 million and $4.4 million, respectively. These deposits were included in interest-bearing accounts and represent assets under management by RAMCorp. At March 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company also had $15.5 million and $12.4 million, respectively in deposits from public entities located in the States of Washington and Oregon, all of which were fully covered by FDIC insurance or secured by pledged collateral.

The Company is enrolled in an internet deposit listing service. Under this listing service, the Company may post certificates of deposit rates on an internet site where institutional investors have the ability to deposit funds with the Company. At March 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not have any deposits through this listing service as the Company chose not to utilize these internet based deposits. Although the Company does not currently have any internet based deposits, the Company will continue to have access to these funds in the future. The Company may also utilize the internet deposit listing service to purchase certificates of deposit at other financial institutions.

Deposit growth remains a key strategic focus for the Company and our ability to achieve deposit growth, particularly growth in core deposits, is subject to many risk factors including the effects of competitive pricing pressures, changing customer deposit behavior, and increasing or decreasing interest rate environments. Adverse developments with respect to any of these risk factors could limit the Company's ability to attract and retain deposits and could have a material negative impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

The following table presents the amount and weighted average rate of certificates of deposit equal to or greater than $100,000 at March 31, 2016 (dollars in thousands).

Borrowings. Deposits are the primary source of funds for the Company's lending and investment activities and for its general business purposes. The Company relies upon advances from the FHLB and borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco ("FRB") to supplement its supply of lendable funds and to meet deposit withdrawal requirements. Advances from the FHLB and borrowings from the FRB are typically secured by the Bank's commercial loans, commercial real estate loans, first mortgage loans and investment securities. At March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Bank did not have any FHLB advances or FRB borrowings.

The FHLB functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for member financial institutions. As a member, the Bank is required to own capital stock in the FHLB and is authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain of its mortgage loans and other assets (primarily securities which are obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States) provided certain standards related to creditworthiness have been met. The FHLB determines specific lines of credit for each member institution and the Bank has a line of credit with the FHLB equal to 35% of its total assets to the extent the Bank provides qualifying collateral and holds sufficient FHLB stock. At March 31, 2016, the Bank had an available credit capacity of $309.3 million, subject to sufficient collateral and stock investment.

The Bank also has a borrowing arrangement with the FRB with an available credit facility of $60.4 million, subject to pledged collateral, as of March 31, 2016. The following table sets forth certain information concerning the Company's borrowings for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands).

At March 31, 2016, the Company had two wholly-owned subsidiary grantor trusts totaling $22.7 million that were established for the purpose of issuing trust preferred securities and common securities. The trust preferred securities accrue and pay distributions periodically at specified annual rates as provided in each trust agreement. The trusts used the net proceeds from each of the offerings to purchase a like amount of junior subordinated debentures (the "Debentures") of the Company. The Debentures are the sole assets of the trusts. The Company's obligations under the Debentures and related documents, taken together, constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by the Company of the obligations of the trusts. The trust preferred securities are mandatorily redeemable upon maturity of the Debentures or upon earlier redemption as provided in the indentures. The Company has the right to redeem the Debentures in whole or in part on or after specific dates, at a redemption price specified in the indentures governing the Debentures plus any accrued but unpaid interest to the redemption date. The Company also has the right to defer the payment of interest on each of the Debentures for a period not to exceed 20 consecutive quarters, provided that the deferral period does not extend beyond the stated maturity. During such deferral period, distributions on the corresponding trust preferred securities will also be deferred and the Company may not pay cash dividends to the holders of shares of the Company's common stock. The common securities issued by the grantor trusts were purchased by the Company, and the Company's investment in the common securities of $681,000 at March 31, 2016 and 2015 is included in prepaid expenses and other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets included in the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. See also Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

Subsidiary Activities

Under OCC regulations, the Bank is authorized to invest up to 3% of its assets in subsidiary corporations, with amounts in excess of 2% only if primarily for community purposes. At March 31, 2016, the Bank's investments in its wholly owned subsidiaries of $1.2 million in Riverview Services, Inc. ("Riverview Services") and $4.3 million in RAMCorp were within these limitations.

REGULATION

The following is a brief description of certain laws and regulations, which are applicable to the Company and the Bank. The description of these laws and regulations, as well as descriptions of laws and regulations contained elsewhere herein, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the applicable laws and regulations.

Legislation is introduced from time to time in the United States Congress ("Congress") that may affect the Company's and Bank's operations. In addition, the regulations governing the Company and the Bank may be amended from time to time by the OCC, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board or the SEC, as appropriate. Any such legislation or regulatory changes in the future could have an adverse effect &#160; on our operations and financial condition. We cannot predict whether any such changes may occur.

General

As a federally chartered savings bank, the Bank is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the OCC, as its primary federal regulator, and the FDIC, as the insurer of its deposits. Additionally, the Company is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve Board as its primary federal regulator. The Bank is a member of the FHLB System and its deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the DIF, which is administered by the FDIC. The Bank must file reports with the OCC and the FDIC concerning its activities and financial condition in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other financial institutions. There are periodic examinations by the OCC, the Federal Reserve and under certain circumstances, the FDIC, to evaluate the Bank's safety and soundness and compliance with various regulatory requirements. This regulatory structure establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which the Bank may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the DIF and depositors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Any change in such policies, whether by the OCC, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on the Company and the Bank and their operations.

In connection with the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act"), the laws and regulations affecting depository institutions and their holding companies have changed the bank regulatory structure and are affecting the lending, investment, trading and operating activities of depository institutions and their holding companies. Among other changes, the Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the Office of Thrift Supervision, the Bank's previous primary federal regulator, as of July 21, 2011 and established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB") as an independent bureau of the Federal Reserve Board. The CFPB assumed responsibility for the implementation of the federal financial consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations and has authority to impose new requirements. The Bank is subject to consumer protection regulations issued by the CFPB, but as a smaller financial institution, the Bank is generally subject to supervision and enforcement by the FDIC and the OCC with respect to its compliance with consumer financial protection laws and CFPB regulations.

Many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to delayed effective dates and/or rulemaking by the federal banking agencies. Their impact on operations cannot yet fully be assessed. However, it is likely that the Dodd-Frank Act will increase the regulatory burden, compliance costs and interest expense for the Bank, the Company and the financial services industry in general.

Federal Regulation of Savings Institutions

Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. &#160; The OCC has extensive authority over the operations of savings institutions. As part of this authority, the Bank is required to file periodic reports with the OCC and is subject to periodic examinations by the OCC. The OCC also has extensive enforcement authority over all savings institutions, including the Bank. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, issue cease-and-desist or removal orders and initiate prompt corrective action orders. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. Other actions or inactions may provide the basis for enforcement action, including misleading or untimely reports filed with the OCC. Except under certain circumstances, public disclosure of final enforcement actions by the OCC is required by law.

All savings institutions are required to pay assessments to the OCC to fund the agency's operations. The general assessments, paid on a semi-annual basis, are determined based on the savings institution's total assets, including consolidated subsidiaries. The Bank's OCC assessment for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 was $215,000.

The Bank's general permissible lending limit for loans-to-one-borrower is equal to the greater of $500,000 or 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus (except for loans fully secured by certain readily marketable collateral, in which case this limit is increased to 25% of unimpaired capital and surplus). At March 31, 2016, the Bank's lending limit under this restriction was $16.0 million and, at that date, the Bank's largest lending relationship with one borrower was $14.4 million, which consisted of one commercial construction loan which was performing according to its original payment terms.

The OCC's oversight of the Bank includes reviewing its compliance with the customer privacy requirements imposed by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 ("GLBA") and the anti-money laundering provisions of the USA Patriot Act. The GLBA privacy requirements place limitations on the sharing of consumer financial information with unaffiliated third parties. They also require each financial institution offering financial products or services to retail customers to provide such customers with its privacy policy and with the opportunity to "opt out" of the sharing of their personal information with unaffiliated third parties. The USA Patriot Act significantly expands the responsibilities of financial institutions in preventing the use of the United States' financial system to fund terrorist activities. Its anti-money laundering provisions require financial institutions operating in the United States to develop anti-money laundering compliance programs and due diligence policies and controls to ensure the detection and reporting of money laundering. These compliance programs are intended to supplement existing compliance requirements under the Bank Secrecy Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulations.

The OCC, as well as the other federal banking agencies, has adopted guidelines establishing safety and soundness standards on such matters as loan underwriting and documentation, asset quality, earnings standards, internal controls and audit systems, interest rate risk exposure and compensation and other employee benefits. Any institution that fails to comply with these standards must submit a compliance plan.

Capital Requirements. &#160; Federally insured savings institutions, such as the Bank, are required by the OCC to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital.

Effective January 1, 2015 (with some changes transitioned into full effectiveness over two to four years), the Bank is subject to the new capital requirements adopted by the OCC. These new requirements create a new required ratio for common equity Tier 1 ("CET1") capital, increase the minimum leverage and Tier 1 capital ratios, change the risk-weightings of certain assets for purposes of the risk-based capital ratios, create an additional capital conservation buffer over the required capital ratios and change what qualifies as capital for purposes of meeting these various capital requirements. These regulations implement the regulatory capital reforms required by the Dodd Frank Act and the "Basel III" requirements. Under the new capital regulations, the Bank is required to maintain additional levels of Tier 1 common equity over the minimum risk-based capital levels before it may pay dividends, repurchase shares or pay discretionary bonuses. Under the new capital regulations, the minimum capital ratios applicable to the Bank are: (i) a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6%; (iii) a total capital ratio of 8%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%.

In addition to the new capital requirements, there are a number of changes in what constitutes regulatory capital subject to transition periods. These changes include the phasing-out of certain instruments as qualifying capital. The Bank does not have any of these instruments. Mortgage servicing rights and certain deferred tax assets over designated percentages of CET1 are deducted from capital subject to a transition period ending December 31, 2017. In addition, Tier 1 capital includes accumulated other comprehensive income, which includes all unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities, subject to a transition period ending December 31, 2017. Because of the Bank's asset size, the bank elected to take a one-time option to permanently opt-out of the inclusion of unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities in its capital calculations.

The new requirements also include changes in the risk-weightings of assets to better reflect credit risk and other risk exposures. These include a 150% risk weight (up from 100%) for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans and for non-residential mortgage loans that are 90 days past due or otherwise in non-accrual status; a 20% (up from 0%) credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable; and a 250% risk weight (up from 100%) for mortgage servicing and deferred tax assets that are not deducted from capital.

In addition to the minimum CET1, Tier 1 and total capital ratios, the Bank will have to maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional CET1 capital greater than 2.5% of risk-weighted assets above the required minimum levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses based on percentages of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions. This new capital conservation buffer requirement is to being phased in, which began in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase each year until fully implemented in January 2019.

Under the new standards, in order to be considered well-capitalized, the Bank must maintain a CET1 risk-based ratio of 6.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based ratio of 8% (increased from 6%), a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% (unchanged) and a leverage ratio of 5% (unchanged).

As of March 31, 2016, the most recent notification from the OCC categorized the Bank as "well capitalized" under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. For additional information, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

Prompt Corrective Action. &#160; The OCC is required to take certain supervisory actions against undercapitalized savings institutions, the severity of which depends upon the institution's degree of undercapitalization. Subject to a narrow exception, the OCC is required to appoint a receiver or conservator for a savings institution that is "critically undercapitalized." OCC regulations also require that a capital restoration plan be filed with the OCC within 45 days of the date a savings institution receives notice that it is "undercapitalized," "significantly undercapitalized" or "critically undercapitalized." In addition, numerous mandatory supervisory actions become immediately applicable to an undercapitalized institution, including, but not limited to, increased monitoring by regulators and restrictions on growth, capital distributions and expansion. "Significantly undercapitalized" and "critically undercapitalized" institutions are subject to more extensive mandatory regulatory actions. The OCC also could take a number of discretionary supervisory actions, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors. At March 31, 2016, the Bank's capital ratios met the new regulatory capital requirements described above to be considered as "well capitalized".

Federal Home Loan Bank System. &#160; The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Des Moines following the voluntary merger of the FHLB of Seattle with and into FHLB Des Moines effective May 31, 2015. The FHLB of Des Moines is one of 11 regional FHLBs that administer the home financing credit function of savings institutions. Each FHLB serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. It is funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB System. It makes loans or advances to members in accordance with policies and procedures, established by the Board of Directors of the FHLB, which are subject to the oversight of the Federal Housing Finance Board. All advances from the FHLB are required to be fully secured by sufficient collateral as determined by the FHLB. In addition, all long-term advances are required to provide funds for residential home financing. See Business &#8211; "Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds &#8211; Borrowings." As a member, the Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB of Des Moines. At March 31, 2016, the Bank held $1.1 million in FHLB stock, which was in compliance with this requirement. During the year ended March 31, 2016, the FHLB of Des Moines repurchased $4.9 million of its stock, at par, from the Bank.

The FHLBs continue to contribute to low- and moderately-priced housing programs through direct loans or interest subsidies on advances targeted for community investment and low- and moderate-income housing projects. These contributions have adversely affected the level of FHLB dividends paid and could continue to do so in the future. These contributions could also have an adverse effect on the value of FHLB stock in the future. A reduction in value of the Bank's FHLB stock may result in a decrease in net income and possibly capital.

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation . The DIF of the FDIC insures deposits in the Bank up to $250,000 per separately insured depositor. As insurer, the FDIC imposes deposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by FDIC-insured institutions. The Bank's deposit insurance premiums for the year ended March 31, 2016 were $500,000.

The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC's deposit insurance assessments to be based on assets instead of deposits. The FDIC has issued rules which specify that the assessment base for a bank is equal to its total average consolidated assets less average tangible capital. The FDIC assessment rates range from approximately five basis points to 35 basis points, depending on applicable adjustments for unsecured debt issued by an institution and brokered deposits (and to further adjustment for institutions that hold unsecured debt of other FDIC-insured institutions), until such time as the FDIC's reserve ratio equals 1.15%. Once the FDIC's reserve ratio reaches 1.15% and the reserve ratio for the immediately prior assessment period is less than 2.0%, the applicable assessment rates may range from three basis points to 30 basis points (subject to 

&#160;

adjustments as described above). If the reserve ratio for the prior assessment period is equal to, or greater than 2.0% and less than 2.5%, the assessment rates may range from two basis points to 28 basis points and if the reserve ratio for the prior assessment period is greater than 2.5%, the assessment rates may range from one basis point to 25 basis points (in each case subject to adjustments as described above). No institution may pay a dividend if it is in default on its federal deposit insurance assessment.

&#160;

The FDIC imposes an assessment for deposit insurance on all depository institutions. Under the FDIC's risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned to risk categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors. An institution's assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned and certain adjustments specified by FDIC regulations, with institutions deemed less risky paying lower rates. Assessment rates (inclusive of possible adjustments) currently range from 2 &#189; to 45 basis points of each institution's total assets less tangible capital. The FDIC may increase or decrease the scale uniformly, except that no adjustment can deviate more than two basis points from the base scale without notice and comment rulemaking. The FDIC's current system represents a change, required by the Dodd-Frank Act, from its prior practice of basing the assessment on an institution's volume of deposits.

The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum target DIF ratio from 1.15% of estimated insured deposits to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. The FDIC must seek to achieve the 1.35% ratio by September 30, 2020 with insured institutions with assets of $10 billion or more to fund the increase. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the 1.5% maximum fund ratio, instead leaving it to the discretion of the FDIC and the FDIC has exercised that discretion by establishing a long term fund ratio of 2%.

The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. Any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank. No predictions can be made as to what assessment rates will be in the future.

In addition to the FDIC assessments, the Financing Corporation is authorized to impose and collect, through the FDIC, assessments for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued in the 1980s to recapitalize the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The bonds issued by the Financing Corporation are due to mature in 2017 through 2019.

The FDIC conducts examinations of and requires reporting by state non-member banks, such as the Bank. The FDIC also may prohibit any insured institution from engaging in any activity determined by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the DIF. The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution, including the Bank, if it determines after a hearing that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, order or any condition imposed by an agreement with the FDIC. It also may suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for the permanent termination of insurance, if the institution has no tangible capital. If insurance of accounts is terminated, the accounts at the institution at the time of the termination, less subsequent withdrawals, shall continue to be insured for a period of six months to two years, as determined by the FDIC. Management is not aware of any existing circumstances which would result in termination of the deposit insurance of the Bank.

Qualified Thrift Lender Test. &#160; All savings institutions, including the Bank, are required to meet a qualified thrift lender ("QTL") test to avoid certain restrictions on their operations. This test requires a savings institution to have at least 65% of its total assets, as defined by regulation, in qualified thrift investments on a monthly average for nine out of every 12 months on a rolling basis. As an alternative, the savings institution may maintain 60% of its assets in those assets specified in Section 7701(a) (19) of the Internal Revenue Code ("Code"). Under either test, such assets primarily consist of residential housing related loans and investments.

Any institution that fails to meet the QTL test is subject to certain operating restrictions and may be required to convert to a national bank charter. As of March 31, 2016, the Bank maintained 90.57% of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments and therefore met the QTL test.

Limitations on Capital Distributions. OCC regulations impose various restrictions on savings institutions with respect to their ability to make distributions of capital, which include dividends, stock redemptions or repurchases, cash-out mergers and other transactions charged to the capital account. Generally, savings institutions, such as the Bank, that before and after the proposed distribution are well-capitalized, may make capital distributions during any calendar year equal to up to 100% of net income for the year-to-date plus retained net income for the two preceding years. However, an institution deemed to be in need of more than normal supervision by the OCC may have its dividend authority restricted by the OCC. If the Bank, however, proposes to make a capital distribution when it does not meet its capital requirements (or will not following the 

&#160;

proposed capital distribution) or that will exceed these net income-based limitations, it must obtain the OCC's approval prior to making such distribution. In addition, the Bank must file a prior written notice of a dividend with the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve or the OCC may object to a capital distribution based on safety and soundness concerns. Additional restrictions on Bank dividends may apply if the Bank fails the QTL test. In addition, as noted above, beginning in 2016, if the Bank does not have the required capital conservation buffer, its ability to pay dividends to the Company would be limited, which may limit the ability of the Company to pay dividends to its stockholders

Activities of Associations and their Subsidiaries. &#160; When a savings institution establishes or acquires a subsidiary or elects to conduct any new activity through a subsidiary that the saving institution controls, the savings institution must file a notice or application with the FDIC and the OCC at least 30 days in advance and receive regulatory approval or non-objection. Savings institutions also must conduct the activities of subsidiaries in accordance with existing regulations and orders.

The OCC may determine that the continuation by a savings institution of its ownership control of, or its relationship to, the subsidiary constitutes a serious risk to the safety, soundness or stability of the savings institution or is inconsistent with sound banking practices or with the purposes of the FDIC. Based upon that determination, the FDIC or the OCC has the authority to order the savings institution to divest itself of control of the subsidiary. The FDIC also may determine by regulation or order that any specific activity poses a serious threat to the DIF. If so, it may require that no FDIC insured institution engage in that activity directly.

Transactions with Affiliates. The Bank's authority to engage in transactions with "affiliates" is limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act as implemented by the Federal Reserve's Regulation W. The term "affiliates" for these purposes generally means any company that controls or is under common control with an institution. The Company and its non-savings institution subsidiaries are affiliates of the Bank. In general, transactions with affiliates must be on terms that are as favorable to the institution as comparable transactions with non-affiliates. In addition, certain types of transactions are restricted to an aggregate percentage of the institution's capital. Collateral in specified amounts must be provided by affiliates in order to receive loans from an institution. In addition, savings institutions are prohibited from lending to any affiliate that is engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and no savings institution may purchase the securities of any affiliate other than a subsidiary. Federally insured savings institutions are subject, with certain exceptions, to certain restrictions on extensions of credit to their parent holding companies or other affiliates, on investments in the stock or other securities of affiliates and on the taking of such stock or securities as collateral from any borrower. In addition, these institutions are prohibited from engaging in certain tying arrangements in connection with any extension of credit or the providing of any property or service.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("Sarbanes-Oxley Act") generally prohibits a company that makes filings with the SEC from making loans to its executive officers and directors. That act, however, contains a specific exception for loans by a depository institution to its executive officers and directors, if the lending is in compliance with federal banking laws. Under such laws, the Bank's authority to extend credit to executive officers, directors and 10% stockholders ("insiders"), as well as entities which such persons control, is limited. The law restricts both the individual and aggregate amount of loans the Bank may make to insiders based, in part, on the Bank's capital position and requires certain Board approval procedures to be followed. Such loans must be made on terms substantially the same as those offered to unaffiliated individuals and not involve more than the normal risk of repayment. There is an exception for loans made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to all employees of the institution and does not give preference to insiders over other employees. There are additional restrictions applicable to loans to executive officers.

Community Reinvestment Act and Consumer Protection Laws. &#160; Under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 ("CRA"), every FDIC-insured institution has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with safe and sound banking practices to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution's discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. The CRA requires the OCC, in connection with the examination of the Bank, to assess the institution's record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications, such as a merger or the establishment of a branch, by the Bank. The OCC may use an unsatisfactory rating as the basis for the denial of an application. Due to the heightened attention being given to the CRA in the past few years, the Bank may be required to devote additional funds for investment and lending in its local community.

&#160;

In connection with its deposit-taking, lending and other activities, the Bank is subject to a number of federal laws designed to protect consumers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy and population. The CFPB issues regulations and standards under these federal consumer protection laws, which include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. Through its rulemaking authority, the CFPB has promulgated several proposed and final regulations under these laws that will affect our consumer businesses. Among these regulatory initiatives, are final regulations setting "ability to repay" and "qualified mortgage" standards for residential mortgage loans and establishing new mortgage loan servicing and loan originator compensation standards. The Bank is evaluating these recent CFPB regulations and proposals and devotes substantial compliance, legal and operational business resources to ensure compliance with these consumer protection standards. In addition, the OCC has enacted customer privacy regulations that limit the ability of the Bank to disclose nonpublic consumer information to non-affiliated third parties. The regulations require disclosure of privacy policies and allow consumers to prevent certain personal information from being shared with non-affiliated parties

Enforcement. &#160; The OCC has primary enforcement responsibility over savings institutions and has the authority to bring action against all "institution-affiliated parties," including shareholders, and any attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on an insured institution. Formal enforcement action may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order to removal of officers or directors, receivership, conservatorship or termination of deposit insurance. Civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and can range from $25,000 to $1.1 million per day. The FDIC has the authority to recommend to the OCC that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular savings institution. If action is not taken by the OCC, the FDIC has authority to take such action under certain circumstances. Federal law also establishes criminal penalties for certain violations.

Standards for Safety and Soundness. As required by statute, the federal banking agencies have adopted Interagency Guidelines prescribing Standards for Safety and Soundness. The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the OCC determines that a savings institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the OCC may require the institution to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard.

Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve Board requires that all depository institutions maintain reserves on transaction accounts or non-personal time deposits. These reserves may be in the form of cash or non-interest-bearing deposits with the regional Federal Reserve Bank. Interest-bearing checking accounts and other types of accounts that permit payments or transfers to third parties fall within the definition of transaction accounts and are subject to Regulation D reserve requirements, as are any non-personal time deposits at a bank. At March 31, 2016, the Bank was in compliance with these reserve requirements. The balances maintained to meet the reserve requirements imposed by the Federal Reserve Board may be used to satisfy any liquidity requirements that may be imposed by the OCC.

Commercial Real Estate Lending Concentrations . The federal banking agencies have issued guidance on sound risk management practices for concentrations in commercial real estate lending. The particular focus is on exposure to commercial real estate loans that are dependent on the cash flow from the real estate held as collateral and that are likely to be sensitive to conditions in the commercial real estate market (as opposed to real estate collateral held as a secondary source of repayment or as an abundance of caution). The purpose of the guidance is not to limit a bank's commercial real estate lending but to guide banks in developing risk management practices and capital levels commensurate with the level and nature of real estate concentrations. The guidance directs the FDIC and other bank regulatory agencies to focus their supervisory resources on institutions that may have significant commercial real estate loan concentration risk. A bank that has experienced rapid growth in commercial real estate lending, has notable exposure to a specific type of commercial real estate loan, or is approaching or exceeding the following supervisory criteria may be identified for further supervisory analysis with respect to real estate concentration risk:

&#8226;

Total reported loans for construction, land development and other land represent 100% or more of the bank's capital; or

&#8226;

Total commercial real estate loans (as defined in the guidance) represent 300% or more of the bank's total capital or the outstanding balance of the bank's commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months.

The guidance provides that the strength of an institution's lending and risk management practices with respect to such concentrations will be taken into account in supervisory guidance on evaluation of capital adequacy.

&#160;

Environmental Issues Associated with Real Estate Lending. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), is a federal statute that generally imposes strict liability on all prior and present "owners and operators" of sites containing hazardous waste. However, Congress acted to protect secured creditors by providing that the term "owner and operator" excludes a person whose ownership is limited to protecting its security interest in the site. Since the enactment of the CERCLA, this "secured creditor exemption" has been the subject of judicial interpretations which have left open the possibility that lenders could be liable for cleanup costs on contaminated property that they hold as collateral for a loan. To the extent that legal uncertainty exists in this area, all creditors, including the Bank, that have made loans secured by properties with potential hazardous waste contamination (such as petroleum contamination) could be subject to liability for cleanup costs, which could substantially exceed the value of the collateral property.

Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering Laws. The Bank is subject to the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the USA Patriot Act of 2001. These laws and regulations require the Bank to implement policies, procedures, and controls to detect, prevent, and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers. Violations of these requirements can result in substantial civil and criminal sanctions. In addition, provisions of the USA Patriot Act require the federal financial institution regulatory agencies to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution's anti-money laundering activities when reviewing mergers and acquisitions

Other Consumer Protection Laws and Regulations. The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB and empowered it to exercise broad regulatory, supervisory and enforcement authority with respect to both new and existing consumer financial protection laws. The Bank is subject to consumer protection regulations issued by the CFPB, but as a financial institution with assets of less than $10 billion, the Bank is generally subject to supervision and enforcement by the FDIC and the OCC with respect to our compliance with consumer financial protection laws and CFPB regulations.

The Bank is subject to a broad array of federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations that govern almost every aspect of its business relationships with consumers. While the list set forth below is not exhaustive, these include the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfers Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act, the Fair Credit Billing Act, the Homeowners Protection Act, the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act, laws governing flood insurance, laws governing consumer protections in connection with the sale of insurance, federal and state laws prohibiting unfair and deceptive business practices, and various regulations that implement some or all of the foregoing. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans, collecting loans, and providing other services. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can subject the Bank to various penalties, including but not limited to, enforcement actions, injunctions, fines, civil liability, criminal penalties, punitive damages, and the loss of certain contractual rights.

Savings and Loan Holding Company Regulations

General. The Company is a unitary savings and loan holding company subject to regulatory oversight of the Federal Reserve. Accordingly, the Company is required to register and file reports with the Federal Reserve and is subject to regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve. In addition, the Federal Reserve has enforcement authority over the Company and its non-savings institution subsidiaries, which also permits the Federal Reserve to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to present a serious risk to the subsidiary savings institution. In accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act, the federal banking regulators must require any company that controls an FDIC-insured depository institution to serve as a source of strength for the institution, with the ability to provide financial assistance if the institution suffers financial distress. These and other Federal Reserve policies may restrict the Company's ability to pay dividends

Capital Requirements. For a savings and loan holding company with less than $1.0 billion in assets, the capital guidelines apply on a bank only basis and the Federal Reserve expects the holding company's subsidiary banks to be well capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations. If the Company was subject to regulatory guidelines for bank holding companies with $1.0 billion or more in assets, at March 31, 2016, the Company would have exceeded all regulatory capital requirements. For a description of the new capital regulations, see "-Federal Regulation of Savings Institutions-- Capital Requirements" above.

Activities Restrictions. The GLBA provides that no company may acquire control of a savings association after May 4, 1999 unless it engages only in the financial activities permitted for financial holding companies under the law or for multiple savings and loan holding companies as described below. Further, the GLBA specifies that, subject to a grandfather provision, existing savings and loan holding companies may only engage in such activities. The Company qualifies for the grandfathering and is therefore not restricted in terms of its activities. Upon any non-supervisory acquisition by the Company of another savings association as a separate subsidiary, the Company would become a multiple savings and loan holding company and would be limited to activities permitted by Federal Reserve regulation. The Federal Reserve has issued an interpretation concluding that multiple savings holding companies may also engage in activities permitted for financial holding companies, including lending, trust services, insurance activities and underwriting, investment banking and real estate investments. 

&#160;

Mergers and Acquisitions. The Company must obtain approval from the Federal Reserve before acquiring more than 5% of the voting stock of another savings institution or savings and loan holding company or acquiring such an institution or holding company by merger, consolidation or purchase of its assets. In evaluating an application for the Company to acquire control of a savings institution, the Federal Reserve would consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the Company and the target institution, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the DIF, the convenience and the needs of the community and competitive factors.

The Federal Reserve may not approve any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings institutions in more than one state, subject to two exceptions; (i) the approval of interstate supervisory acquisitions by savings and loan holding companies and (ii) the acquisition of a savings institution in another state if the laws of the state of the target savings institution specifically permit such acquisitions. The states vary in the extent to which they permit interstate savings and loan holding company acquisitions.

Acquisition of the Company. &#160; Any company, except a bank holding company, that acquires control of a savings association or savings and loan holding company becomes a "savings and loan holding company" subject to registration, examination and regulation by the Federal Reserve and must obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve under the Savings and Loan Holding Company Act before obtaining control of a savings association or savings and loan holding company. A bank holding company must obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act before obtaining control of a savings association or savings and loan holding company and remains subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act. The term "company" includes corporations, partnerships, associations, and certain trusts and other entities. "Control" of a savings association or savings and loan holding company is deemed to exist if a company has voting control, directly or indirectly, of more than 25% of any class of the savings association's voting stock or controls in any manner the election of a majority of the directors of the savings association or savings and loan holding company, and may be presumed under other circumstances, including, but not limited to, holding 10% or more of a class of voting securities if the institution has a class of registered securities, as the Company has. Control may be direct or indirect and may occur through acting in concert with one or more other persons. In addition, a savings and loan holding company must obtain Federal Reserve approval prior to acquiring voting control of more than 5% of any class of voting stock of another savings association or another savings association holding company. A similar provision limiting the acquisition by a bank holding company of 5% or more of a class of voting stock of any company is included in the Bank Holding Company Act. 

Accordingly, the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board would be required:

&#8226;

before any savings and loan holding company or bank holding company could acquire 5% or more of the common stock of the Company; and

&#8226;

before any other company could acquire 25% or more of the common stock of the Company and may be required for an acquisition of as little as 10% of such stock.

In addition, persons that are not companies are subject to the same or similar definitions of control with respect to savings and loan holding companies and savings associations and requirements for prior regulatory approval by the Federal Reserve in the case of control of a savings and loan holding company or by the OCC in the case of control of a savings association not obtained through control of a holding company of such savings association.

&#160;

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. &#160; The Sarbanes-Oxley Act was enacted in 2002 in response to public concerns regarding corporate accountability in connection with recent accounting scandals. The stated goals of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act are to increase corporate responsibility, to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act generally applies to all companies, both U.S. and non-U.S., that file or are required to file periodic reports with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including the Company.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act includes very specific additional disclosure requirements and new corporate governance rules, and requires the SEC and securities exchanges to adopt extensive additional disclosure, corporate governance and related rules. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act represents significant federal involvement in matters traditionally left to state regulatory systems, such as the regulation of the accounting profession, and to state corporate law, such as the relationship between a board of directors and management and between a board of directors and its committees.

Dividends and Stock Repurchases. The Federal Reserve's policy statement on the payment of cash dividends applicable to savings and loan holding companies, which expresses its view that although there are no specific regulations restricting dividend payments other than state corporate laws, a savings and loan holding company must maintain an adequate capital position and generally should not pay cash dividends unless the company's net income for the past year is sufficient to fully fund the cash dividends and that the prospective rate of earnings appears consistent with the company's capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve policy statement also indicates that it would be inappropriate for a company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends. In addition, a savings and loan holding company is required to give the Federal Reserve prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding twelve months, is equal to 10% or more of its consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve order or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve.

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. &#160; On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law. The Dodd-Frank-Act imposes new restrictions and an expanded framework of regulatory oversight for financial institutions, including depository institutions and implements new capital regulations discussed above under "- Regulation and Supervision of the Bank - Capital Requirements." In addition, among other changes, the Dodd-Frank Act requires public companies, such as the Company, to (i) provide their shareholders with a non-binding vote (a) at least once every three years on the compensation paid to executive officers and (b) at least once every six years on whether they should have a "say on pay" vote every one, two or three years; (ii) have a separate, non-binding shareholder vote regarding golden parachutes for named executive officers when a shareholder vote takes place on mergers, acquisitions, dispositions or other transactions that would trigger the parachute payments; (iii) provide disclosure in annual proxy materials concerning the relationship between the executive compensation paid and the financial performance of the issuer; and (iv) amend Item 402 of Regulation S-K to require companies to disclose the ratio of the Chief Executive Officer's annual total compensation to the median annual total compensation of all other employees. For certain of these changes, the implementing regulations have not been promulgated, so the full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on public companies cannot be determined at this time.
