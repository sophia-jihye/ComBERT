 Item 1. Business 

&#160; 

Introduction 

&#160; 

We are a blank check company formed in April 2015 for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to throughout this Report as our initial business combination. We have generated no revenues to date and we do not expect that we will generate operating revenues at the earliest until we consummate our initial business combination. 

&#160; 

For our initial business combination we are focused on industries that complement our management team&#8217;s background, focusing on the consumer products sector in the United States (which may include a business based in the United States which has distribution opportunities outside the United States). Consumer products include goods and services that are bought for personal and household use and intended for direct use or consumption. We are focused on established products that have a long history of consumer demand, are used frequently and must be replaced as opposed to durable items that people keep for a long time, such as cars and furniture. These type of products and segments are also easier to manage and operationally forecast, with which our management team and directors have much experience. 

&#160; 

We believe our management team has the skills and experience to identify, evaluate and consummate a business combination and is positioned to assist businesses we acquire. Our management team&#8217;s network and investing and operating experience do not guarantee a successful initial business combination. The members of our management team are not required to devote any significant amount of time to our business and are concurrently involved with other businesses. There is no guarantee that our current officers and directors will continue in their respective roles, or in any other role, after our initial business combination, and their expertise may only be of benefit to us until our initial business combination is completed. Past performance by our management team is not a guarantee of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate. 

&#160; 

We anticipate structuring our initial business combination to acquire 100% of the equity interest or assets of the target business or businesses. However, we may structure our initial business combination to acquire less than 100% of the equity interest or assets of the target business, but only if we (or any entity that is a successor to us in a business combination) acquire a majority of the outstanding voting securities or assets of the target. We believe that, if we own a majority of the target&#8217;s outstanding voting securities, we will not be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act, since the securities of a majority owned subsidiary that is not itself deemed an investment company are not deemed to be &#8220;investment securities&#8221; as defined in the Investment Company Act, and since we expect that 60% or more of the value of our total assets (excluding government securities and cash) will be represented by the securities of our target business which we expect will be an operating business. Even if we own a majority interest in the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. 

&#160; 

Nasdaq rules require that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions or taxes payable on interest) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation or value of comparable businesses. If our board is not independently able to determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulating Authority, or FINRA, and reasonably acceptable to Cantor Fitzgerald &#38; Co., or Cantor Fitzgerald, the underwriter of our initial public offering. However, if our securities are not listed on Nasdaq or another securities exchange, we will no longer be required to consummate a business combination with a target whose fair market value equals at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions or taxes payable on interest). 

&#160; 

Business Strategy 

&#160; 

We seek to capitalize on the significant consumer products knowledge, experience and contacts of Qi (Jacky) Zhang, the Chairman of our Board of Directors, Tim Richerson, our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and a director, and the financial expertise of Peter Nathanial, our President and a director, to identify, evaluate, acquire and operate a target business. If we elect to pursue an investment outside of the consumer products industry, our management&#8217;s expertise related to that industry may not be directly applicable to its evaluation or operation, and the information contained in this Report regarding that industry might not be relevant to an understanding of the business that we elect to acquire. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

We seek to acquire established consumer product branded businesses that we believe are fundamentally sound but potentially in need of financial, operational, strategic or managerial redirection to maximize value. We do not intend to acquire start-up companies, companies with speculative business plans or companies that are excessively leveraged. 

&#160; 

Our acquisition and value creation strategy is to identify, acquire, and after our initial business combination, to build, a diversified consumer products branded company. We are focused on consumer companies that distribute a broad range of products for various customers and end use markets in multiple channels (a few examples are selling these products through retail stores, purchasing online or via a direct selling experience) but also might be limited in geography. We believe our management team has prior and current experience and access to sales channels and consumer markets outside the United States as well that could be helpful in a consumer product business combination. 

&#160; 

We have identified the following criteria that we use in evaluating business transaction opportunities. We expect that no individual criterion will entirely determine a decision to pursue a particular opportunity. Further, any particular business transaction opportunity which we ultimately determine to pursue may not meet one or more of these criteria: 

&#160; 

&#9679; Size Of Business . undefined We seek to acquire one or more businesses or entities with an enterprise value of approximately $50,000,000 to $200,000,000, determined in the sole discretion of our officers and directors according to reasonably accepted valuation standards and methodologies. We believe that this market segment provides the greatest number of opportunities for investment and is the market consistent with our sponsor&#8217;s previous investment history and where we believe we have the strongest network to identify opportunities. &#160; &#160; &#9679; Established Companies with Proven Track Records . undefined We seek to acquire established companies with consistent historical financial performance. We are typically focused on companies with a history of strong operating and financial results and strong fundamentals. We do not intend to acquire start-up companies or companies with recurring negative free cash flow. &#160; &#160; &#9679; Strong Management Team . undefinedWe seek to acquire one or more businesses or entities that have strong, experienced management teams or those that provide a platform for us to assemble an effective and experienced management team. We are focused on management teams with a proven track record of driving revenue growth, enhancing profitability and creating value for their stockholders and expect that the operating and financial abilities of our executive team and board will complement their own capabilities. &#160; &#160; &#9679; Strong Competitive Position . undefinedWe are focused on targets that have a leading, growing or niche market position in their respective category. We expect to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of target businesses relative to their competitors. We seek to acquire a business that demonstrates advantages when compared to their competitors, which may help to protect their market position and profitability. &#160; &#160; &#9679; Companies with Revenue and Earnings Growth or Potential for Revenue and Earnings Growth . undefinedWe seek to acquire one or more businesses or entities that have achieved or have the potential for significant revenue and earnings growth through a combination of organic growth, new product markets and geographies, expense reduction and increased operating leverage. &#160; &#160; &#9679; Benefit from Being a Public Company . undefined We intend to acquire a company that will benefit from being publicly traded and can effectively utilize the broader access to capital and public profile that are associated with being a publicly traded company. 

&#160; 

Significant Activities Since Inception 

&#160; 

On July 29, 2015, we consummated our initial public offering of 5,000,000 units, each unit consisting of one share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and one warrant to purchase one-half of one share of common stock for an exercise price of $5.75 per half share ($11.50 per whole share), pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-204995). The units were sold in our initial public offering at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $50,000,000 (before underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses). Simultaneously with the consummation of our initial public offering, we completed a private placement of 250,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit, issued to Zhong Hui Holding Limited, our sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $2,500,000. A total of $50,000,000 from the net proceeds from our initial public offering and the private placement were placed in a trust account established for the benefit of our public stockholders. 

&#160; 

The units began trading on July 24, 2015 on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbol &#8220;WYIGU&#8221;. Commencing on September 11, 2015, the securities comprising the units began separate trading. The units, common stock and warrants are trading on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbols &#8220;WYIGU,&#8221; &#8220;WYIG&#8221; and &#8220;WYIGW.&#8221; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Effecting our Initial Business Combination 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public and the private placement, our capital stock, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. 

&#160; 

If we pay for our initial business combination using stock or debt securities, or we do not use all of the funds released from the trust account for payment of the purchase price in connection with our business combination or for redemptions or purchases of our common stock, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital. 

&#160; 

Nasdaq rules require that our initial business combination be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions or taxes payable on interest) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. However, if our securities are not listed on Nasdaq or another securities exchange, we will no longer be subject to that requirement. There is no current basis for investors to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the target business with which we may ultimately complete our initial business combination. Although our management will assess the risks inherent in a particular target business with which we may combine, we cannot assure you that this assessment will result in our identifying all risks that a target business may encounter. Furthermore, some of those risks may be outside of our control, meaning that we can do nothing to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business. 

&#160; 

We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities to finance our initial business combination, and we may effectuate an initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would consummate such financing only simultaneously with the consummation of our business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law or Nasdaq, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. 

&#160; 

Sources of Acquisition Candidates 

&#160; 

Target business candidates are, and have been, brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, venture capital funds, private equity funds, leveraged buyout funds, management buyout funds, brokers and other members of the financial community and corporate executives. These target candidates present solicited or unsolicited proposals. We expect such sources to continue to become aware that we are seeking a business combination candidate by a variety of means, including publicly available information relating to our initial public offering, public relations and marketing efforts or direct contact by management. 

&#160; 

Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates of which they become aware through their contacts. We have engaged, and may in the future engage, on a non-exclusive basis, the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions and we have paid, and may in the future pay, a finder&#8217;s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to such third parties based on the terms of the transaction and the terms and conditions of the arrangements with such third parties. Payment of finder&#8217;s fees is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the trust account. However, our agreement with FirsTrust China Ltd., or FT, dated October 30, 2015, provides that we pay FT a monthly fee of $20,000, payable quarterly in advance. Such fee is paid out of the funds held outside of the trust account. Either party may terminate such agreement beginning on April 30, 2016, upon three days written notice to the other party for any reason. In addition, we have entered into, and may in the future enter into, other consulting arrangements pursuant to which we are obligated to make a retainer payment and pay additional fees upon the consummation of our initial business combination. In no event will our initial stockholders or any of our existing officers or directors, or any entity with which they are affiliated, be paid any finder&#8217;s fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is), other than (i) repayment of any loans that our sponsor, management team, their affiliates or other third parties may make to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination (provided that if we do not consummate an initial business combination, we may use working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts, but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment other than interest earned thereon); and (ii) reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Although some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the acquired business following our initial business combination, the presence or absence of any such arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an acquisition candidate. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, initial holders, officers, directors or their affiliates. Additionally, we are not prohibited from partnering, submitting joint bids, or entering into any similar transaction with such persons in the pursuit of an initial business combination. If we seek to complete an initial business combination with such a company or we partner with such persons in our pursuit of an initial business combination, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA and reasonably acceptable to Cantor Fitzgerald, that such an initial business combination is fair to our stockholders from a financial point of view. Generally, such opinion is rendered to a company&#8217;s board of directors and investment banking firms may take the view that stockholders may not rely on the opinion. Such view will not impact our decision on which investment banking firm to hire. 

&#160; 

Unless we consummate our initial business combination with an affiliated entity, we are not required to obtain a financial fairness opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA. If we do not obtain such an opinion, our stockholders will be relying on the judgment of our board of directors, who will determine fair market value and fairness based on standards generally accepted by the financial community. The application of such standards would involve a comparison, from a valuation standpoint, of our business combination target to comparable public companies, as applicable, and a comparison of our contemplated transaction with such business combination target to other then-recently announced comparable private and public company transactions, as applicable. The application of such standards and the basis of our board of directors&#8217; determination will be discussed and disclosed in our tender offer or proxy solicitation materials, as applicable, related to our initial business combination. 

&#160; 

Selection of a target business and structuring of our initial business combination 

&#160; 

Subject to the Nasdaq requirement that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions or taxes payable on interest) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations. However, if our securities are not listed on Nasdaq or another securities exchange, we will no longer be subject to the Nasdaq requirement. In any case, we intend to consummate our initial business combination only if we (or any entity that is a successor to us in a business combination) will acquire a majority of the outstanding voting securities or assets of the target with the objective of making sure that we are not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. We believe that, if we own a majority of the target&#8217;s outstanding voting securities, we will not be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act since the securities of a majority owned subsidiary that is not itself deemed an investment company are not deemed to be &#8220;investment securities&#8221; as defined in the Investment Company Act, and since we expect that 60% or more of the value of our total assets (excluding government securities and cash) will be represented by the securities of our target business which we expect will be an operating business. We seek to acquire established companies that have demonstrated sound historical financial performance. Although we are not restricted from doing so, we do not intend to acquire start-up companies. To the extent we effect a business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors. 

&#160; 

In evaluating a prospective target business, we conduct an extensive due diligence review which encompasses, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information which will be made available to us. 

&#160; 

The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. 

&#160; 

Lack of business diversification 

&#160; 

For an indefinite period of time after consummation of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By consummating a business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may: 

&#160; 

&#9679; subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and &#160; &#160; &#9679; cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services. &#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Limited ability to evaluate the target&#8217;s management team 

&#160; 

Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating a target business, our assessment of the target business&#8217; management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. The future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following a business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to a business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business. 

&#160; 

We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. 

&#160; 

Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management. 

&#160; 

Stockholders may not have the ability to approve a business combination 

&#160; 

We may not seek stockholder approval before we effect our initial business combination as not all business combinations require stockholder approval under applicable state law. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required by law or Nasdaq, or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other reasons. Presented in the table below is a table of the types of initial business combinations we may consider and whether stockholder approval is currently required under Delaware law for each such transaction. 

&#160;

Type of Transaction &#160; Whether Stockholder Approval is Required Purchase of assets &#160; No Purchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the company &#160; No Merger of target into a subsidiary of the company &#160; No Merger of the company with a target &#160; Yes &#160;

Permitted purchases of our securities 

&#160; 

If we seek stockholder approval of our business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our initial stockholders, directors, officers or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior to or following the consummation of our initial business combination. We anticipate that our initial stockholders, directors, officers or their affiliates would approach a limited number of large holders of our securities that have voted against the business combination or sought redemption of their shares, or that have indicated an intention to do so, and engage in direct negotiations for the purchase of such holders&#8217; positions. All holders approached in this manner would be institutional or sophisticated holders. There is no limit on the number of shares they may acquire. Our initial holders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or during a restricted period under Regulation M under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, or in transactions which would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10(b)-5 under the Exchange Act. We cannot currently determine whether our insiders will make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan, as it will be dependent upon several factors, including but not limited to, the timing and size of such purchases. Depending on such circumstances, our insiders may either enter make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or determine that such a plan is not necessary. Although they do not currently anticipate paying any premium purchase price for such public shares, there is no limit on the price they may pay. We will notify stockholders of such purchases, if any, by press release, filing a Form 8-K or by means of a supplement to our proxy statement. 

&#160; 

The purpose of such purchases would be to (i) increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the business combination or (ii) to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of the business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. This may result in the consummation of a business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. 

&#160; 

As a consequence of any such purchases by our initial stockholders, directors, officers or their affiliates, the public &#8220;float&#8221; of our common stock may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to obtain the continued listing of our securities on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange in connection with our initial business combination 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Our initial stockholders, officers, directors and/or their affiliates anticipate that they will identify the public stockholders with whom they may pursue privately negotiated purchases through either direct contact by the public stockholders or by our receipt of redemption requests or votes against the business combination submitted by such public stockholders following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. The sellers of any shares so purchased by our initial stockholders, officers, advisors, directors and/or their affiliates would, as part of the sale arrangement, revoke their election to redeem such shares and withdraw their vote against the business combination. Our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates will only purchase shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M and the other federal securities laws. Any open market purchases by our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will only be made to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates will not make purchases of our shares of common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. The terms of such purchases would operate to facilitate our ability to consummate a proposed business combination by potentially reducing the number of shares redeemed for cash. 

&#160; 

Redemption rights for public stockholders upon consummation of our initial business combination 

&#160; 

We will provide our stockholders (including our sponsor and its associated parties, with respect to up to 2,000,000 of the 3,000,000 shares included in the units purchased by such parties in our initial public offering) with the opportunity to redeem their shares upon the consummation of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the trust account, less any interest released to us for working capital purposes or the payment of taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be $10.00 per public share. The initial holders have each agreed, with respect to their founder shares, placement shares and 1,000,000 of the 3,000,000 shares included in the units purchased by our sponsor and its associated parties in our initial public offering, to waive their respective redemption rights in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination. 

&#160; 

Manner of Conducting Redemptions 

&#160; 

We will provide our stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the business combination or by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirement. We intend to conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC unless stockholder approval is required by law or by a Nasdaq listing requirement or we choose to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons. 

&#160; 

If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation: 

&#160; 

&#9679; conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and any limitations (including but not limited to cash requirements) agreed to in connection with the negotiation of terms of the proposed business combination, and &#160; &#160; &#9679; file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to consummating our initial business combination that will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies. &#160; 

If we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem must remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to consummate our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In connection with the consummation of our business combination, we may redeem pursuant to a tender offer up to that number of shares of common stock (including up to 2,000,000 of the 3,000,000 shares included in the units purchased by our sponsor and its associated parties in our initial public offering) that would permit us to maintain net tangible assets of $5,000,001. However, the redemption threshold may be further limited by the terms and conditions of our proposed initial business combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or members of its management team, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the allocation of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. If the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of common stock that are validly tendered plus the amount of any cash payments required pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceeds the aggregate amount of cash available to us, taking into consideration the requirement that we maintain net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 or such greater amount depending on the terms of our potential business combination, we will not consummate the business combination, we will not purchase any shares of common stock pursuant to the tender offer and any shares of common stock tendered pursuant to the tender offer will be returned to the holders thereof following the expiration of the tender offer. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

When we conduct a tender offer to redeem our public shares upon consummation of our initial business combination, in order to comply with the tender offer rules, the offer will be made to all of our stockholders, not just our public stockholders. In connection with any such tender offer, holders of founder shares have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and placement shares. 

&#160; 

If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law or Nasdaq, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other reasons, we will: 

&#160; 

&#9679; conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and &#160; &#160; &#9679; file proxy materials with the SEC. &#160; 

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public stockholders (including our sponsor and its associated parties, with respect to up to 2,000,000 of the 3,000,000 shares included in the units purchased by such parties in our initial public offering) with the redemption rights described above upon consummation of the initial business combination. 

&#160; 

If we seek stockholder approval, we will consummate our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. Our sponsor and the other initial holders have agreed to vote their founder shares and placement shares and any public shares held by them in favor of our initial business combination. Our sponsor and initial stockholders currently own 69.5% of our outstanding shares of common stock. Additionally, each public stockholder may elect to redeem its public shares, irrespective of whether it votes for or against the proposed transaction, for cash equal to its pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest but less interest released to us for working capital purposes, to pay taxes or dissolution costs and subject to certain volume limitations, as described below. In addition, holders of founder shares have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and placement shares. 

&#160; 

Limitation on redemption upon consummation of a business combination if we seek stockholder approval 

&#160; 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a &#8220;group&#8221; (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to 20.0% or more of the shares sold in our initial public offering. This restriction will not apply to our sponsor or to parties associated with our sponsor that purchased units in our initial public offering. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding an aggregate of 20.0% or more of the shares sold in our initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder&#8217;s shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders&#8217; ability to redeem no more than 20.0% (less one share) of the shares sold in our initial public offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small number of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to consummate our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. 

&#160; 

Tendering stock certificates in connection with redemption rights 

&#160; 

If we hold a stockholder meeting to approve a potential business combination, we may require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in &#8220;street name,&#8221; to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company&#8217;s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder&#8217;s option. The proxy materials that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have until two days prior to the vote on the business combination to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares. 

&#160; 

There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $45.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

The foregoing is different from the procedures historically used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders&#8217; vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him to deliver his certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an &#8220;option window&#8221; after the consummation of the business combination during which he could monitor the price of the company&#8217;s stock in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he could sell his shares in the open market before actually delivering his shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become &#8220;option&#8221; rights surviving past the consummation of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holder&#8217;s election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved. 

&#160; 

Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the date of the stockholder meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivers its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of a business combination. 

&#160; 

If the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights (including our sponsor and its associated parties, with respect to up to 2,000,000 of the 3,000,000 shares included in the units purchased by such parties in our initial public offering) would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares. 

&#160; 

If our initial proposed business combination is not consummated, we may continue to try to consummate a business combination with a different target until July 29, 2017. 

&#160; 

Redemption of public shares and liquidation if no initial business combination 

&#160; 

Holders of founder shares, and our officers and directors, have agreed that we will have until July 29, 2017 to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to consummate our initial business combination by July 29, 2017, we will distribute the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, pro rata to our public stockholders, by way of redemption and cease all operations except for the purposes of winding up of our affairs, as further described herein. If we have not consummated a business combination by July 29, 2017, at the discretion of our board pursuant to the expiration of a tender offer conducted in connection with a failed business combination, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem all public shares then outstanding at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the trust account, less any interest released to us for working capital purposes, the payment of taxes or dissolution expenses (although, we expect all or substantially all of the interest released to be used for working capital purposes), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders&#8217; rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. 

&#160; 

The initial holders, including our sponsor, have agreed to waive their redemption rights (i) with respect to their founder shares and placement shares in connection with the consummation of a business combination and (ii) with respect to their founder shares and placement shares if we fail to consummate a business combination by July 29, 2017 or if we liquidate prior to July 29, 2017. However, our sponsor and parties associated with it will be entitled to redemption rights on the same terms as other public stockholders with respect to up to 2,000,000 of 3,000,000 public shares which they purchased in our initial public offering; they have waived their redemption rights with respect to the remaining 1,000,000 public shares which they purchased in our initial public offering in connection with the consummation of a business combination. 

&#160; 

There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions from us with respect to our founder shares or placement shares if we do not consummate a business combination by July 29, 2017. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from the approximately $623,000 of proceeds from our initial public offering and the private placement held out of trust as of December 31, 2015, interest income on the balance of the trust account (net of any taxes payable), which will be released to us to fund our working capital requirements, and any potential loans from our sponsor, management team, their affiliates or other third parties for working capital purposes and to pay expenses to identify an initial business combination, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purposes or that such loans would be made. If such funds are insufficient, our sponsor has agreed to pay the balance of the amount necessary to complete such liquidation (currently anticipated to be no more than approximately $30,000) and has agreed not to seek repayment for such amounts. 

&#160; 

The proceeds deposited in the trust account could become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be less than the $10.00 per public share initially on deposit in the trust account. Under Section 281(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL, our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors&#8217; claims. 

&#160; 

Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party&#8217;s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. If we do not obtain a waiver from a third party, we will obtain the written consent of our sponsor before our entering into an agreement with such third party. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver and where our sponsor executes a written consent. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, pursuant to a written agreement, Mr. Zhang, the Chairman of our Board of Directors, has agreed that he will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a definitive transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the trust account to below $10.00 per share, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriter of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, Mr. Zhang will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. We cannot assure you, however, that Mr. Zhang will be able to satisfy those obligations. 

&#160; 

If the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below $10.00 per public share and Mr. Zhang asserts that he is unable to satisfy any applicable obligations or that he has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against Mr. Zhang to enforce his indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against Mr. Zhang to enforce his indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in a particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.00 per public share. 

&#160; 

We have access to approximately $632,000 from the proceeds from our initial public offering and the private placement held out of trust as of December 31, 2015, any amounts representing interest earned on the trust account, less any interest released to us for working capital purposes, the payment of taxes or dissolution expenses, with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation). If we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors. 

&#160; 

Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders (including our sponsor and its associated parties, with respect to up to the 3,000,000 shares included in the units purchased by such parties in our initial public offering) upon the redemption of our public shares if we do not consummate our initial business combination by July 29, 2017 may be considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation elects to comply with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder&#8217;s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not consummate our initial business combination by July 29, 2017 is not considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidation distribution. If we have not consummated a business combination by July 29, 2017, at the discretion of our board, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem all public shares then outstanding at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the trust account, less any interest released to us for working capital purposes, the payment of taxes or dissolution expenses (although, we expect all or substantially all of such interest released to be used for working capital purposes), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders&#8217; rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following July 29, 2017 and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date. 

&#160; 

Because we will not elect to comply with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10 years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement, we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account. As a result of this obligation and Mr. Zhang&#8217;s indemnification of the trust account against certain claims as previously described in this section, we believe that the claims that could be made against us will be significantly limited and that the likelihood that any claim that would result in any liability extending to the trust account is remote. 

&#160; 

If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.00 per share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a &#8220;preferential transfer&#8221; or a &#8220;fraudulent conveyance.&#8221; As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. 

&#160; 

Our public stockholders (including our sponsor and its associated parties, with respect to the 3,000,000 shares included in the units purchased by such parties in our initial public offering) will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not consummate a business combination by July 29, 2017 or if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the consummation of the initial business combination. Also, our management may cease to pursue a business combination prior to July 29, 2017 (our board of directors may determine to liquidate the trust account prior to such expiration if it determines, in its business judgment, that it is improbable within the remaining time to identify an attractive business combination or satisfy regulatory and other business and legal requirements to consummate a business combination). In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a stockholder&#8217;s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a stockholder&#8217;s redeeming its shares for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation 

&#160; 

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains requirements and restrictions relating to our initial public offering that apply to us until the consummation of our initial business combination. These provisions, which cannot be amended without the approval of holders owning 90% of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock, are as follows: 

&#160; 

&#9679; if we are unable to consummate our initial business combination by July 29, 2017, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the trust account, less any interest released to us for working capital purposes, the payment of taxes or dissolution expenses (although, we expect all or substantially all of such interest released to be used for working capital purposes), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders&#8217; rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law; &#160; &#160; &#9679; prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional shares of capital stock that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account or (ii) vote on any initial business combination; &#160; &#160; &#9679; although we do not currently intend to enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with holders of founder shares, our directors or officers, we are not prohibited from doing so. If we propose to do so, we, or a committee of independent directors, must obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA and reasonably acceptable to Cantor Fitzgerald that such a business combination is fair to our stockholders from a financial point of view; &#160; &#160; &#9679; if a stockholder vote on our initial business combination is not required by law or Nasdaq and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other reasons, we must offer to redeem our public shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, and will file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to consummating our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about our initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act; and &#160; &#160; &#9679; we may not effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations. &#160; 

In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that under no circumstances will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. This notwithstanding, if the effect of any proposed amendment, if adopted, would be either to (i) reduce the amount in the in the trust account available to redeeming stockholders to less than $10.00 per public share, or (ii) delay the date on which a public stockholder could otherwise redeem shares for such per share amount in the trust account, we will provide a right for dissenting public shareholders to redeem public shares if such an amendment is approved. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for a business combination, we have encountered, and may continue to encounter, intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash to our public stockholders (including our sponsor and its associated parties, with respect to up to 2,000,000 of the 3,000,000 shares included in the units purchased by such parties in our initial public offering) who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for an initial business combination. In addition, the number of our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

We currently have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our affairs but they devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they devote in any time period varies based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Periodic Reporting and Financial Information 

&#160; 

Our units, common stock and warrants are registered under the Exchange Act and we have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, this Report contains financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants. 

&#160; 

We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, these financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with GAAP. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with GAAP. To the extent that this requirement cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material. 

&#160; 

We will be required to evaluate and report on our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition. 

&#160; 

We are an &#8220;emerging growth company,&#8221; as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not &#8220;emerging growth companies&#8221; including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We will remain an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; for up to five years from the date of the consummation of our initial public offering, although if our non-convertible debt issued within a three year period or revenues exceeds $1 billion, or if the market value of our common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million on the last day of our second fiscal quarter, we would cease to be an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; as of the following fiscal year. 

&#160;
