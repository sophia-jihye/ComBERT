SGK Brand Solutions: 

The SGK Brand Solutions segment provides brand development, deployment and delivery (consisting of brand management, printing plates and cylinders, pre-media services and imaging services for consumer packaged goods and retail customers, merchandising display systems, and marketing and design services). With the acquisition of Schawk, Inc. ("Schawk") in fiscal 2014, the Company significantly expanded its product offerings and capabilities related to brand development and brand management serving the consumer packaged goods and retail industries. The primary packaging industry consists of manufacturers of printed packaging materials such as boxes, flexible packaging, folding cartons and bags commonly displayed at retailers of consumer goods. The corrugated packaging industry consists of manufacturers of printed corrugated containers. Other major industries served include the wallpaper, flooring, automotive, and textile industries. 

The principal products and services of this segment include brand development, deployment, delivery, brand management, pre-media graphics services, printing plates, gravure cylinders, steel bases, embossing tools, special purpose machinery, engineering assistance, print process assistance, print production management, digital asset management, content management, and package design. These products and services are used by brand owners and packaging manufacturers to develop and print packaging graphics that help identify and sell the product in the marketplace. Other packaging graphics can include nutritional information, directions for product use, consumer warning statements and UPC codes. The primary packaging manufacturer produces printed packaging from paper, film, foil and other composite materials used to display, protect and market the product. The corrugated packaging manufacturer produces printed containers from corrugated sheets. Using the Company's products, these sheets are printed and die cut to make finished containers. 

ITEM 1. &#160; BUSINESS, (continued) 

The segment offers a wide array of value-added services and products. These include print process and print production management services; print engineering consultation; pre-media preparation, which includes computer-generated art, film and proofs; plate mounting accessories and various press aids; and press-side print production assurance. The segment also provides creative digital graphics services to brand owners and packaging markets. 

The segment's sales are also derived from the design, engineering, manufacturing and execution of merchandising and display systems. These systems include permanent and temporary displays, custom store fixtures, brand concept shops, interactive media, custom packaging, and screen and digitally printed promotional signage. Design and engineering services include concept and model development, graphics design and prototyping. Merchandising and display systems are manufactured to specifications developed by the segment in collaboration with the customer. 

The Company works closely with manufacturers to provide the proper printing forms and tooling required to print the packaging to the user's specifications. The segment's printing plate products are made principally from photopolymer resin and sheet materials. Upon customer request, plates can be pre-mounted press-ready in a variety of configurations that maximize print quality and minimize press set&#8209;up time. Gravure cylinders, manufactured from steel, copper and chrome, can be custom engineered for multiple print processes and specific customer print applications. 

The SGK Brand Solutions segment customer base consists primarily of brand owners and packaging industry converters. Brand owners are generally large, well-known consumer products companies and retailers with a national or global presence. These types of companies tend to purchase their graphics needs directly, and supply the printing forms, or the electronic files to make the printing plates and gravure cylinders, to the packaging printer for their products. The SGK Brand Solutions segment serves customers throughout the world, with principal locations in the United States, Europe and Asia. 

Major raw materials for this segment's products include photopolymers, steel, copper, film, wood, particleboard, corrugated materials, structural steel, plastic, laminates, inks and graphic art supplies. All such materials are presently available in adequate supply from various industry sources. 

The SGK Brand Solutions segment is one of several providers of brand management, brand development and pre-media services and manufacturers of printing plates and cylinders with an international presence. The combination of the Company's businesses in North America, Europe and Asia is an important part of Matthews' strategy to become a worldwide leader in the graphics industry by providing consistent service to multinational customers on a global basis. Competition is on the basis of product quality, timeliness of delivery and price. The merchandising and display business operates in a fragmented industry consisting primarily of a number of small, locally operated companies. The segment competes on the basis of reliability, creativity and ability to provide a broad array of merchandising products and services. The segment is unique in its ability to provide in-depth marketing and merchandising services as well as design, engineering and manufacturing capabilities. These capabilities allow the segment to deliver complete turnkey merchandising solutions quickly and cost effectively. The Company differentiates itself from the competition by consistently meeting these customer demands, providing service to customers both nationally and globally, and providing a variety of value-added support services. 

Memorialization: 

The Memorialization segment manufactures and markets a full line of memorialization products used primarily in cemeteries, funeral homes and crematories. The segment's products, which are sold principally in the United States, Europe, Canada and Australia, include cast bronze memorials, granite memorials, caskets, cremation equipment and other memorialization products. The segment also manufactures and markets architectural products that are used to identify or commemorate people, places, events and accomplishments. 

ITEM 1. &#160; BUSINESS, (continued) 

Memorial products include flush bronze and granite memorials, upright granite memorials and monuments, cremation memorialization products, granite benches, flower vases, crypt plates and letters, cremation urns, niche units, cemetery features and statues, along with other related products and services. Flush memorials are bronze plaques or granite memorials which contain personal information about a deceased individual (such as name, birth date, and death date), photos and emblems. Flush bronze and granite memorials are even or "flush" with the ground and therefore are preferred by many cemeteries for easier lawn mowing and general maintenance. The segment's memorial products also include community and family mausoleums within North America. In addition, the segment's other memorial products include bronze plaques, letters, emblems, vases, lights and photo ceramics that can be affixed to granite monuments, mausoleums, crypts and flush memorials. Principal customers for memorial products are cemeteries and memorial parks, which in turn sell the Company's products to the consumer. 

Customers of the Memorialization segment can also purchase memorials and vases on a "pre-need" basis. The "pre-need" concept permits families to arrange for these purchases in advance of their actual need. Upon request, the Company will manufacture the memorial to the customer's specifications (e.g., name and birth date) and place it in storage for future delivery. Memorials in storage have been paid in full with title conveyed to each pre-need purchaser. 

The segment is also a leading manufacturer and distributor of caskets and other funeral home products in North America. The segment produces and markets metal, wood and cremation caskets. Caskets are offered in a variety of colors, interior designs, handles and trim in order to accommodate specific religious, ethnic or other personal preferences. The segment also markets other funeral home products such as urns, jewelry, stationery and other funeral home products. The segment offers individually personalized caskets through the Company-owned distribution network. 

Metal caskets are made from various gauges of cold-rolled steel, stainless steel, copper and bronze. Metal caskets are generally categorized by whether the casket is non-gasketed or gasketed, and by material (i.e., bronze, copper, or steel) and in the case of steel, by the gauge (thickness) of the metal. Wood caskets are primarily manufactured from nine different species of wood. The species of wood used are poplar, pine, ash, oak, pecan, maple, cherry, walnut and mahogany. The Memorialization segment is a leading manufacturer of all-wood constructed caskets, which are manufactured using pegged and dowelled construction, and include no metal parts. All-wood constructed caskets are preferred by certain religious groups. Cremation caskets are made primarily from wood or cardboard covered with cloth or veneer. These caskets appeal primarily to cremation consumers, the environmentally concerned consumers, and value buyers. 

The Memorialization segment also produces casket components. Casket components include stamped metal parts, metal locking mechanisms for gasketed metal caskets, adjustable beds and interior panels. Metal casket parts are produced by stamping cold-rolled steel, stainless steel, copper and bronze sheets into casket body parts. Locking mechanisms and adjustable beds are produced by stamping and assembling a variety of steel parts. The segment purchases from sawmills and lumber distributors various species of uncured wood, which it dries and cures. The cured wood is processed into casket components. 

In addition, the segment provides product and service assortment planning, as well as merchandising and display products to funeral service businesses. These products assist funeral service professionals in providing information, value and satisfaction to their client families. 

The segment also provides cremation systems, crematory management, cremation service and supplies, waste management and incineration systems, and environmental and energy solutions to the human, pet and specialized incineration markets. The primary market areas for these products and services are North America and Europe, although the segment also sells into Latin America and the Caribbean, Australia and Asia. 

ITEM 1. &#160; BUSINESS, (continued) 

Cremation systems include both traditional flame-based and water-based bio-cremation systems for cremation of humans and pets, as well as equipment for processing the cremated remains and other related equipment (ventilated work stations, tables, cooler racks, vacuums). The principal markets for these products are funeral homes, cemeteries, crematories, pet crematories, animal disposers and veterinarians. These products primarily are marketed directly by segment personnel. Crematory management/operations represent the actual operation and management of client-owned crematories. Currently the segment provides these services primarily to municipalities in Europe and private operators in the United States. Cremation service and supplies consists of operator training, preventative maintenance and "at need" service work performed on various makes and models of equipment. This work can be as simple as replacing defective bulbs or as complex as complete reconstruction and upgrading or retro-fitting on site. Supplies are consumable items associated with normal operations. 

Waste management/incineration systems encompass both batch load and continuous feed, static and rotary systems for incineration of all waste types, as well as equipment for in-loading waste, out-loading ash and energy recovery. The principal markets for these products are medical waste disposal, oil and gas "work camp" wastes, industrial wastes and bio-mass generators. Environmental and energy systems include emissions filtration units, waste heat recovery equipment, waste gas treatment products, as well as energy recovery. The principal markets are municipalities or public/state agencies, the cremation industry and other industries which utilize incinerators for waste reduction and energy production. 

The Memorialization segment also manufactures a full line of products for cremation, including urns in a variety of sizes, styles and shapes as well as standard and custom designed granite cremation pedestals and benches. The segment also manufactures bronze and granite niche units, which are comprised of numerous compartments used to display cremation urns in mausoleums and churches. In addition, the Company also markets turnkey cremation gardens, which include the design and all related products for a cremation memorial garden. 

Architectural products include cast bronze and aluminum plaques, etchings and letters that are used to recognize, commemorate and identify people, places, events and accomplishments. The Company's plaques are frequently used to identify the name of a building or the names of companies or individuals located within a building. Such products are also used to commemorate events or accomplishments, such as military service or financial donations. The principal markets for the segment's architectural products are corporations, fraternal organizations, contractors, churches, hospitals, schools and government agencies. These products are sold to and distributed through a network of independent dealers including sign suppliers, awards and recognition companies, and trophy dealers. 

Raw materials used by the Memorialization segment to manufacture memorials consist principally of bronze and aluminum ingot, granite, sheet metal, coating materials, photopolymers and construction materials and are generally available in adequate supply. Ingot is obtained from various North American, European and Australian smelters. The primary materials required for casket manufacturing are cold-rolled steel and lumber. The segment also purchases copper, bronze, stainless steel, particleboard, corrugated materials, paper veneer, cloth, ornamental hardware and coating materials. Purchase orders or supply agreements are typically negotiated with large, integrated steel producers that have demonstrated timely delivery, high quality material and competitive prices. Lumber is purchased from a number of sawmills and lumber distributors. Raw materials used to manufacture cremation and incineration products consist principally of structural steel, sheet metal, electrical components, combustion devices and refractory materials. These are generally available in adequate supply from numerous suppliers. 

Competition from other manufacturers of memorial products is on the basis of reputation, product quality, delivery, price, and design availability. The Company believes that its superior quality, broad product lines, innovative designs, delivery capability, customer responsiveness, experienced personnel and consumer-oriented merchandising systems are competitive advantages in its markets. Competition in the mausoleum construction industry includes various construction companies throughout North America and is on the basis of design, quality and price. Competitors in the architectural market are numerous and include companies that manufacture cast and painted signs, plastic materials, sand-blasted wood and other fabricated products. 

ITEM 1. &#160; BUSINESS, (continued) 

The Memorialization segment markets its casket products in the United States through a combination of Company-owned and independent casket distribution facilities. The Company operates over 100 distribution centers in the United States. Over 85% of the segment's casket products are currently sold through Company-owned distribution centers. The casket business is highly competitive and the Company competes with other manufacturers on the basis of product quality, price, service, design availability and breadth of product line. The Memorialization segment provides a line of casket products that it believes is as comprehensive as any of its major competitors. There are a large number of casket industry participants operating in North America, and the industry has in the last five years seen a few new foreign casket manufacturers, primarily from China, enter the North American market. The Memorialization segment and its principal competitor account for a substantial portion of the U.S. casket market. 

The Company competes with several manufacturers in the cremation and accessory equipment market principally on the basis of product design, quality and price. The Memorialization segment and its three largest global competitors account for a substantial portion of the U.S. and European cremation equipment market. 

The Memorialization segment works to provide a total solution to customers that own and operate businesses in both the cemetery and funeral home markets. 

Industrial Technologies: 

The Industrial Technologies segment designs, manufactures and distributes a wide range of marking, coding and industrial automation solutions, order fulfillment systems, and related consumables. Manufacturers, suppliers and distributors worldwide rely on Matthews' integrated systems to identify, track, control and pick their products. 

Marking systems range from mechanical marking solutions to microprocessor-based ink-jet printing systems that integrate into a customer's manufacturing, inventory tracking and material handling control systems. The Company manufactures and markets products and systems that employ different marking technologies, including contact printing, indenting, etching, laser and ink-jet printing. Customers frequently use a combination of these methods to achieve an appropriate mark. These technologies apply product information required for identification and traceability, as well as to facilitate inventory and quality control, regulatory compliance and brand name communication. 

Fulfillment systems complement the tracking and distribution of a customer's products with automated order fulfillment technologies, motor-driven rollers for product conveyance, and controls for material handling systems. Material handling customers include some of the largest automated assembly and distribution companies in the United States. The Company also 

engineers innovative, custom solutions to address specific customer requirements in a variety of industries, including oil exploration and security scanning. 

A significant portion of the revenue of the Industrial Technologies segment is attributable to the sale of consumables and replacement parts required by the marking, coding and tracking hardware sold by Matthews. The Company develops inks, rubber and steel consumables in conjunction with the marking equipment in which they are used, which is critical to ensure ongoing equipment reliability and mark quality. Most marking equipment customers use Matthews' inks, solvents and cleaners. 

The principal customers for the Company's marking and fulfillment systems products are manufacturers, suppliers and distributors of durable goods, building products, consumer goods manufacturers (including food and beverage processors) and producers of pharmaceuticals. The Company also serves a wide variety of industrial markets, including metal fabricators, manufacturers of woven and non-woven fabrics, plastic, rubber and automotive products. 

A portion of this segment's sales are outside the United States, with distribution sourced through the Company's subsidiaries in Canada, Sweden, Germany and China in addition to other international distributors. The Company owns a minority interest in distributors in Asia, Australia and Europe. 

ITEM 1. &#160; BUSINESS, (continued) 

Major raw materials for this segment's products include precision components, electronics, printing components, tool steels, rubber and chemicals, all of which are presently available in adequate supply from various sources. 

Competitors in the marking and fulfillment systems industries are diverse, with some companies offering limited product lines for well-defined specialty markets, while others operate similarly to the Company, offering a broad product line and competing in multiple product markets and countries. Competition for marking and fulfillment systems products is based on product performance, ease of integration into the manufacturing and/or distribution process, service and price. The Company typically competes with specialty companies in specific brand marking solutions and traceability applications. The Company believes that, in general, its Industrial Technologies segment offers one of the broadest lines of products to address a wide variety of marking, coding and industrial automation applications. 

PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND LICENSES: 

The Company holds a number of domestic and foreign patents and trademarks. However, the Company believes the loss of any individual or a significant number of patents or trademarks would not have a material impact on consolidated operations or revenues. 

BACKLOG: 

Because the nature of the Company's SGK Brand Solutions, Memorialization and Industrial Technologies businesses are primarily custom products made to order and services with short lead times, backlogs are not generally material except for roto-gravure engineering projects in the SGK Brand Solutions segment, mausoleums and cremation equipment in the Memorialization segment and industrial automation and order fulfillment systems in the Industrial Technologies segment. Backlogs vary in a range of approximately six to twelve months of sales for roto-gravure engineering projects and mausoleums. Cremation equipment sales backlogs vary in a range of eight to ten months of sales. Backlogs for Industrial Technologies segment sales generally vary in a range of up to six weeks for standard products and twelve weeks for custom systems. The Company's backlog is expected to be substantially filled in fiscal 2017 . 

REGULATORY MATTERS: 

The Company's operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations impose limitations on the discharge of materials into the environment and require the Company to obtain and operate in compliance with conditions of permits and other government authorizations. As such, the Company has developed environmental, health and safety policies and procedures that include the proper handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials. 

The Company is party to various environmental matters. These include obligations to investigate and mitigate the effects on the environment of the disposal of certain materials at various operating and non-operating sites. The Company is currently performing environmental assessments and remediation at these sites, as appropriate. 

At September 30, 2016 , an accrual of approximately $3.7 million &#32;had been recorded for environmental remediation (of which $1.0 million &#32;was classified in other current liabilities), representing management's best estimate of the probable and reasonably estimable costs of the Company's known remediation obligations. The accrual does not consider the effects of inflation and anticipated expenditures are not discounted to their present value. While final resolution of these contingencies could result in costs different than current accruals, management believes the ultimate outcome will not have a significant effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations or financial position.
