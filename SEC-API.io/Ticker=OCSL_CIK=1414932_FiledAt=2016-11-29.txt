 Item 1. Business 

General 

Fifth Street Finance Corp., a Delaware corporation, or together with its subsidiaries, where applicable, the Company, which may also be referred to as &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221;, is a specialty finance company that is a closed-end, externally managed, non-diversified management investment company. Fifth Street Mezzanine Partners III, L.P., our predecessor fund, commenced operations as a private partnership on February 15, 2007. Effective as of January 2, 2008, Fifth Street Mezzanine Partners III, L.P. merged with and into us. We were formed as a Delaware corporation in late 2007 for the purpose of acquiring Fifth Street Mezzanine Partners III, L.P. and continuing its business as a public entity. We have elected to be regulated as a business development company, or BDC, under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the 1940 Act. In addition, we have qualified and elected to be treated as a regulated investment company, or RIC, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, for tax purposes. See &#8220;Taxation as a Regulated Investment Company.&#8221; As a RIC, we generally will not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any net ordinary income or net realized capital gains that we distribute to our stockholders if we meet certain source-of-income, income distribution and asset diversification requirements. 

We generally lend to and invest in small and mid-sized companies, primarily in connection with investments by private equity sponsors. We define small and mid-sized companies as those with annual EBITDA (Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) between $10 million and $120 million. Our investment objective is to maximize our portfolio&#8217;s total return by generating current income from our debt investments, and to a lesser extent, capital appreciation from our equity investments. These investment objectives may be changed without a vote of the holders of a majority of our voting securities. We are externally managed and advised by Fifth Street Management LLC, which we also refer to as &#8220;Fifth Street Management&#8221; or our &#8220;investment adviser.&#8221; 

Our investments generally range in size from $10 million to $100 million &#32;and are principally in the form of first lien, second lien, or collectively, senior secured, and subordinated debt investments, which may also include an equity component made in connection with investments by private equity sponsors. Although our focus could change, we are currently focusing our origination efforts on a prudent mix of first lien, second lien and subordinated loans that we believe will provide superior risk-adjusted returns while maintaining adequate credit protection. We generally invest in securities that are rated below investment grade by rating agencies or that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. Below investment grade securities, which are often referred to as &#8220;high yield&#8221; and &#8220;junk,&#8221; have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer&#8217;s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. 

From inception through September 30, 2016 , we originated approximately $7.4 billion of funded debt and equity investments. Our portfolio totaled $2.2 billion &#32;at fair value at September 30, 2016 &#32;and was comprised of &#32; 129 &#32;investments, 110 &#32;of which were completed in connection with investments by private equity sponsors, one of which was in Senior Loan Fund JV I, LLC, or SLF JV I, and 18 &#32;of which were in private equity funds. The 18 &#32;investments in private equity funds represented less than 1% of the fair value of our assets at September 30, 2016 . At fair value, 91.2% of our portfolio consisted of debt investments and 78.0% &#32;of our portfolio consisted of senior secured loans as of September 30, 2016 . The weighted average annual yield of our debt investments as of September 30, 2016 , including the return on our subordinated note investment in SLF JV I, was approximately 10.4% , of which 9.6% &#32;represented cash payments. The weighted average annual yield of our debt investments is determined before, and therefore does not take into account, the payment of our (and our consolidated subsidiaries') expenses and the payment by an investor of any stockholder transaction expenses, and does not represent the return on investment for our stockholders. Moreover, we held equity investments consisting of common stock, preferred stock or other equity interests in 73 &#32;of our 129 &#32;portfolio companies as of September 30, 2016 . 

We are permitted to, and expect to continue to, finance our investments through borrowings. However, as a business development company, we are only generally allowed to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 200% after such borrowing, provided, that, pursuant to exemptive relief we received from the SEC, we are permitted to exclude the debt of our small business investment company, or SBIC, subsidiaries guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration, or the SBA, from the definition of senior securities in calculating our 200% asset coverage ratio under the 1940 Act. See &#8220;Regulation -Business Development Company Regulations.&#8221; The amount of leverage that we employ will depend on our assessment of market conditions and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing, such as the maturity, covenant package and rate structure of the proposed borrowings, our ability to raise funds through the issuance of shares of our common stock and the risks of such borrowings within the context of our investment outlook. Ultimately, we only intend to use leverage if the expected returns from borrowing to make investments will exceed the cost of such borrowing. As of September 30, 2016 , we had a debt to equity ratio (excluding debentures issued by our SBIC subsidiaries) of 0.83 x (i.e., one dollar of equity for each $ 0.83 &#32;of non-SBIC debt outstanding). 

Joint Venture 

We and Trinity Universal Insurance Company, a subsidiary of Kemper Corporation, or Kemper, also co-invest through an unconsolidated, Delaware limited liability company, SLF JV I. SLF JV I was formed in May 2014 to invest in middle-market and other corporate debt securities. As of September 30, 2016 , SLF JV I had total capital commitments of $ 200.0 million , $ 175.0 million &#32;of which was from us and the remaining $ 25.0 million &#32;from Kemper. At September 30, 2016 , we had funded approximately $ 160.9 million &#32;of our commitment. Additionally, SLF JV I had $400.0 million of borrowing capacity, including a senior revolving credit facility with Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch ("Deutsche Bank facility") with a stated maturity date of July 1, 2019, which permitted up to $ 200.0 million &#32;of borrowings, and a senior revolving credit facility with Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Island Branch ("Credit Suisse facility") with a stated maturity date of July 7, 2023, which permitted up to $200.0 million of borrowings. SLF JV I is managed by a four person board of directors, two of whom are selected by us and two of whom are selected by Kemper. SLF JV I is generally capitalized as transactions are completed and all portfolio decisions must be approved by its investment committee consisting of one representative of us and one representative of Kemper (with approval of each required). As of September 30, 2016 , our investment in SLF JV I was approximately $ 142.7 million &#32;at fair value. We do not consolidate SLF JV I in our consolidated financial statements. 

Organizational Structure 

The following diagram shows a simplified organizational structure reflecting our relationship with our investment adviser and administrator and our direct and indirect ownership interest in certain of our subsidiaries as of September 30, 2016 : 

Our principal executive office is located at 777 West Putnam Avenue, 3rd Floor, Greenwich, Connecticut 06830 and our telephone number is (203) 681-3600. 

The Investment Adviser 

We are externally managed and advised by Fifth Street Management, a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, or the Advisers Act, that is partially and indirectly owned by Fifth Street Asset Management Inc., or FSAM, a publicly-traded, nationally-recognized asset manager with over $5 billion of assets under management as of September 30, 2016. Our investment adviser serves pursuant to an investment advisory agreement adopted in accordance with the Advisers Act, under which it receives from us a percentage of our gross assets as a management fee and a percentage of our ordinary income and capital gains as an incentive fee. See &#8220;- Investment Advisory Agreement.&#8221; 

The key principals and members of senior management of our investment adviser are Leonard M. Tannenbaum, our investment adviser&#8217;s chief executive officer, Bernard D. Berman, our chairman and our investment adviser&#8217;s co-president, Todd G. Owens, our chief executive officer and our investment adviser's co-president, Ivelin M. Dimitrov, our president and chief investment officer and the chief investment officer of our investment adviser, and Alexander C. Frank, the chief operating officer of our investment adviser. Mr. Tannenbaum has led the investment of over $10 billion in small and mid-sized companies and the origination of over 300 investment transactions since 1998. Our investment adviser also currently serves as the investment adviser to Fifth Street Senior Floating Rate Corp., or FSFR, in addition to various other private fund vehicles. FSFR is a business development company focused on making senior loans to middle market companies that bear interest on the basis of a floating base lending rate as compared to our more general primary investment focus on debt and equity investments in small and mid-sized companies in addition to various privately held funds. However, there may be overlap in terms of our targeted investments. 

Our administrator, FSC CT, LLC, or FSC CT, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fifth Street Management, provides the administrative services necessary for us to operate. See &#8220;- Administration Agreement.&#8221; 

Business Strategy 

Our investment objective is to maximize our portfolio&#8217;s total return by generating current income from our debt investments and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation from our equity investments. We have adopted the following business strategy to achieve our investment objective: 

&#8226; 

Capitalize on our investment adviser&#8217;s strong relationships with private equity sponsors. &#160; Our investment adviser has developed an extensive network of relationships with private equity sponsors that invest in small and mid-sized companies. We believe that the strength of these relationships is due to a common investment philosophy, a consistent market focus, a rigorous approach to diligence and a reputation for delivering on commitments. In addition to being our principal source of originations, we believe that private equity sponsors provide significant benefits including incremental due diligence, additional monitoring capabilities and a potential source of capital and operational expertise for our portfolio companies. 

&#8226; 

Focus on established small and mid-sized companies. &#160; We believe that there are fewer finance companies focused on transactions involving small and mid-sized companies than larger companies, and that this is one factor that allows us to negotiate favorable investment terms. Such favorable terms include higher debt yields and lower leverage levels, more significant covenant protection and greater equity grants than typical of transactions involving larger companies. We generally invest in companies with established market positions, seasoned management teams, proven products and services and strong regional or national operations. We believe that these companies possess better risk-adjusted return profiles than newer companies that are in the early stages of building management teams and/or a revenue base. 

&#8226; 

Continue our growth of direct originations. &#160; Over the course of almost a decade, the principals of our investment adviser have developed an origination strategy that allows us to directly originate a significant portion of our investments. We believe that the benefits of direct originations include, among other things, our ability to control the structuring of investment protections and to generate origination and exit fees. 

&#8226; 

Benefit from the large pool of uninvested private equity capital likely to seek complementary debt financing. We expect that private equity firms will continue to be active investors in middle market companies. These private equity funds generally seek to leverage their investments by combining their capital with senior secured loans and/or mezzanine debt provided by other sources, and we believe that our capital is well-positioned to partner with such equity investors who we believe have raised substantial amounts of private equity capital in recent years. 

&#8226; 

Employ disciplined underwriting policies and rigorous portfolio management. &#160; Our investment adviser has developed an extensive underwriting process, which includes a review of the prospects, competitive position, financial performance and industry dynamics of each potential portfolio company. In addition, we perform substantial diligence on potential investments, and seek to invest alongside private equity sponsors who have proven capabilities in building value. As part of the monitoring process, our investment adviser will analyze monthly and quarterly financial statements 

versus the previous periods and year, review financial projections, compliance certificates and covenants, meet with management and attend board meetings. 

&#8226; 

Structure our debt investments to minimize risk of loss and achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns. &#160; We structure our debt investments on a conservative basis with high cash yields, cash advisory fees, low leverage levels and strong investment protections, including prepayment fees. As of September 30, 2016 , the weighted average yield of our debt investments, including the return on our subordinated note investment in SLF JV I, was approximately 10.4% , which includes a cash component of 9.6% . As of September 30, 2016 , our debt investments had a weighted average debt to EBITDA multiple of 4.61 x calculated at the time of origination of the investment. Our debt investments typically have strong protections, which may include one or more of: default penalties, prepayment fees, information rights, board observation rights, and affirmative, negative and financial covenants, such as lien protection and prohibitions against change of control. We believe these protections, coupled with the other features of our investments described above, should allow us to reduce our risk of capital loss and achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully structure our investments to minimize risk of loss and achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns. 

&#8226; 

Benefit from lower, fixed, long-term cost of capital. &#160; The SBIC licenses held by our wholly-owned SBIC subsidiaries allow them to issue SBA-guaranteed debentures. SBA-guaranteed debentures carry long-term fixed rates that are generally lower than rates on comparable bank and other debt. Because lower-cost SBA leverage is a significant part of our capital base, our relative cost of debt capital may be lower than many of our competitors. In addition, SBIC leverage represents a stable, long-term component of our capital structure that should permit the proper matching of duration and cost compared to our portfolio investments. 

&#8226; 

Leverage the skills and experience of our investment adviser. &#160; The principals of our investment adviser have broad investment backgrounds, with prior experience at private investment funds, investment banks and other financial services companies and they also have experience managing distressed companies. We believe that our investment adviser&#8217;s expertise in valuing, structuring, negotiating and closing transactions provides us with a competitive advantage by allowing us to provide financing solutions that meet the needs of our portfolio companies while adhering to our underwriting standards. 

Investment Criteria 

The principals of our investment adviser have identified the following investment criteria and guidelines for use in evaluating prospective portfolio companies and they use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating investment opportunities for us. However, not all of these criteria and guidelines were, or will be, met in connection with each of our investments. 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Established companies with a history of positive operating cash flow. &#160; We generally seek to invest in established companies with sound historical financial performance. We typically focus on companies with a history of profitability on an operating cash flow basis, however in certain cases we may target investments in earlier stage companies, some of which have yet to reach positive levels of profitability. 

&#8226; 

Strong market presence. We seek to invest in portfolio companies that we believe have developed strong positions within their markets and exhibit the potential to maintain sufficient cash flows and profitability to service their obligations in a range of economic environments. We also seek portfolio companies that we believe possess advantages in scale, scope, customer loyalty, product pricing or product quality as compared to their competitors. 

&#8226; 

Ability to exert meaningful influence. &#160; We seek investment opportunities in which we will be the lead/sole investor in our tranche and in which we can add value through active participation in the direction of the company, often through advisory positions. 

&#8226; 

Private equity sponsorship. &#160; We generally seek to invest in companies in connection with private equity sponsors who have proven capabilities in building value. We believe that a private equity sponsor can serve as a committed partner and advisor that will actively work with the company and its management team to meet company goals and create value. We assess a private equity sponsor&#8217;s commitment to a portfolio company by, among other things, the capital contribution it has made or will make in the portfolio company. 

&#8226; 

Seasoned management team. &#160; We generally will require that our portfolio companies have a seasoned management team, with strong corporate governance. We also seek to invest in companies that have proper incentives in place, including having significant equity interests, to motivate management to act in accordance with our interests. 

&#8226; 

Defensible and sustainable business. &#160; We seek to invest in companies with proven products and/or services and strong regional or national operations. 

&#8226; 

Exit strategy. &#160; We generally seek to invest in companies that we believe possess attributes that will provide us with the ability to exit our investments. We expect to exit our investments typically through one of three scenarios: (i) the sale of the company resulting in repayment of all outstanding debt, (ii) the recapitalization of the company through which our loan is replaced with debt or equity from a third party or parties or (iii) the repayment of the initial or remaining principal amount of our loan then outstanding at maturity. In some investments, there may be scheduled amortization of some portion of our loan which would result in a partial exit of our investment prior to the maturity of the loan. In addition, although less common, we may sell all or a portion of our investments on the secondary market. 

Deal Origination 

Our deal originating efforts are focused on building relationships with private equity sponsors that are focused on investing in the small and mid-sized companies that we target. We divide the country geographically into Eastern, Central and Western regions and emphasize active, consistent sponsor coverage. The investment professionals of our investment adviser have developed an extensive network of relationships with these private equity sponsors. We estimate that our investment adviser has active relationships with approximately 200 private equity sponsors. An active relationship is one through which our investment adviser has received at least one investment opportunity from the private equity sponsor within the last year. 

Our investment adviser reviewed over 700 potential investment transactions with private equity sponsors during the year ended September 30, 2016 . A significant portion of the investment transactions that we have completed to date were originated through our investment adviser&#8217;s relationships with private equity sponsors. We believe that our investment adviser has a reputation as a reliable, responsive and efficient source of funding to support private equity investments. We believe that this reputation and the relationships of our investment adviser with private equity sponsors will provide us with significant investment opportunities. 

Our origination process is designed to efficiently evaluate a large number of opportunities and to identify the most attractive of such opportunities. A significant number of opportunities that clearly do not fit our investment criteria are screened by the originators of our investment adviser when they are initially identified. If an originator believes that an opportunity fits our investment criteria and merits consideration, the investment is presented to our investment adviser&#8217;s Investment Committee. This is the first stage of our origination process, the &#8220;Review&#8221; stage. During this stage, the originator gives a preliminary description of the opportunity. This is followed by preliminary due diligence, from which an investment summary is created. The opportunity may be discussed several times by the full Investment Committee of our investment adviser, or subsets of that Committee. At any point in this stage, we may reject the opportunity, and, indeed, we have historically decided not to proceed with more than 80% of the investment opportunities reviewed by our investment adviser&#8217;s Investment Committee. 

For the subset of opportunities that we decide to pursue, we issue preliminary term sheets and classify them in the &#8220;Term Sheet Issued&#8221; stage. This term sheet serves as a basis for negotiating the critical terms of a transaction. At this stage we begin our underwriting and investment approval process, as more fully described below. After the term sheet for a potential transaction has been fully negotiated, the transaction is presented to our investment adviser&#8217;s Investment Committee for approval. If the deal is approved, the term sheet is signed. Approximately half of the term sheets we issue result in an executed term sheet. Our underwriting and investment approval process is ongoing during this stage, during which we begin documentation of the loan. The final stage, &#8220;Closings,&#8221; culminates with the funding of an investment only after all due diligence is satisfactorily completed and all closing conditions, including the sponsor&#8217;s funding of its investment in the portfolio company, have been satisfied. 

Investment Underwriting 

Investment Underwriting Process and Investment Approval 

We make our investment decisions only after consideration of a number of factors regarding the potential investment including, but not limited to: (i) historical and projected financial performance; (ii) company and industry specific characteristics, such as strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats; (iii) composition and experience of the management team; and (iv) track record of the private equity sponsor leading the transaction. 

If an investment is deemed appropriate to pursue, a more detailed and rigorous evaluation is made along a variety of investment parameters, not all of which may be relevant or considered in evaluating a potential investment opportunity. The following outlines the general parameters and areas of evaluation and due diligence for investment decisions, although not all will necessarily be considered or given equal weighting in the evaluation process: 

Management Assessment 

Our investment adviser makes an in-depth assessment of the management team, including evaluation along several key metrics: 

&#8226; 

The number of years in their current positions; 

&#8226; 

Track record; 

&#8226; 

Industry experience; 

&#8226; 

Management incentive, including the level of direct investment in the enterprise; 

&#8226; 

Background investigations; and 

&#8226; 

Completeness of the management team (lack of positions that need to be filled). 

Industry Dynamics 

An evaluation of the industry is undertaken by our investment adviser that considers several factors. If considered appropriate, industry experts will be consulted or retained. The following factors are analyzed by our investment adviser: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Sensitivity to economic cycles; 

&#8226; 

Competitive environment, including number of competitors, threat of new entrants or substitutes; 

&#8226; 

Fragmentation and relative market share of industry leaders; 

&#8226; 

Growth potential; and 

&#8226; 

Regulatory and legal environment. 

Business Model and Financial Assessment 

Prior to making an investment decision, our investment adviser will undertake a review and analysis of the financial and strategic plans for the potential investment. There is significant evaluation of and reliance upon the due diligence performed by the private equity sponsor and third party experts including accountants and consultants. Areas of evaluation include: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Historical and projected financial performance; 

&#8226; 

Quality of earnings, including source and predictability of cash flows; 

&#8226; 

Customer and vendor interviews and assessments; 

&#8226; 

Potential exit scenarios, including probability of a liquidity event; 

&#8226; 

Internal controls and accounting systems; and 

&#8226; 

Assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. 

Private Equity Sponsor 

Among the most critical due diligence investigations is the evaluation of the private equity sponsor making the investment. A private equity sponsor is typically the controlling shareholder upon completion of an investment and as such is considered critical to the success of the investment. The private equity sponsor is evaluated along several key criteria, including: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Investment track record; 

&#8226; 

Industry experience; 

&#8226; 

Capacity and willingness to provide additional financial support to the company through additional capital contributions, if necessary; and 

&#8226; 

Reference checks. 

Investments 

We target debt investments that will yield meaningful current income and also provide the opportunity for capital appreciation through our ownership of equity securities in certain of our portfolio companies. We typically structure our debt investments with the maximum seniority and collateral that we can reasonably obtain while seeking to achieve our total return target. Our debt investment may be collateralized by a first or second lien on the assets of the portfolio company. As of September 30, 2016 , 78.0% &#32;of our portfolio at fair value consisted of debt investments that were secured by first or second priority liens on the assets of the portfolio company. 

Debt Investments 

We tailor the terms of our debt investments to the facts and circumstances of the transaction and prospective portfolio company, negotiating a structure that seeks to protect our rights and manage our risk while creating incentives for the portfolio company to achieve its business plan. A substantial source of return is monthly or quarterly cash interest that we collect on our debt investments. As of September 30, 2016 , we had directly originated a majority of our debt investments. We are currently focusing our origination efforts on a prudent mix of first lien, second lien and subordinated loans which we believe will provide superior risk-adjusted returns while maintaining adequate credit protection. 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

First Lien Loans. &#160; Our first lien loans generally have terms of four to six years, provide for a variable or fixed interest rate, contain prepayment penalties and are secured by a first priority security interest in all existing and future assets of the borrower. Our first lien loans may take many forms, including revolving lines of credit, term loans and acquisition lines of credit. 

&#8226; 

Second Lien Loans. Our second lien loans generally have terms of five to seven years, primarily provide for a fixed interest rate, contain prepayment penalties and are secured by a second priority security interest in all existing and future assets of the borrower. Our second lien loans often include payment-in-kind, or PIK, interest, which represents contractual interest accrued and added to the principal that generally becomes due at maturity. 

&#8226; 

Unsecured Loans. Our unsecured investments generally have terms of five to seven years and provide for a fixed interest rate. We may make unsecured investments on a stand-alone basis, or in connection with a senior secured loan, a junior secured loan or a &#8220;one-stop&#8221; financing. Our unsecured investments may include PIK interest and an equity component, such as warrants to purchase common stock in the portfolio company. 

We typically structure our debt investments to include covenants that seek to minimize our risk of capital loss. Our debt investments have strong protections, including default penalties, information rights, board observation rights, and affirmative, negative and financial covenants, such as lien protection and prohibitions against change of control. Our debt investments also typically have substantial prepayment penalties designed to extend the life of the average loan. 

Equity Investments 

When we make a debt investment, we may be granted equity in the company in the same class of security as the sponsor receives upon funding. In addition, we may from time to time make non-control, equity co-investments in connection with private equity sponsors. We generally seek to structure our equity investments, such as direct equity co-investments, to provide us with minority rights provisions and event-driven put rights. We also seek to obtain limited registration rights in connection with these investments, which may include &#8220;piggyback&#8221; registration rights. 

Private Equity Fund Investments 

We make investments in the private equity funds of certain private equity sponsors we partner with in making investments in small and mid-sized companies. In general, we make these investments where we have a long-term relationship and are comfortable with the sponsor&#8217;s business model and investment strategy. As of September 30, 2016 , we had investments in 18 &#32;private equity funds, which represented less than 1% of the fair value of our assets as of such date. 

SLF JV I 

We have invested in SLF JV I, which as of September 30, 2016 , consisted of a diverse portfolio of loans to 37 &#32;different borrowers in industries similar to the companies in our portfolio. SLF JV I invests in middle-market and other corporate debt securities, including traditional senior debt, that are secured by some or all of the issuer&#8217;s assets. 

Portfolio Management 

Active Involvement in our Portfolio Companies 

As a business development company, we are obligated to offer to provide managerial assistance to our portfolio companies and to provide it if requested. In fact, we provide managerial assistance to most of our portfolio companies as a general practice and we seek investments where such assistance is appropriate. We monitor the financial trends of each portfolio company to assess the appropriate course of action for each company and to evaluate overall portfolio quality. We have several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance of our investments, including but not limited to, the following: 

&#8226; 

Review of monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies; 

&#8226; 

Periodic and regular contact with portfolio company management to discuss financial position requirements and accomplishments; 

&#8226; 

Attendance at board meetings; 

&#8226; 

Periodic formal update interviews with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the private equity sponsor; and 

&#8226; 

Assessment of business development success, including product development, profitability and the portfolio company&#8217;s overall adherence to its business plan. 

Ranking Criteria 

In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, we use an investment ranking system to characterize and monitor the credit profile and our expected level of returns on each investment in our portfolio. See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Portfolio Asset Quality&#8221; for a description of our four-level numeric ranking scale and the distributions of our investments on the 1 to 4 investment ranking scale at fair value as of September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Valuation of Portfolio Investments 

As a business development company, we generally invest in illiquid securities including debt and equity investments of small and mid-sized companies. All of our investments are recorded at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board of Directors. See &#8220;- Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies- Investment Valuation&#8221; for a description of our investment valuation processes and procedures. 

Net Asset Value Determinations 

Our Board of Directors determines the net asset value per share of our common stock on a quarterly basis. The net asset value per share of our common stock is equal to the value of our total assets minus liabilities divided by the total number of shares of common stock outstanding. Our liabilities will include amounts that we have accrued under our investment advisory agreement, including the management fee, income incentive fee and capital gains incentive fee, the latter of which will be accrued for GAAP purposes based upon the cumulative realized and unrealized capital appreciation in our portfolio. 

Competition 

We compete for investments with a number of business development companies and investment funds (including private equity funds and mezzanine funds), as well as traditional financial services companies such as commercial banks and other sources of financing. Many of these entities have greater financial and managerial resources than we do. We believe we are able to be competitive with these entities primarily on the basis of the experience and contacts of our management team, our responsive and efficient investment analysis and decision-making processes, the investment terms we offer, and our willingness to make smaller investments. 

We believe that some of our competitors make loans with interest rates and returns that are comparable to or lower than the rates and returns that we target. Therefore, we do not seek to compete solely on the interest rates that we offer to potential portfolio companies. For additional information concerning the competitive risks we face, see &#8220;Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure &#8212; We may face increasing competition for investment opportunities, which could reduce returns and result in losses.&#8221; 

Employees 

We do not have any employees. Our day-to-day investment operations are managed by Fifth Street Management as our investment adviser. See &#8220;&#8212; Investment Advisory Agreement.&#8221; Fifth Street Management utilizes over 25 &#32;investment professionals, including its principals. In addition, we reimburse our administrator, FSC CT, for the allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by it in performing its obligations under an administration agreement, including our allocable portion of the costs of compensation of our chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their staffs. For a more detailed discussion of the administration agreement, see &#8220;&#8212; Administration Agreement.&#8221; 

Properties 

We do not own any real estate or other physical properties material to our operations. We utilize office space that is leased by our administrator from an affiliate controlled by the chief executive officer of our investment adviser and administrator, Mr. Tannenbaum. See &#8220;Material Conflicts of Interest.&#8221; Pursuant to an administration agreement with our administrator, we pay FSC CT an allocable portion of the rent at market rates for our principal executive office at 777 West Putnam Avenue, 3rd Floor, Greenwich, CT 06830. Such reimbursement is at cost with no profit to, or markup by, FSC CT. We also utilize additional office space that is leased by affiliates of our administrator at 311 South Wacker Drive, Suite 3380, Chicago, IL 60606 and 309 23rd Street, Suite 200A, Miami Beach, FL 33139. 

Investment Advisory Agreement 

Management Services 

Our investment adviser, Fifth Street Management, is registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. Our investment adviser serves pursuant to an investment advisory agreement in accordance with the Advisers Act. Subject to the overall supervision of our Board of Directors, our investment adviser manages our day-to-day operations and provides us with investment advisory services. Under the terms of the investment advisory agreement, our investment adviser: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

determines the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes; 

&#8226; 

determines what securities we purchase, retain or sell; 

&#8226; 

identifies, evaluates and negotiates the structure of the investments we make; and 

&#8226; 

executes, monitors and services the investments we make. 

Our investment adviser&#8217;s services under the investment advisory agreement may not be exclusive and it is free to furnish similar services to other entities so long as its services to us are not impaired. 

Management Fee 

We pay our investment adviser a fee for its services under the investment advisory agreement consisting of two components &#8212; a base management fee and an incentive fee. The cost of both the base management fee payable to our investment adviser and any incentive fees earned by our investment adviser will ultimately be borne by our common stockholders. 

Base Management Fee 

Prior to December 31, 2015, the base management fee was calculated at an annual rate of 2.0% of our gross assets, including any borrowings for investment purposes but excluding cash and cash equivalents. The base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears and the fee for any partial month or quarter is appropriately prorated. 

On January 20, 2016, we announced that our Investment Adviser agreed to amend the investment advisory agreement to permanently reduce the base management fee. Beginning January 1, 2016, the base management fee on total gross assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents) was permanently reduced from 2.0% to 1.75%. The other commercial terms of the investment advisory arrangement with our investment adviser remained unchanged. 

On July 14, 2015, we announced that the investment adviser voluntarily agreed to a revised base management fee arrangement, or the Revised Management Fee, for the period commencing on July 1, 2015 and remaining in effect until January 1, 2017, or the Waiver Period. 

The Revised Management Fee is intended to provide for a reduction in the base management fee payable by us to the investment adviser during the Waiver Period. Neither the prior waiver of base management fees nor the Revised Management Fee in any way implies that Fifth Street Management will agree to additional waivers of management or incentive fees in any future period. The Revised Management Fee will be calculated quarterly and will be equal to our gross assets, including assets acquired with borrowed funds, but excluding any cash and cash equivalents, multiplied by 0.25 multiplied by the sum of (x) and (y), expressed as a percentage, where (x) is equal to 1.75% multiplied by the Baseline NAV Percentage, and (y) is equal to 1% multiplied by the Incremental NAV Percentage. The &#8220;Baseline NAV Percentage&#8221; is the percentage derived by dividing our net asset value as of March 31, 2015 (i.e., $1,407,774,000), or the Baseline NAV, by our net asset value at the beginning of the fiscal quarter for which the fee is being calculated, or the New NAV. The &#8220;Incremental NAV Percentage&#8221; is the percentage derived by dividing the New NAV in excess of the Baseline NAV by the New NAV. 

The Revised Management Fee modifies the base management fee payable to the investment adviser pursuant to our investment advisory agreement with the investment adviser and results in a blended annual base management fee rate that will not be less than 1%, or greater than 1.75%. The initial computation of the Revised Management Fee will occur at the end of the quarter following the quarter in which we issue or sell shares of our common stock, including new shares issued as dividends or pursuant to our dividend reinvestment plan, but excluding non-ordinary course transactions as outlined below. Prior to that time, the annual base management fee rate will remain at 1.75%. Moreover, if any recalculation of the base management fee rate would otherwise result in an increase of the blended rate used, the blended rate in effect immediately prior to such recalculation would remain in effect until such time, if any, as a recalculation following an equity issuance would result in a lower fee rate. 

The Revised Management Fee will not apply to any assets we acquire through the issuance of shares of our common stock in non-ordinary course transactions, such as mergers or other types of business combination transactions, or the proceeds therefrom, or Excluded Assets, and Excluded Assets will not be taken into account in calculating the New NAV, the Baseline NAV Percentage and/or the Incremental NAV Percentage. As a result, as the Company raises additional equity capital and its net asset value increases, including through net unrealized/realized appreciation on its investments, the overall blended rate of the base management fee is expected to decrease during the Waiver Period. 

Incentive Fee 

The incentive fee has two parts. The first part is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on our &#8220;Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income&#8221; for the immediately preceding fiscal quarter. For this purpose, &#8220;Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income&#8221; means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including (i) any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, advisory, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies), (ii) any gain realized on the extinguishment of our own debt and (iii) any other income of any kind that we are required to distribute to our stockholders in order to maintain our RIC status) accrued during the fiscal quarter, minus our operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, expenses payable under the administration agreement with FSC CT, and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, or OID, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding quarter, will be compared to a &#8220;hurdle rate&#8221; of 2% per quarter (8% annualized), subject to a &#8220;catch-up&#8221; provision measured as of the end of each quarter. Our net investment income used to calculate this part of the incentive fee is also included in the amount of our gross assets used to calculate the 1.75% base management fee. The operation of the incentive fee with respect to our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for each quarter is as follows: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

no incentive fee is payable to the investment adviser in any fiscal quarter in which our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed the hurdle rate of 2% (the &#8220;preferred return&#8221; or &#8220;hurdle&#8221;); 

&#8226; 

100% of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than or equal to 2.5% in any fiscal quarter (10% annualized) is payable to the investment adviser. We refer to this portion of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (which exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than or equal to 2.5%) as the &#8220;catch-up.&#8221; The &#8220;catch-up&#8221; provision is intended to provide our investment adviser with an incentive fee of 20% on all of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income as if a hurdle rate did not apply when our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds 2.5% in any quarter; and 

&#8226; 

20% of the amount of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds 2.5% in any fiscal quarter (10% annualized) is payable to the investment adviser once the hurdle is reached and the catch-up is achieved. 

There is no accumulation of amounts on the hurdle rate from quarter to quarter and accordingly there is no clawback of amounts previously paid if subsequent quarters are below the quarterly hurdle and there is no delay of payment if prior quarters are below the quarterly hurdle. 

The following is a graphical representation of the calculation of the income-related portion of the incentive fee: 

The second part of the incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each fiscal year (or upon termination of the investment advisory agreement, as of the termination date) and equals 20% of our realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of each fiscal year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees, provided that, the incentive fee determined as of September 30, 2008 was calculated for a period of shorter than twelve calendar months to take into account any realized capital gains computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation from inception. 

Example 1: Income Related Portion of Incentive Fee for Each Fiscal Quarter 

Scenario 1 

Assumptions 

Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 1.25% 

Hurdle rate(1) = 2% 

Management fee(2) = 0.4375% 

Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.)(3) = 0.2% 

Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income 

(investment income &#8211; (management fee + other expenses) = 0.6125% 

Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed hurdle rate, therefore there is no income-related incentive fee. 

Scenario 2 

Assumptions 

Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 2.9% 

Hurdle rate(1) = 2% 

Management fee(2) = 0.4375% 

Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.)(3) = 0.2% 

Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income 

(investment income &#8211; (management fee + other expenses) = 2.2625% 

Incentive fee 

&#160; 

=100% &#215; Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (subject to &#8220;catch-up&#8221;)(4) 

=100% &#215; (2.2625% &#8211; 2%) 

=0.2625% 

Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds the hurdle rate, but does not fully satisfy the &#8220;catch-up&#8221; provision, therefore the income related portion of the incentive fee is 0.2625%. 

Scenario 3 

Assumptions 

Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 3.5% 

Hurdle rate(1) = 2% 

Management fee(2) = 0.4375% 

Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.)(3) = 0.2% 

Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income 

(investment income &#8211; (management fee + other expenses) = 2.8625% 

Incentive fee = 100% &#215; Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (subject to &#8220;catch-up&#8221;)(4) 

Incentive fee = 100% &#215; &#8220;catch-up&#8221; + (20% &#215; (Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income &#8211; 2.5%)) 

Catch up 

= 

2.5% &#8211; 2% 

&#160; 

= 

0.5% 

Incentive fee 

= 

(100% &#215; 0.5%) + (20% &#215; (2.8625% &#8211; 2.5%)) 

&#160; 

= 

0.5% + (20% &#215; 0.3625%) 

&#160; 

= 

0.5% + 0.0725% 

&#160; 

= 

0.5725% 

Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds the hurdle rate, and fully satisfies the &#8220;catch-up&#8221; provision, therefore the income related portion of the incentive fee is 0.56%. 

&#160;_________________ 

(1) 

Represents 8% annualized hurdle rate. 

(2) 

Represents 1.75% annualized base management fee. 

(3) 

Excludes organizational and offering expenses. 

(4) 

The &#8220;catch-up&#8221; provision is intended to provide our investment adviser with an incentive fee of 20% on all Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income as if a hurdle rate did not apply when our net investment income exceeds 2.5% in any fiscal quarter. 

Example 2: Capital Gains Portion of Incentive Fee(*): 

Scenario 1 

Assumptions 

Year 1: $20 million investment made in Company A (&#8220;Investment A&#8221;), and $30 million investment made in Company B (&#8220;Investment B&#8221;) 

Year 2: Investment A sold for $50 million and fair market value (&#8220;FMV&#8221;) of Investment B determined to be $32 million 

Year 3: FMV of Investment B determined to be $25 million 

Year 4: Investment B sold for $31 million 

The capital gains portion of the incentive fee would be: 

Year 1: None 

Year 2: Capital gains incentive fee of $6 million &#8212; ($30 million realized capital gains on sale of Investment A multiplied by 20%) 

Year 3: None &#8212; $5 million (20% multiplied by ($30 million cumulative capital gains less $5 million cumulative capital depreciation)) less $6 million (previous capital gains incentive fee paid in Year 2) 

Year 4: Capital gains incentive fee of $200,000 &#8212; $6.2 million ($31 million cumulative realized capital gains multiplied by 20%) less $6 million (capital gains incentive fee paid in Year 2) 

Scenario 2 

Assumptions 

Year 1: $20 million investment made in Company A (&#8220;Investment A&#8221;), $30 million investment made in Company B (&#8220;Investment B&#8221;) and $25 million investment made in Company C (&#8220;Investment C&#8221;) 

Year 2: Investment A sold for $50 million, FMV of Investment B determined to be $25 million and FMV of Investment C determined to be $25 million 

Year 3: FMV of Investment B determined to be $27 million and Investment C sold for $30 million 

Year 4: FMV of Investment B determined to be $24 million 

Year 5: Investment B sold for $20 million 

The capital gains incentive fee, if any, would be: 

Year 1: None 

Year 2: $5 million capital gains incentive fee &#8212; 20% multiplied by $25 million ($30 million realized capital gains on Investment A less unrealized capital depreciation on Investment B) 

Year 3: $1.4 million capital gains incentive fee(1) &#8212; $6.4 million (20% multiplied by $32 million ($35 million cumulative realized capital gains less $3 million unrealized capital depreciation)) less $5 million capital gains incentive fee paid in Year 2 

Year 4: None 

Year 5: None &#8212; $5 million (20% multiplied by $25 million (cumulative realized capital gains of $35 million less realized capital losses of $10 million)) less $6.4 million cumulative capital gains incentive fee paid in Year 2 and Year 3(2) 

_______________ 

* 

The hypothetical amounts of returns shown are based on a percentage of our total net assets and assume no leverage. There is no guarantee that positive returns will be realized and actual returns may vary from those shown in this example. 

(1) 

As illustrated in Year 3 of Scenario 2 above, if we were to be wound up on a date other than our fiscal year end of any year, we may have paid aggregate capital gains incentive fees that are more than the amount of such fees that would be payable if we had been wound up on our fiscal year end of such year. 

(2) 

As noted above, it is possible that the cumulative aggregate capital gains fee received by our investment adviser ($6.4 million) is effectively greater than $5 million (20% of cumulative aggregate realized capital gains less net realized capital losses or net unrealized depreciation ($25 million)). 

Payment of Our Expenses 

Our primary operating expenses are the payment of a base management fee and any incentive fees under the investment advisory agreement and the allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by FSC CT in performing its obligations under the administration agreement. Our management fee compensates our investment adviser for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, executing and servicing our investments. We generally bear all other expenses of our operations and transactions, including (without limitation) fees and expenses relating to: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

expenses of offering our debt and equity securities; 

&#8226; 

the investigation and monitoring of our investments; 

&#8226; 

the cost of calculating our net asset value; 

&#8226; 

the cost of effecting sales and repurchases of shares of our common stock and other securities; 

&#8226; 

management and incentive fees payable pursuant to the investment advisory agreement; 

&#8226; 

fees payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making investments and valuing investments (including third-party valuation firms); 

&#8226; 

transfer agent, trustee and custodial fees; 

&#8226; 

interest payments and other costs related to our borrowings; 

&#8226; 

fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts (including attendance at investment conferences and similar events); 

&#8226; 

federal and state registration fees; 

&#8226; 

any exchange listing fees; 

&#8226; 

federal, state and local taxes; 

&#8226; 

independent directors&#8217; fees and expenses; 

&#8226; 

brokerage commissions; 

&#8226; 

costs of mailing proxy statements, stockholders&#8217; reports and notices; 

&#8226; 

costs of preparing government filings, including periodic and current reports with the SEC; 

&#8226; 

fidelity bond, liability insurance and other insurance premiums; and 

&#8226; 

printing, mailing, independent accountants and outside legal costs and all other direct expenses incurred by either our administrator or us in connection with administering our business, including payments under the administration agreement. 

Duration and Termination 

Unless earlier terminated as described below, the investment advisory agreement, as amended, will remain in effect from year-to-year if approved annually by the Board of Directors or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, including, in either case, approval by a majority of our directors who are not interested persons. The investment advisory agreement will automatically terminate in the event of its assignment. The investment advisory agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon not more than 60 days&#8217; written notice to the other. The investment advisory agreement may also be terminated, without penalty, upon the vote of a majority of our outstanding voting securities. 

Indemnification 

The investment advisory agreement provides that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of their respective duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of their respective duties and obligations, our investment adviser and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members (or their owners) and any other person or entity affiliated with it, are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys&#8217; fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of our investment adviser&#8217;s services under the investment advisory agreement or otherwise as our investment adviser. 

Organization of our Investment Adviser 

Our investment adviser is a Delaware limited liability company that registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. The principal address of our investment adviser is 777 West Putnam Avenue, 3rd Floor, Greenwich, CT 06830. 

Board Approval of the Investment Advisory Agreement 

The investment advisory agreement was first approved by our Board of Directors on December 13, 2007 and by a majority of the limited partners of Fifth Street Mezzanine Partners III, L.P., our predecessor fund, through a written consent first solicited on December 14, 2007. On March 14, 2008, our Board of Directors, including all of the directors who were not &#8220;interested persons&#8221; as defined in the 1940 Act, approved an amendment to the investment advisory agreement that revised the investment advisory agreement to clarify the calculation of the base management fee. Such amendment was also approved by a majority of our outstanding voting securities through a written consent first solicited on April 7, 2008. On May 2, 2011, the investment advisory agreement was further amended, as approved by our Board of Directors, to exclude management fees on any assets held in the form of cash and cash equivalents. Most recently, at a meeting of the Board of Directors held on January 19, 2016, the Board of Directors, including a majority of the independent directors, approved a third amended and restated investment advisory agreement with Fifth Street Management that permanently reduced the base management fee payable to Fifth Street Management on gross assets, excluding cash and cash equivalents, from 2.00% to 1.75% effective as of January 1, 2016. In reaching a decision to approve the third amended and restated investment advisory agreement, the Board of Directors reviewed a significant amount of information and considered, among other things: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

the nature, extent and quality of services to be performed by Fifth Street Management; 

&#8226; 

the investment performance of FSC and that of its portfolio managers with other investment portfolios with similar strategies to FSC; 

&#8226; 

the anticipated costs of providing services to FSC; 

&#8226; 

the anticipated profitability of the relationship between FSC and Fifth Street Management; 

&#8226; 

comparative information on fees and expenses borne by other comparable business development companies and, as applicable, advised accounts; 

&#8226; 

comparative business development company performance and other competitive factors; 

&#8226; 

the extent to which economies of scale have been realized as FSC has grown; and 

&#8226; 

whether proposed fee levels reflect these economies of scale for the benefit of FSC&#8217;s investors. 

No single factor was determinative of the decision of our Board of Directors, including all of the directors who are not &#8220;interested persons&#8221; as defined in the 1940 Act, to approve the third amended and restated investment advisory agreement. Rather, consistent with applicable law and guidance from the federal courts and based on the considerations described above, our Board of Directors, including all of the independent directors, concluded that the third amended and restated investment advisory agreement is fair and reasonable in relation to the services provided. 

Administration Agreement 

We have also entered into an administration agreement with FSC CT, a wholly-owned subsidiary of our investment adviser, under which FSC CT provides administrative services for us, including office facilities and equipment and clerical, bookkeeping and record-keeping services at such facilities. Under the administration agreement, FSC CT also performs, or oversees the performance of, our required administrative services, which includes being responsible for the financial records which we are required to maintain and preparing reports to our stockholders and reports filed with the SEC. In addition, FSC CT assists us in determining and publishing our net asset value, overseeing the preparation and filing of our tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to our stockholders, and generally overseeing the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. FSC CT may also provide on our behalf managerial assistance to our portfolio companies. For providing these services, facilities and personnel, we reimburse FSC CT the allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by FSC CT in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of our chief financial officer and chief compliance officer, and their staffs. Such reimbursement is at cost, with no profit to, or markup by, FSC CT. Our allocable portion of FSC CT&#8217;s costs is determined based upon costs attributable to our operations versus costs attributable to the operations of other entities for which FSC CT provides administrative services. 

The administration agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days&#8217; written notice to the other party. 

The administration agreement provides that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of their respective duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of their respective duties and obligations, FSC CT and its officers, managers, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with it are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys&#8217; fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of services under the administration agreement or otherwise as administrator for us. 

License Agreement 

We have entered into a license agreement with Fifth Street Capital LLC pursuant to which Fifth Street Capital LLC has agreed to grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name &#8220;Fifth Street.&#8221; Under this agreement, we will have a right to use the &#8220;Fifth Street&#8221; name, for so long as Fifth Street Management or one of its affiliates remains our investment adviser. Other than with respect to this limited license, we will have no legal right to the &#8220;Fifth Street&#8221; name. 

Material Conflicts of Interest 

Our executive officers and directors, and certain members of our investment adviser, serve or may serve as officers, directors or principals of entities that operate in the same or a related line of business as we do or of investment funds managed by our affiliates. For example, Fifth Street Management presently serves as investment adviser to FSFR, a publicly-traded BDC with over $600 million of total assets at fair value as of September 30, 2016. FSFR invests in senior secured loans, including first lien, unitranche and second lien debt instruments that pay interest at rates which are determined periodically on the basis of a floating base lending rate, made to private middle market companies whose debt is rated below investment grade, similar to those we target for investment. Specifically, FSFR targets private leveraged middle market companies with approximately $20 million to $120 million of EBITDA, in connection with investments by private equity sponsors, and targets investment sizes generally ranging from $3 million to $30 million. We generally target small and mid-sized companies with annual EBITDA between $10 million and $120 million and target investment sizes generally ranging from $10 million to $100 million. In addition, though not the primary focus of our investment portfolio, our investments also include floating rate senior loans. Therefore, there may be certain investment opportunities that satisfy the investment criteria for both FSFR and us. FSFR operates as a distinct and separate public company and any investment in our common stock will not be an investment in FSFR. In addition, certain of our executive officers and three of our independent directors serve in substantially similar capacities for FSFR. Fifth Street Management and its affiliates also manage private investment funds, and may manage other funds in the future, that have investment mandates that are similar, in whole and in part, with ours. Accordingly, they may have obligations to investors in those entities, the fulfillment of which might not be in the best interests of us or our stockholders. For example, the principals of our investment adviser may face conflicts of interest in the allocation of investment opportunities to us and such other funds. 

Fifth Street Management has adopted, and our Board of Directors has approved, an investment allocation policy that governs the allocation of investment opportunities among the investment funds managed by Fifth Street Management and its affiliates. To the extent an investment opportunity is appropriate for us or FSFR or any other investment fund managed by our affiliates, Fifth Street Management will adhere to its investment allocation policy in order to determine to which entity to allocate the opportunity. As a business development company, we were substantially limited in our ability to co-invest in privately negotiated transactions with affiliated funds until we obtained an exemptive order from the SEC in September 2014. The exemptive relief permits us to participate in negotiated co-investment transactions with certain affiliates, each of whose investment adviser is Fifth Street Management, or an investment adviser controlling, controlled by or under common control with Fifth Street Management, in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors, and pursuant to the conditions to the exemptive relief. 

If we are unable to rely on our exemptive relief for a particular opportunity, such opportunity will be allocated first to the entity whose investment strategy is the most consistent with the opportunity being allocated, and second, if the terms of the opportunity are consistent with more than one entity's investment strategy, on an alternating basis. Although our investment professionals will endeavor to allocate investment opportunities in a fair and equitable manner, we and our common stockholders could be adversely affected to the extent investment opportunities are allocated among us and other investment vehicles managed or sponsored by, or affiliated with, our executive officers, directors and members of our investment adviser. 

Fifth Street Management&#8217;s investment allocation policy is also designed to manage and mitigate the conflicts of interest associated with the allocation of investment opportunities if we are able to co-invest, either pursuant to SEC interpretive positions or our exemptive order, with other accounts managed by our investment adviser and its affiliates. Generally, under the investment allocation, co-investments will be allocated pursuant to the conditions of the exemptive order. Under the investment allocation policy, a portion of each opportunity that is appropriate for us and any affiliated fund will be offered to us and such other eligible accounts as determined by Fifth Street Management and generally based on asset class, fund size and liquidity, among other factors. If there is a sufficient amount of securities to satisfy all participants, the securities will be allocated among the participants in accordance with their order size and if there is an insufficient amount of securities to satisfy all participants, the securities will be allocated pro rata based on each participating party&#8217;s capital available for investment in the asset class being allocated, up to the amount proposed to be invested by each. In accordance with Fifth Street Management&#8217;s investment allocation policy, we might not participate in each individual opportunity, but will, on an overall basis, be entitled to participate equitably with other entities managed by Fifth Street Management and its affiliates. Fifth Street Management seeks to treat all clients fairly and equitably such that none receive preferential treatment vis-&#224;-vis the others over time, in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duty to each of them; however, in some instances, especially in instances of limited liquidity, the factors may not result in pro rata allocations or may result in situations where certain funds receive allocations where others do not. See &#8220;Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence." 

Pursuant to the administration agreement with FSC CT, FSC CT furnishes us with the facilities, including our principal executive office, and administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. We pay FSC CT its allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by FSC CT in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including a portion of the rent at market rates and compensation of our chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs.

We make this information available on our website free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file the information with, or furnish it to, the SEC. 

Business Development Company Regulations 

We have elected to be regulated as a business development company under the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between business development companies and their affiliates, principal underwriters and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters. The 1940 Act requires that a majority of the directors be persons other than &#8220;interested persons,&#8221; as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a business development company unless approved by a majority of our outstanding voting securities. 

The 1940 Act defines &#8220;a majority of the outstanding voting securities&#8221; as the lesser of (i) 67% or more of the voting securities present at a meeting if the holders of more than 50% of our outstanding voting securities are present or represented by proxy or (ii) more than 50% of our outstanding voting securities. 

As a business development company, we were substantially limited in our ability to co-invest in privately negotiated transactions with affiliated funds until we obtained an exemptive order from the SEC in September 2014. The exemptive relief permits us to participate in negotiated co-investment transactions, subject to the conditions of the relief granted by the SEC, with certain affiliates, each of whose investment adviser is Fifth Street Management, or an investment adviser controlling, controlled by or under common control with Fifth Street Management, in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors, and pursuant to the conditions to the exemptive relief. 

We may invest up to 100% of our assets in securities acquired directly from issuers in privately negotiated transactions. With respect to such securities, we may, for the purpose of public resale, be deemed an &#8220;underwriter&#8221; as that term is defined in the Securities Act. Our intention is to not write (sell) or buy put or call options to manage risks associated with the publicly traded securities of our portfolio companies, except that we may enter into hedging transactions to manage the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. However, we may purchase or otherwise receive warrants to purchase the common stock of our portfolio companies in connection with acquisition financing or other investments. Similarly, in connection with an acquisition, we may acquire rights to require the issuers of acquired securities or their affiliates to repurchase them under certain circumstances. We also do not intend to acquire securities issued by any investment company that exceed the limits imposed by the 1940 Act. Under these limits, we generally cannot acquire more than three percent of the voting stock of any registered investment company, invest more than five percent of the value of our total assets in the securities of one investment company or invest more than 10% of the value of our total assets in the securities of investment companies. With regard to that portion of our portfolio invested in securities issued by investment companies, it should be noted that such investments might subject our stockholders to additional expenses. None of these policies is fundamental, and all may be changed without stockholder approval. 

Qualifying Assets 

Under the 1940 Act, a business development company may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the company&#8217;s total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are any of the following: 

(1) Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer which: 

(a) is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States; 

(b) is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by the business development company) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and 

(c) satisfies any of the following: 

(i) does not have any class of securities that is traded on a national securities exchange; 

(ii) has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange, but has an aggregate market value of outstanding voting and non-voting common equity of less than $250 million; 

(iii) is controlled by a business development company or a group of companies including a business development company and the business development company has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company; or 

(iv) is a small and solvent company having total assets of not more than $4 million and capital and surplus of not less than $2 million; 

(2) Securities of any eligible portfolio company that we control; 

(3) Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements; 

(4) Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company; 

(5) Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described in (1) through (4) above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities; or 

(6) Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment. 

In addition, a business development company must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in (1), (2) or (3) above. 

Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies 

Business development companies generally must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities significant managerial assistance, except in circumstances where either (i) the business development company controls such issuer of securities or (ii) the business development company purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together and one of the other persons in the group makes available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the business development company, through its directors, officers or employees (if any), offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company. 

Temporary Investments 

Pending investment in other types of &#8220;qualifying assets,&#8221; as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets. We may invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, provided that such agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement (which is substantially similar to a secured loan) involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price that is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such 

repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25% of our total assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would not meet the diversification tests in order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. Our investment adviser will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions. 

Senior Securities 

We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of debt and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 200% immediately after each such issuance. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we may be prohibited from making distributions to our stockholders or repurchasing such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see &#8220;Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure &#8212; Regulations governing our operation as a business development company and RIC affect our ability to raise, and the way in which we raise, additional capital or borrow for investment purposes, which may have a negative effect on our growth&#8221; and &#8220;&#8212; Because we borrow money, the potential for loss on amounts invested in us will be magnified and may increase the risk of investing in us.&#8221; 

We received exemptive relief from the SEC to permit us to exclude the debt of our SBIC subsidiaries guaranteed by the United States Small Business Administration, or SBA, from the definition of senior securities &#32; in the 200% asset coverage ratio we are required to maintain under the 1940 Act. This provides us increased flexibility under the 200% asset coverage test by permitting us to borrow up to $213.3 million more than we would otherwise be able to under the 1940 Act absent the receipt of this exemptive relief. 

Common Stock 

We are not generally able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. We may, however, sell our common stock, warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the current net asset value of the common stock if our Board of Directors determines that such sale is in our best interests and that of our stockholders, and our stockholders approve such sale. In any such case, the price at which our securities are to be issued and sold may not be less than a price which, in the determination of our Board of Directors, closely approximates the market value of such securities (less any distributing commission or discount). We may also make rights offerings to our stockholders at prices per share less than the net asset value per share, subject to applicable requirements of the 1940 Act. See &#8220;Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure &#8212; Regulations governing our operation as a business development company and RIC affect our ability to raise, and the way in which we raise, additional capital or borrow for investment purposes, which may have a negative effect on our growth.&#8221; 

Code of Ethics 

We have adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and we have also approved the investment adviser&#8217;s code of ethics that was adopted by it under Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and Rule 204A-1 under the Advisers Act. These codes establish procedures for personal investments and restrict certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to the code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with the code&#8217;s requirements. You may read and copy the codes of ethics at the SEC&#8217;s Public Reference Room located at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549. You may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. In addition, the codes of ethics are available on the EDGAR Database on the SEC&#8217;s website at http://www.sec.gov &#32;and are available at the Investor Relations portion of our website at http://fsc.fifthstreetfinance.com. 

Compliance Policies and Procedures 

We and our investment adviser have adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the federal securities laws and are required to review these compliance policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation. Our chief compliance officer is responsible for administering these policies and procedures. 

Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures 

We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to our investment adviser. The proxy voting policies and procedures of our investment adviser are set forth below. The guidelines are reviewed periodically by our investment adviser and our non-interested directors, and, accordingly, are subject to change. 

Introduction 

As an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act, our investment adviser has a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests of its clients. As part of this duty, it recognizes that it must vote client securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in the best interests of its clients. 

These policies and procedures for voting proxies for the investment advisory clients of our investment adviser are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act. 

Proxy Policies 

Our investment adviser will vote proxies relating to our securities in the best interest of our stockholders. It will review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted for a stockholder vote to determine its impact on the portfolio securities held by us. Although our investment adviser will generally vote against proposals that may have a negative impact on our portfolio securities, it may vote for such a proposal if there exists compelling long-term reasons to do so. 

The proxy voting decisions of our investment adviser are made by the officers who are responsible for monitoring each of our investments. To ensure that its vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, our investment adviser will require that: (a) anyone involved in the decision-making process disclose to its chief compliance officer any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (b) employees involved in the decision making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how our investment adviser intends to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties. 

Proxy Voting Records 

You may obtain information, without charge, regarding how our investment adviser voted proxies for us for the most recent 12-month period ended June 30, 2016 with respect to our portfolio securities by making a written request for proxy voting information to: Fifth Street Finance Corp. Chief Compliance Officer, 777 West Putnam Avenue, 3rd Floor, Greenwich, CT 06830. 

Other 

We are subject to periodic examination by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act. 

We are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a business development company, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person&#8217;s office. 

Securities Exchange Act and Sarbanes-Oxley Act Compliance 

We are subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the Exchange Act, including the filing of quarterly, annual and current reports, proxy statements and other required items. In addition, we are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly-held companies and their insiders. For example: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

pursuant to Rule 13a-14 under the Exchange Act, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer are required to certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports; 

&#8226; 

pursuant to Item 307 of Regulation S-K, our periodic reports are required to disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures; and 

&#8226; 

pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our management is required to prepare a report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm is required to audit our internal control over financial reporting. 

Small Business Investment Company Regulations 

Our wholly-owned subsidiaries&#8217; SBIC licenses allow them to obtain leverage by issuing SBA-guaranteed debentures, subject to customary procedures. SBA-guaranteed debentures are non-recourse, interest only debentures with interest payable semi-annually and have a ten-year maturity. The principal amount of SBA-guaranteed debentures is not required to be paid prior to maturity but may be prepaid at any time without penalty. The interest rate of SBA-guaranteed debentures is fixed at the time of issuance at a market-driven spread over U.S. Treasury Notes with ten-year maturities. 

SBICs are designed to stimulate the flow of private equity capital to eligible small businesses. Under SBA regulations, SBICs may make loans to eligible small businesses and invest in the equity securities of small businesses. Under present SBA regulations, eligible small businesses include businesses that have a tangible net worth not exceeding $19.5 million and have average net income after federal income taxes (excluding any carry-over losses) not exceeding $6.5 million for the two most recent fiscal years. In addition, an SBIC must devote 25% of its investment activity to &#8220;smaller&#8221; enterprises as defined by the SBA. A smaller enterprise is one that has a tangible net worth not exceeding $6 million and has average net income after federal income taxes (excluding any carry-over losses) not exceeding $2 million for the two most recent fiscal years. SBA regulations also provide alternative size standard criteria to determine eligibility, which depend on the industry in which the business is engaged and are based on such factors as the number of employees and gross sales. According to SBA regulations, SBICs may make long-term loans to small businesses, invest in the equity securities of such businesses and provide them with consulting and advisory services. 

SBA regulations currently limit the amount that an SBIC subsidiary may borrow to a maximum of $150 million when it has at least $75 million in regulatory capital. Affiliated SBICs are permitted to issue up to a combined maximum amount of $350 million when they have at least $175.0 million in regulatory capital. As of September 30, 2016 , one of our SBIC subsidiaries had $75 million in regulatory capital and $138.3 million &#32;in SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding, which had a fair value of $131.0 million . As of September 30, 2016 , our other SBIC subsidiary had $37.5 million in regulatory capital and $75.0 million &#32;in SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding, which had a fair value of $67.5 million . Our SBIC subsidiaries held approximately 344.7 million , or 14.7% , of our total assets at September 30, 2016 . 

We have received exemptive relief from the SEC to permit us to exclude the debt of our SBIC subsidiaries guaranteed by the SBA from the definition of senior securities in the 200% asset coverage test under the 1940 Act. We are now permitted to borrow one dollar for every dollar we have in assets less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by debt securities issued by us or loans obtained by us. This allows us increased flexibility under the 200% asset coverage test by permitting us to borrow up to $213.3 million more than we would otherwise be able to absent the receipt of this exemptive relief. 

The SBA restricts the ability of SBICs to repurchase their capital stock. SBA regulations also include restrictions on a &#8220;change of control&#8221; or transfer of an SBIC and require that SBICs invest idle funds in accordance with SBA regulations. In addition, our SBIC subsidiaries may also be limited in their ability to make distributions to us if they do not have sufficient capital, in accordance with SBA regulations. 

Our SBIC subsidiaries are subject to regulation and oversight by the SBA, including requirements with respect to maintaining certain minimum financial ratios and other covenants. Receipt of SBIC licenses does not assure that our SBIC subsidiaries will receive SBA guaranteed debenture funding, which is dependent upon our SBIC subsidiaries continuing to be in compliance with SBA regulations and policies. The SBA, as a creditor, will have a superior claim to our SBIC subsidiaries&#8217; assets over our stockholders in the event we liquidate our SBIC subsidiaries or the SBA exercises its remedies under the SBA-guaranteed debentures issued by our SBIC subsidiaries upon an event of default. 

Stock Exchange Corporate Governance Regulations 

Each of the NASDAQ Global Select Market and the New York Stock Exchange has adopted corporate governance regulations that listed companies must comply with. We are in compliance with such corporate governance regulations applicable to business development companies. 

Taxation as a Regulated Investment Company 

As a business development company, we have elected to be treated, and intend to continue to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally will not be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any income that we distribute (or are deemed to have distributed) to our stockholders as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes. To continue to qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, to qualify for RIC tax treatment we must distribute to our stockholders, for each taxable year, dividends of an amount generally equal to at least 90% of our &#8220;investment company taxable income,&#8221; which is generally our ordinary income plus the excess of our realized net short-term capital gains over our realized net long-term capital losses, determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid, or the Annual Distribution Requirement. 

If we qualify as a RIC and satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, then we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our income we distribute (or are deemed to distribute) to stockholders. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any income or capital gains not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our stockholders. 

We will be subject to a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless we timely distribute dividends in respect of each calendar year of an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our net ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for each calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any net ordinary income or capital gain net income recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years and on which we paid no U.S. federal corporate income tax, or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement. We generally will endeavor in each taxable year to make sufficient distributions to our stockholders to avoid any U.S. federal excise tax on our earnings. 

In order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

continue to maintain our election to be treated as a business development company under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year; 

&#8226; 

derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to loans of certain securities, gains from the sale of stock or other securities, net income from certain &#8220;qualified publicly traded partnerships,&#8221; or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities, or the 90% Income Test; and 

&#8226; 

diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year: 

&#8226; 

at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and 

&#8226; 

no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer, of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable Code rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or of certain &#8220;qualified publicly traded partnerships,&#8221; or the Diversification Tests. 

Earnings considered qualifying income in determining our satisfaction of the 90% Income Test may exclude such income as management fees received in connection with our SBIC or other potential outside managed funds and certain other fees. 

We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive cash. For example, if we hold debt instruments that are treated under applicable tax rules as having OID (such as debt instruments with PIK interest or, in certain cases, increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), we generally would be required to include in income each taxable year a portion of the OID that accrues over the life of the debt instrument, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. We also may be required to include in income other amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as PIK interest and deferred loan origination fees that are paid after origination of a loan or are paid in non-cash compensation such as warrants or stock. Because any OID or other amounts accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the taxable year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount. 

Although we do not presently expect to do so, we are authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement. However, under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted in certain circumstances to make distributions to our stockholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain &#8220;asset coverage&#8221; tests are met. Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to maintaining our status as a RIC. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous.
