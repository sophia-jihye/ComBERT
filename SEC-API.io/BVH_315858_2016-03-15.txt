 Item 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The Company 

&#160; 

BFC Financial Corporation (&#8220;BFC&#8221; and, unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221;, &#8220;our&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a Florida-based holding company. BFC&#8217;s principal holdings include an approximately 81% equity interest in BBX Capital Corporation (including its subsidiaries, &#8220;BBX Capital&#8221; and a direct 54% equity interest in Woodbridge Holdings, LLC &#8220;Woodbridge&#8221;). BBX Capital holds the remaining 46% equity interest in Woodbridge. Woodbridge owns 100% of Bluegreen Corporation (including its subsidiaries, &#8220;Bluegreen&#8221;). Bluegreen is a sales, marketing and management company focused on the vacation ownership industry. BBX Capital is a Florida-based company involved in the acquisition, development, ownership and management of and investments in real estate and real estate development projects as well as investments in operating businesses. 

&#160; 

BBX Capital&#8217;s principal asset until July 31, 2012 was its ownership of BankAtlantic and its subsidiaries (&#8220;BankAtlantic&#8221;). BankAtlantic was a federal savings bank headquartered in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. On July 31, 2012, BBX Capital completed the sale to BB&#38;T Corporation (&#8220;BB&#38;T&#8221;) of all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of BankAtlantic (the stock sale and related transactions described herein are collectively referred to as the &#8220;BankAtlantic Sale&#8221; or the &#8220;BB&#38;T Transaction&#8221;). Prior to the closing of the BB&#38;T Transaction, BankAtlantic formed two wholly-owned subsidiaries, BBX Capital Asset Management, LLC (&#8220;CAM&#8221;) and Florida Asset Resolution Group, LLC (&#8220;FAR&#8221;). 

&#160; 

Prior to the closing of the BB&#38;T Transaction, BankAtlantic contributed approximately $82 million in cash to CAM and certain non-performing commercial loans, commercial real estate and previously written-off assets that had an aggregate carrying value on BankAtlantic&#8217;s balance sheet of $125 million as of July 31, 2012. CAM assumed all liabilities related to these assets. Prior to the closing of the BB&#38;T Transaction, BankAtlantic distributed all of the membership interests in CAM to BBX Capital. CAM remains a wholly-owned subsidiary of BBX Capital. 

&#160; 

BankAtlantic also contributed to FAR certain performing and non-performing loans, tax certificates and real estate that had an aggregate carrying value on BankAtlantic&#8217;s balance sheet of approximately $346 million as of July 31, 2012. FAR assumed all liabilities related to these assets. BankAtlantic also contributed approximately $50 million in cash to FAR on July 31, 2012 and thereafter distributed all of the membership interests in FAR to BBX Capital. At the closing of the BB&#38;T Transaction, BBX Capital transferred to BB&#38;T 95% of the outstanding preferred membership interests in FAR in connection with BB&#38;T&#8217;s assumption of BBX Capital&#8217;s $285.4 million in principal amount of outstanding trust preferred securities (&#8220;TruPS&#8221;) obligations. BBX Capital retained the remaining 5% of FAR&#8217;s preferred membership interests. Under the terms of the Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company agreement of FAR entered into by BBX Capital and BB&#38;T at the closing, BB&#38;T was entitled to hold its 95% preferred interest in the net cash flows of FAR until it recovered $285 million in preference amount plus a priority return of LIBOR + 2.0% per annum on any unpaid preference amount. On May 6, 2015, BB&#38;T&#8217;s preferred interest in FAR was repaid in full and redeemed and FAR became a wholly-owned subsidiary of BBX Capital. 

&#160; 

BFC consolidates the financial results of the entities in which it has controlling financial interests, including BBX Capital, Woodbridge, and Bluegreen. As a consequence, the assets and liabilities of all such entities are presented on a consolidated basis in BFC&#8217;s financial statements. However, except as otherwise noted, the debts and obligations of the consolidated entities, including BBX Capital, Woodbridge, and Bluegreen, are not direct obligations of BFC and are non-recourse to BFC. Similarly, the assets of those entities are not available to BFC absent a dividend or distribution from those entities (and, in the case of Bluegreen, a subsequent dividend or distribution by Woodbridge, Bluegreen&#8217;s parent company). 

&#160; 

Historically, BFC&#8217;s business strategy has been to invest in and acquire businesses in diverse industries either directly or through controlled subsidiaries. In recent years, BFC has focused on providing strategic support to its existing investments with a view to the improved performance of the organization as a whole. Initiatives in furtherance of this strategy include BFC&#8217;s purchase of additional shares of BBX Capital&#8217;s Class A Common Stock in the tender offer which was completed in April 2015, as described in further detail in Item 8 &#8211; Note 1 of this report, and the cash merger consummated in April 2013 pursuant to which Woodbridge acquired all of the outstanding shares of Bluegreen&#8217;s common stock not previously owned by Woodbridge. Additionally, we may invest in operating 

&#160;

businesses and real estate joint ventures for the development of residential and commercial real estate projects, including those in which our affiliates may participate. In furtherance of this goal or otherwise as part of our business and investment strategy, we expect to evaluate various financing transactions, including debt or equity financings as well as other alternative sources of new capital. BFC&#8217;s investments or acquisitions, and the business and investment strategies of BFC&#8217;s subsidiaries, may not prove to be successful or even if successful may not initially generate income or may generate income on an irregular basis, and may involve a long term investment. As a result our results of operations may vary significantly on a quarterly basis. BFC may also consider transactions involving the sale of all or a portion of its assets, investments or subsidiaries, including transactions involving BBX Capital or Bluegreen, either directly or indirectly through a transaction involving Woodbridge. These may include, among other alternatives, a future sale or spin-off or transactions involving public or private issuances of debt or equity securities which might result in a decrease in BFC&#8217;s ownership of the companies.

&#183; 

risks associated with BFC&#8217;s current business strategy, including the risk that BFC will not be in a position to provide strategic support to or make additional investments in its subsidiaries or in joint ventures or that BFC 

&#160;

may not achieve or maintain in the future the benefits anticipated to be realized from such support or additional investments, including the additional investment made in BBX Capital pursuant to the tender offer consummated during April 2015, and the risk that BFC will not be in a position to make new investments or that any investments made will not prove to be advantageous;

Business Segments 

&#160; 

BFC currently reports the results of its operations through two reportable segments: Bluegreen and BBX Capital. 

&#160; 

Bluegreen Segment 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

Bluegreen is a sales, marketing and management company focused on the vacation ownership industry. Bluegreen, which in prior reports was referred to as Bluegreen Vacations or Bluegreen Resorts, markets, sells and manages vacation ownership interests (&#8220;VOIs&#8221;) in resorts, which are generally located in popular, &#8220;drive-to&#8221; vacation destinations, and were either developed or acquired by Bluegreen or developed by others, in which case Bluegreen earns fees for providing these services. Bluegreen also earns fees by providing club and property owner&#8217;s association management services, mortgage servicing, VOI title services, reservation services, and construction design and development services. In addition, Bluegreen provides financing to FICO &#174; score-qualified individual purchasers of VOIs, which generates significant interest income for Bluegreen. 

&#160; 

Industry Overview 

&#160; 

The resorts component of the leisure industry is serviced primarily by two separate alternatives for overnight accommodations: commercial lodging establishments and vacation ownership resorts. Commercial lodging consists principally of hotels and motels in which a room is rented on a nightly, weekly or monthly basis, or rentals of privately-owned condominium units or homes. For many vacationers, particularly those with families, a lengthy stay at a quality commercial lodging establishment can be expensive, and the space provided to such vacationers by these establishments relative to the cost is often not economical. In addition, room rates at commercial lodging establishments are subject to change periodically and availability is often uncertain. Bluegreen believes that vacation ownership presents an attractive vacation alternative to commercial lodging. 

&#160; 

The purchase of a timeshare property typically entitles the buyer to use and occupy a fully-furnished residence, generally for a stated period in perpetuity. Typically, the buyer acquires an ownership interest in the vacation residence, which is often held as a tenant-in-common with other buyers of interests in the vacation residence. However, under a points-based vacation club system, such as the Bluegreen Vacation Club, the members purchase a real estate interest in a specific VOI resort, which is deeded on their behalf into a trust and provides the member with beneficial rights, including an annual or biennial allotment of points that can be used to reserve occupancy at participating resorts. See &#8220;Products and Services &#8211; Vacation Ownership&#8221; below for additional information regarding the Bluegreen Vacation Club and Bluegreen&#8217;s points-based system. 

&#160; 

Bluegreen believes that, in general, Americans desire to take family vacations and that the Bluegreen Vacation Club is positioned to benefit from consumer demand for family vacations. However, economic conditions and other factors may have an adverse effect on the demand for vacations as well as on the vacation ownership industry specifically and on Bluegreen&#8217;s operations. 

&#160; 

Products and Services 

&#160; 

Vacation Ownership 

&#160; 

Bluegreen has been involved in the vacation ownership industry since its inception in 1994. Since Bluegreen&#8217;s inception, Bluegreen has generated approximately 535,000 VOI sales transactions, which include over 77,000 VOI sales transactions on behalf of third-parties. As of December 31, 2015, Bluegreen was selling VOIs in the Bluegreen Vacation Club at 23 sales offices at resorts located in the United States. VOIs in Bluegreen resorts and those sold by Bluegreen on behalf of third parties typically entitle the buyer to use resort accommodations through an annual or biennial allotment of &#8220;points&#8221; which represent the buyer&#8217;s ownership and beneficial use rights in perpetuity in the Bluegreen Vacation Club (supported by an underlying deeded VOI held in trust for the buyer). Bluegreen believes the Bluegreen Vacation Club allows its VOI owners to customize their vacation experience in a more flexible manner than traditional fixed-week vacation ownership programs. Members can use their points to stay in resorts for varying lengths of time starting at a minimum of two nights. The number of points required for a stay at a resort varies depending on a variety of factors, including the resort location, the size of a unit, the vacation season and the days of the week used. Under this system, members can select vacations among available resorts according to their schedules, space needs, and available points. Subject to certain restrictions and fees, members are typically allowed to carry over for one year any unused points and to "borrow" points from the next year. Bluegreen Vacation Club members may use their points to stay in any of the 66 Bluegreen Vacation Club resorts, as described in further detail below. 

&#160;

Bluegreen Vacation Club members may also use their points to take advantage of other vacation options, including an exchange program offered by a third-party world-wide vacation ownership exchange network of approximately 4,500 resorts and other vacation experiences such as cruises and hotel stays. Additionally, through an alliance with Choice Hotels International, Inc. (NYSE:CHH, &#8220;Choice Hotels&#8221;), Bluegreen Vacation Club members may enroll in Choice Hotels&#8217; free rewards program, Choice Privileges &#174;. For a fee, Bluegreen Vacation Club members can convert their Bluegreen Vacation Club points into Choice Privileges &#174; points, which can be used for free nights at Choice hotel locations and other rewards such as gift cards. Additionally, for a fee, members of the Bluegreen Traveler Plus&#8482; program may use their Bluegreen Vacation Club points for stays in Choice Hotels&#8217; Ascend Hotel Collection&#174; properties, a network of historic and boutique hotels in the United States, Canada, Scandinavia and Latin America, subject to the terms and conditions of the program. See &#8220;VOI Exchange Networks, the Bluegreen Traveler Plus&#8482; Program and Other Strategic Alliances&#8221; for additional information regarding vacation options available to Bluegreen Vacation Club members in addition to Bluegreen Vacation Club resorts. 

&#160; 

The owners of VOIs collectively manage the resort property through nonprofit POAs that are governed by a board of directors or trustees, consisting of representatives of the developer (so long as the developer owns VOIs in the resort or as otherwise provided by law) and owners of VOIs at the resort. The board of directors hires a management company to which it delegates many of the rights and responsibilities of the POA, including grounds landscaping, security, housekeeping and operating supplies, garbage collection, utilities, insurance procurement, laundry and repairs and maintenance. Each VOI owner is required to pay a share of the costs of maintaining all of the properties in the Bluegreen Vacation Club system. These charges generally consist of an annual maintenance fee plus applicable real estate taxes and special assessments, which are assessed on an as-needed basis. If a VOI owner does not pay such charges, the owner&#8217;s use rights may be suspended and ultimately terminated, subject to the lender&#8217;s first mortgage lien on the VOI, if any. 

&#160; 

According to information compiled by various sources, Bluegreen believes its typical customer to be married with children with an average age of 48 and an average household income of approximately $75,000. 

&#160; 

Capital-Light Business Strategy 

&#160; 

In addition to Bluegreen&#8217;s traditional vacation ownership operations, Bluegreen has in recent years pursued a business strategy, referred to herein as the &#8220;capital-light&#8221; business strategy, involving activities that typically do not require the significant costs and capital investments generally incurred in connection with the acquisition and development of VOIs under Bluegreen&#8217;s traditional vacation ownership business. Bluegreen believes its capital-light business strategy enables it to leverage its expertise and existing infrastructure in resort management, sales and marketing, mortgage servicing, title services, and construction management to generate recurring revenues from third parties. As of December 31, 2015, Bluegreen&#8217;s capital-light business activities consisted of the following: fee-based sales and marketing arrangements; just-in-time inventory acquisition arrangements; secondary market arrangements; and other fee-based services. Each of these categories is described below. 

&#160; 

Fee-Based Sales and Marketing Arrangements - In 2009, Bluegreen began offering sales and marketing services to third party developers for a fee. Under these arrangements, Bluegreen sells third party VOIs as Bluegreen Vacation Club interests through its distribution network of sales offices, typically on a non-committed basis. Bluegreen seeks to structure its fee for these services to cover its selling and marketing costs, plus an operating profit. Because the completed VOI was built by a third party, Bluegreen is not at risk for the development financing of these projects and Bluegreen has little to no capital requirements. Notes receivable originated in connection with Bluegreen&#8217;s sale of third party VOIs under commission-based arrangements are held by the third party developer, and in certain cases, are serviced by Bluegreen for a fee. Bluegreen refers to sales made on behalf of third-party developers as &#8220;FBS Sales&#8221;. 

&#160; 

Just-In-Time Arrangements - In 2013, Bluegreen began entering into agreements with third-party developers that allow Bluegreen to buy VOI inventory from time to time in close proximity to the timing of when Bluegreen intends to sell such VOIs. Bluegreen strives to enter into such arrangements on a non-committed basis, although Bluegreen may engage in committed arrangements under certain circumstances. Because the completed VOI was built by a third-party, Bluegreen is not at risk for the development financing of these projects. Unlike FBS Sales, receivables originated in connection with sales of just-in-time inventory are held by Bluegreen. Sales of inventory acquired through these arrangements are sometimes referred to as &#8220;Just-In-Time Sales&#8221;. 

&#160; 

Secondary Market Arrangements - In 2012, Bluegreen began a program to acquire VOI inventory from POAs and other third parties on a non-committed basis, in close proximity to the timing of when Bluegreen intends to sell such VOIs. Such VOIs are typically obtained by the POAs through foreclosure in connection with maintenance fee defaults, and are generally acquired by Bluegreen at a significant discount. Sales of inventory acquired through these arrangements are sometimes referred to as &#8220;Secondary Market Sales&#8221;. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Other Fee-Based Services - Bluegreen also earns fees for providing management services to the Bluegreen Vacation Club and to certain POAs. In connection with the management services provided to the Bluegreen Vacation Club, Bluegreen manages the club reservation system and provides owner services as well as billing and collection services. In connection with Bluegreen&#8217;s management of POAs, Bluegreen provides day-to-day management services, including oversight of housekeeping services, maintenance, and certain accounting and administrative services. As of December 31, 2015, Bluegreen provided management services to 46 timeshare resort properties and hotels. Other fee-based services also include the processing of sales of VOIs through Bluegreen&#8217;s wholly-owned title company subsidiary, which earns fees in connection with the closing of the VOI transactions. 

&#160; 

Bluegreen also generates fee-based income by providing construction design and management services, and mortgage servicing. 

&#160; 

Bluegreen&#8217;s goal is for the activities associated with its capital-light business strategy to become an increasing portion of its business over time; however, Bluegreen&#8217;s efforts to execute its capital-light business strategy may not be successful, and any arrangements entered into may not prove to be profitable. Further, changes in economic conditions may adversely impact the future results of Bluegreen&#8217;s fee-based and other capital-light business activities. 

&#160; 

Vacation Club Resort Locations 

&#160; 

Bluegreen Vacation Club resorts are primarily &#8220;drive-to&#8221; resort destinations. Bluegreen believes that 85% of its VOI owners live within a 4 hour drive of at least one of its resorts. Units at most of the Bluegreen Vacation Club resorts typically include a full kitchen, two televisions, and laundry facilities. Many resorts offer guests a clubhouse (with an indoor or outdoor pool, a game room, exercise facilities and a lounge) and hotel-type staff. Bluegreen manages certain of the resorts either directly or through a subcontract.

&#160; 

Future Resorts and Acquisition of Additional Inventory 

&#160; 

Bluegreen believes that it currently has adequate timeshare inventory on hand, or available through arrangements with third parties in connection with its capital-light business strategy, to satisfy its projected sales of VOIs for 2016 and a number of years thereafter. Accordingly, Bluegreen currently does not plan to acquire or significantly develop additional resort properties in the near term other than those to be developed by Bluegreen/Big Cedar Vacations and resorts added to the Bluegreen Vacation Club pursuant to Bluegreen&#8217;s capital-light business strategy. However, Bluegreen may decide to acquire or develop additional inventory in the future. 

&#160; 

VOI Exchange Networks, the Bluegreen Traveler Plus&#8482; Program, and Other Strategic Alliances 

&#160; 

Bluegreen believes that its VOIs are made more attractive by its alliance with Choice Hotels, its participation in third-party exchange networks, its Traveler Plus&#8482; program and other strategic affiliations with third-party resort developers. In 2013, Bluegreen entered into a five-year strategic alliance agreement with Choice Hotels. Choice Hotels currently franchises approximately 6,300 hotels in more than 35 countries and territories and its brands include the Ascend Hotel Collection&#174;, Comfort Inn&#174;, Comfort Suites &#174; , Quality &#174; , Sleep Inn &#174; , Clarion &#174; , Cambria &#174; hotels and suites, MainStay Suites&#174;, Suburban Extended Stay Hotel &#174; , Econo Lodge &#174; and Rodeway Inn &#174; . Bluegreen&#8217;s relationship with Choice Hotels&#8217; impacts several areas of Bluegreen&#8217;s business and, while there is no assurance as to the success of the relationship, it includes a sales and marketing alliance component that Bluegreen believes will enable it to leverage Choice Hotels brands, customer relationships and marketing channels to market Bluegreen&#8217;s VOI offerings. Additionally, subject to the terms and conditions of the agreements, including specified payments to Choice Hotels, Bluegreen Vacation Club resorts may be branded as part of the Ascend Hotel Collection&#174;. As of December 31, 2015, a total of 29 Bluegreen Vacation Club resorts were branded as part of the Ascend Hotel Collection &#174; . Also, &#160; 

&#160;

Bluegreen Vacation Club members may enroll as members of the Choice Hotels loyalty program, Choice Privileges &#174; , and for a fee can convert their Bluegreen Vacation Club points into Choice Privileges &#174; points which can be used for stays at participating Choice Hotels. Additionally, for a fee, members of the Bluegreen Traveler Plus &#8482; program may exchange their vacation points for stays at Choice Hotels&#8217; Ascend Hotel Collection &#174; properties subject to the terms and conditions of the program. 

&#160; 

Bluegreen Vacation Club members may also participate in an unaffiliated external exchange network, Resort Condominiums International, LLC (&#8220;RCI&#8221;). The RCI exchange network allows an owner to exchange stays in their VOI for occupancy at nearly 4,500 participating resorts located throughout the world in over 100 countries, based upon availability and the payment of a variable exchange fee. The annual membership fees of RCI are included in the Bluegreen Vacation Club dues. In 2015, approximately 9% of Bluegreen Vacation Club members utilized the RCI exchange network for an exchange of two or more nights. Most of the Bluegreen Vacation Club resorts are rated in one of the two highest categories by RCI (Gold Crown and Silver Crown). &#160; 

&#160; 

Bluegreen Vacation Club members, for an additional annual fee, may also participate in the Bluegreen Traveler Plus&#8482; program, which allows them to use their points for a variety of hotel stays, RV site stays within the &#8220;Coast to Coast&#8221; network, or various cruise vacations. Also, for a nominal fee, Bluegreen Vacation Club members who purchased or upgraded their VOI since July 1, 2007 and participate in the Bluegreen Traveler Plus &#8482; program have the ability to use their vacation points to reserve accommodations in 42 additional resort locations through Bluegreen&#8217;s alliances with other resort development companies (&#8220;Direct Exchange&#8221;). 

&#160; 

No assurance can be given that Bluegreen&#8217;s resorts will continue to participate in the RCI or Direct Exchange networks, or that Bluegreen&#8217;s customers will continue to be satisfied with these networks or the Bluegreen Traveler Plus &#8482; program. In addition, Bluegreen&#8217;s relationship with Choice Hotels may not be received favorably by Bluegreen&#8217;s customers and may not have a positive impact on Bluegreen&#8217;s operating results or financial condition. If Bluegreen does not continue to participate in qualified exchange networks or maintain other strategic alliances, including if Bluegreen&#8217;s resorts are not included in such networks or alliances, or if such networks or other strategic alliances do not operate effectively, Bluegreen&#8217;s financial condition, results and business could be materially adversely affected. 

&#160; 

Marketing and Sale of Inventory 

&#160; 

Bluegreen uses a variety of methods to attract prospective purchasers of VOIs, including selling discount vacation packages either face-to-face or through telemarketing efforts to consumers Bluegreen meets in connection with various marketing alliances (as discussed in greater detail below) and other arrangements, and referrals of prospective purchasers from existing VOI owners. Bluegreen sometimes provides hotel accommodations or accommodations in one of Bluegreen&#8217;s resorts to prospective purchasers at reduced rates in exchange for their touring one of Bluegreen&#8217;s resorts. 

&#160; 

Additionally, Bluegreen offers a sampler program which allows purchasers of this product to enjoy substantially the same accommodations offered to Bluegreen Vacation Club members during a trial period, which is generally one or two years. Bluegreen believes that it benefits from the sampler program as it gives Bluegreen an opportunity to market its VOIs to customers when they use their trial memberships at a Bluegreen resort and to recapture a portion of the costs incurred in connection with the initial marketing to prospective customers. 

&#160; 

In addition to attracting new customers, Bluegreen seeks to sell VOIs to its existing VOI owners (&#8220;owner sales&#8221;). Owner sales generally have lower marketing costs and typically result in relatively higher operating margins than sales generated through other marketing channels. During 2015, owner sales accounted for 47% of Bluegreen&#8217;s system-wide sales. However, Bluegreen has recently increased, and expects to continue to increase, its marketing efforts to new customers as compared to existing owners as it believes that its ability to continue to sell VOIs to its current existing owner base will diminish over time. Accordingly, Bluegreen expects that its owner sales as a percentage of total sales will decrease and Bluegreen&#8217;s marketing expenses will increase in the future. 

&#160; 

Bluegreen uses both &#8220;permission&#8221; marketing and branding programs. &#8220;Permission&#8221; marketing methods involve obtaining the prospective purchasers&#8217; permission, directly or indirectly, to contact them in the future regarding an offer to purchase a product or service. Branding involves forming alliances with third-party entities that possess what Bluegreen believes to be a nationally or regionally known brand name, a good reputation and a customer base with similar demographic characteristics to Bluegreen&#8217;s target market. 

&#160; 

One of Bluegreen&#8217;s wholly-owned subsidiaries has an arrangement with Big Cedar, LLC (&#8220;Big Cedar&#8221;), an affiliate of Bass Pro, Inc. (&#8220;Bass Pro&#8221;), relating to Bluegreen/Big Cedar Vacations. Bluegreen&#8217;s subsidiary owns 51% of Bluegreen/Big Cedar Vacations and Big Cedar owns the remaining 49%. Bluegreen/Big Cedar Vacations develops, 

&#160;

markets, and sells VOIs at the Bluegreen Wilderness Club at Big Cedar, a wilderness-themed resort adjacent to the Big Cedar Lodge, a luxury hotel resort owned by Big Cedar, on the shores of Table Rock Lake in Ridgedale, Missouri. Bluegreen/Big Cedar Vacations also develops, markets, and sells timeshare interests in The Cliffs at Long Creek and Paradise Point Resort. Bluegreen/Big Cedar Vacations pays Big Cedar a fee upon sales of certain timeshare interests for promotional, marketing and advertising services. 

&#160; 

Bluegreen also has an exclusive marketing agreement with Bass Pro, a privately-held retailer of fishing, marine, hunting, camping and sports gear. Pursuant to the agreement, Bluegreen has the right to market VOIs at each of Bass Pro&#8217;s retail locations. As of December 31, 2015, Bluegreen marketed VOIs in 67 of Bass Pro&#8217;s stores. These marketing efforts include offers for the sale of discounted vacation packages which require the purchaser to attend a timeshare sales presentation, where permitted by law . Under the agreement, Bluegreen also has the right to market VOIs in Bass Pro&#8217;s catalogs and on its website, and Bluegreen has access to Bass Pro&#8217;s customer lists. In exchange, Bluegreen compensates Bass Pro based on the overall success of these marketing activities. The amount of compensation is dependent on the level of additional marketing efforts required by Bluegreen to convert the prospect into a sale and a defined time frame for such marketing efforts. No compensation is paid to Bass Pro under the marketing agreement on sales made by Bluegreen/Big Cedar Vacations of VOIs owned by Bluegreen/Big Cedar Vacations. In accordance with the agreement, Bluegreen makes an annual prepayment to Big Cedar by February of each year. The prepayment is an advance payment for anticipated commissions estimated to be generated during the upcoming year, as determined by Bluegreen and Big Cedar, not to exceed $5.0 million. No additional commissions are paid to Big Cedar during any year until the annual prepayment for that year has been fully earned. During 2015, sales of VOIs to prospects and leads generated by the marketing arrangement with Bass Pro accounted for approximately 20% of Bluegreen&#8217;s VOI sales volume. Bluegreen&#8217;s marketing agreement with Bass Pro is for a term expiring in January 2025, subject to early termination in whole or in part under certain circumstances. There is no assurance that Bluegreen will be able to maintain, extend or renew its marketing relationship with Bass Pro, including for the duration of the term of the agreement, and Bluegreen&#8217;s sales would be materially and adversely impacted if Bluegreen&#8217;s relationship with Bass Pro ended. 

&#160; 

As previously described, Bluegreen entered into a five-year strategic relationship with Choice Hotels in 2013. This relationship impacts several areas of Bluegreen&#8217;s business and, while there is no assurance as to the success of the relationship, it includes a sales and marketing alliance component which Bluegreen believes will enable Bluegreen to leverage Choice Hotels&#8217; brands, customer relationships and marketing channels to market Bluegreen&#8217;s VOI offerings. Choice Hotels&#8217; obligations under the agreements are subject to Bluegreen making specified payments to Choice Hotels and certain other terms and conditions. 

&#160; 

In 2014, Bluegreen began a limited marketing relationship with Walmart &#174; , a leading global mass retailer with over 5,200 domestic locations, to sell vacation packages in 5 Walmart &#174; locations. This relationship expanded to 25 locations in 2015. Under this relationship, Bluegreen leases space at certain Walmart &#174; locations to sell discount vacation packages which require the purchaser to attend a timeshare sales presentation, where permitted by law . &#160; There is no assurance that this relationship will be successful or that Bluegreen will be able to maintain, or extend its relationship with Walmart &#174; . 

&#160; 

Typically, Bluegreen&#8217;s sales offices are located adjacent to certain of its resorts and are staffed with sales representatives and sales managers, all of whom are Bluegreen employees. Bluegreen sponsors ongoing training for its personnel. 

&#160; 

It is Bluegreen&#8217;s policy to require its sales staff to provide each VOI customer with a written disclosure statement prior to the time the customer signs a purchase agreement. The purpose of this disclosure statement is to provide relevant information regarding VOI ownership at the resort and membership in the Bluegreen Vacation Club. Pursuant to Bluegreen&#8217;s policies, the statement must be signed by every purchaser. Purchasers are entitled to cancel purchase agreements within applicable legal rescission periods. Substantially all VOI purchasers visit one of Bluegreen&#8217;s sales offices prior to or at the time of purchase. 

&#160; 

Customer Financing 

&#160; 

Bluegreen generally offers financing of up to 90% of the purchase price of its VOIs to its VOI customers who meet certain FICO &#174; score-based underwriting standards. The typical financing extended by Bluegreen on a VOI during 2015 provided for a term of 10 years and a fixed interest rate. However, Bluegreen also encourages purchasers to finance their purchase with a loan having a shorter term by offering a lower interest rate on those loans. In connection with Bluegreen VOI sales, Bluegreen delivers the property deed to the trustee of the Bluegreen Vacation Club on behalf of the purchaser and obtains a mortgage on the purchaser&#8217;s VOI. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Purchasers of VOIs are generally required to make a down payment of at least 10% of the VOI sales price. As part of Bluegreen&#8217;s continued efforts to improve its operating cash flows, Bluegreen incentivizes its sales associates to encourage cash sales, and Bluegreen promotes a point-of-sale credit card program sponsored by a third party financial institution. As a result, Bluegreen has increased both the percentage of its sales that are 100% cash and its average down payment on financed sales. Including down payments received on financed sales, approximately 46% of Bluegreen VOI sales during 2015 were paid in cash within approximately 30 days from the contract date. 

&#160; 

See &#8220;Products and Services &#8212; Vacation Ownership&#8221; above for more information about the demographic profile of Bluegreen&#8217;s typical customer. See &#8220;Sales of Receivables/Pledging of Receivables&#8221; below for information regarding Bluegreen&#8217;s receivable financing activities. 

&#160; 

Loan Underwriting 

&#160; 

Prior to December 15, 2008, Bluegreen&#8217;s VOI financing was not subject to any significant loan underwriting criteria and no FICO &#174; score was obtained prior to extending credit. Instead, customer financing on sales of VOIs typically only required the following: (i) receipt of a minimum down payment of 10% of the purchase price; (ii) a note and mortgage (or deed of trust); and (iii) other closing documents by the purchaser and Bluegreen. 

&#160; 

Effective December 15, 2008, Bluegreen implemented a FICO &#174; score-based credit underwriting program. Following implementation, Bluegreen no longer provided financing to customers with FICO &#174; scores below 500, and new customers with FICO &#174; scores between 500 and 599 were required to make a minimum cash down payment of 20%. Effective January 1, 2010, Bluegreen further increased its FICO&#174; score-based credit underwriting standards such that Bluegreen no longer originates financing to customers with FICO &#174; scores below 575. Bluegreen may, from time to time, offer certain introductory products to customers with different FICO &#174; scores, finance and down payment terms that it intends to hold in its portfolio. Additionally, Bluegreen may provide financing to customers with no FICO &#174; scores if the customer makes a minimum required down payment. For loans with an outstanding balance as of December 31, 2015 that were originated from December 15, 2008 through December 31, 2009, the borrowers&#8217; weighted average FICO &#174; score at the point of sale was 701. For loans with an outstanding balance as of December 31, 2015 that were originated from January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2015, the borrowers&#8217; weighted average FICO &#174; score at the point of sale was 706. Further information on VOI notes receivable held by Bluegreen is set forth in the following table:

Bluegreen encourages purchasers to make higher down payments and accept shorter loan period terms by offering lower interest rates. In addition, where permitted under applicable laws, rules and regulations, buyers receive a 1% discount in the interest rate by participating in Bluegreen&#8217;s pre-authorized payment plan. As of December 31, 2015, borrowers with respect to approximately 93% of Bluegreen&#8217;s serviced VOI notes receivable participated in Bluegreen&#8217;s pre-authorized payment plan. 

&#160;

Effective November 1, 2008, Bluegreen increased the interest rates charged on new loans. The weighted-average interest rate on Bluegreen&#8217;s VOI notes receivable was as follows:

Collection Policies 

&#160; 

Financed sales of VOIs originated by Bluegreen typically utilize a note and mortgage. Collection efforts related to the timeshare loans are managed by Bluegreen and are handled by a staff of experienced collectors, assisted by a mortgage collection computer system. Bluegreen&#8217;s collectors are incentivized through a performance-based compensation program. Technological capabilities include, but are not limited to, automated lock box and clearing house processing. 

&#160; 

Bluegreen generally makes collection efforts to customers by mail and by telephone. Telephone contact generally commences when an account is as few as 10 days past due. At 30 days past due, a collection letter is sent to U.S. residents advising the customer that if the loan is not brought current, the delinquency will be reported to the credit reporting agencies. At 60 days delinquent, Bluegreen sends a lockout letter to the customer by mail advising that they cannot make any future reservations for lodging at a resort. If the delinquency continues, at 90 days past due, Bluegreen stops the accrual of, and reverses previously accrued but unpaid, interest on the note receivable and mails a &#8220;Notice of Intent to Cancel Membership,&#8221; which informs the customer that unless the delinquency is cured within 30 days, Bluegreen will terminate the customer&#8217;s VOI ownership. If the customer fails to respond to such correspondence within the given timeframe, the loan will be defaulted and the customer&#8217;s VOI terminated. In that case, Bluegreen sends a final letter, typically at approximately 120 days delinquent, to notify the customer of the loan default and the termination of the customer&#8217;s beneficial interest in the VOI property. Thereafter, Bluegreen seeks to resell the VOI to a new purchaser. Historically, Bluegreen has typically not sought to collect a deficiency on defaulted notes. 

&#160; 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

&#160; 

Under timeshare accounting rules, Bluegreen estimates uncollectibles based on historical uncollectibles for similar VOI notes receivable and does not consider the value of the underlying collateral. Bluegreen holds large amounts of homogeneous VOI notes receivable and assesses uncollectibility based on pools of receivables. In estimating future credit losses, Bluegreen does not use a single primary indicator of credit quality but instead evaluates its VOI notes based upon a combination of factors, including a static pool analysis, the aging of the respective receivables, current default trends and prepayment rates by origination year, as well as the FICO &#174; scores of the borrowers. 

&#160; 

Substantially all defaulted VOI notes receivable result in the holder of the note receivable acquiring the related VOI that secured the note receivable, typically soon after default and at little or no cost. The reacquired VOI is then available for resale in the normal course of business. 

&#160; 

See &#8220;Item 5 &#8211; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; for additional information about the performance of Bluegreen&#8217;s notes receivable portfolio. 

&#160; 

Sales of Receivables/Pledging of Receivables 

&#160; 

Bluegreen&#8217;s ability to sell or borrow against its VOI notes receivable has historically been a critical factor in Bluegreen meeting its liquidity requirements. The vacation ownership business generally involves making sales of a vacation product where a buyer is only required to pay a minimum of 10% to 20% of the purchase price up front, while at the same time selling and marketing expenses are primarily cash expenses exceeding the down payment amount. For the year ended December 31, 2015, Bluegreen&#8217;s sales and marketing expenses were approximately 51% of its system-wide sales. Accordingly, having facilities for the sale or hypothecation of these VOI notes receivables, along with periodic term securitization transactions, has been a critical factor for Bluegreen in meeting its short- and long-term cash needs. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Bluegreen&#8217;s VOI receivables purchase facilities and term securitizations typically utilize an owner&#8217;s trust structure whereby Bluegreen sells receivables to a wholly-owned, special purpose finance entity which then sells the receivables to an owner&#8217;s trust, typically without recourse to Bluegreen or its subsidiaries, except for breaches of certain representations and warranties at the time of sale. While in limited instances Bluegreen has entered into guarantees in connection with its vacation ownership receivables purchase facilities or term securitizations, historically, Bluegreen has typically not entered into such guarantees. These facilities usually have detailed requirements with respect to the eligibility of receivables for purchase, and fundings under these facilities are typically subject to certain conditions precedent. Under such purchase facilities, a variable purchase price of a portion of the principal balance of the receivables sold, subject to certain terms and conditions, is paid at closing in cash. The balance of the purchase price is deferred until such time as the purchaser of the VOI receivables has received a specified return and all servicing, custodial, agent and similar fees and expenses have been paid and, if applicable, a specified overcollateralization ratio is achieved and a cash reserve account is fully funded. Bluegreen&#8217;s VOI receivables purchase facilities typically include various conditions to purchase, covenants, triggering events and other provisions Bluegreen believes to be customary for these types of transactions. Bluegreen has historically acted as servicer of, and in such capacity received a fee for servicing, the VOI receivables Bluegreen has sold under these purchase facilities. See &#8220;Item 5 &#8211; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; for additional information about Bluegreen&#8217;s VOI receivables purchase facilities and term securitizations. 

&#160; 

Receivables Servicing 

&#160; 

Receivables servicing includes collecting payments from borrowers and remitting the funds to the owners, lenders or investors in such receivables, accounting for principal and interest on such receivables, making advances when required, contacting delinquent borrowers, terminating a membership in the Bluegreen Vacation Club in the event that defaults are not timely remedied, and performing other administrative duties. 

&#160; 

Bluegreen receives mortgage servicing fees for servicing its securitized notes receivable which are included as a component of interest income. Additionally, Bluegreen earns servicing fee income from third-party developers in connection with Bluegreen&#8217;s servicing of their loan portfolios under certain of Bluegreen&#8217;s fee-based services arrangements. 

&#160; 

Market and Industry Data 

&#160; 

Market and industry data pertaining to Bluegreen and its business contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K were obtained from Bluegreen&#8217;s internal surveys, industry publications, unpublished industry data and estimates, discussions with industry sources and other currently available information. The sources for this data include, without limitation, the American Resort Development Association. Industry publications generally state that the information contained therein has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but there can be no assurance as to the accuracy and completeness of such information. Bluegreen has not independently verified such market data. Similarly, Bluegreen&#8217;s internal surveys, while believed to be reliable, have not been verified by any independent sources. Accordingly, such data may not prove to be accurate. 

&#160; 

BBX Capital Segment 

&#160; 

The BBX Capital segment consists of BBX Capital&#8217;s monetization and management of legacy assets (the assets retained by BBX Capital following the sale of BankAtlantic) and BBX Capital&#8217;s investments in real estate and real estate development and in operating businesses. Legacy assets include loans, real estate and investments in unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. The BBX Capital segment also includes its investment in Woodbridge. In April 2013 BBX Capital acquired a 46% equity interest in Woodbridge. Woodbridge&#8217;s principal asset is its ownership of Bluegreen and its subsidiaries. Bluegreen is a vacation ownership company with over 190,000 owners and over 60 owned or managed resorts. BFC owns the remaining 54% of Woodbridge. 

&#160; 

BBX Capital&#8217;s Business Strategy 

&#160; 

Since the sale of BankAtlantic in July 2012, BBX Capital has been repositioning its business, monetizing its legacy portfolios of loans and real estate, and pursuing its goal of transitioning into a growth business by focusing on real estate opportunities and acquiring operating businesses. 

&#160; 

The majority of BBX Capital&#8217;s assets do not generate income on a regular or predictable basis. Recognizing the nature of its assets, BBX Capital&#8217;s goal is to build long-term value. BBX Capital does not expect to generate significant revenue from the legacy BankAtlantic assets until the assets are monetized through repayments or transactions involving the sale, joint venture or development of the underlying real estate. BBX Capital is currently utilizing the 

&#160;

cash flow from the monetization of its assets and dividends from Woodbridge to pay operating expenses and to invest in income producing real estate, real estate developments, real estate joint ventures and operating businesses. BBX Capital is seeking to manage its cash needs and the timing of monetizing its existing assets with new investments to maximize its returns. In some cases, this may involve immediate sale and in other cases a longer term hold or development (either directly or through a joint venture). BBX Capital may also consider transactions involving its investments in operating businesses, including Renin and Sweet Holdings, and BBX Capital may in connection with its investment with BFC in Woodbridge pursue transactions involving Bluegreen, either directly or indirectly through a transaction involving Woodbridge, to monetize all or a portion of its investment in Woodbridge. Such transactions may include pursuing a future sale or spin-off of a company or transactions involving other public or private issuances of a company&#8217;s debt or equity securities which might result in the ownership of less than 100% of the company. BBX Capital is also engaged in land entitlement activities on certain properties that BBX Capital acquired through foreclosure and anticipates moving forward with land development projects which may include selling or leasing the improved properties to third parties or pursuing joint ventures with developers for the development of residential and commercial real estate projects involving the contribution of these properties by us all as potential cash investments in such projects. BBX Capital is also pursuing potential investments in joint venture real estate projects that include real estate held by a joint venture partner or to be acquired from unrelated parties. As a result of the substantial decline in real estate values during the recession, the majority of BBX Capital&#8217;s non-performing commercial real estate loans and foreclosed real estate were written down in prior periods to the then prevailing estimated fair values of the collateral less costs to sell. BBX Capital believes there has been continued improvements generally in real estate markets and believes that the prior estimated fair values of the underlying collateral securing certain of its commercial real estate loans and its real estate carrying values may be below current market values. Additionally, this recovery in the real estate market has favorably affected the financial condition of BBX Capital&#8217;s borrowers and BBX Capital is aggressively pursuing its borrowers and/or guarantors in order to maximize recoveries through cash settlements, loan workout arrangements or participation interests in the development or performance of the collateral. If BBX Capital is successful in its efforts, BBX Capital expects to recognize gains to the extent that the amounts it collects exceed the carrying value of its commercial loans and foreclosed real estate and expect these gains to be reflected in an increase in BBX Capital&#8217;s shareholders&#8217; equity in the long term. Due to the nature of these activities however, BBX Capital does not expect to generate revenues or earnings on a predictable or consistent basis. Accordingly, BBX Capital expects its results of operations to vary significantly on a quarterly basis and BBX Capital may experience losses in subsequent periods. 

&#160; 

Legacy Assets 

&#160; 

Loans 

&#160; 

On July 31, 2012, BBX Capital completed the sale of BankAtlantic to BB&#38;T. Prior to the closing of the BB&#38;T Transaction, BankAtlantic formed two wholly-owned subsidiaries, BBX Capital Asset Management, LLC (&#8220;CAM&#8221;) and Florida Asset Resolution Group, LLC (&#8220;FAR&#8221;). &#160; BBX Capital retained through CAM, BBX Partners and FAR certain loans, tax certificates and foreclosed real estate and liabilities related to these retained assets which had been held by BankAtlantic. These retained loans were grouped in five loan segments as follows: residential loans, commercial real estate loans, consumer loans, small business loans and commercial non-mortgage loans. CAM holds loans from the commercial real estate and the commercial non-mortgage loan segments. BBX Partners holds loans from the commercial real estate segment and FAR holds loans from all five segments. 

&#160; 

Residential - The majority of BBX Capital&#8217;s residential loans were originally acquired in the secondary markets and were originated by financial institutions. These loans, which are serviced by independent servicers, are secured by properties located throughout the United States. Residential loans were typically purchased in bulk and were generally non-conforming loans under agency guidelines due primarily to the size of the individual loans (&#8220;jumbo loans&#8221;). A portfolio of residential loans which were made primarily to &#8220;low to moderate income&#8221; borrowers in accordance with the Community Reinvestment Act were also retained but were sold during the year ended December 31, 2014. BBX Capital&#8217;s residential loans serviced by independent servicers were classified as loans held-for-sale as of December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

Commercial Real Estate - Commercial real estate loans were originated in connection with the borrowers&#8217; acquisition, development and construction of various types of properties including office buildings, retail shopping centers, residential construction and other non-residential properties. Commercial real estate loans were also originated in connection with borrowers&#8217; acquisition or refinance of existing income-producing properties. These loans were primarily secured by property located in Florida. 

&#160; 

Commercial non-mortgage loans - These loans are generally business loans secured by the receivables, inventory, equipment, and/or general corporate assets of the borrowers. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Consumer - Consumer loans consist primarily of loans to individuals originated through BankAtlantic&#8217;s retail network. The majority of consumer loans are home equity lines of credit secured by a first or second mortgage on the primary residence of the borrower, substantially all of which are located in Florida. 

&#160; 

Small Business - BankAtlantic originated small business loans to companies located primarily in markets within BankAtlantic&#8217;s branch network. Small business loans were originated primarily on a secured basis and do not generally exceed $2.0 million individually. These loans were originated with maturities ranging generally from one to three years or due upon demand. Lines of credit extended to small businesses are due upon demand. Small business loans have either fixed or variable prime-based interest rates.

&#160; 

Real estate held-for-investment - Real estate is classified as held-for-investment when the property is not available for immediate sale due to anticipated renovations and potential improvements in operating performance before sale, management pursuing joint venture opportunities, potential development, or management&#8217;s decision to retain the property in anticipation of appreciation in market value in subsequent periods.

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

Management believes that its relations with its employees are satisfactory. BFC currently maintains employee benefit programs that are considered by management to be generally competitive with programs provided by other major employers in its markets. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, BFC and its subsidiaries had approximately 6,108 employees, with 28 employees at BFC and its wholly owned subsidiaries; 651 employees at BBX Capital and its subsidiaries ; and 5,429 employees at Bluegreen, of which 521 employees were located at Bluegreen&#8217;s headquarters in Boca Raton, Florida, and 4,908 employees were located in regional field offices throughout the United States and Aruba. &#160; 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Bluegreen 

&#160; 

Bluegreen competes with various high profile and well-established operators, many of which have greater liquidity and financial resources than Bluegreen does. Many of the world&#8217;s most recognized lodging, hospitality and entertainment companies develop and sell VOIs in resort properties. Major companies that now operate or are developing or planning to develop vacation ownership resorts directly or through subsidiaries include Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation, the Walt Disney Company, Hilton Hotels Corporation, Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, Inc., Wyndham Worldwide Corporation and Diamond Resorts International. Bluegreen also competes with numerous other smaller owners and operators of vacation ownership resorts. In Bluegreen&#8217;s fee-based services business, Bluegreen typically competes with Hilton Hotels Corporation and Wyndham Worldwide Corporation. In addition to competing for sales leads, prospects and fee-based service clients, Bluegreen competes with other VOI developers for marketing, sales, and resort management personnel. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

BBX Capital 

&#160; 

The industries in which BBX Capital conducts business are very competitive and it faces substantial competition from real estate developers and building construction companies from private equity funds and hedge funds. BBX Capital competes with institutions and entities that are larger and have greater resources than the resources available to BBX Capital. F our companies in the candy and confections industry currently account for approximately 71% of the industry&#8217;s revenues reflecting significant consolidation in the industry in which Sweet Holdings operates . Renin operations include the manufacturing of wall d&#233;cor, hardware, and fabricated glass. Renin&#8217;s products are sold mainly to large retailers as well as to housing and building construction companies. The industry in which Renin operates experiences intense competition from foreign importers and producers. 

&#160; 

Regulation 

&#160; 

BFC and BBX Capital 

&#160; 

As public companies, BFC and BBX Capital are subject to federal securities laws, including The Exchange Act. In addition, the companies in which BFC and BBX Capital hold investments are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations generally applicable to all of their businesses. 

&#160; 

Bluegreen 

&#160; 

The vacation ownership and real estate industries are subject to extensive and complex governmental regulation. Bluegreen is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental, zoning, consumer protection and other laws, rules and regulations regarding the acquisition, marketing, and sale of real estate and VOIs and various aspects of Bluegreen&#8217;s financing operations. On a federal level, the Federal Trade Commission has taken an active regulatory role through the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or unfair competition in interstate commerce. In addition, many states have what are known as &#8220;Little FTC Acts&#8221; that apply to intrastate activity. In addition to the laws applicable to Bluegreen&#8217;s customer financing and other operations discussed below, Bluegreen is or may be subject to the Fair Housing Act and various other federal laws, rules and regulations. Bluegreen is also subject to various foreign laws with respect to La Cabana Beach and Racquet Club in Oranjestad, Aruba and Blue Water Resort in Nassau, Bahamas as well as with respect to certain marketing efforts and operations in Canada. In addition, in the future, VOIs may be deemed to be securities subject to regulation as such, which could have a material adverse effect on Bluegreen. The cost of complying with applicable laws and regulations may be significant and Bluegreen may not maintain compliance at all times with all applicable laws, including those discussed below. Any failure to comply with current or future applicable laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on Bluegreen. 

&#160; 

Bluegreen&#8217;s vacation ownership resorts are subject to various regulatory requirements, including state and local approvals. The laws of most states require Bluegreen to file a detailed offering statement describing Bluegreen&#8217;s business and all material aspects of the project and sale of VOIs with a designated state authority. In addition, when required by state law, Bluegreen provides its VOI purchasers with a public disclosure statement that contains, among other items, detailed information about the resort, the surrounding vicinity, and the purchaser&#8217;s rights and obligations as a VOI owner. Laws in each state where Bluegreen sells VOIs generally grant the purchaser of a VOI the right to cancel a purchase contract at any time within a specified rescission period following the earlier of the date the contract was signed or the date the purchaser has received the last of the documents required to be provided by Bluegreen. Most states have other laws that regulate Bluegreen&#8217;s activities, including real estate licensure requirements; sellers of travel licensure requirements; anti-fraud laws; telemarketing laws; prize, gift and sweepstakes laws; and labor laws. 

&#160; 

Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, the owner of real property generally is liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances located on or in, or emanating from, the property, as well as related costs of investigation and property damage. These laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner knew of the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. The presence of these substances, or the failure to properly remediate these substances if they exist, may adversely affect the owner&#8217;s ability to sell or lease a property or to borrow using the real property as collateral. Other federal and state laws require the removal or encapsulation of asbestos-containing material when this material is in poor condition or in the event of construction, demolition, remodeling or renovation. Other statutes may require the removal of underground storage tanks. Noncompliance with these and other environmental, health or safety requirements may result in the need to cease or alter operations or development at a property. In addition, certain state and local laws may impose liability on property developers with respect to construction defects discovered on the property or repairs made by future owners of such property. Under these laws, Bluegreen may be required to pay for repairs to the developed property. The 

&#160;

development, management and operation of Bluegreen&#8217;s resorts are also subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act. 

&#160; 

Bluegreen&#8217;s marketing, sales and customer financing activities are also subject to extensive regulation, which can include, but is not limited to: the Truth-in-Lending Act and Regulation Z; the Fair Housing Act; the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act; the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B; the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E; the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and Regulation C; the Dodd&#8211;Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices and Regulation AA; the Patriot Act; the Right to Financial Privacy Act; the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act; the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act; and anti-money laundering laws. The Dodd-Frank Act contains significant changes to the regulation of financial institutions, and related entities, including the creation of new federal regulatory agencies, and the granting of additional authorities and responsibilities to existing regulatory agencies to identify and address emerging systemic risks posed by the activities of financial services firms. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;) is one such regulatory agency created pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act. The CFPB&#8217;s mandate is to protect consumers by carrying out federal consumer financial laws and to publish rules and forms that facilitate understanding of the financial implications of the transactions consumers enter into. Consistent with this mission, the CFPB amended Regulations X and Z to establish new disclosure requirements and forms in Regulation Z for most closed-end consumer credit transactions secured by real property. The practical impact upon Bluegreen was the requirement to use a new Integrated Mortgage Disclosure Statement in lieu of the separate Good Faith Estimate and Closing Statement. While this rule has been complied with by Bluegreen, the rule-making process under the Dodd-Frank Act is still underway, and no assurance can be given that Bluegreen&#8217; will comply with this act or other applicable laws or that compliance with this rule or the promulgation of additional new standards by the CFPB will not have an adverse impact on Bluegreen. In addition, Bluegreen&#8217;s term securitization transactions must comply with certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act, including the risk retention rules. 

&#160;

Bluegreen's management of, and dealings with, POAs, including Bluegreen's purchase of defaulted inventory from POAs in connection with its secondary market arrangements, is also subject to state laws and resort rules and regulations, including those with respect to the establishment of budgets and expenditures, rule-making, and the imposition of maintenance assessments.

During the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 8% of Bluegreen&#8217;s VOI sales were generated by marketing to prospective purchasers obtained through internal and third-party vendors&#8217; outbound telemarketing efforts. Bluegreen attempts to monitor the actions and compliance of these third parties, but there are risks associated with Bluegreen&#8217;s and such third parties&#8217; telemarketing efforts. In recent years, state regulators have increased regulations and enforcement actions related to telemarketing operations, including requiring the adherence to state &#8220;do not call&#8221; laws. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission and Federal Communications Commission have implemented national &#8220;do not call&#8221; legislation. These measures have significantly increased the costs associated with telemarketing. While Bluegreen continues to be subject to telemarketing risks and potential liability, Bluegreen believes that its exposure to adverse impacts from this heightened telemarketing legislation and enforcement may be mitigated to some extent by the use of &#8220;permission marketing,&#8221; whereby Bluegreen obtains the permission of prospective purchasers to contact them in the future, thereby exempting such calls from the various &#8220;do not call&#8221; laws. Bluegreen has also implemented policies and procedures which Bluegreen believes will help reduce the possibility that individuals who have requested to be placed on its internal company do not call list are not contacted, but such policies and procedures may not be effective in ensuring strict regulatory compliance. 

&#160; 

To date, no material fines or penalties have been imposed on Bluegreen as a result of its telemarketing operations. However, from time to time, Bluegreen has been the subject of proceedings for violation of the &#8220;do not call&#8221; laws and for violation of state laws applicable to the marketing and sale of VOIs. Bluegreen may not be able to efficiently or effectively market to prospective purchasers through telemarketing operations in the future or successfully develop alternative sources of identifying and marketing to prospective purchasers of Bluegreen&#8217;s VOI products at acceptable costs. In addition, Bluegreen may face significant non-compliance issues or additional costs of compliance, which may adversely impact Bluegreen&#8217;s results and operations in the future.
