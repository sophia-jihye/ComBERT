 Item 1. Business 

Overview 

We are defining a new category of enterprise software we call Software Analytics. Our cloud-based platform and suite of products, which we call the New Relic Software Analytics Cloud, enables organizations to collect, store, and analyze massive amounts of software data in real time so they can better understand their application performance, improve customer experience, and achieve business success. We design all our products to be highly intuitive and frictionless; they are easy to deploy, and customers can rapidly, often within minutes, realize benefits and results. Software developers can build better applications faster, as they can see how their software will perform and is actually performing for end-users. IT operations teams can use our products to quickly find and fix performance problems as well as prevent future issues. Business users such as product managers can get answers to how their new product launch is being received, or how a pricing change impacted customer retention, without waiting for help from IT. For each of these audiences &#151; software developers, IT operations, and business users&#151;we aim to be the first, best place to look to understand their digital business. As of March 31, 2016, we had 13,518 paid business accounts, 5,887 paid business accounts with annual recurring revenue over $5,000, and annualized revenue per average paid business account of $15,761. A single customer may have multiple paid business accounts for separate divisions, segments, or subsidiaries. 

Software has become increasingly critical to businesses and consumers worldwide, from online retailing to social networking to customer relationship management. This software is found in applications and throughout the architectures on which those applications run: servers, websites, operating systems, mobile devices, and other IT assets. The use of this software generates huge volumes of data about how it is performing, the end-user experience, and the transactions flowing through it. Historically, organizations collected and analyzed only a small fraction of this data due to technology and business constraints, including high costs and limited benefits, except for specific use cases such as application performance management, clickstream analysis, and web traffic measurement. Legacy software products were typically customized, expensive, required training, and thus limited to business-critical applications within large organizations. As a result, the vast majority of software data has been underutilized. 

Several fundamental technology and business trends are enabling Software Analytics today. As software has become increasingly critical, it contains more of the data that organizations need to make key decisions. As cloud computing and software-as-a-service, or SaaS, replace on-premise architectures, more data is being generated and analyzed. Software developers are rapidly increasing in stature and influence within organizations, and able to shape IT trends such as cloud adoption. New technologies have been developed to enable greater storage and faster analysis of massive quantities of data with greater speed and flexibility. 

In light of these trends, we saw the opportunity for Software Analytics to empower technology and business users to make use of this underutilized software data. We provide customers with our software code, called agents, to add to their applications and infrastructure quickly and easily. These intelligent agents enable our users to identify vast amounts of data they would like to have sent to our cloud-based, big data database. Our database stores and organizes the data that we receive from our users for analysis through a simple dashboard interface that users can easily configure to monitor their key metrics and quickly make queries using simple phrases. Our intuitive and frictionless product design results in users being able to quickly receive analysis of their data. With this visibility, developers and operations teams can significantly improve the quality of their digital initiatives, and business and technology users can get real-time insights about their business. 

Our New Relic Software Analytics Cloud is made up of an integrated suite of products, a big data database, and an open platform. All of our products have a simple user interface, and require minimal training or integration. Our products for technology users focus on software performance management and monitoring and 

&#160;

include New Relic APM (Application Performance Management), New Relic Mobile, New Relic Servers, New Relic Browser, and New Relic Synthetics. Built into the core of our technology platform, New Relic Insights provides big data analytics to both business and technology users that enable them to easily extract actionable information from the massive quantities of data flowing through their software. In addition to these products, we offer key platform capabilities in the form of New Relic Alerts and New Relic Plugins. New Relic Alerts offers policy management that delivers alerts across our entire suite of products. New Relic Plugins offers a plugin architecture including application programming interfaces, or APIs, and software development kits, or SDKs, for customers and partners to embed and extend our solution into their products. Today, there are hundreds of plugins to extend our functionality to other applications and infrastructures including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, MongoDB, and Oracle mySQL. 

Our go-to-market strategy centers on creating a frictionless experience for our customers, enabling them to quickly see results and share their insights broadly across their company. We combine grassroots user adoption with both low-touch and high-touch sales approaches. Our products are easy to download and use, which allowed us to build a large base of users and smaller organizations before we even began to grow and develop our enterprise sales organization. Over time, users within larger organizations began to grow our footprint within their companies, as they often purchase our products for a specific use case and subsequently expand their use of our products. This has led many of our top customers to develop into accounts with hundreds of users across multiple roles, each accessing a common set of data through the New Relic Software Analytics Cloud to answer questions about their digital business. We continue to build our direct enterprise sales and support operation in order to better market to and support larger organizations, which represent a growing portion of our revenue. 

We have achieved rapid customer adoption, high customer retention, and significant growth since our founding. For our fiscal years ended March 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, our revenue was $181.3 million, $110.4 million, and $63.2 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 64% from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, and 75% from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014 to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. We had net losses of $67.5 million, $50.1 million, and $40.2 million for our fiscal years ended March 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Collect. Our intelligent agents are software code that developers and operations teams easily deploy into their applications and related IT infrastructure, including physical and virtual servers, browsers, and mobile devices. These agents configure automatically to their particular IT environment and collect and send event and performance data that is defined by the customer securely to our proprietary cloud database. The agents typically send this information once a minute, and are designed to cause minimal latency on the application. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Store. Data received from the agents deployed by our customers is stored in our highly secure and scalable cloud-based, big data database. Our database has been crafted so that our customers do not need to build or maintain their own big data solution for Software Analytics. We optimized this database to store data as well as handle the analytics and queries that we believe are important to drive decision making. Customers can easily define which data they want to collect and store for analysis. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Analyze. Our simple and intuitive user interface consists of a dashboard of graphical charts for key performance indicators, which are easily configurable and enable deep drill-down and root cause analysis. Our New Relic Insights product includes two ways for technical and non-technical users to drill down into their data, diagnose problems, and make more informed decisions. New Relic Insights offers a visual Data Explorer that enables a user to understand data attributes, and drill down on graphs and attributes utilizing an intuitive point-and-click interface. New Relic Insights also offers a field for queries utilizing the New Relic Query Language, or NRQL, similar to the commonly used Structured Query Language, or SQL. Users can type a simple query into the NRQL field and receive the answer in a range of visual and graphical formats. We also provide a feature within New Relic Insights called Data Apps that enables users to create and publish a set of customer-curated dashboards, along with an optional search field, for use by non-technical business users. Key Elements of Our Solution 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; SaaS-Based Delivery Model. We designed our products based on cloud architecture and a SaaS delivery model. We are able to provide frequent updates to our software enabling us to continuously improve it to reflect technology developments. This delivers a wide range of technology and financial benefits over on-premise architectures, including potential faster time to market, accelerated return on investment, and lower total cost of ownership. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Scalable, Flexible Cloud Architecture. Our customers can collectively analyze billions of data points every second. Because we built our technology with a multi-tenant cloud architecture, customers can leverage its scale to rapidly run queries and get answers&#151;without having to build their own expensive infrastructure. &#160;

They are able to access, interact, and analyze various dimensions of massive amounts of application, customer experience, and business data to drive business outcomes when traditional on-premise solutions have struggled to keep up with the scale and variety of data. Business users are also able to easily configure their graphical dashboards of key performance indicators, or quickly make queries, without needing to wait for a data scientist to design a new report or program a new query. Limitations of Existing Solutions 

A number of legacy and emerging companies provide products to collect and analyze software data for business and technology managers. However, these suffer from a range of limitations including: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Difficult and Time-Consuming. Existing solutions typically require developers and technology and business users to undergo upfront and ongoing user training to learn. The solutions are often customized and provisioned over the course of several months through the central IT function. Any changes to the collection, storage, or analyses of data needs to go through the IT group or specialized data scientists. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; High Total Cost of Ownership. The majority of existing products has been deployed on-premise, requiring substantial upfront investments in IT infrastructure and extensive implementation, customization, maintenance, and training costs. Organizations often choose not to deploy these products, or postpone implementations of upgraded versions, due to concerns relating to the substantial costs involved. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; On-Premise Architectures. Solutions built for legacy, on-premise architectures are highly customized, expensive to purchase and operate, and require frequent upgrades and maintenance. In addition, they are fundamentally unable to adapt to cloud architectures and SaaS models. They typically rely on systems to collect, store, and analyze data which are highly specific to the particular customer&#146;s software applications and environment at a point in time. For example, the agents for collecting data need to be highly customized and typically involve significant latency to send data. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Support Limited to Legacy Software. Developers using new languages and frameworks to build modern software need solutions that understand them. Most legacy solutions were built to understand COBOL, C++, Java, and .NET. However, modern languages and frameworks such as Ruby, PHP, Python, and Node.js represent a large and growing proportion of applications and websites. Companies of all sizes, from start-ups to the largest enterprises, require an APM solution that can monitor both legacy and modern applications. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Lack of Support for Mobile Devices and Applications. Legacy solutions were typically designed for business or technology users sitting at their desktop. Today&#146;s users increasingly expect and need to be able to do their jobs outside their office, wherever and whenever they want, on a variety of mobile devices. In addition, both legacy applications running on mobile devices and native mobile applications involved different architectures and are very difficult to be managed by systems designed to work on-premise. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Lack of Big Data and Analytics. Existing solutions typically use structured transactional data, representing a small and shrinking portion of software data. This significantly limited the types, timeliness, and flexibility of analyses they could support. Big data analytics are typically cost prohibitive for all but the largest organizations. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Fragmented Point Solutions. Existing solutions were built for a wide range of specific use cases which had to be business or technology critical, such as traditional application performance management, CRM or ERP analytics, or clickstream analysis. These products addressed limited use cases and were not integrated with other applications, forcing businesses to select and integrate solutions from a variety of vendors, resulting in siloed analytics. &#160;

For example, while our focus is on supporting modern programming languages and frameworks with our agents, some customers and developers have built plugins to address custom or legacy on-premise applications and architectures. In addition, plugins can also extend the functionality and data from other applications and sources into our databases. The New Relic Plugin Central offers hundreds of easily downloadable plugins to users. Other elements include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Extensibility . We provide APIs and SDKs to allow developers to easily and quickly integrate and embed the functionality of our products and data with other applications and data sources. We also offer a click and drag dashboard creation tool that allows users to customize their user experience. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Plugins . Plugins have been built to monitor IT architecture elements including databases, networks, queuing systems, and communication tools, enabling customers to monitor their entire application stack. In general, data from sources other than our agents is presented in the same dashboard alongside the monitoring data from our agents. Many plugins are built and used within the workday. Plugins can be kept proprietary or shared with the broader public community. Employees 

As of March 31, 2016, we had 936 employees, including temporary employees. We also engage consultants. None of our employees is covered by collective bargaining agreements and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. 

Operations 

We host our applications and serve all our customers from a data center located in Chicago, Illinois and, to a lesser extent, a combination of cloud hosting providers. We utilize third parties to manage our infrastructure at our Chicago data center. We maintain a formal and comprehensive security program designed to ensure the security and integrity of our data, protect against security threats or data breaches, and prevent unauthorized access to the data of our customers. Our technology uses multi-tenant architecture, enabling all our customers to share the same version of our products and platform capabilities while securely partitioning their data. 

Research and Development 

Our research and development organization is responsible for the design, development, and testing of all aspects of the New Relic Software Analytics Cloud suite of products and platform capabilities. We invest heavily in these efforts to continuously improve, innovate, and add new features to our solutions. 

We deploy new features, functionality, and technologies through daily and weekly software releases or updates in order to minimize disruption and provide for constant improvement. Our product managers regularly engage with customers, partners, and industry analysts, as well as other stakeholders, in functions such as sales, customer success, marketing, and business development to understand customer needs as well as general trends in our industry. Once product improvements are identified, the development organization works closely together to design, develop, test, and launch a solution. 

The majority of our research and development team is based in our Portland, Oregon office, as well as our San Francisco, California office. To foster rapid innovation, our team is further apportioned into smaller, agile development teams. 

As of March 31, 2016, we had 247 employees in our research and development organization. Our research and development expenses were $46.4 million, $24.0 million, and $16.5 million for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. 

Sales and Marketing 

Our sales and marketing organizations work together closely to drive market awareness, create and manage user and customer leads, provide qualified leads to our sales pipeline, and build customer relationships to drive revenue growth. As of March 31, 2016, we had 422 employees in our sales and marketing organization. 

Sales 

We sell our products to businesses of all sizes largely through our direct sales organization. Our direct sales organization is organized by size of customer and geography and is focused on growing accounts and usage so as to provide our customers with a broader set of our product solutions. 

&#160;

Our sales organization has separate teams focused on smaller companies, mid-market organizations, and large enterprises. Our specific sales strategy is based on the size of account and the target user at an organization&#151;software developers, business or product managers, or IT managers. 

Marketing 

Our marketing strategy targets software developers, IT leaders, and technology executives across many industries and regions. Additionally, our events, demand generation, customer programs, corporate communications, and product marketing teams focus on building brand, engagement, and demand with our target markets. We utilize both online and offline marketing initiatives, including search engine and email marketing, online banner and video advertising, blogs, corporate communications, whitepapers, case studies, user events, and webinars. We believe an effective method to market our suite of products is for users to actively use and explore its capabilities. We encourage free trials of one or more of our products in order to successfully convert those accounts to paid subscriptions. 

Customer Support 

Our products and platform capabilities are designed to minimize the need for customer support, as users can easily download, install, and deploy our software agents without needing support. However, as we increase our customer account base with larger enterprises, these customers typically expect and require more support and accountability. We offer a range of customer support options with multiple levels of support. These include free community support, email support, and phone support, up to our enterprise customer support organization that provides dedicated customer success representatives, onsite support, with global capabilities and is available at all hours of the day. 

Partnerships and Strategic Relationships 

We have built marketing relationships with a number of technology companies to help promote and grow our user base and footprint. We also have developed partnerships with several cloud providers including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Rackspace, and others where we collaborate to ensure our products and platform capabilities work well on applications running on their clouds. These providers offer access to our products and platform capabilities through links on their websites, refer developers and other potential users to us, and expand our marketing reach. We also have a partnership with Salesforce.com where developers using the Salesforce1 development platform can easily deploy our products and platform capabilities into their applications. 

Competition 

We operate in a highly competitive industry that is characterized by constant change and innovation. Changes in the applications and the programing languages used to develop applications, devices, operating systems, and technology landscape result in evolving customer requirements. 

Our competitors fall into four primary categories: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; software performance providers such as AppDynamics, Inc., Dynatrace LLC, and Splunk Inc.; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; diversified technology companies such as Hewlett-Packard Company, International Business Machines Corporation, Microsoft Corporation, and Oracle Corporation; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; large enterprise software and service companies such as BMC Software, Inc., CA, Inc., Riverbed Technology, Inc., and SAP SE; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; companies offering analytics products competing with our New Relic Insights product, including Amazon Web Services, Inc., Google Inc., and Webtrends Inc. &#160;

The principal competitive factors in our market include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; product features, architecture, reliability, security, performance, effectiveness, and supported environments; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; product extensibility and ability to integrate with other technology infrastructures; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; software analytics expertise; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; ease of use of products and platform capabilities; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; total cost of ownership; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; adherence to industry standards and certifications; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; strength of sales and marketing efforts; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; brand awareness and reputation; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; focus on customer success. We believe we generally compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources, greater name recognition, larger sales and marketing budgets, broader distribution, and larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios. 

Intellectual Property 

We rely on federal, state, common law, and international rights, as well as contractual restrictions, to protect our intellectual property. We control access to our proprietary technology and algorithms by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with third parties. 

In addition to these contractual arrangements, we also rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, and domain names to protect our intellectual property. As of March 31, 2016, we had four patent applications pending and two trademark registrations for &#147;New Relic&#148; in the United States, as well as one trademark registration and five trademark applications for &#147;New Relic&#148; outside of the United States. 

Circumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in the United States or other countries in which we operate. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time-consuming. Any unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results. 

Companies in Internet-related industries may own large numbers of patents, copyrights, and trademarks and may frequently request license agreements, threaten litigation, or file suit against us based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We are currently subject to, and expect to face in the future, allegations that we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents, and other intellectual property rights of third parties, including our competitors and non-practicing entities. As we face increasing competition and as our business grows, we will likely face more claims of infringement.
