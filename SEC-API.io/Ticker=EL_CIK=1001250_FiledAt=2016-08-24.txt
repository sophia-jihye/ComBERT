 Item 1. Business. 

&#160; 

The Est&#233;e Lauder Companies Inc., founded in 1946 by Est&#233;e and Joseph Lauder, is one of the world&#146;s leading manufacturers and marketers of quality skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products. Our products are sold in over 150 countries and territories under a number of well-known brand names including: Est&#233;e Lauder, Clinique, Origins, M &#158; A &#158; C, Bobbi Brown, La Mer, Jo Malone London and Aveda. We are also the global licensee for fragrances and/or cosmetics sold under various designer brand names, including Tommy Hilfiger, Donna Karan New York, DKNY, Michael Kors and Tom Ford. Each brand is distinctly positioned within the market for cosmetics and other beauty products.

&#160; 

We are a pioneer in the cosmetics industry and believe we are a leader in the industry due to the global recognition of our brand names, our leadership in product innovation, our strong position in key geographic markets and the consistently high quality of our products and &#147;High-Touch&#148; services. We sell our prestige products principally through limited distribution channels to complement the images associated with our brands. These channels consist primarily of upscale department stores, specialty multi-brand retailers, upscale perfumeries and pharmacies and prestige salons and spas. In addition, our products are sold in freestanding stores, our own and authorized retailer websites, stores in airports and on cruise ships, in-flight, and duty-free shops. We believe that our strategy of pursuing selective distribution strengthens our relationships with retailers, enables our brands to be among the best selling product lines at the stores, and heightens the aspirational quality of our brands.

Our Brands 

&#160; 

Given the personal nature of our products and the wide array of consumer preferences and tastes, as well as competition for the attention of consumers, our strategy has been to market and promote our products through distinctive brands seeking to address broad preferences and tastes. Each brand has a single global image that is promoted with consistent logos, packaging and advertising designed to enhance its image and differentiate it from other brands in the market. Beauty brands are differentiated by numerous factors, including quality, performance, a particular lifestyle, where they are distributed (e.g., prestige, mass) and price point. Below is a chart showing most of the brands that we sell and how we view them based on lifestyle and price point:

&#160; 

Distribution 

&#160; 

We sell our products primarily through limited distribution channels that complement the luxury image and prestige status of our brands. These channels consist primarily of upscale department stores, specialty multi-brand retailers, upscale perfumeries and pharmacies and prestige salons and spas. In addition, our products are sold in freestanding stores that are operated either by us or by authorized third parties, through our own and third-party operated e-commerce websites and websites of our authorized retailers, in various travel retail locations such as stores in airports and on cruise ships, in-flight and duty-free shops, and certain fragrances are sold in self-select outlets. As is customary in the cosmetics industry, our practice is to accept returns of our products from retailers if properly requested and approved. 

&#160; 

As part of our strategy, we have selectively opened new freestanding stores globally that we or authorized third parties operate, with M &#158; A &#158; C, Jo Malone London and Bobbi Brown as the brands leading this expansion, and we are also evaluating opportunities to open additional freestanding stores for certain of our other brands. As of June 30, 2016, we operated approximately 1,260 freestanding stores, and more than 400 freestanding stores are operated around the world by authorized third parties. We expect the number of freestanding stores to increase over the next several years.

&#160; 

We currently sell products from most of our brands directly to consumers online through Company-owned and operated e-commerce and m-commerce sites in approximately 30 countries. While today a majority of our online sales are generated in the United States and the United Kingdom, we have ample opportunity for expansion of online sales growth globally. Additionally, our products are sold through various websites operated by authorized retailers. 

&#160; 

We maintain dedicated sales teams that manage our retail accounts. We have wholly-owned operations in over 50 countries, and two controlling interests that operate in several countries, through which we market, sell and distribute our products. In certain countries, we sell our products through carefully selected distributors that share our commitment to protecting the image and position of our brands. In addition, we sell certain products in select domestic and international U.S. military exchanges. For information regarding our net sales and long-lived assets by geographic region, see &#147;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#150; Note 20 &#150; Segment Data and Related Information .&#148; 

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160; 

Our strategy is to build strong relationships with selected retailers globally, as well as with our consumers directly through freestanding stores and online sales and social media. Senior management works with executives of our major retail accounts on a regular basis, and we believe we are viewed as an important supplier to these customers. Our largest customer, Macy&#146;s Inc., sells products primarily within the United States and accounted for 9% of our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2016 and 10% for fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, and 13% and 12% of our accounts receivable as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

&#160; 

Marketing 

&#160; 

Our strategy to market and promote our products begins with our well-diversified portfolio of more than 25 distinctive brands across four product categories. This portfolio enhances our presence in the multiple geographies and distribution channels where our products are sold and our brands&#146; global reputations benefit us when entering into emerging markets. Our geographic and distribution channel diversity allows us to engage local consumers across an array of developed and emerging markets by emphasizing products and services with the greatest local appeal. This strategy is built around &#147;Bringing the Best to Everyone We Touch.&#148; Our founder, Mrs. Est&#233;e Lauder, formulated this unique marketing philosophy to provide &#147;High-Touch&#148; service and high quality products as the foundation for a solid and loyal consumer base. Our &#147;High-Touch&#148; approach is demonstrated through our integrated consumer engagement models that leverage our product specialists and technology to provide the consumer with a distinct experience that can include personal consultations with beauty advisors, in person or online, who demonstrate and educate the consumer on product usage and application. 

&#160; 

Our marketing strategies vary by brand and local market. Our diverse portfolio of brands employ different engagement models suited to each brand&#146;s equity, distribution, product focus and understanding of the core consumer. This enables us to elevate the consumer experience as we attract new customers, build loyalty, drive consumer advocacy and address the transformation of consumer shopping behaviors. Our marketing planning approach leverages local insights to optimize allocation of resources across different media outlets and retail touch points to resonate with our most discerning consumers most effectively. This includes strategically deploying our brands and tailoring product assortments and communications to fit local tastes and preferences in cities and neighborhoods. Most of our creative marketing work is done by in-house teams that design and produce the sales materials, social media strategies, advertisements and packaging for products in each brand. We build brand equity and drive traffic to retail locations and to our own and authorized retailers&#146; websites through digital and social media, magazines and newspapers, television, billboards in cities and airports, and direct mail and email. In addition, we seek editorial coverage for our brands and products not only in publications and other traditional media, but increasingly in digital and social media, leveraging significant opportunities for amplification. 

&#160; 

- 8 - 

&#160; 

We are increasing our brand awareness and sales by continuing to elevate our digital presence encompassing e-commerce and m-commerce, as well as digital and social media. In order to continue to offer unparalleled service and set the standard for prestige beauty shopping online, we continue to innovate to better meet consumer online shopping preferences (e.g., how-to videos, ratings and reviews and mobile phone and tablet applications), support e-commerce and m-commerce businesses via digital and social marketing activities designed to build brand equity and consumer engagement, and support our authorized retailers to strengthen their e-commerce businesses and drive sales of our brands on their websites. We have opportunities to expand our balanced brand portfolio online around the world, and we are investing in and testing new omnichannel concepts in the United States and other established markets to increase brand loyalty by better serving consumers as they shop across channels. We have dedicated resources to implement creative, coordinated, brand-enhancing strategies across all online activities to increase our direct access to consumers. 

&#160; 

Promotional activities and in-store displays are designed to attract new consumers and introduce existing consumers to other product offerings from the respective brands. Our marketing efforts also benefit from cooperative advertising programs with some retailers, some of which are supported by coordinated promotions, such as sampling programs, including purchase with purchase and gift with purchase, and we continue to believe that the quality and perceived benefits of sample products have been effective inducements to purchases by new and existing consumers. Such activities attract consumers to our counters and websites and keep existing consumers engaged. Our marketing and sales executives spend considerable time in the field meeting with consumers, retailers, beauty consultants and makeup artists at the points of sale to enable us to offer a seamless experience across channels of distribution. 

&#160; 

Information Systems 

&#160; 

Information systems support business processes including product development, marketing, sales, order processing, production, distribution and finance. We continue to maintain and enhance these systems in alignment with our long-term strategy. Certain elements of our information technology infrastructure are managed by third-party providers. We have executed our plans to transform and modernize our global technology infrastructure (&#147;GTI&#148;) to fundamentally change the way we deliver information technology services internally (such initiative, the &#147;GTI Restructuring&#148;). As part of the GTI Restructuring, we transitioned our GTI from Company-owned assets to a primarily vendor-owned, cloud-based model where we pay for services as they are used. This model, with a different third-party provider, is expected to provide an enhanced scalable platform to better support current and future requirements, help us achieve key strategic opportunities and improve our agility and flexibility to respond to the demands of the business by leveraging more advanced technologies. This transition is also expected to result in operational efficiencies and reduce our information technology service and infrastructure costs in the future. During fiscal 2016, we also completed the deployment of our core human resource (&#147;HR&#148;) transformation program globally. This initiative should provide managers with greater visibility into our global workforce and provide managers and employees with better self-service HR capabilities. 

&#160; 

As we continue to strengthen and modernize our key processes, related systems and infrastructure, we continue to make investments to upgrade many of our legacy systems, including retail systems and retail capabilities globally. The retail system upgrades are expected to enhance the effectiveness of store operations, and support our omnichannel objectives. Over the next few years, we will continue to implement upgraded point of sale, retail merchandising, and retail workforce management solutions in certain key markets globally.

&#160; 

Most of our locations are currently enabled with SAP-based technologies (&#147;SAP&#148;). W e continue to develop and invest in new data insight and analytic capabilities to allow us to more effectively utilize the information provided by SAP, as well as strategic sources of both internal and external data. In addition, we are making continuous investments to integrate changes to systems applications with SAP that we expect will bring value creation to the business and increase productivity. In particular, initiatives are currently underway to optimize certain of our supply chain capabilities, including inventory and warehouse management, as well as adding capabilities to enhance certain financial processes and workforce management solutions. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

We believe that we are an industry leader in the development of new products. Our research and development group, which includes scientists and other employees involved in product innovation and packaging design and development, works closely with our marketing and product development teams and third-party suppliers to cultivate ideas, develop new products and product-line extensions, and create new packaging concepts, as well as to improve, redesign or reformulate existing products. In addition, these research and development personnel provide ongoing technical assistance and know-how to quality and assurance and manufacturing personnel on a worldwide basis, to ensure consistent global standards for our products and to deliver products that meet or exceed consumer expectations. The research and development group has long-standing working relationships with several U.S. and international medical and educational facilities, which supplement internal capabilities. Members of the research and development group are also responsible for regulatory compliance matters. 

&#160; 

- 9 - 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. As of June 30, 2016, we had approximately 800 employees engaged in research and development activities. We maintain research and development programs at certain of our principal facilities and facilities dedicated to performing research and development, see &#147; Item 2. Properties. &#148; 

&#160; 

We do not conduct animal testing on our products or ingredients, and do not ask others to test on our behalf, except when required by law. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing, Warehousing and Raw Materials 

&#160; 

We manufacture our products primarily in the United States, Belgium, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Canada. We continue to streamline our manufacturing processes and identify sourcing opportunities to improve innovation, increase efficiencies, minimize our impact on the environment and reduce costs. Our major manufacturing facilities operate as &#147;focus&#148; plants that primarily manufacture one category of product (e.g., makeup) for all of the principal brands. Our plants are modern, and our manufacturing processes are substantially automated. While we believe that our network of manufacturing facilities and third-party manufacturers is sufficient to meet current and reasonably anticipated manufacturing requirements, we continue to identify opportunities to make significant improvements in capacity, technology, productivity and align our manufacturing with regional sales demand. To capitalize on innovation and other supply chain benefits, we continue to utilize a network of third-party manufacturers on a global basis. 

&#160; 

We have established a global distribution network designed to meet the changing demands of our customers while maintaining service levels. We are continuously evaluating and adjusting this physical distribution network. We have established regional distribution centers, including those maintained by third parties, strategically positioned throughout the world in order to facilitate efficient delivery of our products to our customers. 

&#160; 

The principal raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are essential oils, alcohols and specialty chemicals. We also purchase packaging components that are manufactured to our design specifications. Procurement of materials for all manufacturing facilities is generally made on a global basis through our Global Supplier Relations department. We review our supplier base periodically with the specific objectives of improving quality, increasing innovation and speed-to-market and reducing costs. In addition, we focus on supply sourcing within the region of manufacture to allow for improved supply chain efficiencies. Some of our products rely on a single or limited number of suppliers; however, we believe that our portfolio of suppliers has adequate resources and facilities to overcome most unforeseen interruptions of supply. In the past, we have been able to obtain an adequate supply of essential raw materials and currently believe we have adequate sources of supply for virtually all components of our products. 

&#160; 

We are continually benchmarking the performance of our supply chain and will change suppliers and adjust our distribution networks and manufacturing footprint based upon the changing needs of the business. As we integrate acquired brands, we continually seek new ways to leverage our production and sourcing capabilities to improve our overall supply chain performance. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

There is vigorous competition within each market where our skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products are sold. Brand recognition, quality, performance, availability and price are some of the factors that impact consumers&#146; choices among competing products and brands. Advertising, promotion, social media activities, merchandising, the pace and timing of new product introductions, line extensions and the quality of in-store demonstrations also have a significant impact on consumers&#146; buying decisions. With our numerous brands, sold in various channels, we are one of the world&#146;s leading manufacturers and marketers of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products. We compete against a number of companies, some of which have substantially greater resources than we do. 

&#160; 

Our principal competitors consist of large, well-known, multinational manufacturers and marketers of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products, most of which market and sell their products under multiple brand names. They include, among others, L&#146;Oreal S.A.; Shiseido Company, Ltd.; Beiersdorf AG; LVMH Mo&#235;t Hennessey Louis Vuitton; Coty, Inc.; The Procter &#38; Gamble Company; Avon Products, Inc.; Chanel S.A.; Groupe Clarins; and Amorepacific. We also face competition from a number of independent brands, as well as some retailers that have their own beauty brands. Certain of our competitors also have ownership interests in retailers that are customers of ours.

&#160; 

Trademarks, Patents and Copyrights 

&#160; 

We own the trademark rights used in connection with the manufacturing, marketing, distribution and sale of our products both in the United States and in the other principal countries where such products are sold, including Est&#233;e Lauder, Clinique, Aramis, Prescriptives, Lab Series, Origins, M &#158; A &#158; C, Bobbi Brown, La Mer, Aveda, Jo Malone London, Bumble and bumble, Darphin, GoodSkin Labs, Ojon, Smashbox, Osiao, Le Labo, RODIN olio lusso, Editions de Parfums Fr&#233;d&#233;ric Malle, GLAMGLOW and By Kilian and the names of many of the products sold under these brands. We are the exclusive worldwide licensee for fragrances, cosmetics and/or related products for Tommy Hilfiger, Donna Karan New York, DKNY, Kiton, Michael Kors, Tom Ford, Dr. Andrew Weil, Ermenegildo Zegna, AERIN and Tory Burch. For further discussion on license arrangements, including their duration, see &#147;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#150; Note 2 &#150; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#150; License Arrangements .&#148; We protect our trademarks in the United States and significant markets worldwide. We consider the protection of our trademarks to be important to our business.

&#160; 

A number of our products incorporate patented, patent-pending or proprietary technology. In addition, several products and packaging for such products are covered by design patents or copyrights. While we consider these patents and copyrights, and the protection thereof, to be important, no single patent or copyright, or group of patents or copyrights, is considered material to the conduct of our business. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

At June 30, 2016, we had approximately 46,000 full-time employees worldwide (including demonstrators at points of sale who are employed by us). We have no employees in the United States that are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. A limited number of employees outside of the United States are covered by a works council agreement or other syndicate arrangements. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

We and our products are subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Trade Commission in the United States, as well as by various other federal, state, local and international regulatory authorities and the regulatory authorities in the countries in which our products are produced or sold. Such regulations principally relate to the ingredients, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, marketing, advertising, shipment, disposal and safety of our products. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with such regulations, as well as with applicable federal, state, local and international and other countries&#146; rules and regulations governing the discharge of materials hazardous to the environment or that relate to climate change. There are no significant capital expenditures for environmental control or climate change matters either planned in the current year or expected in the near future. 

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

Our results of operations in total, by region and by product category, are subject to seasonal fluctuations, with net sales in the first half of the fiscal year typically being slightly higher than in the second half of the fiscal year. The higher net sales in the first half of the fiscal year are attributable to the increased levels of purchasing by retailers for the holiday selling season. Many of our customers that are retailers follow a 4-4-5 retail calendar which may influence the amount and timing of their order placement and receipt of goods in any fiscal quarter. In a traditional 4-4-5 retail calendar, each fiscal quarter is comprised of two 4-week periods and one 5-week period, with one extra week in one quarter every seven years. As a result, our customers&#146; retail quarter-end and our fiscal quarter-end may be different by up to six days. Fluctuations in net sales and operating income in total and by geographic region and product category in any fiscal quarter may be attributable to the level and scope of new product introductions. Additionally, gross margins and operating expenses are impacted on a quarter-by-quarter basis by variations in our launch calendar and the timing of promotions, including purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions.
