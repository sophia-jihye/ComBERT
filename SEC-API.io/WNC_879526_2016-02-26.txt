&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

Wabash National Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, &#8220;Wabash,&#8221; &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221;) was founded in 1985 as a start-up company in Lafayette, Indiana. We are now a diversified industrial manufacturer and North America&#8217;s leading producer of semi-trailers and liquid transportation systems. We design, manufacture and market a diverse range of products, including dry freight and refrigerated trailers, platform trailers, bulk tank trailers, dry and refrigerated truck bodies, truck-mounted tanks, intermodal equipment, aircraft refueling equipment, structural composite panels and products, trailer aerodynamic solutions and specialty food grade and pharmaceutical equipment. We believe our position as a leader in our key industries is the result of longstanding relationships with our core customers, our demonstrated ability to attract new customers, our broad and innovative product lines, our technological leadership and our extensive distribution and service network. Our management team is focused on continuing to optimize our manufacturing and retail operations to match the current demand environment, implementing cost savings initiatives and lean manufacturing techniques, strengthening our capital structure, developing innovative products that enable our customers to succeed, improving earnings and continuing diversification of the business into higher margin opportunities that leverage our intellectual and process capabilities.

Commercial Trailer Products 

&#160;

Commercial Trailer Products segment sales as a percentage of our consolidated net sales and gross margin measured prior to intersegment eliminations were:

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; Year Ended December 31, &#160; &#160; &#160; 2015 &#160; &#160; 2014 &#160; &#160; 2013 &#160; Percentage of net sales &#160; &#160; 71.7 % &#160; &#160; 66.4 % &#160; &#160; 62.8 % Percentage of gross profit &#160; &#160; 61.1 % &#160; &#160; 45.8 % &#160; &#160; 39.5 % &#160;

The Commercial Trailer Products segment manufactures standard and customized van and platform trailers. We seek to identify and produce proprietary custom products that offer exceptional value to customers with the potential to generate higher profit margin than standardized products. We believe that we have the engineering and manufacturing capability to produce these products efficiently. We introduced our proprietary composite product, DuraPlate &#226; , in 1996 and have experienced widespread truck trailer industry acceptance. Since 2002, sales of our DuraPlate &#226; trailers have represented approximately 94% of our total new dry van trailer sales. We are also a competitive producer of refrigerated trailer products as well as other specialty products, including converter dollies. Through our Transcraft subsidiary we also manufacture steel and aluminum flatbed and dropdeck trailers. Through our Commercial Trailer Products segment, we also operate a wood flooring production facility that manufactures laminated hard wood oak products for our van trailer products.

&#160;

Commercial Trailer Products&#8217; transportation equipment is marketed under the Wabash &#226; , DuraPlate &#226; , DuraPlateHD &#226; , DuraPlate &#226; XD-35 &#174; , ArcticLite &#174; , RoadRailer &#174; , Transcraft &#174; and Benson &#174; trademarks directly to customers, through independent dealers and through our Company-owned retail branch network. Historically, we have focused on our longstanding core customers representing many of the largest companies in the trucking industry, but have expanded this focus over the past several years to include numerous additional key accounts. Our relationships with our core customers have been central to our growth since inception. We have also actively pursued the diversification of our customer base through our network of independent dealers. For our van business we utilize a total of 25 independent dealers with approximately 63 locations throughout North America to market and distribute our trailers. We distribute our flatbed and dropdeck trailers through a network of 73 independent dealers with approximately 123 locations throughout North America. In addition, we maintain a used fleet sales center to focus on selling both large and small fleet trade packages to the wholesale market.

&#160;

Diversified Products 

&#160;

Diversified Products segment sales as a percentage of our consolidated net sales and gross margin measured prior to intersegment eliminations were:

&#160;

&#160; &#160; Year Ended December 31, &#160; &#160; &#160; 2015 &#160; &#160; 2014 &#160; &#160; 2013 &#160; Percentage of net sales &#160; &#160; 20.3 % &#160; &#160; 23.9 % &#160; &#160; 26.7 % Percentage of gross profit &#160; &#160; 32.4 % &#160; &#160; 45.2 % &#160; &#160; 51.0 % &#160;

The Diversified Products segment focuses on our commitment to expand our customer base, diversify our product offerings, end markets and revenues, and extend our market leadership by leveraging our intellectual property and technology, including our proprietary DuraPlate &#174; panel technology, drawing on our core manufacturing expertise and making available products that are complementary to the truck and tank trailers and transportation equipment we offer. This segment includes a wide array of products and customer-specific solutions. Leveraging our intellectual property and technology and core manufacturing expertise into new applications and market sectors enables us to deliver greater value to our customers and shareholders.

&#160;

The Diversified Products segment is comprised of four strategic business units: Tank Trailer, Aviation &#38; Truck Equipment, Process Systems and Composites. The Tank Trailer business sells products through several brands including Walker Transport, Brenner &#174; Tank, Bulk International and Beall &#174; Trailers. These brands represent leading positions in liquid transportation systems and include a full line of stainless steel and aluminum tank trailers for the North American chemical, dairy, food and beverage, and petroleum and energy services markets. Offerings related to our Process Systems business include brands such as Walker &#174; Engineered Products and Extract Technology &#174; and represent what we estimate to be leading positions in isolators, stationary silos and downflow booths around the world for the chemical, dairy, food and beverage, pharmaceutical and nuclear markets. The Aviation &#38; Truck Equipment business is a leading manufacturer of truck-mounted tanks used in the aviation, refined fuel, heating oil, propane and liquid waste industries with products offered under the Garsite and Progress Tank brands. Our Composites business includes offerings under our DuraPlate &#174; composite panel technology, which contains unique properties of strength and durability that can be utilized in numerous applications in addition to truck trailers and truck bodies. The Diversified Products segment has leveraged our DuraPlate &#174; panel technology to develop numerous proprietary products, including the DuraPlate &#174; AeroSkirt &#174; , an aerodynamic solution for over-the-road trailers that provides approximately 6% improvement in fuel economy, as well as a line of foldable portable storage containers. Leveraging its experience with DuraPlate&#174; and trailer aerodynamics, the Composites business has developed a full line of aerodynamic solutions designed to improve overall trailer aerodynamics and fuel economy, most notably the AeroSkirt CX&#8482;, Ventix DRS TM and AeroFin TM . In addition, we utilize our DuraPlate &#174; technology in the production of truck bodies, overhead doors and other industrial applications. These DuraPlate &#174; composite products are sold to original equipment manufacturers and aftermarket customers.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Through these brands and product offerings, our Diversified Products segment now serves a variety of end markets, a number of which we believe are less cyclical than the markets served by our Commercial Trailer Products and Retail segments. We expect to continue to focus on diversifying our Diversified Products segment to enhance our business model, strengthen our revenues and become a stronger company that can deliver greater value to our shareholders.

&#160;

Retail 

&#160;

Retail segment sales as a percentage of our consolidated net sales and gross margin measured prior to intersegment eliminations were:

&#160;

&#160; &#160; Year Ended December 31, &#160; &#160; &#160; 2015 &#160; &#160; 2014 &#160; &#160; 2013 &#160; Percentage of net sales &#160; &#160; 8.0 % &#160; &#160; 9.7 % &#160; &#160; 10.5 % Percentage of gross profit &#160; &#160; 6.5 % &#160; &#160; 9.0 % &#160; &#160; 9.5 % &#160;

The Retail segment includes our 15 Company-owned retail branch locations, which are strategically located near large metropolitan areas to provide additional opportunities to distribute our products, diversify our factory direct sales and also offer services and support capabilities for our customers. Additionally, this segment includes 9 on-site service locations, where we provide dedicated service on a customer&#8217;s site in conjunction with long-term service and maintenance contracts. Our retail branch network&#8217;s sale of new and used trailers, aftermarket parts and service generally provides enhanced margin opportunities.

&#160;

Industry and Competition 

&#160;

Trucking in the U.S., according to the American Trucking Association (ATA), was estimated to be a $700 billion industry in 2014, representing approximately 80% of the total transportation industry revenue. Furthermore, ATA estimates that approximately 69% of all freight tonnage in 2014 was carried by trucks. Trailer demand is a direct function of the amount of freight to be transported. Furthermore, ATA estimates that the percentage of freight tonnage carried by trucks will grow 25% by 2026. To meet this continued high demand for freight, truck carriers will need to replace and expand their fleets, which typically results in increased trailer orders.

&#160;

Transportation in the U.S., including trucking, is a cyclical industry that has experienced three cycles over the last 20 years. In each of the last three cycles the decline in freight tonnage preceded the general U.S. economic downturn by approximately two and one-half years and the recovery has generally preceded that of the economy as a whole. The trailer industry generally follows the transportation industry, experiencing cycles in the early and late 90&#8217;s lasting approximately 58 and 67 months, respectively. Truck freight tonnage, according to ATA statistics, started declining year-over-year in 2006 and remained at depressed levels through 2009. The most recent cycle concluded in 2009, lasting a total of 89 months. After three consecutive years with total trailer demand well below normal replacement demand levels estimated to be approximately 220,000 trailers, the four year period ending December 2015 represent consecutive years of significant improvement in which the total trailer market increased year-over-year by 14%, 1%, 15% and 14% in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively, with total shipments of approximately 232,000; 234,000, 269,000 and 307,000, respectively. In our view, we expect to see continued strong demand for new trailer equipment as the economic and industry specific indicators we track, including but not limited to ATA&#8217;s truck tonnage index, employment growth, housing and auto sectors, as well as the overall gross domestic product, appear to be trending in a positive direction.

&#160;

Wabash, and its three largest competitors, Great Dane, Utility and Hyundai Translead, are generally viewed as the top trailer manufacturers in the U.S. and accounted for approximately 69% of U.S. new trailer market share in 2015. Our market share of U.S. total trailer shipments in 2015 was approximately 20%. Trailer manufacturers compete primarily through the quality of their products, customer relationships, service availability and price. Over the past several years, we have seen a number of our competitors follow our leadership in the development and use of composite sidewalls that compete directly with our DuraPlate &#226; products. Our product development is focused on maintaining our leading position with respect to these products and on development of new products and markets, leveraging our proprietary DuraPlate &#174; product, as well as our expertise in the engineering and design of customized products.

&#160;

The table below sets forth new trailer production for Wabash and, as provided by Trailer Body Builders Magazine, our largest competitors and the trailer industry as a whole within North America. The data represents all segments of the market, except containers and chassis. For the years included below, we have participated primarily in the van and platform trailer segments and added the tank trailer segment beginning in 2012 with the acquisitions of Walker Group Holdings (&#8220;Walker&#8221;) in May 2012 and certain assets of Beall Corporation (&#8220;Beall&#8217;) in February 2013. Van trailer demand, the largest segment within the trailer industry, has continued to show sequential improvements over each of the last five years from a low of approximately 52,000 trailers in 2009 and recovering to an estimated 227,000 van trailers in 2015. Our market share for van trailers in 2015 was approximately 24%, a decrease of less than 1% from 2014.

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 2015 &#160; &#160; 2014 &#160; &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; Wabash &#160; &#160; 63,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; 56,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; 46,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; 45,000 (2) &#160; &#160; 49,000 &#160; Great Dane &#160; &#160; 52,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; 48,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; 44,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; 44,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; 39,000 &#160; Utility &#160; &#160; 49,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; 41,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; 39,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; 38,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; 33,000 &#160; Hyundai Translead &#160; &#160; 43,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; 34,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; 27,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; 23,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; 18,000 &#160; Stoughton &#160; &#160; 15,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; 13,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; 12,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; 11,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; 9,000 &#160; Other principal producers &#160; &#160; 40,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; 37,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; 31,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; 33,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; 25,000 &#160; Total Industry &#160; &#160; 302,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; 265,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; 232,000 (1) &#160; &#160; 227,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; 201,000 (1) (1) Data revised by publisher in a subsequent year. (2) The 2012 production includes Walker volumes on a full-year pro forma basis. &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Our diversified product segment, in most cases, participates in markets different than our traditional van and platform trailer product offerings. The end markets that our diversified products serve are broader and more diverse than the trailer industry, including environmental, pharmaceutical, biotech, oil and gas, moving and storage and specialty vehicle. In addition, our diversification efforts pertain to new and emerging markets and many of the products are driven by regulatory requirements or, in most cases, customer-specific needs. However, some of our diversification efforts are considered to be in the early growth stages and future success is largely dependent on continued customer adoption of our product solutions and general expansion of our customer base and distribution channels.

&#160; 

Competitive Strengths 

&#160;

We believe our core competitive strengths include:

&#160;

&#183; Long-Term Core Customer Relationships &#8211; We are the leading provider of trailers to a significant number of top tier trucking companies, generating a revenue base that has helped to sustain us as one of the market leaders. Our van products are preferred by many of the industry&#8217;s leading carriers. We are also a leading provider of liquid-transportation systems and engineered products and we have a strong customer base, consisting of mostly private fleets, and have earned a leading market position across many of the markets we serve. &#160;

&#183; Innovative Product Offerings &#8211; Our DuraPlate &#226; proprietary technology offers what we believe to be a superior trailer, which customers value. A DuraPlate &#226; trailer is a composite plate trailer using material that contains a high-density polyethylene core bonded between high-strength steel skins. We believe that the competitive advantages of our DuraPlate &#226; trailers compared to standard trailers include providing a lower total cost of ownership through the following: &#160;

- Extended Service Life &#8211; operate three to five years longer; &#160;

- Lower Operating and Maintenance Costs &#8211; greater durability and performance; &#160;

- Less Downtime &#8211; higher utilization for fleets; &#160;

- Extended Warranty &#8211; warranty period for DuraPlate &#226; panels is ten years; and &#160;

- Improved Resale Value &#8211; higher trade-in and resale values. &#160;

We have been manufacturing DuraPlate &#226; trailers for over 20 years and through December 2015 have sold approximately 600,000 DuraPlate &#174; trailers. We believe that this proven experience, combined with ownership and knowledge of the DuraPlate &#226; panel technology, will help ensure continued industry leadership in the future. We continue to introduce new innovations in our DuraPlate &#174; line of products, including DuraPlateHD &#174; and DuraPlate XD-35 &#174; , along with new innovations in other product lines, including our ArcticLite &#174; refrigerated trailers and Lean Duplex tank trailers.

&#160;

&#183; Significant Market Share and Brand Recognition &#8211; We have been one of the three largest manufacturers of trailers in North America since 1994, with one of the most widely recognized brands in the industry. We are currently the largest producer of van trailers in North America and, according to data published by Trailer Body Builders Magazine, our Transcraft subsidiary is one of the leading producers of platform trailers . We are also the largest manufacturers of liquid stainless steel and aluminum tank trailers in North America through our Walker Transport, Brenner &#174; Tank, Bulk International and Beall &#174; brands. We participate broadly in the transportation industry through each of our three business segments. As a percentage of our consolidated net sales, new trailer sales for our dry and refrigerated vans, platforms and tanks represented approximately 83% in 2015. &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; Committed Focus on Operational Excellence &#8211; Safety, quality, on-time delivery, productivity and cost reduction are the core elements of our program of continuous improvement. We currently maintain an ISO 14001 registration of our Environmental Management System at our Lafayette, Indiana facilities and an ISO 9001 registration of our Quality Management System at our Lafayette, Indiana and Cadiz, Kentucky facilities. &#160;

&#183; Technology &#8211;We continue to be recognized by the trucking industry as a leader in developing technology to provide value-added solutions for our customers that reduce trailer operating costs, improve revenue opportunities, and solve unique transportation problems. Throughout our history, we have been and we expect we will continue to be a leading innovator in the design and production of trailers. Recent new trailer introductions and value-added options include the Lean Duplex tank trailer, a stainless steel option that reduces weight while providing enhanced performance characteristics over typical chemical tank trailers; Trustlock Plus &#174; , a proprietary single-lock rear door mechanism; a combination ID/Stop light, a dual-function rear ID light that also actuates as a brake indicator; MaxClearence TM Overhead Door System, a vertical door that provides an opening that would be comparable to that of swing door models; and the DuraPlate &#174; AeroSkirt &#174; , Ventix DRS TM , AeroFin TM and AeroSkirt CX TM , durable aerodynamic solutions that, based on verified laboratory and track testing, provides improved fuel efficiencies of 9% or greater when used in specific combinations. &#160;

In addition to the introduction of new trailer product innovations made through our DuraPlate &#174; family over the past 20 years, we have also focused on a customer-centered approach in developing product enhancements for other industries we serve. Some of the more recent innovations include: the development of mobile clean rooms, or self-contained laboratories, which are configured to provide isolation and containment solutions into a rapidly deployable and flexible manufacturing facility for pharmaceutical and other technology applications; the development of a Refined Fuel truck with integrated Auxiliary Power Unit designed to improve fuel efficiency and prolong the useful operating life of fuel delivery vehicles; and the introduction of the Truck Body line leveraging our fleet-proven DuraPlate &#174; technology for dry truck bodies as well as the introduction of a revolutionary proprietary composite panel designed to improve weight and thermal efficiency in refrigerated truck body applications. &#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#183; Corporate Culture &#8211; We benefit from an experienced, value-driven management team and dedicated workforce focused on operational excellence. &#160;

&#183; Extensive Distribution Network &#8211; Our 15 Company-owned retail branches extend our sales network throughout North America, diversify our factory direct sales, provide an outlet for used trailer sales and support our national service contracts. Additionally, we utilize a network of 25 independent dealers with approximately 63 locations throughout North America to distribute our van trailers, and our Transcraft distribution network consists of 73 independent dealers with approximately 123 locations throughout North America. Our tank trailers are distributed through a network of 65 independent dealers with 66 locations throughout North America. &#160;

Regulation 

&#160;

Truck trailer length, height, width, maximum weight capacity and other specifications are regulated by individual states. The federal government also regulates certain safety and environmental sustainability features incorporated in the design and use of truck and tank trailers. These regulations include, but are not limited to, requirements on anti-lock braking systems and rear-impact guard standards, the use of aerodynamic devices and fuel saving technologies, as well as operator restrictions as to hours of service and minimum driver safety standards (see &#8220;Industry Trends&#8221;). In addition, most tank trailers we manufacture have specific federal regulations and restrictions that dictate tank design, material type and thickness. Manufacturing operations are subject to environmental laws enforced by federal, state and local agencies (see &#34;Environmental Matters&#34;).

&#160; 

Products 

&#160; 

Since our inception, we have expanded our product offerings from a single truck trailer dry van product to a broad range of transportation equipment and diversified industrial products.

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Our Commercial Trailer Products segment specializes in the development of innovative proprietary products for our key markets. Commercial Trailer Products segment sales represented approximately 72%, 66% and 63% of our consolidated net sales as measured before elimination of intersegment sales in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our current Commercial Trailer Products primarily include the following:

&#160;

&#183; Dry Van Trailers. The dry van market represents our largest product line and includes trailers sold under DuraPlate &#226; , DuraPlateHD &#226; , and DuraPlate &#174; XD-35 &#174; trademarks. Our DuraPlate &#174; trailers utilize a proprietary technology that consists of a composite plate wall for increased durability and greater strength. &#160;

&#183; Platform Trailers. Platform trailers are sold under the Transcraft &#174; and Benson &#174; trademarks. Platform trailers consist of a trailer chassis with a flat or &#8220;drop&#8221; loading deck without permanent sides or a roof. These trailers are primarily utilized to haul steel coils, construction materials and large equipment. In addition to our all steel and combination steel and aluminum platform trailers, we also offer a premium all-aluminum platform trailer. &#160; 

&#183; Refrigerated Trailers. Refrigerated trailers have insulating foam in the walls, roof and floor, which improves both the insulation capabilities and durability of the trailers. Our refrigerated trailers are sold under the ArcticLite &#174; trademark and use our proprietary SolarGuard &#174; technology, coupled with our foaming process, which we believe enables customers to achieve lower costs through reduced operating hours of refrigeration equipment and therefore reduced fuel consumption. &#160;

Our Retail segment offers products in three general categories, including new trailers, used trailers and parts and service. Retail segment sales represented approximately 8% of our consolidated net sales as measured before elimination of intersegment sales in 2015 and approximately 10% in each of the prior two years. The following is a description of each product category:

&#160;

&#183; New Trailers. We sell new trailers produced by the Commercial Trailer Products and Diversified Products segments. Additionally, we sell specialty trailers produced by third parties that are purchased in smaller quantities for local or regional transportation needs. As a percentage of consolidated net sales, new trailer sales through our Retail segment represented approximately 3%, 5% and 5% of consolidated net sales in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. &#160;

&#183; Parts &#38; Service. We provide replacement parts and accessories, maintenance service and trailer repairs and conversions for trailers and other related equipment. As a percentage of consolidated net sales, parts and service sales within our Retail segment represented approximately 4%, 4% and 5% in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. &#160;

&#183; Used Trailers. We sell used trailers through our retail branch network to enable us to remarket and promote new trailer sales in the local regions in which we operate. Used trailer sales represented less than 1% of consolidated net sales in each of 2015, 2014 and 2013. &#160; 

Customers 

&#160;

Our customer base has historically included many of the nation&#8217;s largest truckload (TL) common carriers, leasing companies, private fleet carriers, less-than-truckload (LTL) common carriers and package carriers. We continue to expand our customer base and diversify into the broader trailer market through our independent dealer and company-owned retail networks, as well as through strategic acquisitions. Furthermore, we continue to diversify our products organically by expanding the use of DuraPlate &#174; composite panel technology through products such as DuraPlate &#174; AeroSkirts &#174; , truck bodies, overhead doors and portable storage containers as well as strategically through our acquisitions. All of these efforts have been accomplished while maintaining our relationships with our core customers. Our five largest customers together accounted for approximately 25%, 20% and 17% of our aggregate net sales in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. No individual customer accounted for more than 10% or more of our aggregate net sales during the past three years. International sales, primarily to Canadian customers, accounted for less than 10% of net sales for each of the last three years.

&#160;

We have established relationships as a supplier to many large customers in the transportation industry, including the following:

&#160;

&#183; Truckload Carriers: Averitt Express, Inc.; Celadon Group, Inc.; Covenant Transportation Group, Inc; Cowan Systems, LLC; Crete Carrier Corporation; Heartland Express, Inc.; J.B Hunt Transport, Inc.; Knight Transportation, Inc.; Schneider National, Inc.; Swift Transportation Corporation; U.S. Xpress Enterprises, Inc.; and Werner Enterprises, Inc. &#160;

(an unaffiliated company); and Whiting Door Manufacturing Corp.

&#160; 

Marketing and Distribution 

&#160;

We market and distribute our products through the following channels:

&#160;

&#183; Factory direct accounts; &#160;

&#183; Company-owned distribution network; and &#160;

&#183; Independent dealerships. &#160;

Factory direct accounts are generally large fleets, with over 7,500 trailers, that are high volume purchasers. Historically, we have focused on the factory direct market in which customers are highly knowledgeable of the life-cycle costs of trailer equipment and, therefore, are best equipped to appreciate the design and value-added features of our products.

&#160;

Our Company-owned distribution network generates retail sales of trailers to smaller fleets and independent operators located in geographic regions where our branches are located. This branch network enables us to provide maintenance and other services to customers.

&#160;

We also sell our van trailers through a network of 25 independent dealers with approximately 63 locations throughout North America. Our platform trailers are sold through 73 independent dealers with approximately 123 locations throughout North America. Our tank trailers are distributed through a network of 65 independent dealers with 66 locations throughout North America. The dealers primarily serve mid-market and smaller sized carriers and private fleets in the geographic region where the dealer is located and occasionally may sell to large fleets. The dealers may also perform service work for our customers.

&#160; 

Raw Materials 

&#160;

We utilize a variety of raw materials and components including, specialty steel coil, stainless steel, plastic, aluminum, lumber, tires, landing gear, axles and suspensions, which we purchase from a limited number of suppliers. Costs of raw materials and component parts represented approximately 63%, 65% and 65% of our consolidated net sales in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Raw material costs as a percentage of our consolidated net sales realized throughout 2015 are in line with recent years; however, we have seen some declining raw material costs in recent quarters. Significant price fluctuations or shortages in raw materials or finished components have had, and could have further, adverse effects on our results of operations. In 2016 and for the foreseeable future, we expect that the raw materials used in the greatest quantity will be steel, aluminum, plastic and wood. We will endeavor to pass along any raw material and component cost increases and, to minimize the effect of price fluctuations, we hedge certain commodities that have the potential to significantly impact our operations.

&#160;

Backlog 

&#160;

Orders that have been confirmed by customers in writing, have defined delivery timeframes and can be produced during the next 18 months are included in our backlog. Orders that comprise our backlog may be subject to changes in quantities, delivery, specifications, terms or cancellation. Our backlog of orders at December 31, 2015 and 2014 was approximately $1,191 million and $1,087 million, respectively, and we expect to complete the majority of our backlog orders as of December 31, 2015 within 12 months of this date.

&#160; 

Patents and Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We hold or have applied for 104 patents in the U.S. on various components and techniques utilized in our manufacture of transportation equipment and engineered products. In addition, we hold or have applied for 126 patents in foreign countries.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Our patents include intellectual property related to the manufacture of trailers and aerodynamic-related products using our proprietary DuraPlate &#174; product, truck body, trailer, and aerodynamic-related products utilizing other composite materials, our containment and isolation systems, and other engineered products &#8211; all of which we believe offer us a significant competitive advantage in the markets in which we compete.

&#160;

Our DuraPlate &#174; patent portfolio includes several patents and pending patent applications, which cover not only utilization of our DuraPlate &#174; product in the manufacture of trailers, but also cover a number of aerodynamic-related products aimed at increasing the fuel efficiency of trailers. Patents in our DuraPlate &#174; patent portfolio have expiration dates ranging from 2016 to 2035. While certain patents relating to the combined use of DuraPlate &#174; panels and logistics systems within the sidewalls of our dry van trailers will expire in 2016, several other issued patents and pending patent applications relating to the use of DuraPlate&#174; panels, or other composite materials, within aerodynamic-related products as well as modular storage and shipping containers will not begin to expire until 2035. Additionally, we believe that our proprietary DuraPlate &#174; production process, which has been developed and refined since 1995, offers us a significant competitive advantage in the industry &#8211; above and beyond the benefits provided by any patent protection concerning the use and/or design of our DuraPlate &#174; products. While unpatented, we believe the proprietary knowledge of this process and the significant intellectual and capital hurdles in creating a similar production process provide us with an advantage over others in the industry who utilize composite sandwich panel technology.

&#160;

Our intellectual property portfolio further includes a number of patent applications related to the manufacture of truck bodies and trailers using polymer composite component parts. These patent applications cover the polymer composite component structure and method of manufacturing the same. We believe the intellectual property related to this emerging use of polymer composite technology in our industry will offer us a significant market advantage to create proprietary products exploiting this technology. Additionally, our intellectual property portfolio includes patent applications related to the rear impact guard (RIG) of a trailer. These patent applications include new RIG designs which surpass the current and proposed federal regulatory RIG standards for the U.S. and Canada.

&#160;

In addition, our intellectual property portfolio includes patents and patent applications covering many of our engineered products, including our containment and isolation systems, as well as many trailer industry components. These products have become highly desirable and are recognized for their innovation in the markets we serve. The engineered products patents and patent applications relate to our industry leading isolation systems, sold under the Extract Technology &#174; brand name. These patents will not begin to expire until 2021. The patents and patent applications relating to our proprietary trailer-industry componentry include, for example, those covering the Trust Lock Plus &#174; door locking mechanism, the use of bonded intermediate logistics strips, the bonded D-ring hold-down device, bonded skylights, the DuraPlate &#174; arched roof, and the Max Clearance&#174; Overhead Door System, which provides additional overhead clearance when an overhead-style rear door is in the opened position that would be comparable to that of swing-door models. The patents covering these products will not expire before 2029. Further, another patented product sold by the Diversified Products segment includes the ShakerTank &#174; trailer, a vibrating bulk tank trailer used in transporting viscous materials, whose patents will not expire before 2026. We believe all of these proprietary products offer us a competitive market advantage in the industries in which we compete.

&#160;

We also hold or have applied for 46 trademarks in the U.S., as well as 60 trademarks in foreign countries. These trademarks include the Wabash &#174; , Wabash National &#174; , Transcraft &#174; , Benson &#174; , Extract Technology &#174;, Beall &#174; and Brenner &#174; brand names as well as trademarks associated with our proprietary products such as DuraPlate &#174; , RoadRailer &#174; , Transcraft &#174; , Arctic Lite &#174; , and Benson &#174; trailers. Additionally, we utilize several tradenames that are each well-recognized in their industries, including Walker Transport, Walker Stainless Equipment, Walker Engineered Products, Garsite, Bulk Tank International and Progress Tank. Our trademarks associated with additional proprietary products include Max Clearance &#174; Overhead Door System, Trust Lock Plus &#174; , EZ-7 &#174; , DuraPlate AeroSkirt &#174; , DuraPlate AeroSkirt CX TM , DuraPlate XD-35 &#174; , DuraPlate HD &#174; , SolarGuard &#174; , Ventix DRS TM , AeroFin TM , AeroFin XL&#8482; and EZ-Adjust &#174; . We believe these trademarks are important for the identification of our products and the associated customer goodwill; however, our business is not materially dependent on such trademarks.

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

Research and development expenses are charged to earnings as incurred and were $4.8 million, $1.7 million and $2.2 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Environmental Matters 

&#160; 

Our facilities are subject to various environmental laws and regulations including those relating to air emissions, wastewater discharges, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and occupational safety and health. Our operations and facilities have been, and in the future may become, the subject of enforcement actions or proceedings for non-compliance with such laws or for remediation of company-related releases of substances into the environment. Resolution of such matters with regulators can result in commitments to compliance abatement or remediation programs and, in some cases, the payment of penalties (see Item 3 &#8220;Legal Proceedings&#8221;).

&#160;

We believe that our facilities are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Our facilities have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with these laws and regulations. However, we currently do not anticipate that the future costs of environmental compliance will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had approximately 5,300 and 5,100 full-time employees, respectively. Throughout 2015, essentially all of our active employees were non-union. Our temporary employees represented approximately 17% of our overall production workforce as of December 31, 2015 as compared to approximately 18% at the end of the prior year period. We place a strong emphasis on maintaining good employee relations and development through competitive compensation and related benefits, a safe work environment and promoting educational programs and quality improvement teams.
