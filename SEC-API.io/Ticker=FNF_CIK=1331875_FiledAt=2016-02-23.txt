 Item 1. 

Business 

We have organized our business into two groups, FNF Core Operations and FNF Ventures ("FNFV"). 

Through our Core Operations, FNF is a leading provider of (i) title insurance, escrow and other title related services, including collection and trust activities, trustee sales guarantees, recordings and reconveyances and home warranty insurance and (ii) technology and transaction services to the real estate and mortgage industries. FNF is the nation&#8217;s largest title insurance company operating through its title insurance underwriters - Fidelity National Title Insurance Company, Chicago Title Insurance Company, Commonwealth Land Title Insurance Company, Alamo Title Insurance and National Title Insurance of New York Inc. - that collectively issue more title insurance policies than any other title company in the United States. Through our subsidiary ServiceLink Holdings, LLC ("ServiceLink"), we provide mortgage transaction services including title-related services and facilitation of production and management of mortgage loans. FNF also provides industry-leading mortgage technology solutions, including MSP&#174;, the leading residential mortgage servicing technology platform in the U.S., through its majority-owned subsidiary, Black Knight Financial Services, Inc. ("Black Knight"). 

Through our FNFV group, we own majority and minority equity investment stakes in a number of entities, including American Blue Ribbon Holdings, LLC ("ABRH"), Ceridian HCM, Inc. and Fleetcor Technologies, Inc. (collectively "Ceridian") and Digital Insurance, Inc. ("Digital Insurance"). 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had the following reporting segments: 

FNF Core Operations 

&#8226;

This segment provides core title insurance and escrow and other title related services including collection and trust activities, trustee sales guarantees, recordings and reconveyances, and home warranty insurance. This segment also includes the transaction services business acquired from Lender Processing Services, Inc. ("LPS"), now combined with our ServiceLink business. Transaction services include other title-related services used in the production and management of mortgage loans, including mortgage loans that experience default. 

&#8226;

&#8226; 

FNFV Corporate and Other. &#32;This segment primarily consists of our share in the operations of certain equity investments, including Ceridian, as well as consolidated investments, including Digital Insurance, in which we own 96% , and other smaller operations which are not title related. 

C ompetitive Strengths 

We believe that our competitive strengths include the following: 

Corporate principles. A cornerstone of our management philosophy and operating success is the six fundamental precepts upon which we were founded, which are: 

&#8226; 

Autonomy and entrepreneurship; 

&#8226; 

Bias for action; 

&#8226; 

Customer-oriented and motivated; 

&#8226; 

Minimize bureaucracy; 

&#8226; 

Employee ownership; and 

&#8226; 

Highest standard of conduct. 

&#32;1 

These six precepts are emphasized to our employees from the first day of employment and are integral to many of our strategies described below. 

Competitive cost structure. We have been able to maintain competitive operating margins in part by monitoring our businesses in a disciplined manner through continual evaluation of title order activity and management of our cost structure. When compared to our industry competitors, we also believe that our structure is more efficiently designed, which allows us to operate with lower overhead costs. 

We believe that our competitive strengths position us well to take advantage of future changes to the real estate market. 

Title 

Leading title insurance company. We are the largest title insurance company in the United States and a leading provider of title insurance and escrow and other title-related services for real estate transactions. Through the third quarter of 2015 , our insurance companies had a 32.9% &#32;share of the U.S. title insurance market, according to the American Land Title Association ("ALTA"). 

Established relationships with our customers. We have strong relationships with the customers who use our title services. Our distribution network, which includes approximately &#32; 1,200 &#32; direct residential title offices and approximately &#32; 5,000 &#32;agents , is among the largest in the United States. We also benefit from strong brand recognition in our multiple title brands that allows us to access a broader client base than if we operated under a single consolidated brand and provides our customers with a choice among brands. 

Strong value proposition for our customers. We provide our customers with title insurance and escrow and other title-related services that support their ability to effectively close real estate transactions. We help make the real estate closing more efficient for our customers by offering a single point of access to a broad platform of title-related products and resources necessary to close real estate transactions. 

Proven management team. The managers of our operating businesses have successfully built our title business over an extended period of time, resulting in our business attaining the size, scope and presence in the industry that it has today. Our managers have demonstrated their leadership ability during numerous acquisitions through which we have grown and throughout a number of business cycles and significant periods of industry change. 

Commercial title insurance. While residential title insurance comprises the majority of our business, we are also a significant provider of commercial real estate title insurance in the United States. Our network of agents, attorneys, underwriters and closers that service the commercial real estate markets is one of the largest in the industry. Our commercial network combined with our financial strength makes our title insurance operations attractive to large national lenders that require the underwriting and issuing of larger commercial title policies. 

Black Knight 

&#32; Market leadership with comprehensive and integrated solutions . We are a leading provider of comprehensive and integrated solutions to the mortgage industry. Our solutions are utilized to service approximately 59% of all U.S. first lien mortgages as of December 31, 2015 according to the Black Knight Mortgage Monitor Report and operate one of the industry&#8217;s largest exchanges connecting originators, agents, settlement services providers and investors. We believe our leadership position is, in part, the result of our unique expertise and insight developed from over 50 years serving the needs of customers in the mortgage industry. We have used this insight to develop an integrated and comprehensive suite of proprietary technology, data, and analytics solutions to automate many of the mission-critical business processes across the entire mortgage loan life cycle. These integrated solutions are designed to reduce manual processes, assist in improving organizational compliance and mitigating risk, and ultimately deliver significant cost savings to our clients. 

Broad and deep client relationships with significant recurring revenue . We have deep and long-standing relationships with our largest clients. We frequently enter into long-term contracts with our mortgage servicing and loan origination clients that contain volume minimums and provide for annual increases. Our products are typically embedded within our clients&#8217; mission-critical workflow and decision processes across various parts of their organizations. 

Extensive data assets and analytics capabilities . We develop and maintain large, accurate and comprehensive data sets on the mortgage and housing industry that we believe are competitively differentiated. Our data sets represent metropolitan statistical areas that cover 99.99% of the U.S. population and 96% of all mortgage transactions according to 2012 U.S. census data. Our unique data sets provide a combination of public and proprietary data in real-time and each of our data records feature a large number of attributes. Our data scientists utilize our data sets, subject to any applicable use &#32; restrictions, and comprehensive analytical capabilities to create highly customized reports, including models of customer behavior for originators and servicers, portfolio analytics for capital markets and government agencies and proprietary market insights for real estate agencies. Our data and analytics capabilities are also embedded into our technology platform and workflow products, providing our clients with integrated and comprehensive solutions. 

&#32;2 

&#32; Scalable and cost effective operating model . We believe we have a highly attractive and scalable operating model derived from our market leadership, hosted technology platforms and the large number of clients we serve across the mortgage industry. Our scalable operating model provides us with significant benefits. Our scale and operating leverage allows us to add incremental clients to our existing platforms with limited incremental cost. As a result, our operating model drives attractive margins and generates significant cash flow. Also, by leveraging our scale and leading market position, we are able to make cost effective investments in our technology platform to meet evolving regulatory and compliance requirements, further increasing our value proposition to clients. 

World class management team with depth of experience and track record of success . Our management team has an average of over 20 years of experience in the banking technology and mortgage processing industries and a proven track record of strong execution capabilities. Over the past two years we have significantly improved our operations and enhanced our go-to-market strategy, further integrated our technology platforms, expanded our data and analytics capabilities and introduced several new innovative products. We executed all of these projects while delivering attractive revenue growth and strong profitability. 

Strategy 

Title 

Our strategy in the title business is to maximize operating profits by increasing our market share and managing operating expenses throughout the real estate business cycle. To accomplish our goals, we intend to do the following: 

&#8226; 

Continue to operate multiple title brands independently . We believe that in order to maintain and strengthen our title insurance customer base, we must operate our strongest brands in a given marketplace independently of each other. Our national and regional brands include Fidelity National Title, Chicago Title, Commonwealth Land Title, Lawyers Title, Ticor Title, Alamo Title, and National Title of New York. In our largest markets, we operate multiple brands. This approach allows us to continue to attract customers who identify with a particular brand and allows us to utilize a broader base of local agents and local operations than we would have with a single consolidated brand. 

&#8226; 

Consistently deliver superior customer service. We believe customer service and consistent product delivery are the most important factors in attracting and retaining customers. Our ability to provide superior customer service and consistent product delivery requires continued focus on providing high quality service and products at competitive prices. Our goal is to continue to improve the experience of our customers, in all aspects of our business. 

&#8226; 

Manage our operations successfully through business cycles . We operate in a cyclical industry and our ability to diversify our revenue base within our core title insurance business and manage the duration of our investments may allow us to better operate in this cyclical business. Maintaining a broad geographic revenue base, utilizing both direct and independent agency operations and pursuing both residential and commercial title insurance business help diversify our title insurance revenues. We continue to monitor, evaluate and execute upon the consolidation of administrative functions, legal entity structure, and office consolidation, as necessary, to respond to the continually changing marketplace. We maintain shorter durations on our investment portfolio to mitigate our interest rate risk. A more detailed discussion of our investment strategies is included in &#8220;Investment Policies and Investment Portfolio.&#8221; 

&#8226; 

Continue to improve our products and technology. As a national provider of real estate transaction products and services, we participate in an industry that is subject to significant change, frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate industry changes and offer products and services that meet evolving industry standards. In connection with our service offerings, we are continuing to deploy new information system technologies to our direct and agency operations. We expect to improve the process of ordering title and escrow services and improve the delivery of our products to our customers. 

&#8226; 

Maintain values supporting our strategy. We believe that our continued focus on and support of our long-established corporate culture will reinforce and support our business strategy. Our goal is to foster and support a corporate culture where our employees and agents seek to operate independently and maintain profitability at the local level while forming close customer relationships by meeting customer needs and improving customer service. Utilizing a relatively flat managerial structure and providing our employees with a sense of individual ownership support this goal. 

&#8226; 

Effectively manage costs based on economic factors. We believe that our focus on our operating margins is essential to our continued success in the title insurance business. Regardless of the business cycle in which we may be operating, we seek to continue to evaluate and manage our cost structure and make appropriate adjustments where economic conditions dictate. This continual focus on our cost structure helps us to better maintain our operating margins. 

Black Knight 

Black Knight's comprehensive and integrated technology platforms, robust data and analytic capabilities, differentiated business model, broad and deep client relationships and other competitive strengths enable it to pursue multiple growth opportunities. Black Knight intends to continue to expand its business and grow through the following key strategies: 

&#32;3 

&#8226; 

Further penetration of our solutions with existing clients . We believe our established client base presents a substantial opportunity for growth. We seek to capitalize on the trend of standardization and increased adoption of leading third-party solutions and increase the number of solutions provided to our existing client base. We intend to broaden and deepen our client relationships by cross-selling our suite of end-to-end technology solutions, as well as our robust data and analytics. We have established incentives within our sales force, as well as a core team of account managers, to encourage cross-selling of our full range of solutions to our existing clients. By helping our clients understand the full extent of our comprehensive solutions and the value of leveraging the multiple solutions that we offer, we believe we can expand our existing relationships by freeing our clients to focus on their core businesses and their customers. 

&#8226; 

Win new clients in existing markets . We intend to attract new clients in the mortgage industry by leveraging the value proposition provided by our technology platform and comprehensive solutions offering. In particular, we believe there is a significant opportunity to penetrate the underserved mid-tier mortgage originators and servicers market. We believe that these institutions can benefit from our proven solutions suite in order to address increasingly complex regulatory requirements and compete more effectively in the evolving mortgage market. We intend to continue to pursue this channel and benefit from the low incremental cost of adding new customers to our scaled technology infrastructure. 

&#8226; 

Continue to innovate and introduce new solutions . Our long-term vision is to be the industry-leading provider for participants of the mortgage industry for their platform, data, and analytic needs. We &#32; intend to enhance what we believe is a leadership position in the industry by continuing to innovate our solutions and refine the insight we provide to our clients. We have a strong track record of introducing and developing new solutions that span the mortgage loan life cycle, are tailored to specific industry trends and that enhance our clients&#8217; core operating functions. By working in partnership with key clients, we have been able to develop and market new and advanced solutions to our client base that meet the evolving demands of the mortgage industry. In addition, we will continue to develop and leverage insights from our large public and proprietary data assets to further improve our customer value proposition. 

&#8226; 

Powerful focus and dedication to staying up-to-date with regulatory requirements . We have dedicated significant technological and management resources to build and maintain a regulatory infrastructure and human capital base to assist our clients with increased regulatory oversight and requirements. We are able to leverage our consistent investment in this area through our SaaS technology solutions and our market-leading scale. We intend to continue our strategy of building and investing in solutions that help our clients with the regulatory environment. 

&#8226; 

Selectively pursue strategic acquisitions . The core focus of our strategy is to grow organically. However, we may selectively evaluate strategic acquisition opportunities that may allow us to expand our footprint, broaden our client base and deepen our product and service offerings. We believe that &#32; there are meaningful synergies that result from acquiring small companies that provide best-of-breed single point solutions. The potential revenue synergies would result from integrating and cross-selling these point solutions into our broader client base and cost synergies would result from integrating acquisitions into our efficient operating environment. 

FNFV 

Through FNFV we actively manage a group of companies and investments with a net asset value of approximately $ 969 million &#32;as of December 31, 2015 . The businesses within FNFV primarily consist of our majority ownership positions in ABRH and Digital Insurance and our 32% minority investment in Ceridian. Our strategy for the Group is to continue our activities with respect to such business investments to achieve superior financial performance, maximize and ultimately monetize the value of those assets and to continue to pursue similar investments in businesses and to grow and achieve superior financial performance with respect to such newly acquired businesses. 

Restaurant Group 

Our restaurant operations are focused in the family dining and casual dining segments. The Restaurant Group's strategy is to achieve long-term profit growth and drive increases in same store sales and guest counts. We have a highly experienced management team that is focused on enhancing the guest experience at our restaurants and building team member engagement. We also utilize a shared service platform that takes advantage of the combined synergies of our operating companies to provide purchasing power and other shared service functions. We expect to continue to maintain a strong balance sheet for our Restaurant Group to support future acquisitions and to provide stability in all operating environments. 

FNFV Corporate and Other 

Acquisitions, Dispositions, Minority Owned Operating Subsidiaries and Financings 

Acquisitions have been an important part of our growth strategy. D ispositions have been an important aspect of our strategy of returning value to shareholders. On an ongoing basis, with assistance from our advisors, we actively evaluate possible transactions, such as acquisitions and dispositions of business units and operating assets and business combination transactions. 

&#32;4 

In the future, we may seek to sell certain investments or other assets to increase our liquidity. Further, our management has stated that we may make acquisitions in lines of business that are not directly tied to, or synergistic with, our core operating segments. &#32;&#32; In the past we have obtained majority and minority investments in entities and securities where we see the potential to achieve above market returns. Fundamentally our goal is to acquire quality companies that are well-positioned in their respective industries, run by best in class management teams in industries that have attractive organic and acquired growth opportunities. We leverage our operational expertise and track record of growing industry leading companies and also our active interaction with the acquired company's management directly or through our board of directors, to ultimately provide value for our shareholders. 

There can be no assurance that any suitable opportunities will arise or that any particular transaction will be completed. &#160; We have made a number of acquisitions and dispositions over the past several years to strengthen and expand our service offerings and customer base in our various businesses, to expand into other businesses or where we otherwise saw value, and to monetize investments in assets and businesses. 

Title Insurance 

Market for title insurance. According to Demotech Performance of Title Insurance Companies &#32; 2015 &#32; Edition, an annual compilation of financial information from the title insurance industry that is published by Demotech Inc., an independent firm ("Demotech"), total operating income for the entire U.S. title insurance industry has increased over the last 5 years from approximately $ 10.3 billion &#32; in &#32;2010 to $ 12.2 billion &#32;in 2014, which is a $ 1.2 billion &#32;decrease from 2013. The size of the industry is closely tied to various macroeconomic factors, including, but not limited to, growth in the gross domestic product, inflation, unemployment, the availability of credit, consumer confidence, interest rates, and sales volumes and prices for new and existing homes, as well as the volume of refinancing of previously issued mortgages. &#32; 

Most real estate transactions consummated in the U.S. require the use of title insurance by a lending institution before the transaction can be completed. Generally, revenues from title insurance policies are directly correlated with the value of the property underlying the title policy, and appreciation or depreciation in the overall value of the real estate market are major factors in total industry revenues. Industry revenues are also driven by factors affecting the volume of real estate closings, such as the state of the economy, the availability of mortgage funding, and changes in interest rates, which affect demand for new mortgage loans and refinancing transactions. Both the volume and the average price of residential real estate transactions declined from 2007-2011. Beginning in 2008 and continuing through 2011, the mortgage delinquency and default rates caused negative operating results at a number of banks and financial institutions. Multiple banks failed during this time, reducing the capacity of the mortgage industry to make loans. Since this time, lenders have tightened their underwriting standards which has made it more difficult for buyers to qualify for new loans. However, during this same period, interest rates declined to historically low levels, which spurred higher refinance activity in the period 2009 through 2012. During 2013 and continuing through 2015, refinance activity declined due to rising interest rates which followed a period of historically low interest rates experienced from 2008 through 2012. However, over the same period from 2013 through 2015, we experienced an increase in the purchase volume and average price of residential real estate. Overall, our title premiums increased in 2015 compared to 2014. Our revenues in future periods will continue to be subject to these and other factors which are beyond our control and, as a result, are likely to fluctuate. 

&#160; The U.S. title insurance industry is concentrated among a handful of industry participants. According to Demotech, the top four title insurance groups accounted for &#32; 87 % of net premiums written in &#32; 2014 . Approximately 32 independent title insurance companies accounted for the remaining &#32; 13 % of net premiums written in &#32; 2014 . Consolidation has created opportunities for increased financial and operating efficiencies for the industry&#8217;s largest participants and should continue to drive profitability and market share in the industry. 

Title Insurance Policies. Generally, real estate buyers and mortgage lenders purchase title insurance to insure good and marketable title to real estate and priority of lien. A brief generalized description of the process of issuing a title insurance policy is as follows: 

&#8226; 

The customer, typically a real estate salesperson or broker, escrow agent, attorney or lender, places an order for a title policy. 

&#8226; 

Company personnel note the specifics of the title policy order and place a request with the title company or its agents for a preliminary report or commitment. 

&#8226; 

After the relevant historical data on the property is compiled, the title officer prepares a preliminary report that documents the current status of title to the property, any exclusions, exceptions and/or limitations that the title company might include in the policy, and specific issues that need to be addressed and resolved by the parties to the transaction before the title policy will be issued. 

&#8226; 

The preliminary report is circulated to all the parties for satisfaction of any specific issues. 

&#8226; 

After the specific issues identified in the preliminary report are satisfied, an escrow agent closes the transaction in accordance with the instructions of the parties and the title company&#8217;s conditions. 

&#8226; 

Once the transaction is closed and all monies have been released, the title company issues a title insurance policy. 

&#32;5 

In real estate transactions financed with a mortgage, virtually all real property mortgage lenders require their borrowers to obtain a title insurance policy at the time a mortgage loan is made. This lender&#8217;s policy insures the lender against any defect affecting the priority of the mortgage in an amount equal to the outstanding balance of the related mortgage loan. An owner&#8217;s policy is typically also issued, insuring the buyer against defects in title in an amount equal to the purchase price. In a refinancing transaction, only a lender&#8217;s policy is generally purchased because ownership of the property has not changed. In the case of an all-cash real estate purchase, no lender&#8217;s policy is issued but typically an owner&#8217;s title policy is issued. 

Title insurance premiums paid in connection with a title insurance policy are based on (and typically are a percentage of) either the amount of the mortgage loan or the purchase price of the property insured. Applicable state insurance regulations or regulatory practices may limit the maximum, or in some cases the minimum, premium that can be charged on a policy. Title insurance premiums are due in full at the closing of the real estate transaction. A lender&#8217;s policy generally terminates upon the refinancing or resale of the property. 

The amount of the insured risk or &#8220;face amount&#8221; of insurance under a title insurance policy is generally equal to either the amount of the loan secured by the property or the purchase price of the property. The title insurer is also responsible for the cost of defending the insured title against covered claims. The insurer&#8217;s actual exposure at any given time, however, generally is less than the total face amount of policies outstanding because the coverage of a lender&#8217;s policy is reduced and eventually terminated as a result of payments on the mortgage loan. A title insurer also generally does not know when a property has been sold or refinanced except when it issues the replacement coverage. Because of these factors, the total liability of a title underwriter on outstanding policies cannot be precisely determined. 

Title insurance companies typically issue title insurance policies directly through branch offices or through affiliated title agencies, or indirectly through independent third party agencies unaffiliated with the title insurance company. Where the policy is issued through a branch or wholly-owned subsidiary agency operation, the title insurance company typically performs or directs the title search, and the premiums collected are retained by the title company. Where the policy is issued through an independent agent, the agent generally performs the title search (in some areas searches are performed by approved attorneys), examines the title, collects the premium and retains a majority of the premium. The remainder of the premium is remitted to the title insurance company as compensation, part of which is for bearing the risk of loss in the event a claim is made under the policy. The percentage of the premium retained by an agent varies from region to region and is sometimes regulated by the states. The title insurance company is obligated to pay title claims in accordance with the terms of its policies, regardless of whether the title insurance company issues policies through its direct operations or through independent agents. 

&#160; Prior to issuing policies, title insurers and their agents attempt to reduce the risk of future claim losses by accurately performing title searches and examinations. A title insurance company&#8217;s predominant expense relates to such searches and examinations, the preparation of preliminary title reports, policies or commitments, the maintenance of "title plants,&#8221; which are indexed compilations of public records, maps and other relevant historical documents, and the facilitation and closing of real estate transactions. Claim losses generally result from errors made in the title search and examination process, from hidden defects such as fraud, forgery, incapacity, or missing heirs of the property, and from closing related errors. 

Residential real estate business results from the construction, sale, resale and refinancing of residential properties, while commercial real estate business results from similar activities with respect to properties with a business or commercial use. Commercial real estate title insurance policies insure title to commercial real property, and generally involve higher coverage amounts and yield higher premiums. Residential real estate transaction volume is primarily affected by macroeconomic and seasonal factors while commercial real estate transaction volume is affected primarily by fluctuations in local supply and demand conditions for commercial space. 

Direct and Agency Operations. We provide title insurance services through our direct operations and through independent title insurance agents who issue title policies on behalf of our title insurance companies. Our title insurance companies determine the terms and conditions upon which they will insure title to the real property according to our underwriting standards, policies and procedures. 

Direct Operations. In our direct operations, the title insurer issues the title insurance policy and retains the entire premium paid in connection with the transaction. Our direct operations provide the following benefits: 

&#8226; 

higher margins because we retain the entire premium from each transaction instead of paying a commission to an independent agent; 

&#8226; 

continuity of service levels to a broad range of customers; and 

&#8226; 

additional sources of income through escrow and closing services. 

We have approximately 1,200 &#32;offices throughout the U.S. primarily providing residential real estate title insurance. We continuously monitor the number of direct offices to make sure that it remains in line with our strategy and the current economic environment. Our commercial real estate title insurance business is operated almost exclusively through our direct operations. We maintain direct operations for our commercial title insurance business in all the major real estate markets including Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Seattle and Washington D.C. 

&#32;6 

Agency Operations. In our agency operations, the search and examination function is performed by an independent agent or the agent may purchase the search and examination from us. In either case, the agent is responsible to ensure that the search and examination is completed. The agent thus retains the majority of the title premium collected, with the balance remitted to the title underwriter for bearing the risk of loss in the event that a claim is made under the title insurance policy. Independent agents may select among several title underwriters based upon their relationship with the underwriter, the amount of the premium &#8220;split&#8221; offered by the underwriter, the overall terms and conditions of the agency agreement and the scope of services offered to the agent. Premium splits vary by geographic region, and in some states are fixed by insurance regulatory requirements. Our relationship with each agent is governed by an agency agreement defining how the agent issues a title insurance policy on our behalf. The agency agreement also sets forth the agent&#8217;s liability to us for policy losses attributable to the agent&#8217;s errors. An agency agreement is usually terminable without cause upon 30 days notice or immediately for cause. In determining whether to engage or retain an independent agent, we consider the agent&#8217;s experience, financial condition and loss history. For each agent with whom we enter into an agency agreement, we maintain financial and loss experience records. We also conduct periodic audits of our agents and strategically manage the number of agents with which we transact business in an effort to reduce future expenses and manage risks. As of December 31, 2015 , we transact business with approximately 5,000 &#32;agents. 

&#160; Fees and Premiums. One method of analyzing our business is to examine the level of premiums generated by direct and agency operations. 

The following table presents the percentages of our title insurance premiums generated by direct and agency operations:

The premium for title insurance is due in full when the real estate transaction is closed. We recognize title insurance premium revenues from direct operations upon the closing of the transaction, whereas premium revenues from agency operations include an accrual based on estimates of the volume of transactions that have closed in a particular period for which premiums have not yet been reported to us. The accrual for agency premiums is necessary because of the lag between the closing of these transactions and the reporting of these policies to us by the agent, and is based on estimates utilizing historical information. 

Escrow, Title-Related and Other Fees. In addition to fees for underwriting title insurance policies, we derive a significant amount of our revenues from escrow and other title-related services including collection and trust activities, trustee sales guarantees, recordings and reconveyances, and home warranty services. The escrow and other services provided by us include all of those typically required in connection with residential and commercial real estate purchases and refinance activities. Escrow, title-related and other fees included in our Title segment represented approximately &#32;31.2% , 32.8%, and 27.1% of our revenues in &#32; 2015 , &#32; 2014 , and &#32; 2013 , respectively. 

Sales and Marketing. &#32; We market and distribute our title and escrow products and services to customers in the residential and commercial market sectors of the real estate industry through customer solicitation by sales personnel. Although in many instances the individual homeowner is the beneficiary of a title insurance policy, we do not focus our marketing efforts on the homeowner. We actively encourage our sales personnel to develop new business relationships with persons in the real estate community, such as real estate sales agents and brokers, financial institutions, independent escrow companies and title agents, real estate developers, mortgage brokers and attorneys who order title insurance policies for their clients. While our smaller, local clients remain important, large customers, such as national residential mortgage lenders, real estate investment trusts and developers are an important part of our business. The buying criteria of locally based clients differ from those of large, geographically diverse customers in that the former tend to emphasize personal relationships and ease of transaction execution, while the latter generally place more emphasis on consistent product delivery across diverse geographical regions and the ability of service providers to meet their information systems requirements for electronic product delivery. 

Claims. An important part of our operations is the handling of title and escrow claims. We employ a large staff of attorneys in our claims department. Our claims processing centers are located in Omaha, Nebraska and Jacksonville, Florida. In-house claims counsel are also located in other parts of the country. 

Claims result from a wide range of causes. These causes generally include, but are not limited to, search and exam errors, forgeries, incorrect legal descriptions, signature and notary errors, unrecorded liens, mechanics&#8217; liens, the failure to pay off existing liens, mortgage lending fraud, mishandling or theft of settlement funds (including independent agency theft), and mistakes in the escrow process. Under our policies, we are required to defend insureds when covered claims are filed against their interest in the property. Some claimants seek damages in excess of policy limits. Those claims are based on various legal theories, including in 

&#32;7 

some cases allegations of negligence or an intentional tort. We occasionally incur losses in excess of policy limits. Experience shows that most policy claims and claim payments are made in the first five years after the policy has been issued, although claims may also be reported and paid many years later. 

Title losses due to independent agency defalcations typically occur when the independent agency misappropriates funds from escrow accounts under its control. Such losses are usually discovered when the independent agency fails to pay off an outstanding mortgage loan at closing (or immediately thereafter) from the proceeds of the new loan. Once the previous lender determines that its loan has not been paid off timely, it will file a claim against the title insurer. 

Claims can be complex, vary greatly in dollar amounts and are affected by economic and market conditions and the legal environment existing at the time claims are processed. In our commercial title business, we may issue polices with face amounts well in excess of $100 million, and from time to time claims are submitted with respect to large policies. We believe we are appropriately reserved with respect to all claims (large and small) that we currently face. Occasionally we experience large losses from title policies that have been issued or from our escrow operations, or overall worsening loss payment experience, which require us to increase our title loss reserves. These events are unpredictable and adversely affect our earnings. Claims can result in litigation in which we may represent our insured and/or ourselves. We consider this type of litigation to be an ordinary course aspect of the conduct of our business. 

Reinsurance and Coinsurance. &#160; We limit our maximum loss exposure by reinsuring risks with other insurers under excess of loss and case-by-case (&#8220;facultative&#8221;) reinsurance agreements. Reinsurance agreements generally provide that the reinsurer is liable for loss and loss adjustment expense payments exceeding the amount retained by the ceding company. However, the ceding company remains primarily liable to the insured whether or not the reinsurer is able to meet its contractual obligations. Facultative reinsurance agreements are entered into with other title insurers when the transaction to be insured will exceed state statutory or self-imposed limits. Excess of loss reinsurance coverage protects us from a large loss from a single loss occurrence. Through &#32; February 23, 2016 , our excess of loss reinsurance coverage is split into two tiers. &#32; The first tier provides coverage for residential and commercial transactions up to $100 million per loss occurrence, subject to a $20 million retention per loss occurrence. The second tier provides additional coverage for commercial transactions in excess of $100 million of loss per occurrence up to $400 million per loss occurrence, with the Company participating at approximately 10%. We have not yet finalized the terms and conditions of our 2016 - 2017 coverages, but do not expect there to be substantial changes in the terms and conditions. 

&#160; In addition to reinsurance, we carry errors and omissions insurance and fidelity bond coverage, each of which can provide protection to us in the event of certain types of losses that can occur in our businesses. 

Our policy is to be selective in choosing our reinsurers, seeking only those companies that we consider to be financially stable and adequately capitalized. In an effort to minimize exposure to the insolvency of a reinsurer, we periodically review the financial condition of our reinsurers. 

We also use coinsurance in our commercial title business to provide coverage in amounts greater than we would be willing or able to provide individually. In coinsurance transactions, each individual underwriting company issues a separate policy and assumes a portion of the overall total risk. As a coinsurer we are only liable for the portion of the risk we assume. 

We also earn a small amount of additional income, which is reflected in our direct premiums, by assuming reinsurance for certain risks of other title insurers. 

Competition. &#32; &#160; Competition in the title insurance industry is based primarily on expertise, service and price. In addition, the financial strength of the insurer has become an increasingly important factor in decisions relating to the purchase of title insurance, particularly in multi-state transactions and in situations involving real estate-related investment vehicles such as real estate investment trusts and real estate mortgage investment conduits. The number and size of competing companies varies in the different geographic areas in which we conduct our business. In our principal markets, competitors include other major title underwriters such as First American Financial Corporation, Old Republic International Corporation and Stewart Information Services Corporation, as well as numerous smaller title insurance companies, underwritten title companies and independent agency operations at the regional and local level. As a result of the significant decrease in the real estate market from 2008 through 2012, several of our smaller competitors closed their operations. The addition or removal of regulatory barriers might result in changes to competition in the title insurance business. New competitors may include diversified financial services companies that have greater financial resources than we do and possess other competitive advantages. Competition among the major title insurance companies, expansion by smaller regional companies and any new entrants with alternative products could affect our business operations and financial condition. 

&#160; Regulation. &#32; Our insurance subsidiaries, including title insurers, underwritten title companies and insurance agencies, are subject to extensive regulation under applicable state laws. Each of the insurers is subject to a holding company act in its state of domicile, which regulates, among other matters, the ability to pay dividends and enter into transactions with affiliates. The laws of most states in which we transact business establish supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers relating to issuing and revoking licenses to transact business, regulating trade practices, licensing agents, approving policy forms, accounting practices, financial practices, establishing reserve and capital and surplus as regards policyholders (&#8220;capital and surplus&#8221;) requirements, 

&#32;8 

defining suitable investments for reserves and capital and surplus and approving rate schedules. The process of state regulation of changes in rates ranges from states which set rates, to states where individual companies or associations of companies prepare rate filings which are submitted for approval, to a few states in which rate changes do not need to be filed for approval. 

Since we are governed by both state and federal governments and the applicable insurance laws and regulations are constantly subject to change, it is not possible to predict the potential effects on our insurance operations of any laws or regulations that may become more restrictive in the future or if new restrictive laws will be enacted. 

&#160; Pursuant to statutory accounting requirements of the various states in which our title insurers are domiciled, these insurers must defer a portion of premiums as an unearned premium reserve for the protection of policyholders (in addition to their reserves for known claims) and must maintain qualified assets in an amount equal to the statutory requirements. The level of unearned premium reserve required to be maintained at any time is determined by a statutory formula based upon either the age, number of policies, and dollar amount of policy liabilities underwritten, or the age and dollar amount of statutory premiums written. As of &#32; December 31, 2015 , the combined statutory unearned premium reserve required and reported for our title insurers was &#32; $ 1,728 million. &#32; In addition to statutory unearned premium reserves and reserves for known claims, each of our insurers maintains surplus funds for policyholder protection and business operations. 

Each of our insurance subsidiaries is regulated by the insurance regulatory authority in its respective state of domicile, as well as that of each state in which it is licensed. The insurance commissioners of their respective states of domicile are the primary regulators of our insurance subsidiaries. Each of the insurers is subject to periodic regulatory financial examination by regulatory authorities. 

Under the statutes governing insurance holding companies in most states, insurers may not enter into certain transactions, including sales, reinsurance agreements and service or management contracts, with their affiliates unless the regulatory authority of the insurer&#8217;s state of domicile has received notice at least 30 days prior to the intended effective date of such transaction and has not objected to, or has approved, the transaction within the 30-day period. 

In addition to state-level regulation, segments of our FNF core businesses are subject to regulation by federal agencies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;). The CFPB was established under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 ("Dodd-Frank") which also included regulation over financial services and other lending related businesses including Black Knight. The CFPB has been given broad authority to regulate, among other areas, the mortgage and real estate markets in matters pertaining to consumers. This authority includes the enforcement of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act formerly placed with the Department of Housing and Urban Development. On July 9, 2012, the CFPB introduced a number of proposed rules related to the enforcement of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and the Truth in Lending Act, including, among others, measures designed to (i) simplify financing documentation and (ii) require lenders to deliver to consumers a statement of final financing charges (and the related annual percentage rate) at least three business days prior to the closing. These rules became effective on January 10, 2014. 

On November 20, 2013, the CFPB issued additional rules regarding mortgage forms and other mortgage related disclosures with the intent to provide "easier-to-use" mortgage disclosure forms for the consumer. The additional disclosure requirements require participants in the mortgage market, including us, to make significant changes to the manner in which they create, process, and deliver certain disclosures to consumers in connection with mortgage loan applications. The additional disclosures are effective for mortgage loan applications made on or after October 3, 2015. The main provisions of the additional disclosures include amending Regulation Z (the Truth in Lending Act) and Regulation X (Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act) (collectively, the &#8220;TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure" or "TRID&#8221;) to consolidate existing loan disclosures under TILA and RESPA for closed-end credit transactions secured by real property. TRID will require (i) timely delivery of a loan estimate upon receipt a consumer&#8217;s application and (ii) timely delivery of a closing disclosure prior to consummation. TRID will also impose certain restrictions, including the prohibition of imposing fees prior to provision of an estimate and the prohibition of providing estimates prior to a consumer&#8217;s submission of verifying documents. These changes could lead to lower mortgage volumes and/or delays in mortgage processing, particularly in the early stages of implementation. We do not believe the changes will have a significant effect on long term mortgage volumes, but could have the effect of delaying mortgage closings to 2016 that absent the rule may have closed in 2015. We do not anticipate this having a material impact on our current year results from operations. 

Readiness for and compliance with TRID required extensive planning; changes to systems, forms and processes; as well as heightened coordination among market participants. Although there can be no assurance that FNF, its agents or other market participants will be successful in their implementation efforts, we have reviewed the new requirements, and reviewed and updated our policies, procedures and technology resources as appropriate. It is our experience that mortgage lenders have become more focused on the risk of non-compliance with these evolving regulations and are focused on technologies and solutions that help them to comply with the increased regulatory oversight and burdens. Black Knight has developed solutions that target this need, which has resulted in additional revenue at Black Knight. 

&#160; As a holding company with no significant business operations of our own, we depend on dividends or other distributions from our subsidiaries as the principal source of cash to meet our obligations, including the payment of interest on and repayment of 

&#32;9 

principal of any debt obligations, and to pay any dividends to our shareholders. The payment of dividends or other distributions to us by our insurers is regulated by the insurance laws and regulations of their respective states of domicile. In general, an insurance company subsidiary may not pay an &#8220;extraordinary&#8221; dividend or distribution unless the applicable insurance regulator has received notice of the intended payment at least 30 days prior to payment and has not objected to or has approved the payment within the 30-day period. In general, an &#8220;extraordinary&#8221; dividend or distribution is statutorily defined as a dividend or distribution that, together with other dividends and distributions made within the preceding 12 months, exceeds the greater of: 

&#8226; 

10% of the insurer&#8217;s statutory surplus as of the immediately prior year end; or 

&#8226; 

the statutory net income of the insurer during the prior calendar year. 

The laws and regulations of some jurisdictions also prohibit an insurer from declaring or paying a dividend except out of its earned surplus or require the insurer to obtain prior regulatory approval. During &#32; 2016 , our directly owned title insurers can pay dividends or make distributions to us of approximately &#32;$ 334 million; h owever, insurance regulators have the authority to prohibit the payment of ordinary dividends or other payments by our title insurers to us (such as a payment under a tax sharing agreement or for other services) if they determine that such payment could be adverse to our policyholders. There are no restrictions on our retained earnings regarding our ability to pay dividends to shareholders. 

The combined statutory capital and surplus of our title insurers was approximately &#32;$ 1,412 million and $ 1,472 million as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. The combined statutory earnings of our title insurers were $ 381 million, $ 276 million, and $ 352 million for the years ended &#32; December 31, 2015 , &#32; 2014 , and &#32; 2013 , respectively. 

As a condition to continued authority to underwrite policies in the states in which our insurers conduct their business, they are required to pay certain fees and file information regarding their officers, directors and financial condition. 

&#160; Pursuant to statutory requirements of the various states in which our insurers are domiciled, such insurers must maintain certain levels of minimum capital and surplus. Required levels of minimum capital and surplus are not significant to the insurers individually or in the aggregate. Each of our insurers has complied with the minimum statutory requirements as of &#32; December 31, 2015 . 

&#160; Our underwritten title companies are also subject to certain regulation by insurance regulatory or banking authorities, primarily relating to minimum net worth. Minimum net worth requirements for each underwritten title company is less than $1 million. These companies were in compliance with their respective minimum net worth requirements at &#32; December 31, 2015 . 

&#160; From time to time we receive inquiries and requests for information from state insurance departments, attorneys general and other regulatory agencies about various matters relating to our business. Sometimes these take the form of civil investigative demands or subpoenas. We cooperate with all such inquiries and we have responded to or are currently responding to inquiries from multiple governmental agencies. Also, regulators and courts have been dealing with issues arising from foreclosures and related processes and documentation. Various governmental entities are studying the title insurance product, market, pricing, and business practices, and potential regulatory and legislative changes, which may materially affect our business and operations. From time to time, we are assessed fines for violations of regulations or other matters or enter into settlements with such authorities which may require us to pay fines or claims or take other actions. &#32; For further discussion, see item 3, Legal Proceedings. 

Before a person can acquire control of a U.S. insurance company, prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance commissioner of the state in which the insurer is domiciled. Prior to granting approval of an application to acquire control of a domestic insurer, the state insurance commissioner will consider such factors as the financial strength of the applicant, the integrity and management of the applicant&#8217;s Board of Directors and executive officers, the acquirer&#8217;s plans for the insurer&#8217;s Board of Directors and executive officers, the acquirer&#8217;s plans for the future operations of the domestic insurer and any anti-competitive results that may arise from the consummation of the acquisition of control. Generally, state statutes provide that control over a domestic insurer is presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote, or holds proxies representing 10% or more of the voting securities of the domestic insurer. Because a person acquiring 10% or more of our common shares would indirectly control the same percentage of the stock of our insurers, the insurance change of control laws would likely apply to such a transaction. 

&#160; The National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") has adopted an instruction requiring an annual certification of reserve adequacy by a qualified actuary. Because all of the states in which our title insurers are domiciled require adherence to NAIC filing procedures, each such insurer, unless it qualifies for an exemption, must file an actuarial opinion with respect to the adequacy of its reserves. 

&#160;

Title Insurance Ratings 

Our title insurance underwriters are regularly assigned ratings by independent agencies designed to indicate their financial condition and/or claims paying ability. The rating agencies determine ratings by quantitatively and qualitatively analyzing financial data and other information. Our title subsidiaries include Alamo Title, Chicago Title, Commonwealth Land Title, Fidelity National Title and National Title of New York. Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s Ratings Group (&#8220;S&#38;P&#8221;), Moody&#8217;s Investors Service (&#8220;Moody&#8217;s&#8221;), and A. M. Best Company ("A.M. Best") provide ratings for the entire FNF family of companies as a whole as follows:

The relative position of each of our ratings among the ratings scale assigned by each rating agency is as follows: 

&#8226; 

An S&#38;P "A" rating is the third highest rating of 11 ratings for S&#38;P. S&#38;P states that an &#8220;A&#8221; rating means that, in its opinion, the insurer has strong financial security characteristics. 

&#8226; 

A Moody's "A3" rating is the third highest rating of 9 ratings for Moody's. Moody's states that insurance companies rated &#8220;A3&#8221; offer good financial security. 

&#8226; 

An A.M. Best "A" rating is the third highest rating of 18 ratings for A.M. Best. A.M. Best states that its &#8220;A (Excellent)&#8221; rating is assigned to those companies that have, in its opinion, an excellent ability to meet their ongoing obligations to policyholders. 

Demotech provides financial strength/stability ratings for each of our principal title insurance underwriters individually, as follows: &#160; Alamo Title Insurance 

A' 

Chicago Title Insurance Company 

A'' 

Commonwealth Land Title Insurance Company 

A' 

Fidelity National Title Insurance Company 

A' 

National Title Insurance of New York 

A' 

&#160; Demotech states that its ratings of "A"(A double prime)" and "A' (A prime)" reflect its opinion that, regardless of the severity of a general economic downturn or deterioration in the insurance cycle, the insurers assigned either of those ratings possess "Unsurpassed" financial stability related to maintaining positive surplus as regards policyholders. The "A'' (A double prime)" and "A' (A prime)" ratings are the two highest ratings of Demotech's five ratings. 

The ratings of S&#38;P, Moody&#8217;s, A.M. Best, and Demotech described above are not designed to be, and do not serve as, measures of protection or valuation offered to investors. These financial strength ratings should not be relied on with respect to making an investment in our securities. See &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors &#32;&#8212; If the rating agencies downgrade our Company, our results of operations and competitive position in the title insurance industry may suffer&#8221; for further information. 

Black Knight 

Our Black Knight segment offers technology and data and analytics services through leading software systems and information solutions that facilitate and automate many of the business processes across the life cycle of a mortgage. Our customers use our technology and services to reduce their operating costs, improve their customer service and enhance the quality and consistency of various aspects of their mortgage servicing. We continually work with our customers to customize and integrate our software and services in order to assist them in achieving the value proposition that we offer to them. 

Our principal technology solutions are software applications provided to mortgage lenders and other lending institutions, together with related support and services. Our technology solutions primarily consist of mortgage processing and workflow management software applications. The long term nature of most of our contracts in this business provides us with substantial recurring revenues. Our revenues from servicing technology are generally based on the number of active mortgages on our mortgage servicing platform in a given period. Our other technology solutions include our origination and default technology, from which we generally earn revenues on a per transaction basis. Our data and analytics offerings primarily consist of our alternative valuation services, real estate and mortgage data, modeling and forecasting and analytical tools. 

The U.S. mortgage market has seen significant change over the past few years and is expected to continue to evolve going forward. Increased origination volatility and key regulatory actions arising from the recent financial crisis, such as the Dodd-Frank Act and the establishment of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the "CFPB"), impose new and evolving standards for market participants. These regulatory changes have spurred lenders and servicers to seek technology solutions that facilitate compliance obligations in the face of a changing regulatory environment while remaining efficient and profitable. 

&#32;11 

The current market conditions for Black Knight's services include the following: 

&#32;Increased regulation . Most U.S. mortgage market participants have become subject to increasing regulatory oversight and regulatory requirements as federal and state governments have enacted various new laws, rules and regulations. One example of such legislation is the Dodd-Frank Act, which contains broad changes for many sectors of the financial services and lending industries and established the CFPB, a new federal regulatory agency responsible for regulating consumer financial protection within the United States. It is our experience that mortgage lenders have become more focused on minimizing the risk of non-compliance with these evolving regulations and are looking towards technologies and solutions that help them to comply with the increased regulatory oversight and burdens. 

Lenders increasingly focused on core operations . As a result of greater regulatory scrutiny and the higher cost of doing business, we believe lenders have become more focused on their core operations and customers. We believe lenders are increasingly shifting from in-house technologies to solutions with third-party providers who can provide better technology and services more efficiently. Lenders require these vendors to provide best-in-class technology and deep domain expertise and to assist them in maintaining regulatory compliance. 

&#32; Growing role of technology in the U.S. mortgage industry . Banks and other lenders and servicers have become increasingly focused on technology automation and workflow management to operate more efficiently and meet their regulatory guidelines. We believe that vendors must be able to support the complexity in the market, display extensive industry knowledge and possess the financial resources to make the necessary investments in technology to support lenders. 

&#32;Increased demand for enhanced transparency and analytic insight . As U.S. mortgage market participants work to minimize the risk in lending, servicing and capital markets, they increasingly rely on data and analytics to integrate with technologies that enhance the decision making process. These industry participants rely on large comprehensive third party databases coupled with enhanced analytics to achieve these goals. 

Intellectual Property 

We rely on a combination of contractual restrictions, internal security practices, and copyright and trade secret law to establish and protect our software, technology, and expertise across our businesses. Further, we have developed a number of brands that have accumulated substantial goodwill in the marketplace, and we rely on trademark law to protect our rights in that area. We intend to continue our policy of taking all measures we deem necessary to protect our copyright, trade secret, and trademark rights. These legal protections and arrangements afford only limited protection of our proprietary rights, and there is no assurance that our competitors will not independently develop or license products, services, or capabilities that are substantially equivalent or superior to ours. 

Technology and Research and Development 

Title Business 

&#160; As a national provider of real estate transaction products and services, we participate in an industry that is subject to significant regulatory requirements, frequent new product and service introductions, and evolving industry standards. We believe that our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate industry changes and offer products and services that meet evolving industry standards. In connection with our title segment service offerings, we are continuing to deploy new information system technologies to our direct and agency operations. We continue to improve the process of ordering title and escrow services and improve the delivery of our products to our customers. In order to meet new regulatory requirements, we also continue to expand our data collection and reporting abilities. &#32; We have made enhancements to certain of our systems to comply with the CFPB&#8217;s Integrated Mortgage Disclosure rules that went into effect on October 3, 2015. See further discussion of the new rules in Item 7. &#32; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#32;- Business Trends and Conditions. 

Black Knight 

Black Knight's technology and research and development activities relate primarily to the design, development and enhancement of our processing systems and related software applications. We expect to continue our practice of investing an appropriate level of resources to maintain, enhance and extend the functionality of our proprietary systems and existing software applications, to develop new and innovative software applications and systems in response to the needs of our clients, and to enhance the capabilities surrounding our infrastructure. We work with our clients to determine the appropriate timing and approach to introducing technology or infrastructure changes to our applications and services. We have made enhancements to certain of our systems to comply with the CFPB's Integrated Mortgage Disclosure rules that went into effect on October 3, 2015. See further discussion of the new rules in Item 7. &#32; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#32;- Business Trends and Conditions. 

Investment Policies and Investment Portfolio 

&#160; Our investment policy is designed to maximize total return through investment income and capital appreciation consistent with moderate risk of principal, while providing adequate liquidity. Our insurance subsidiaries, including title insurers, underwritten 

&#32;12 

title companies and insurance agencies, are subject to extensive regulation under applicable state laws. The various states in which we operate our underwriters regulate the types of assets that qualify for purposes of capital, surplus, and statutory unearned premium reserves. Our investment policy specifically limits duration and non-investment grade allocations in the FNF core fixed-income portfolio. Maintaining shorter durations on the investment portfolio allows for the mitigation of interest rate risk. Equity securities and preferred stock are utilized to take advantage of perceived value or for strategic purposes. Due to the magnitude of the investment portfolio in relation to our claims loss reserves, durations of investments are not specifically matched to the cash outflows required to pay claims. 

As of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , the carrying amount of total investments, which approximates the fair value, excluding investments in unconsolidated affiliates, was $ 4.3 billion and $ 3.9 billion, respectively. 

&#160; We purchase investment grade fixed maturity securities, selected non-investment grade fixed maturity securities, preferred stock and equity securities. The securities in our portfolio are subject to economic conditions and normal market risks and uncertainties. &#160; 

The following table presents certain information regarding the investment ratings of our fixed maturity &#32; securities and preferred stock portfolio at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 :

At December 31, 2015 , all of our mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities are rated AAA by Moody's. The mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities are made up of $ 49 million of agency-backed mortgage-backed securities, $ 8 million of agency-backed collateralized mortgage obligations, and $ 14 million in asset-backed securities. 

&#160; Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because certain borrowers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. Because of the potential for prepayment on mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, they are not categorized by contractual maturity. &#32; 

Our equity securities at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;consisted of investments with a cost basis of $ 276 million and $ 72 million , respectively, and fair value of $ 345 million &#32;and $ 145 million , respectively. 

&#32;13 

At December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , we also held $ 521 million and $ 770 million, respectively, in investments that are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, principally our ownership interests in Ceridian. 

&#160; As of &#32; December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , other long-term investments included investments accounted for using the cost method of accounting of $ 74 million and $ 144 million, as of &#32; December 31, 2015 &#32; and &#32; 2014 , respectively. 

&#160; Short-term investments, which consist primarily of commercial paper and money market instruments which have an original maturity of one year or less, are carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. As of &#32; December 31, 2015 &#32; and &#32; 2014 , short-term investments amounted to $ 1,034 million and $ 334 million, respectively. 

Our investment results for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;were as follows:

Geographic Operations 

Our direct title operations are divided into approximately 150 &#32;profit centers. Each profit center processes title insurance transactions within its geographical area, which is usually identified by a county, a group of counties forming a region, or a state, depending on the management structure in that part of the country. We also transact title insurance business through a network of approximately 5,000 &#32;agents, primarily in those areas in which agents are the more prevalent title insurance provider. Substantially all of our revenues are generated in the United States. 

The following table sets forth the approximate dollar and percentage volumes of our title insurance premium revenue by state:

&#160; Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information 

&#160; The statements contained in this Form 10-K or in our other documents or in oral presentations or other statements made by our management that are not purely historical are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including statements regarding our expectations, hopes, intentions, or strategies regarding the future. These statements relate to, among other things, future financial and operating results of the Company. In many cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;expect,&#8221; &#8220;plan,&#8221; &#8220;anticipate,&#8221; &#8220;believe,&#8221; &#8220;estimate,&#8221; &#8220;predict,&#8221; &#8220;potential,&#8221; or &#8220;continue,&#8221; or the negative of these terms and other comparable terminology. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these statements as a result of a number of factors, including, but not limited to the following: 

&#8226; 

changes in general economic, business, and political conditions, including changes in the financial markets; 

&#8226; 

the severity of our title insurance claims; 

&#8226; 

downgrade of our credit rating by rating agencies; 

&#8226; 

adverse changes in the level of real estate activity, which may be caused by, among other things, high or increasing interest rates, a limited supply of mortgage funding, increased mortgage defaults, or a weak U.S. economy; 

&#8226; 

compliance with extensive government regulation of our operating subsidiaries and adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations or in their application by regulators; 

&#8226; 

regulatory investigations of the title insurance industry; 

&#8226; 

loss of key personnel that could negatively affect our financial results and impair our operating abilities; 

&#8226; 

our business concentration in the States of California and Texas are the source of approximately 15.1% &#32;and 14.4% , respectively, of our title insurance premiums; 

&#8226; 

our potential inability to find suitable acquisition candidates, as well as the risks associated with acquisitions in lines of business that will not necessarily be limited to our traditional areas of focus, or difficulties integrating acquisitions; 

&#8226; 

our dependence on distributions from our title insurance underwriters as our main source of cash flow; 

&#8226; 

competition from other title insurance companies; and 

&#8226; 

other risks detailed in "Risk Factors" below and elsewhere in this document and in our other filings with the SEC. 

&#160; We are not under any obligation (and expressly disclaim any such obligation) to update or alter our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You should carefully consider the possibility that actual results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements.
