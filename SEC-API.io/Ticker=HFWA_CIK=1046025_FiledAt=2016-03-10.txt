 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

General 

Heritage Financial Corporation (the &#8220;Company&#8221; or "Heritage") is a bank holding company that was incorporated in the State of Washington in August 1997. We were organized for the purpose of acquiring all of the capital stock of Heritage Savings Bank upon our reorganization from the mutual holding company form of organization to the stock holding company form of organization. Effective September 1, 2004, Heritage Savings Bank switched its charter from a state chartered savings bank to a state chartered commercial bank and changed its legal name from Heritage Savings Bank to Heritage Bank (the "Bank"). The Company acquired Central Valley Bank in March 1999 and changed its charter from a nationally chartered commercial bank to a state chartered commercial bank effective September 1, 2005. In 1998, the Company acquired North Pacific Bank. In June 2006, the Company completed the acquisition of Western Washington Bancorp and its wholly owned subsidiary, Washington State Bank, N.A., at which time Washington State Bank, N.A. was merged into Heritage Bank. 

Effective July 30, 2010, Heritage Bank entered into a definitive agreement with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the &#8220;FDIC&#8221;), pursuant to which Heritage Bank acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of Cowlitz Bank, a Washington state-chartered commercial bank headquartered in Longview, Washington (the &#8220;Cowlitz Acquisition&#8221;). The Cowlitz Acquisition included nine branches of Cowlitz Bank, including its division Bay Bank, which opened as branches of Heritage Bank on August 2, 2010. The acquisition also included the Trust Services Division of Cowlitz Bank. In 2013, the Company consolidated three of these branches into existing Heritage Bank branches. Effective November 5, 2010, Heritage Bank entered into a definitive agreement with the FDIC, pursuant to which Heritage Bank acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of Pierce Commercial Bank, a Washington state-chartered commercial bank headquartered in Tacoma, Washington (the &#8220;Pierce Acquisition&#8221;). The Pierce Acquisition included one branch, which opened as a branch of Heritage Bank on November 8, 2010. 

On September 14, 2012, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement along with Heritage Bank, to acquire Northwest Commercial Bank (&#8220;NCB&#8221;), a full service commercial bank headquartered in Lakewood, Washington that operated two branch locations in Washington State (the &#8220;NCB Acquisition&#8221;). The NCB Acquisition was completed on January 9, 2013, at which time NCB was merged with and into Heritage Bank. The Lakewood branch was subsequently consolidated with an existing Heritage Bank branch in 2013. 

On March 11, 2013, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Valley Community Bancshares, Inc. ("Valley" or "Valley Community Bancshares") and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Valley Bank, both headquartered in Puyallup, Washington (the &#8220;Valley Acquisition&#8221;) and its eight branches. The Valley Acquisition was completed on July 15, 2013. Subsequently, four of these branches were consolidated into existing Heritage Bank branches as of December 31, 2013. 

On April 8, 2013, the Company announced the proposed merger of its two wholly-owned bank subsidiaries Central Valley Bank and Heritage Bank, with Central Valley Bank merging into Heritage Bank (the "Central Valley Merger"). The common control merger was completed on June 19, 2013. Central Valley Bank now operates as a division of Heritage Bank. 

On October 23, 2013, the Company, the Bank, Washington Banking Company (&#8220;Washington Banking&#8221;) and its wholly owned subsidiary bank, Whidbey Island Bank ("Whidbey"), jointly announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement pursuant to which Heritage and Washington Banking entered into a strategic merger with Washington Banking merging into Heritage (the "Washington Banking Merger"). Washington Banking branches adopted the Heritage Bank name in all markets, with the exception of six branches in Whidbey Island markets which continue to operate using the Whidbey Island Bank name. The Washington Banking Merger was completed on May 1, 2014. 

For additional information on the merger and acquisitions completed during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, see Note (2) Business Combinations of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." 

We are primarily engaged in the business of planning, directing, and coordinating the business activities of our wholly owned subsidiary, Heritage Bank.

Lending Activities 

General . Lending activities are conducted through Heritage Bank. Our focus is on commercial business lending. We also originate consumer loans, real estate construction and land development loans and one-to-four family residential loans. Our loans are originated under policies that are reviewed and approved annually by our Board of Directors. In addition, we have established internal lending guidelines that are updated as needed.

We conduct post-approval reviews on selected loans and routinely perform internal loan reviews of our loan portfolio to check for credit quality, proper documentation and compliance with laws and regulations. 

The Company has acquired loans through mergers and acquisitions, which are designated as "purchased" loans. Prior to August 2015, certain purchased loans were covered under FDIC shared-loss agreements and were identified as "covered". The Company and the FDIC terminated the FDIC shared-loss agreements effective August 4, 2015.

Commercial Business Lending 

We offer different types of commercial business loans, including lines of credit, term equipment financing and term owner-occupied and non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans. We also originate loans that are guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (&#8220;SBA&#8221;), for which Heritage Bank is a &#8220;preferred lender.&#8221; Before extending credit to a business, we review and analyze the borrower&#8217;s management ability, financial history, including cash flow of the borrower and all guarantors, and the liquidation value of the collateral. Emphasis is placed on having a comprehensive understanding of the borrower&#8217;s global cash flow and performing necessary financial due diligence. 

At December 31, 2015 &#32;we had $1.92 billion , or 80.0% , of our total loans receivable in commercial business loans with an average outstanding loan balance of approximately $374,000 at December 31, 2015, excluding loans with no outstanding balance. 

We originate commercial real estate loans within our primary market areas with a preference for loans secured by owner-occupied properties. Our underwriting standards require that commercial real estate loans not exceed 75% of the lower of appraised value at origination or cost of the underlying collateral. Cash flow coverage to debt servicing requirements is generally a minimum of 1.15 times for five or more family residential loans and 1.25 times for other commercial real estate loans. Cash flow coverage is calculated using an &#8220;underwriting&#8221; interest rate that is higher than the note rate. 

Commercial real estate loans typically involve a greater degree of risk than one-to-four family residential loans. Payments on loans secured by commercial real estate properties are dependent on successful operation and management of the properties and repayment of these loans may be affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. We seek to minimize these risks by determining the financial condition of the borrower, the quality and value of the collateral, and the management of the property securing the loan. We also generally obtain personal guarantees from the owners of the collateral after a thorough review of personal financial statements. In addition, we review our commercial real estate loan portfolio annually for performance of individual loans, and stress-test loans for potential changes in interest rates, occupancy, and collateral values. 

See &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212;Our loan portfolio is concentrated in loans with a higher risk of loss&#8212;Repayment of our commercial business loans, consisting of commercial and industrial loans as well as owner-occupied and non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, is often dependent on the cash flows of the borrower, which may be unpredictable, and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value.&#8221; See also &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212;Our loan portfolio is concentrated in loans with a higher risk of loss&#8212;Our non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, which includes five or more family residential real estate loans, involve higher principal amounts than other loans and repayment of these loans may be dependent on factors outside our control or the control of our borrowers.&#8221; 

One-to-Four Family Residential Loans, Originations and Sales 

The majority of our one-to-four family residential loans are secured by single-family residences located in our primary market areas. Our underwriting standards require that one-to-four family residential loans generally are owner-occupied and do not exceed 80% of the lower of appraised value at origination or cost of the underlying collateral. Terms typically range from 15 to 30 years. 

As part of our asset/liability management strategy, we typically sell a significant portion of our one-to-four family residential loans in the secondary market. See &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Asset/Liability Management.&#8221; We discontinued this strategy in the second quarter of 2013 through the second quarter of 2014, and reinstated the strategy following the completion of the Washington Banking Merger. 

We typically sell the servicing of the sold one-to-four family residential loans, or the collection of principal and interest payments, to other financial institutions. We did not service any of these sold loans as of or for the years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;or 2014 .

Real Estate Construction and Land Development 

We originate one-to-four family residential construction loans for the construction of custom homes (where the home buyer is the borrower). We also provide financing to builders for the construction of pre-sold homes and, in selected cases, to builders for the construction of speculative residential property. Because of the higher risks present in the residential construction industry, our lending to builders is limited to those who have demonstrated a favorable record of performance and who are building in markets that management understands. 

We further endeavor to limit our construction lending risk through adherence to strict underwriting guidelines and procedures. Speculative construction loans are short term in nature and have a variable rate of interest. We require builders to have tangible equity in each construction project and have prompt and thorough documentation of all draw requests, and we inspect the project prior to paying any draw requests. 

See &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212;Our loan portfolio is concentrated in loans with a higher risk of loss&#8212;Our real estate construction and land development loans are based upon estimates of costs and the related value associated with the completed project. These estimates may be inaccurate.&#8221; 

Consumer 

At December 31, 2015, we had $298.2 million &#32;of consumer loans. We originate consumer loans and lines of credit that are both secured and unsecured. The majority of our consumer loans are for relatively small amounts disbursed among many individual borrowers. 

As a result of the Washington Banking Merger, we currently originate indirect consumer loans. These loans are for new and used automobile and recreational vehicles that are originated indirectly by selected dealers located in our market areas. We have limited our indirect loans purchased primarily to dealerships that are established and well known in their market areas and to applicants that are not classified as sub-prime. 

Commitments and Contingent Liabilities 

In the ordinary course of business, we enter into various types of transactions that include commitments to extend credit that are not included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. We apply the same credit standards to these commitments as we use in all our lending activities and have included these commitments in our lending risk evaluations. Our exposure to credit loss under commitments to extend credit is represented by the amount of these commitments. 

The following table presents outstanding commitments to extend credit, including letters of credit, at the dates indicated:

Delinquencies and Nonperforming Assets 

Delinquency Procedures . Delinquencies in the commercial business loan portfolio are handled by the assigned loan officer. Loan officers are responsible for collecting loans they originate or which are assigned to them. We send a borrower a delinquency notice 15 days after the due date when the borrower fails to make a required payment on a loan. If the delinquency is not brought current, additional delinquency notices are mailed at 30 and 45 days for commercial loans. Additional written and oral contacts are made with the borrower between 60 and 90 days after the due date. 

If a real estate loan payment is past due for 45 days or more, the collection manager may perform a review of the condition of the property. Depending on the nature of the loan and the type of collateral securing the loan, we may negotiate and accept a modified payment program with the borrower, accept a voluntary deed in lieu of foreclosure or, when considered necessary, begin foreclosure proceedings. If foreclosed on, real property is generally sold at a public sale and we may bid on the property to protect our interest. A decision as to whether and when to begin foreclosure proceedings is based on such factors as the amount of the outstanding loan relative to the value of the property securing the original indebtedness, the extent of the delinquency, and the borrower&#8217;s ability and willingness to cooperate in resolving the delinquency. 

Real estate acquired by us in partial or full satisfaction of a loan obligation is classified as other real estate owned until it is sold. When property is acquired, it is recorded at the estimated fair value (less costs to sell) at the date of acquisition, not to exceed net realizable value, and any resulting write-down is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Upon acquisition, all costs incurred in maintaining the property are expensed. Costs relating to the development and improvement of the property, however, are capitalized to the extent of the property&#8217;s net realizable value. If the estimated realizable value of the other real estate owned property declines after the acquisition date, the adjustment to the value is charged to other real estate owned expense, net. 

Classification of Loans . Federal regulations require that the Bank periodically evaluates the risks inherent in its loan portfolio. In addition, the Division of Banks of the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions (&#8220;Division&#8221;) and the FDIC have the authority to identify problem loans and, if appropriate, require them to be reclassified. There are three classifications for problem loans: Substandard, Doubtful, and Loss. Substandard loans have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful loans have the weaknesses of Substandard loans, with additional characteristics that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values questionable. There is a high probability of some loss in loans classified as Doubtful. A loan classified as Loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as a loan of the institution is not warranted. If a loan or a portion of the loan is classified as Loss, the institution must charge-off this amount. We also have loans we classify as Watch and Other Assets Especially Mentioned (&#8220;OAEM&#8221;). Loans classified as Watch are performing assets but have elements of risk that require more monitoring than other performing loans. Loans classified as OAEM are assets that continue to perform but have shown deterioration in credit quality and require closer monitoring. 

The Bank routinely tests its problem loans for potential impairment. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect all amounts due according to 

the original contractual terms of the loan agreement. Problem loans that may be impaired are identified using the Bank's normal loan review procedures, which include post-approval reviews, monthly reviews by credit administration of criticized loan reports, scheduled internal reviews, underwriting during extensions and renewals and the analysis of information routinely received on a borrower&#8217;s financial performance. 

Impairment is measured using the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan&#8217;s effective interest rate, unless the loan is collateral dependent, in which case impairment is measured using the fair value of the collateral after deducting appropriate collateral disposition costs. Furthermore, when it is practically expedient, impairment is measured by the fair market price of the loan. 

Subsequent to an initial measure of impairment, if there is a significant change in the amount or timing of a loan&#8217;s expected future cash flows or a change in the value of collateral or market price of a loan, based on new information received, the impairment is recalculated. However, the net carrying value of a loan never exceeds the recorded investment in the loan. 

Nonperforming Assets . Nonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans and other real estate owned. The following table provides information about our nonaccrual loans and other real estate owned for the indicated dates. The following table also includes information regarding our performing troubled-debt restructured ("TDR") loans for the indicated dates. The performing TDR loans are not considered nonperforming assets as they continue to accrue interest despite being considered impaired due to the restructured status.

Nonaccrual Loans . Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting, including the recognition of interest income on our loan portfolio, unless a loan is placed on nonaccrual status. Loans are considered to be impaired and are placed on nonaccrual status when there are serious doubts about the collectability of principal or interest. Our policy is to place a loan on nonaccrual status when the loan becomes past due for 90 days or more, is less than fully collateralized, and is not in the process of collection. Payments received on nonaccrual loans generally are applied first to principal and then to interest only after all principal has been collected. 

Nonaccrual loans decreased $1.9 million &#32;to $9.7 million , or 0.40% &#32;of loans receivable, net, at December 31, 2015 &#32;from $11.6 million , or 0.51% &#32;of loans receivable, net, at December 31, 2014 &#32;due to the loan resolution efforts of our credit department. During the year ended December 31, 2015 , approximately $5.6 million in net principal payments were received on nonaccrual loans and $236,000 of nonaccrual loans were transferred back to accrual status. We also recorded $1.1 million in net charge-offs of nonaccrual loans. The decrease in total nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2015 &#32;was partially offset by $5.0 million in additions to nonperforming loans, of which $1.1 million were previously performing TDR loans that were transferred to nonaccrual status. 

Nonperforming assets decreased $3.2 million &#32;to $11.7 million , or 0.32% &#32;of total assets, at December 31, 2015 &#32;from $14.9 million , or 0.43% &#32;of total assets, at December 31, 2014 &#32;due to the decrease in nonperforming loans discussed above as well as an overall decrease in other real estate owned. Other real estate owned decreased $1.3 million , or 39.8% , to $2.0 million &#32;at December 31, 2015 &#32;from $3.4 million &#32;at December 31, 2014 &#32;due primarily to dispositions of $3.6 million , which were offset partially by additions of $2.8 million &#32;during the year ended December 31, 2015 . 

Performing TDR loans as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and December 31, 2014 &#32;were $20.7 million &#32;and $18.7 million , respectively. The $2.0 million &#32;increase in performing TDR loans during the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;was primarily due to $6.1 million of loans restructured during the year ended December 31, 2015 , offset partially by $3.0 million of net principal reductions and $1.1 million in TDR loans transferred to nonaccrual status. 

Troubled Debt Restructured Loans. A TDR loan is a restructuring in which the Bank, for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower&#8217;s financial difficulties, grants a concession to a borrower that it would not otherwise consider. The majority of the Bank's TDR loans are a result of granting extensions to troubled credits which have already been adversely classified. We grant such extensions to reassess the borrower&#8217;s financial status and develop a plan for repayment. Certain modifications also include interest rate reductions, which is the second most prevalent concession. The interest rate reductions can be for a period of time or over the remainder of the life of the loan. We may also bifurcate troubled credits into a &#8220;good&#8221; loan and a &#8220;bad&#8221; loan, whereas the good loan continues to accrue under the modified terms. We perform bifurcations to limit potential losses. The remainder of the Bank's TDRs are the result of converting revolving lines of credits to amortizing loans, changing amortizing loans to interest-only loans with balloon payments, or re-amortizing the loan over a longer period of time. These modifications would all be considered a concession for a borrower that could not obtain financing outside of the Bank. We do not forgive principal for a majority of our TDRs, but in those situations where principal is forgiven, the entire amount of such principal forgiveness is immediately charged off to the extent not done so prior to the modification. We sometimes delay the timing on the repayment of a portion of principal (principal forbearance) and charge-off the amount of forbearance if that amount is not considered fully collectible. We also consider insignificant delays in payments when determining if a loan should be classified as a TDR. 

TDRs are considered impaired and are separately measured for impairment under Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) 310-10-35, whether on accrual or nonaccrual status. At December 31, 2015 &#32;and December 31, 2014 , the balance of performing TDR loans was $20.7 million &#32;and $18.7 million , respectively. The related allowance for loan losses on the performing TDR loans was $2.1 million &#32;as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and $1.9 million &#32;as of December 31, 2014 . At December 31, 2015 , nonperforming TDR loans were $6.3 million &#32;and had a related allowance for loan losses of $679,000 . At December 31, 2014 , nonperforming TDR loans of $7.3 million &#32;had a related allowance for loan losses of $1.0 million . 

A loan may have the TDR classification removed if (a) the restructured interest rate was greater than or equal to the interest rate of a new loan with comparable risk at the time of the restructure, and (b) the loan is no longer 

impaired based on the terms of the restructured agreement. The Bank's policy is that the borrower must demonstrate six consecutive monthly payments in accordance with the modified loan terms before it can be reviewed for removal of TDR classification under the second criteria. However, the loan must be reported as a TDR in at least one of the Company&#8217;s Annual Reports on Form 10-K. Once a loan has been classified as a TDR, it will continue to be an impaired loan until paid off or charged-off, even if the loan subsequently is no longer a TDR. 

Potential Problem Loans . Potential problem loans are those loans that are currently accruing interest and are not considered impaired, but which we are monitoring because the financial information of the borrower causes us concerns as to their ability to comply with their loan repayment terms. Loans that are past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest are considered potential problem loans if they are both well-secured and in the process of collection. Potential problem loans decreased $52.6 million , or 32.3% , to $110.4 million &#32;at December 31, 2015 &#32;from $162.9 million &#32;at December 31, 2014 &#32;primarily due to loan payments. 

Analysis of Allowance for Loan Losses 

Management maintains an allowance for loan losses (&#8220;ALL&#8221;) to provide for estimated probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio that have been incurred as of the reporting date. The adequacy of the ALL is monitored through our ongoing quarterly loan quality assessments. 

We assess the estimated credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio by considering a number of elements including: 

&#8226; 

Historical loss experience in a number of homogeneous segments of the loan portfolio; 

&#8226; 

Balance of potential problem loans in the loan portfolio; 

&#8226; 

The impact of environmental factors, including: 

&#9642; 

Levels of and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans; 

&#9642; 

Levels of and trends in charge-offs and recoveries; 

&#9642; 

Trends in volume and terms of loans; 

&#9642; 

Effects of changes in risk selection and underwriting standards, and other changes in lending policies, procedures and practices; 

&#9642; 

Experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff; 

&#9642; 

National and local economic trends and conditions; 

&#9642; 

Other external factors such as competition, legal, and regulatory requirements; 

&#9642; 

Effects of changes in credit concentrations; and 

&#9642; 

Other factors 

We calculate an appropriate ALL for the loans in our loan portfolio by applying historical loss factors for homogeneous classes of the portfolio, adjusted for changes to the above-noted environmental factors. We may record specific provisions for impaired loans, including loans on nonaccrual status and TDR loans, after a careful analysis of each loan&#8217;s credit and collateral factors. Our analysis of an appropriate ALL combines the provisions made for our non-impaired loans and the specific provisions made for each impaired loan. 

While we believe we use the best information available to determine the allowance for loan losses, results of operations could be significantly affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in determining the allowance. A decline in local and national economic conditions, or other factors, could result in a material increase in the allowance for loan losses and may adversely affect the Company&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the determination of the amount of the allowance for loan losses is subject to review by bank regulators, as part of their routine examination process, which may result in the establishment of additional allowance allocations based upon their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination. 

The following table provides information regarding changes in our allowance for loan losses at and for the indicated years:

Investment Activities 

At December 31, 2015 , our investment securities portfolio totaled $811.9 million , which consisted entirely of securities available for sale. This compares with a total portfolio of $778.7 million &#32;at December 31, 2014 , which was comprised of $742.8 million &#32;of securities available for sale and $35.8 million &#32;of securities held to maturity. During the year ended December, 31, 2015, the Company transferred investment securities held to maturity with amortized cost of $29.4 million to available for sale to more effectively manage the investment securities portfolio. The $33.2 million , or 4.3% , increase in our investment securities portfolio in fiscal 2015 is attributable primarily to $290.5 million &#32;of purchases of investment securities, offset partially by $124.6 million &#32;in payments, maturities and calls of investment securities available for sale and $116.3 million &#32;in sales of investment securities available for sale. The composition of the investment portfolio by type of security, at each respective date, is presented in Note (3) Investment Securities of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." 

Our investment policy is established by the Board of Directors and monitored by the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors. It is designed primarily to provide and maintain liquidity, generate a favorable return on investments without incurring undue interest rate and credit risk, and complements the Bank's lending activities. The policy dictates the criteria for classifying securities as either available for sale or held to maturity. The policy permits investment in various types of liquid assets permissible under applicable regulations, which include U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. Government agency obligations, some certificates of deposit of insured banks, mortgage backed and mortgage related securities, corporate notes, municipal bonds, and federal funds. Investment in non-investment grade bonds and stripped mortgage backed securities is not permitted under the policy.

The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (&#8220;FHLB&#8221;) of Des Moines following the voluntary merger of the FHLB of Seattle with and into FHLB of Des Moines effective May 31, 2015. The FHLB of Des Moines is one of 11 regional FHLBs that administer the home financing credit function of savings institutions. Each FHLB serves as a reserve or central bank for its member financial institutions within its assigned region. It is funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB System. It makes loans or advances to members in accordance with policies and procedures, established by the Board of Directors of the FHLB, which are subject to the oversight of the Federal Housing Finance Board (&#8220;FHFA&#8221;). 

For membership purposes, the Bank is required to maintain an investment in the stock of the FHLB of Des Moines in an amount equal to 0.12% of the Bank's assets as calculated on an annual basis. At December 31, 2015 &#32;the Bank had an investment in FHLB stock carried at a cost basis (par value) of $4.1 million . In addition to the FHLB stock required for membership, the Bank must purchase activity stock equal to 4.0% of all outstanding borrowing balances. The activity stock is automatically redeemed in amounts equal to the FHLB advance balances as they are repaid. 

Based on the Company&#8217;s evaluation of the underlying investment, including the long-term nature of the investment, the liquidity position of the FHLB of Des Moines, and the Company&#8217;s intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to recover the par value, the Company did not recognize an other-than-temporary impairment loss on its FHLB stock during the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 . Despite no impairment having been recorded during the indicated fiscal years, any deterioration in the FHLB of Des Moines' financial position may result in future impairment losses. 

Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds 

General. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, loan repayments and borrowings. Scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposits and unscheduled loan prepayments, which are influenced significantly by general interest rate levels, interest rates available on other investments, competition, economic conditions and other factors, are not. Customer deposits remain an important source of funding, but these balances have been influenced in the past by adverse market conditions in the industry and may be affected by future developments such as interest rate fluctuations and new competitive pressures. In addition to customer deposits, management may utilize brokered deposits on an as-needed basis. 

Borrowings may also be used on a short-term basis to compensate for reductions in other sources of funds (such as deposit inflows at less than projected levels). Borrowings may also be used on a longer-term basis to support expanded lending activities and match the maturity of repricing intervals of assets. In addition, the Company utilizes repurchase agreements as a supplement to other funding sources. 

During the year ended December 31, 2015 , non-maturity deposits (total deposits less certificate of deposit accounts) increased by $307.0 million , or 12.9% , to $2.69 billion &#32;from $2.38 billion &#32;at December 31, 2014 . The increase was primarily a result of an increase in negotiable order of withdrawal ("NOW") account deposits of $124.5 million , or 15.7% , to $917.9 million &#32;at December 31, 2015 from $793.4 million &#32;at December 31, 2014 and a $96.0 million , or 26.8% , increase in savings deposits to $453.8 million &#32;at December 31, 2015 from $357.8 million &#32;at December 31, 

2014. The percentage of non-maturity deposits to total deposits increased to 86.5% &#32;at December 31, 2015 &#32;compared to 81.9% &#32;at December 31, 2014 . As a result of this increase, the certificate of deposit ("CD") accounts to total deposits decreased to 13.5% &#32;at December 31, 2015 &#32;from 18.1% &#32;at December 31, 2014 . CDs decreased $105.1 million , or 20.0% , to $420.3 million &#32;at December 31, 2015 from $525.4 million &#32;at December 31, 2014. 

Deposit Activities. We offer a variety of deposit accounts designed to attract both short-term and long-term deposits. These accounts include noninterest demand accounts, NOW accounts, money market accounts, savings accounts and CDs. These accounts, with the exception of noninterest demand accounts, generally earn interest at rates established by management based on competitive market factors and management&#8217;s desire to increase or decrease certain types or maturities of deposits. The major categories of deposit accounts are described below. 

Noninterest Demand Deposits. Noninterest demand deposits are noninterest bearing and may be charged service fees based on activity and balances. 

NOW Accounts. NOW accounts are interest bearing and may be charged service fees based on activity and balances. NOW accounts pay interest, but require a higher minimum balance to avoid service charges. 

Money Market Accounts. Money market accounts pay a variable interest rate that is tiered depending on the balance maintained in the account. Minimum opening balances vary. 

Savings Accounts. We offer savings accounts that allow for unlimited deposits and withdrawals, provided that a $300 minimum balance is maintained. 

CDs. We offer several types of CDs with maturities ranging from three months to five years, which require a minimum deposit of $2,500. Negotiable CDs are offered in amounts of $100,000 or more for terms of 30 days to five years.

Borrowings. Deposits are the primary source of funds for our lending and investment activities and our general business purposes. We rely upon advances from the FHLB to supplement our supply of lendable funds and meet deposit withdrawal requirements. The FHLB of Des Moines serves as one of our secondary sources of liquidity. Advances from the FHLB of Des Moines are typically secured by our first lien one-to-four family residential loans, commercial real estate loans and stock issued by the FHLB, which is owned by us. At December 31, 2015 , the Bank maintained an uncommitted credit facility with the FHLB of Des Moines of $626.9 million &#32;and an uncommitted credit facility with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco of $51.9 million , of which there were no advances or borrowings outstanding. The Bank also maintains advance lines with Wells Fargo Bank, US Bank, TIB and Pacific Coast Bankers&#8217; Bank to purchase federal funds of up to $90.0 million &#32;as of December 31, 2015 . At December 31, 2015 &#32;we had securities sold under agreement to repurchase of $23.2 million &#32;which were secured by investment securities available for sale. 

The FHLB functions provide credit for member financial institutions. As a member, we are required to own capital stock in the FHLB and are authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain of our mortgage loans and other assets (principally securities which are obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States) provided certain standards related to creditworthiness have been met. Advances are made pursuant to several different programs. Each credit program has its own interest rate and range of maturities. Depending on the program, limitations on the amount of advances are based on a percentage of an institution&#8217;s assets or on the FHLB&#8217;s assessment of the institution&#8217;s creditworthiness. Under its current credit policies, the FHLB of Des Moines limits advances to 35% of the Bank's assets. 

During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company had an average balance of $1.8 million in FHLB advances. There were no FHLB advances during the year ended December 31, 2014 other than to test the facilities. There were no FHLB advances outstanding as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. There were no federal funds purchased during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. 

Supervision and Regulation 

We are subject to extensive Federal and Washington State legislation, regulation, and supervision. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors, the FDIC and shareholders. The laws and regulations affecting banks and bank holding companies have changed significantly particularly in connection with the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (&#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;). Among other changes, the Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Protection Financial Bureau (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;) as an independent bureau of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (&#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;). The CFPB assumed responsibility for the implementation of the federal financial consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations and has authority to impose new requirements. See &#8220;&#8212;Other Regulatory Developments&#8212;The Dodd-Frank Act&#8221; herein for a discussion of this legislation. Any change in applicable laws, regulations, or regulatory policies may have a material effect on our business, operations, and prospects. We cannot predict the nature or the extent of the effects on our business and earnings that any fiscal or monetary policies or new Federal or State legislation may have in the future. 

The following is a summary discussion of certain laws and regulations applicable to Heritage Financial and Heritage Bank which is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual laws and regulations. 

Heritage Financial. As a registered bank holding company with the Federal Reserve, &#32; we are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. This regulation and supervision is generally intended to ensure that we limit our activities to those allowed by law and that we operate in a safe and sound manner without endangering the financial health of Heritage Bank. As a bank holding company supervised by the Federal Reserve, we are required to file annual and periodic reports with the Federal Reserve and provide additional information as the Federal Reserve may require. The Federal Reserve may examine us, and any of our subsidiaries, and assess us for the cost of such examination. 

The Federal Reserve has extensive enforcement authority over bank holding companies, including the ability to assess civil money penalties and to issue cease and desist or removal orders. The Federal Reserve may also order termination of non-banking activities by non-banking subsidiaries of bank holding companies, or divestiture of ownership and control of a non-banking subsidiary by a bank holding company. Some violations may also result in criminal penalties. 

Federal Reserve policy provides that a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner. Federal Reserve policy further provides that in its capacity as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks, a bank holding company should have the ability to provide financial assistance to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial distress. A bank holding company&#8217;s failure to meet its obligation to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks is generally considered by the Federal Reserve to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s regulations or both. The Dodd-Frank Act also codified the "source of strength" doctrine by adopting a statutory provision requiring, among other things, that bank holding companies serve as a source of financial strength to their subsidiary banks 

Under the prompt corrective action provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act ("FDIA"), a bank holding company with an undercapitalized subsidiary bank must guarantee, within limitations, the capital restoration plan that is required to be implemented of its undercapitalized subsidiary bank. If an undercapitalized subsidiary bank fails to file an acceptable capital restoration plan or fails to implement an accepted plan the Federal Reserve may prohibit the bank holding company or its undercapitalized subsidiary bank from, among other restrictions, paying any dividend or making any other form of capital distribution without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve. In addition, the Federal Reserve policy provides that a bank holding company may pay cash dividends only to the extent that the company&#8217;s net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividend and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the company&#8217;s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. In addition, under Washington corporate law, companies generally may not pay dividends if after that payment the company would not be able to pay its liabilities as they become due in the usual course of business, or its total assets would be less than its total liabilities. 

We, and any subsidiaries which we may control, are considered &#8220;affiliates&#8221; within the meaning of the Federal Reserve Act, and transactions between our bank subsidiary and affiliates are subject to numerous restrictions. With some exceptions, we and our subsidiaries are prohibited from tying the provision of various products or services, such as extensions of credit, to other products or services offered by us, or our affiliates. 

Bank regulations require bank holding companies and banks to maintain a minimum &#8220;leverage&#8221; ratio of core capital to adjusted quarterly average total assets of at least 4%. In addition, banking regulators have adopted risk-based capital guidelines under which risk percentages are assigned to various categories of assets and off-balance sheet items to calculate a risk-adjusted capital ratio. Tier 1 capital generally consists of common stockholders&#8217; equity (which does not include unrealized gains and losses on investment securities available for sale), less goodwill and 

certain identifiable intangible assets. Tier 2 capital includes Tier 1 capital plus the allowance for loan losses and subordinated debt, both subject to some limitations. Regulatory risk-based capital guidelines require Tier 1 capital of 6% of risk-adjusted assets and minimum total capital ratio (combined Tier 1 and Tier 2) of 8% of risk-adjusted assets. In July 2013, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC approved a new rule that substantially amended the regulatory risk-based capital rules to implement the Basel III regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. 

For additional information, see &#8220;&#8212;Capital Adequacy&#8221; below. 

Subsidiary Bank. Heritage Bank is a Washington-chartered commercial bank, the deposits of which are insured by the FDIC. Heritage Bank is subject to regulation by the FDIC and the Division. 

Applicable Federal and State statutes and regulations which govern a bank&#8217;s operations relate to minimum capital requirements, required reserves against deposits, investments, loans, legal lending limits, mergers and consolidation, borrowings, issuance of securities, payment of dividends, establishment of branches, and other aspects of its operations, among other things. The Division and the FDIC also have authority to prohibit banks under their supervision from engaging in what they consider to be unsafe and unsound practices. 

The Bank is required to file periodic reports with the FDIC and the Division, and is subject to periodic examinations and evaluations by those regulatory authorities. Based upon these evaluations, the regulators may revalue the assets of an institution and require that it establish specific reserves to compensate for the differences between the determined value and the book value of such assets. These examinations must be conducted every 12 months, with the exception that well-capitalized banks may be examined every 18 months. The FDIC and the Division may each accept the results of an examination by the other in lieu of conducting an independent examination. 

Dividends paid by the Bank provide substantially all of our cash flow. Applicable Federal and Washington State regulations restrict capital distributions by the Bank, including dividends. Such restrictions are tied to the institution&#8217;s capital levels after giving effect to such distributions. For an additional discussion of restrictions on the payment of dividends, see &#8220;Item 5. Market for the Registrant&#8217;s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities&#8221; herein. 

Capital Adequacy. The Federal Reserve and FDIC have issued substantially similar risk-based and leverage capital guidelines applicable to bank holding companies and banks. In addition, these regulatory agencies may from time to time require that a bank holding company or bank maintain capital above the minimum levels, based on its financial condition or actual or anticipated growth. 

Effective January 1, 2015 (with some changes transitioned into full effectiveness over two to four years), the Company and the Bank became subject to new capital regulations adopted by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, which create a new required ratio for common equity Tier 1 (&#8220;CET1&#8221;) capital, increase the minimum leverage and Tier 1 capital ratios, change the risk-weightings of certain assets for purposes of the risk-based capital ratios, create an additional capital conservation buffer over the required capital ratios, and change what qualifies as capital for purposes of meeting the capital requirements. These regulations implement the regulatory capital reforms required by the Dodd-Frank Act and the &#8220;Basel III&#8221; requirements. 

Under the new capital regulations, the minimum capital ratios are: (1) a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets; (2) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% of risk-weighted assets; (3) a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% of risk-weighted assets; and (4) a leverage ratio (the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total adjusted assets) of 4.0%. CET1 generally consists of common stock; retained earnings; accumulated other comprehensive income (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;) unless an institution elects to exclude AOCI from regulatory capital; and certain minority interests; all subject to applicable regulatory adjustments and deductions. Tier 1 capital generally consists of CET1 and noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. Tier 2 capital generally consists of other preferred stock and subordinated debt meeting certain conditions plus an amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses up to 1.25% of assets. Total capital is the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. 

In addition to the minimum CET1, Tier 1, leverage ratio and total capital ratios, the Company and the Bank must maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional CET1 capital greater than 2.5% of risk-weighted assets above the required minimum levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, repurchasing shares, and paying discretionary bonuses. The new capital conservation buffer requirement is to be phased in beginning on January 1, 2016 when a buffer greater than 0.625% of risk-weighted assets will be required, which amount will increase each year until the buffer requirement is fully implemented on January 1, 2019. 

To be considered "well capitalized," a bank holding company must have, on a consolidated basis, a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater and a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater and must not be subject to an individual order, directive or agreement under which the Federal Reserve requires it to maintain a specific capital level. To be consider &#8220;well capitalized,&#8221; a depository institution must have a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 

8%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%, a CET1 capital ratio of at least 5% and a leverage ratio of at least 5% and not be subject to an individualized order, directive or agreement under which its primary federal banking regulator requires it to maintain a specific capital level. As of December 31, 2015, the Company and the Bank met the requirements to be "well capitalized" and the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer requirement. 

The FDIC may impose additional restrictions on institutions that are undercapitalized and generally is authorized to reclassify an institution into a lower capital category and impose the restrictions applicable to such category if the institution is engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or is in an unsafe or unsound condition. An institution is deemed &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; if it has at least a 6.5% CET1 capital ratio, a 5.0% Tier 1 capital ratio, a 8.0% Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and 10.0% total risk-based capital ratio. At December 31, 2015 , the Bank&#8217;s current capital levels exceed the required capital amounts to be considered &#8220;well capitalized." 

&#32;For a complete description of the Company&#8217;s and the Bank's required and actual capital levels as of December 31, 2015 , see Note (22) Regulatory Capital Requirements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#8221; 

Prompt Corrective Action. Federal statutes establish a supervisory framework for FDIC-insured institutions based on five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. An institution&#8217;s category depends upon where its capital levels are in relation to relevant capital measures. The well capitalized category is described above. An institution that is not well capitalized is subject to certain restrictions on brokered deposits, including restrictions on the rates it can offer on its deposits generally. To be considered adequately capitalized, an institution must have the minimum capital ratios described above. Any institution which is neither well capitalized nor adequately capitalized is considered undercapitalized. 

Undercapitalized institutions are subject to certain prompt corrective action requirements, regulatory controls and restrictions which become more extensive as an institution becomes more severely undercapitalized. Failure by Heritage Bank to comply with applicable capital requirements would, if unremedied, result in progressively more severe restrictions on its activities and lead to enforcement actions, including, but not limited to, the issuance of a capital directive to ensure the maintenance of required capital levels and, ultimately, the appointment of the FDIC as receiver or conservator. Banking regulators will take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. Additionally, approval of any regulatory application filed for their review may be dependent on compliance with capital requirements. 

As of December 31, 2015 , the Bank met the requirements to be classified as &#8220;well capitalized.&#8221; See Note (22) Regulatory Capital Requirements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#8221; 

Deposit Insurance and Other FDIC Programs. The deposits of the Bank are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (&#8220;DIF&#8221;), which is administered by the FDIC. The FDIC is an independent federal agency that insures the deposits, up to applicable limits, of depository institutions. As insurer of the Bank's deposits, the FDIC has supervisory and enforcement authority over Heritage Bank and this insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government. As insurer, the FDIC imposes deposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by institutions insured by the FDIC. It also may prohibit any FDIC-insured institution from engaging in any activity determined by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the institution and the DIF. The FDIC also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions and may terminate the deposit insurance if it determines that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or is in an unsafe or unsound condition. 

The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC&#8217;s deposit insurance assessments to be based on assets instead of deposits. The FDIC issued rules under which the assessment base for a bank is equal to its total average consolidated assets less average tangible capital. The FDIC assessment rates range from approximately five basis points to 35 basis points, depending on applicable adjustments for unsecured debt issued by an institution and brokered deposits (and to further adjustment for institutions that hold unsecured debt of other FDIC-insured institutions), until such time as the FDIC&#8217;s reserve ratio equals 1.15%. Once the FDIC&#8217;s reserve ratio reaches 1.15% and the reserve ratio for the immediately prior assessment period is less than 2.0%, the applicable assessment rates may range from three basis points to 30 basis points (subject to adjustments as described above). If the reserve ratio for the prior assessment period is equal to, or greater than 2.0% and less than 2.5%, the assessment rates may range from two basis points to 28 basis points and if the prior assessment period is greater than 2.5%, the assessment rates may range from one basis point to 25 basis points (in each case subject to adjustments as described above). No institution may pay a dividend if it is in default on its federal deposit insurance assessment. 

Other Regulatory Developments. Significant federal banking legislation has been enacted in recent years. The following summarizes some of the recent significant federal banking legislation. 

The Dodd-Frank Act : The Dodd-Frank-Act imposes new restrictions and an expanded framework of regulatory oversight for financial institutions, including depository institutions and implements new capital regulations that we are subject to and that are discussed above under &#8220;- Capital Adequacy.&#8221; 

The federal banking and securities regulators have issued final rules to implement Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act (the &#8220;Volcker Rule&#8221;) pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act. Generally, subject to a transition period and certain exceptions, the Volcker Rule restricts insured depository institutions and their affiliated companies from engaging in short-term proprietary trading of certain securities, investing in funds with collateral comprised of less than 100% loans that are not registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) and from engaging in hedging activities that do not hedge a specific identified risk. After the transition period, the Volcker Rule prohibitions and restrictions will apply to banking entities, including the Company, unless an exception applies. We are continuously reviewing our investment portfolio to determine if changes to our investment strategies may be required in order to comply with the various provisions of the Volcker Rule regulations. 

In addition, among other changes, the Dodd-Frank Act requires public companies, like us, to (i) provide their shareholders with a non-binding vote (a) at least once every three years on the compensation paid to executive officers and (b) at least once every six years on whether they should have a &#8220;say on pay&#8221; vote every one, two or three years; (ii) have a separate, non-binding shareholder vote regarding golden parachutes for named executive officers when a shareholder vote takes place on mergers, acquisitions, dispositions or other transactions that would trigger the parachute payments; (iii) provide disclosure in annual proxy materials concerning the relationship between the executive compensation paid and the financial performance of the issuer; and (iv) amend Item 402 of Regulation S-K to require companies to disclose the ratio of the Chief Executive Officer's annual total compensation to the median annual total compensation of all other employees. 

Sarbanes-Oxley Act . As a public company that files periodic reports with the SEC, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Heritage is subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act represents significant federal involvement in matters traditionally left to state regulatory systems, such as the regulation of the accounting profession, and to state corporate law, such as the relationship between a board of directors and management and between a board of directors and its committees. Our policies and procedures have been updated to comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. 

Website Access to Company Reports 

We post publicly available reports required to be filed with the SEC on our website, www.HF-WA.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such reports with the SEC. The required reports are available free of charge through our website. 

Code of Ethics 

We have adopted a Code of Ethics that applies to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and controller. We have posted the text of our Code of Ethics at www.HF-WA.com in the section titled Investor Information: Corporate Governance. Any waivers of the code of ethics will be publicly disclosed to shareholders. 

Competition 

We compete for loans and deposits with other commercial banks, credit unions, mortgage bankers, and other institutions in the scope and type of services offered, interest rates paid on deposits, pricing of loans, and number and locations of branches, among other things. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do. Particularly in times of high or rising interest rates, we also face significant competition for investors&#8217; funds from short-term money market securities and other corporate and government securities. 

We compete for loans principally through the range and quality of the services we provide, interest rates and loan fees, and the locations of our Bank's branches. We actively solicit deposit-related clients and compete for deposits by offering depositors a variety of savings accounts, checking accounts, cash management and other services. 

Employees 

We had 717 &#32;full-time equivalent employees at December 31, 2015 . We believe that employees play a vital role in the success of a service company. Employees are provided with a variety of benefits such as medical, vision, dental and life insurance, a retirement plan, and paid vacations and sick leave. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
