 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

GLPI is a self-administered and self-managed Pennsylvania REIT. The Company was formed from the 2013 tax-free spin-off of the real estate assets of Penn. GLPI was incorporated in Pennsylvania on February 13, 2013, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Penn. On November 1, 2013, Penn contributed to GLPI, through a series of internal corporate restructurings, substantially all of the assets and liabilities associated with Penn's real property interests and real estate development business, as well as the assets and liabilities of Louisiana Casino Cruises, Inc. (d/b/a Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge) and Penn Cecil Maryland, Inc. (d/b/a Hollywood Casino Perryville), which are referred to as the "TRS Properties," and then spun-off GLPI to holders of Penn's common and preferred stock in a tax-free distribution (the "Spin-Off"). GLPI owns and operates the TRS Properties through an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, GLP Holdings, Inc. 

&#32;The Company elected on its United States ("U.S.") federal income tax return for its taxable year beginning on January 1, 2014 to be treated as a REIT and the Company, together with GLP Holdings, Inc., jointly elected to treat each of GLP Holdings, Inc., Louisiana Casino Cruises, Inc. and Penn Cecil Maryland, Inc. as a "taxable REIT subsidiary" (a "TRS") effective on the first day of the first taxable year of GLPI as a REIT. As a result of the Spin-Off, GLPI owns substantially all of Penn's former real property assets and leases back these assets to Penn for use by its subsidiaries pursuant to a master lease (the "Penn Master Lease"). The Penn Master Lease is a triple-net operating lease with an initial term of 15 years with no purchase option, followed by four 5-year renewal options (exercisable by Penn) on the same terms and conditions. 

The assets and liabilities of GLPI were recorded at their respective historical carrying values at the time of the Spin-Off in accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 505-60, "Spinoffs and Reverse Spinoffs." 

Prior to the Spin-Off, GLPI and Penn entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement setting forth the mechanics of the Spin-Off, certain organizational matters and other ongoing obligations of Penn and GLPI. Penn and GLPI or their respective subsidiaries, as applicable, also entered into a number of other agreements prior to the Spin-Off to provide a framework for the restructuring and for the relationships between GLPI and Penn after the Spin-Off. 

In connection with the Spin-Off, Penn allocated its accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) for periods prior to the consummation of the Spin-Off between Penn and GLPI. In connection with its election to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes for the year ending December 31, 2014, GLPI declared a special dividend to its shareholders to distribute any accumulated earnings and profits relating to the real property assets and attributable to any pre-REIT years, including any earnings and profits allocated to GLPI in connection with the Spin-Off, to comply with certain REIT qualification requirements (the "Purging Distribution"). The Purging Distribution, which was paid on February 18, 2014, totaled $1.05 billion and was comprised of cash and GLPI common stock. Additionally, on December 19, 2014, the Company made a one-time distribution of $37.0 million to shareholders in order to confirm the Company appropriately allocated its historical earnings and profits relative to the separation from Penn, in response to the Pre-Filing Agreement requested from the IRS. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further details on the Purging Distribution and the distribution related to the Pre-Filing Agreement. 

GLPI's primary business consists of acquiring, financing, and owning real estate property to be leased to gaming operators in triple-net lease arrangements. Triple-net leases are leases in which the lessee pays rent to the lessor, as well as all taxes, insurance, and maintenance expenses that arise from the use of the property. As of December 31, 2015 , GLPI's portfolio consisted of 21 gaming and related facilities, including the TRS Properties and the real property associated with 18 gaming and related facilities operated by Penn and the real property associated with the Casino Queen in East St. Louis, Illinois. These 

facilities are geographically diversified across 12 states and contain approximately 7.0 million &#32;of rentable square feet. As of December 31, 2015 , the Company's properties were 100% occupied. 

We expect to grow our portfolio by pursuing opportunities to acquire additional gaming facilities to lease to gaming operators under prudent terms, including our July 2015 announcement of our proposed acquisition of substantially all of the real estate assets of Pinnacle (as more fully described below) and our December 2015 announcement of the resolution of the previously disclosed Meadows litigation and our entry into an amended purchase agreement with Cannery Casino Resorts LLC ("CCR"), the owner of the Meadows. The Pinnacle transaction is expected to close during April 2016, while the Meadows transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2016. However, we cannot predict the actual dates on which the transactions will be completed because each transaction is subject to conditions beyond our control. 

&#32;Additionally, we believe we have the ability to leverage the expertise our management team has developed over the years to secure additional avenues for growth beyond the gaming industry. Accordingly, we anticipate we will be able to effect strategic acquisitions unrelated to the gaming industry as well as other acquisitions that may prove complementary to GLPI's gaming facilities. 

Proposed Acquisition of Pinnacle Real Estate Assets 

On July 20, 2015, GLPI, Gold Merger Sub, LLC, a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of GLPI ("Merger Sub"), and Pinnacle entered into a merger agreement (as it may be amended from time to time, the "Merger Agreement") providing for the merger of Pinnacle with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of GLPI (the "Merger"). Following the consummation of the Merger, GLPI will own all of Pinnacle&#8217;s real property assets, other than Pinnacle&#8217;s Belterra Park property and excess land at certain locations. In order to effect the acquisition of Pinnacle&#8217;s real property assets (other than the Belterra Park property and excess land at certain locations), prior to the Merger, Pinnacle will cause certain assets relating to its operating business to be transferred to, and liabilities relating thereto to be assumed by a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of Pinnacle ("OpCo"). Immediately following the separation, Pinnacle will distribute to Pinnacle&#8217;s stockholders all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of OpCo owning Pinnacle&#8217;s operating assets and certain other specified assets. Then, upon satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to closing in the Merger Agreement on the closing date, Pinnacle will merge with and into Merger Sub, as described in more detail in the joint proxy statement/prospectus filed with a Registration Statement on Form S-4 (No. 333-206649) initially filed by GLPI with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 23, 2015, as most recently amended on February 16, 2016 (and as the same may be thereafter amended, the "Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus"). Merger Sub, as the surviving company in the Merger, will then own substantially all of Pinnacle&#8217;s real estate assets that were retained or transferred to Pinnacle in the separation and will lease those assets back to OpCo pursuant to a triple-net 35 year (including extension renewals) master lease agreement (the "Pinnacle Master Lease Agreement") substantially in the form attached as Exhibit B to the Merger Agreement. A wholly-owned subsidiary of OpCo would operate the leased gaming facilities as a tenant under the Pinnacle Master Lease Agreement. 

At the effective time of the Merger, each share of Pinnacle common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will be converted into 0.85 shares of a share of GLPI common stock, with cash paid in lieu of the issuance of fractional shares of GLPI common stock. The exchange ratio will not be adjusted to reflect changes in the price of GLPI common stock or the price of Pinnacle common stock occurring prior to the completion of the Merger. The obligations of GLPI and Pinnacle to effect the Merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement (including the applicable approvals of each company&#8217;s stockholders and gaming regulatory approvals). Upon completion of the Merger, the current directors and officers of GLPI are expected to continue in their current positions, other than as may be publicly announced by GLPI in the normal course of business. 

In connection with the proposed Merger, GLPI and Pinnacle will each hold a special meeting of their respective stockholders. At the GLPI special meeting, GLPI stockholders will be asked to vote on (i) a proposal to approve the issuance of GLPI common stock to Pinnacle stockholders in the Merger and (ii) a proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the meeting to another date, time or place, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies in favor of the proposal to approve the issuance of shares of GLPI common stock to Pinnacle stockholders in the Merger. At the Pinnacle special meeting, Pinnacle stockholders will be asked to vote on (i) a proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, (ii) an advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of Pinnacle in connection with the Merger, and (iii) a proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the meeting to another date, time or place, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies in favor of the proposal to approve the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus describes the foregoing proposals in more detail, as well as other matters contemplated in connection with the proposed Merger. 

The Merger Agreement may be terminated, subject to certain exceptions, prior to the effective time of the Merger by either GLPI or Pinnacle under certain conditions, including if the Merger has not been consummated on or before March 31, 

2016, subject to one three-month extension by GLPI, at the election of GLPI, if the only conditions not satisfied at such time related to regulatory and other government approvals. The Company expects to exercise the extension. 

Tax Status 

We elected on our 2014 U.S. federal income tax return to be treated as a REIT and intend to continue to be organized and to operate in a manner that will permit us to qualify as a REIT. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to shareholders. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute as dividends to our shareholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates, and dividends paid to our shareholders would not be deductible by us in computing taxable income. Any resulting corporate liability could be substantial and could materially and adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to shareholders. Unless we were entitled to relief under certain Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") provisions, we also would be disqualified from re-electing to be taxed as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify to be taxed as a REIT. 

Our TRS Properties are able to engage in activities resulting in income that is not qualifying income for a REIT. As a result, certain activities of the Company which occur within our TRS Properties are subject to federal and state income taxes. 

Tenants 

As of December 31, 2015 , all of the Company's rental properties, with the exception of the real property associated with the Casino Queen were leased to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Penn under the Penn Master Lease. 

Penn is a leading, diversified, multi-jurisdictional owner and manager of gaming and pari-mutuel properties, and an established gaming provider with strong financial performance. The obligations under the Penn Master Lease are guaranteed by Penn and by all Penn subsidiaries that occupy and operate the facilities leased under the Penn Master Lease, or that own a gaming license, other license or other material asset necessary to operate any portion of the facilities. A default by Penn or its subsidiaries with regard to any facility will cause a default with regard to the entire Penn portfolio. 

We will seek to cultivate our relationships with tenants and gaming providers in order to expand the mixture of tenants operating our properties and, in doing so, to reduce our dependence on Penn. We expect that this objective will be achieved over time as part of our overall strategy to acquire new properties and further diversify our overall portfolio of gaming properties. For example, in July 2015 as described above, we announced our proposed acquisition of substantially all of the real estate assets of Pinnacle and in December 2015 we announced the resolution of the previously disclosed Meadows litigation and our entry into an amended purchase agreement with CCR, the owner of the Meadows. The Pinnacle transaction is expected to close during April 2016, while the Meadows transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2016. However, we cannot predict the actual dates on which the transactions will be completed because each transaction is subject to conditions beyond our control. 

The rent structure under the Penn Master Lease includes a fixed component, a portion of which is subject to an annual 2% escalator if certain rent coverage ratio thresholds are met, and a component that is based on the performance of the facilities, which is adjusted, subject to certain floors (i) every 5 years by an amount equal to 4% of the average change to net revenues of all facilities under the Penn Master Lease (other than Hollywood Casino Columbus and Hollywood Casino Toledo) during the preceding five years, and (ii) monthly by an amount equal to 20% of the net revenues of Hollywood Casino Columbus and Hollywood Casino Toledo during the preceding month. In addition to rent, all properties under the Penn Master Lease are required to pay the following: (1) all facility maintenance, (2) all insurance required in connection with the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties, (3) taxes levied on or with respect to the leased properties (other than taxes on the income of the lessor) and (4) all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties. 

At Penn's option, the Penn Master Lease may be extended for up to four 5-year renewal terms beyond the initial 15-year term, on the same terms and conditions. If Penn elects to renew the term of the Penn Master Lease, the renewal will be effective as to all, but not less than all, of the leased property then subject to the Penn Master Lease, provided that the final renewal option shall only be exercisable with respect to certain of the barge-based facilities&#8212;i.e., facilities where barges serve as foundations upon which buildings are constructed to serve as gaming or related facilities or serve ancillary purposes such as access platforms or shear barges to protect a gaming facility from floating debris&#8212;following an independent third party expert's review of the total useful life of the applicable barged-based facility measured from the beginning of the initial term. If the final five-year renewal term would not cause the aggregate term to exceed 80% of the useful life of such facility, the facility shall be included in the five-year renewal. In the event that a five-year renewal of such facility would cause it to exceed 80% of the estimated useful life, such facility shall be included in the renewal for the period of time equal to but not exceeding 80% of the estimated useful life. 

Penn will not have the ability to terminate its obligations under the Penn Master Lease prior to its expiration without the Company's consent. If the Penn Master Lease is terminated prior to its expiration other than with our consent, Penn may be liable for damages and incur charges such as continued payment of rent through the end of the lease term and maintenance costs for the leased property.

Competition 

We compete for real property investments with other REITs, investment companies, private equity and hedge fund investors, sovereign funds, lenders, gaming companies and other investors. Some of our competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we have. Increased competition will make it more challenging to identify and successfully capitalize on acquisition opportunities that meet our investment objectives. Furthermore, in October 2015, a large hospitality company owning a portfolio of casino resorts announced plans to separate a substantial portion of its real estate assets and operations through the formation of a REIT. Another large global casino operator has declared a voluntary Chapter 11 reorganization in order to significantly reduce its debt with the intent of restructuring its operations into a REIT and separate operating company. There is also market speculation surrounding the formation of additional gaming REITs. If any of these transactions materialize, we will face direct competition in the acquisition of gaming properties. 

In addition, revenues from our gaming properties are dependent on the ability of our gaming tenants and operators to compete with other gaming operators. The gaming industry is characterized by an increasingly high degree of competition among a large number of participants, including riverboat casinos, dockside casinos, land-based casinos, video lottery, sweepstakes and poker machines not located in casinos, Native American gaming, emerging varieties of Internet gaming and other forms of gaming in the U.S. In a broader sense, our gaming tenants and operators face competition from all manner of leisure and entertainment activities, including: shopping, athletic events, television and movies, concerts and travel. Legalized gaming is currently permitted in various forms throughout the U.S., in several Canadian provinces and on various lands taken into trust for the benefit of certain Native Americans in the U.S. and Canada. Other jurisdictions, including states adjacent to states in which our gaming tenants and operators are located have legalized, and will expand gaming in the near future. In addition, established gaming jurisdictions could award additional gaming licenses or permit the expansion or relocation of existing gaming operations. New, relocated or expanded operations by other persons will increase competition for our gaming tenants and operators and could have a material adverse impact on our gaming tenants and operators and us as landlord. Finally, the imposition of smoking bans and/or higher gaming tax rates have a significant impact on our gaming tenants and operators' ability to compete with facilities in nearby jurisdictions. 

Hollywood Casino Perryville continued to face additional competition, led by the August 26, 2014 opening of the Horseshoe Casino Baltimore, located in downtown Baltimore. In addition Maryland Live!, at the Arundel Mills mall in Anne Arundel, Maryland, which opened on June 6, 2012, added table games on April 11, 2013, and a 52 table poker room in late August 2013. Both facilities have and will continue to negatively impact Hollywood Casino Perryville's results of operations. 

&#32;Furthermore, in November 2012, voters approved legislation authorizing a sixth casino in Prince George's County. The 2012 law also changes the tax rate casino operators pay the state, varying from casino to casino, allows all casinos in Maryland to be open 24 hours per day for the entire year, and permits casinos to directly purchase slot machines in exchange for gaming tax reductions. In December 2013, the license for the sixth casino in Prince George's County was granted. The $1.3 billion casino resort, which is currently under construction and expected to open in the fourth quarter of 2016, will adversely impact Hollywood Casino Perryville's financial results. 

Segments 

Consistent with how our Chief Operating Decision Maker (as such term is defined in ASC 280 "Segment Reporting") reviews and assesses our financial performance, we have two reportable segments, GLP Capital, L.P. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of GLPI through which GLPI owns substantially all of its real estate assets) ("GLP Capital") and the TRS Properties. The GLP Capital reportable segment consists of the leased real property and represents the majority of our business. The TRS Properties reportable segment consists of Hollywood Casino Perryville and Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge. See "Item 7&#8212;Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and "Item 8&#8212;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 13&#8212;Segment Information" for further information with respect to the Company's segments.

Tax Considerations 

We elected to be treated as a REIT on our 2014 U.S. federal income tax return and we, together with an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, GLP Holdings, Inc., jointly elected to treat each of GLP Holdings, Inc., Louisiana Casino Cruises, Inc. and Penn Cecil Maryland, Inc. as a "taxable REIT subsidiary" effective on the first day of the first taxable year of GLPI as a REIT. We intend to continue to be organized and to operate in a manner that will permit us to qualify as a REIT. Qualification and taxation as a REIT depends on our ability to meet on a continuing basis, through actual operating results, distribution levels, and diversity of stock ownership, various qualification requirements imposed upon REITs by the Code. Our ability to qualify to be taxed as a REIT also requires that we satisfy certain tests, some of which depend upon the fair market values of assets that we own directly or indirectly. The material qualification requirements are summarized below. Such values may not be susceptible to a precise determination. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the actual results of our operations for any taxable year will satisfy such requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT. Additionally, while we intend to operate so that we continue to qualify to be taxed as a REIT, no assurance can be given that the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") will not challenge our qualification, or that we will be able to operate in accordance with the REIT requirements in the future. 

Taxation of REITs in General 

As a REIT, generally we will be entitled to a deduction for dividends that we pay and therefore will not be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on our net REIT taxable income that is currently distributed to our shareholders. This treatment substantially eliminates the "double taxation" at the corporate and shareholder levels that generally results from an investment in a C corporation. A "C corporation" is a corporation that generally is required to pay tax at the corporate level. Double taxation means taxation once at the corporate level when income is earned and once again at the shareholder level when the income is distributed. In general, the income that we generate is taxed only at the shareholder level upon a distribution of dividends to our shareholders. We will nonetheless be subject to U.S. federal tax in the following circumstances: 

&#8226; 

We will be taxed at regular corporate rates on any undistributed net taxable income, including undistributed net capital gains. 

&#8226; 

We may be subject to the "alternative minimum tax" on our items of tax preference, including any deductions of net operating losses. 

&#8226; 

If we have net income from prohibited transactions, which are, in general, sales or other dispositions of inventory or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, other than foreclosure property, such income will be subject to a 100% tax. 

&#8226; 

If we elect to treat property that we acquire in connection with a foreclosure of a mortgage loan or certain leasehold terminations as "foreclosure property," we may thereby avoid the 100% tax on gain from a resale of that property (if the sale would otherwise constitute a prohibited transaction), but the income from the sale or operation of the property may be subject to corporate income tax at the highest applicable rate (currently 35%). 

&#8226; 

If we fail to satisfy the 75% gross income test and/or the 95% gross income test, as discussed below, but nonetheless maintain our qualification as a REIT because we satisfy other requirements, we will be subject to a 100% tax on an amount based on the magnitude of the failure, as adjusted to reflect the profit margin associated with our gross income. 

&#8226; 

If we violate the asset tests (other than certain de minimis violations) or other requirements applicable to REITs, as described below, and yet maintain our qualification as a REIT because there is reasonable cause for the failure and other applicable requirements are met, we may be subject to a penalty tax. In that case, the amount of the penalty tax will be at least $50,000 per failure, and, in the case of certain asset test failures, will be determined as the amount of net income generated by the nonqualifying assets in question multiplied by the highest corporate tax rate (currently 35%) if that amount exceeds $50,000 per failure. 

&#8226; 

If we fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of (i) 85% of our ordinary income for such year, (ii) 95% of our capital gain net income for such year and (iii) any undistributed net taxable income from prior periods, we will be subject to a nondeductible 4% excise tax on the excess of the required distribution over the sum of (a) the amounts that we actually distributed and (b) the amounts we retained and upon which we paid income tax at the corporate level. 

&#8226; 

We may be required to pay monetary penalties to the IRS in certain circumstances, including if we fail to meet record-keeping requirements intended to monitor our compliance with rules relating to the composition of a REIT's shareholders. 

&#8226; 

A 100% tax may be imposed on transactions between us and a TRS that do not reflect arm's-length terms. 

&#8226; 

If we acquire appreciated assets from a corporation that is not a REIT (i.e., a corporation taxable under subchapter C of the Code) in a transaction in which the adjusted tax basis of the assets in our hands is determined by reference to the adjusted tax basis of the assets in the hands of the subchapter C corporation, we may be subject to tax on such appreciation at the highest corporate income tax rate then applicable if we subsequently recognize gain on a disposition of any such assets during the five-year period following their acquisition from the subchapter C corporation. 

&#8226; 

The earnings of our TRS Properties will generally be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax. 

In addition, we and our subsidiaries may be subject to a variety of taxes, including payroll taxes and state, local, and foreign income, property, gross receipts and other taxes on our assets and operations. We could also be subject to tax in situations and on transactions not presently contemplated. 

Requirements for Qualification&#8212;General 

The Code defines a REIT as a corporation, trust or association: 

1. 

that is managed by one or more trustees or directors; 

2. 

the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares, or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest; 

3. 

that would be taxable as a domestic corporation but for its election to be subject to tax as a REIT; 

4. 

that is neither a financial institution nor an insurance company subject to specific provisions of the Code; 

5. 

the beneficial ownership of which is held by 100 or more persons; 

6. 

in which, during the last half of each taxable year, not more than 50% in value of the outstanding stock is owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer "individuals" (as defined in the Code to include specified tax-exempt entities); and 

7. 

that meets other tests described below, including with respect to the nature of its income and assets. 

The Code provides that conditions (1) through (4) must be met during the entire taxable year, and that condition (5) must be met during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months, or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year. Conditions (5) and (6) need not be met during a corporation's initial tax year as a REIT (which, in our case, was 2014). Our charter provides restrictions regarding the ownership and transfers of our stock, which are intended to assist us in satisfying the stock ownership requirements described in conditions (5) and (6) above. These restrictions, however, may not ensure that we will, in all cases, be able to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in conditions (5) and (6) above. If we fail to satisfy these share ownership requirements, except as provided in the next sentence, our status as a REIT will terminate. If, however, we comply with the rules contained in applicable U.S. Department of the Treasury (the "Treasury") regulations that require us to ascertain the actual ownership of our shares and we do not know, or would not have known through the exercise of reasonable diligence, that we failed to meet the requirements described in condition (6) above, we will be treated as having met this requirement. 

To monitor compliance with the stock ownership requirements, we generally are required to maintain records regarding the actual ownership of our stock. To do so, we must demand written statements each year from the record holders of significant percentages of our stock pursuant to which the record holders must disclose the actual owners of the stock (i.e., the persons required to include our dividends in their gross income). We must maintain a list of those persons failing or refusing to comply with this demand as part of our records. We could be subject to monetary penalties if we fail to comply with these record-keeping requirements. If, upon request by the Company, a shareholder fails or refuses to comply with the demands, such holder will be required by Treasury regulations to submit a statement with his, her or its tax return disclosing the actual ownership of our stock and other information. 

Qualified REIT Subsidiaries 

The Code provides that a corporation that is a "qualified REIT subsidiary" shall not be treated as a separate corporation, and all assets, liabilities and items of income, deduction and credit of a "qualified REIT subsidiary" shall be treated as assets, liabilities and items of income, deduction and credit of the REIT. A "qualified REIT subsidiary" is a corporation, all of the capital stock of which is owned by the REIT, that has not elected to be a "taxable REIT subsidiary" (discussed below). In applying the requirements described herein, all of our "qualified REIT subsidiaries" will be ignored, and all assets, liabilities and items of income, deduction and credit of such subsidiaries will be treated as our assets, liabilities and items of income, deduction and credit. These subsidiaries, therefore, will not be subject to federal corporate income taxation, although they may be subject to state and local taxation. 

Taxable REIT Subsidiaries 

In general, we may jointly elect with a subsidiary corporation, whether or not wholly-owned, to treat such subsidiary corporation as a TRS. We generally may not own more than 10% of the securities of a taxable corporation, as measured by voting power or value, unless we and such corporation elect to treat such corporation as a TRS. The separate existence of a TRS is not ignored for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, a TRS generally is subject to corporate income tax on its earnings, which may reduce the cash flow that we and our subsidiaries generate in the aggregate and may reduce our ability to make distributions to our shareholders. 

We are not treated as holding the assets of a TRS or as receiving any income that the subsidiary earns. Rather, the stock issued by the TRS to us is an asset in our hands, and we treat the dividends paid to us, if any, as income. This treatment can affect our income and asset test calculations, as described below. Because we do not include the assets and income of TRSs on a look-through basis in determining our compliance with the REIT requirements, we may use such entities to undertake indirectly activities that the REIT rules might otherwise preclude us from doing directly or through pass-through subsidiaries. For example, we may use TRSs to perform services or conduct activities that give rise to certain categories of income or to conduct activities that, if conducted by us directly, would be treated in our hands as prohibited transactions. 

The TRS rules limit the deductibility of interest paid or accrued by a TRS to its parent REIT to assure that the TRS is subject to an appropriate level of corporate taxation. Further, the rules impose a 100% excise tax on transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT or the REIT's tenants that are not conducted on an arm's-length basis. We intend that all of our transactions with our TRS, if any, will be conducted on an arm's-length basis. 

Income Tests 

As a REIT, we must satisfy two gross income requirements on an annual basis. First, at least 75% of our gross income for each taxable year, excluding gross income from sales of inventory or dealer property in "prohibited transactions," discharge of indebtedness and certain hedging transactions, generally must be derived from "rents from real property," gains from the sale of real estate assets, interest income derived from mortgage loans secured by real property (including certain types of mortgage-backed securities), dividends received from other REITs, and specified income from temporary investments. Second, at least 95% of our gross income in each taxable year, excluding gross income from prohibited transactions, discharge of indebtedness 

and certain hedging transactions, must be derived from some combination of income that qualifies under the 75% gross income test described above, as well as other dividends, interest, and gain from the sale or disposition of stock or securities, which need not have any relation to real property. Income and gain from certain hedging transactions will be excluded from both the numerator and the denominator for purposes of both the 75% and 95% gross income tests. 

Rents received by a REIT will qualify as "rents from real property" in satisfying the gross income requirements described above only if several conditions are met. 

&#8226; 

The amount of rent must not be based in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person. However, an amount received or accrued generally will not be excluded from the term "rents from real property" solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage or percentages of gross receipts or sales. 

&#8226; 

Rents received from a tenant will not qualify as "rents from real property" in satisfying the gross income tests if the REIT, or a direct or indirect owner of 10% or more of the REIT, directly or constructively, owns 10% or more of such tenant (a "Related Party Tenant"). However, rental payments from a taxable REIT subsidiary will qualify as rents from real property even if we own more than 10% of the total value or combined voting power of the taxable REIT subsidiary if at least 90% of the property is leased to unrelated tenants and the rent paid by the taxable REIT subsidiary is substantially comparable to the rent paid by the unrelated tenants for comparable space. 

&#8226; 

Rent attributable to personal property leased in connection with a lease of real property will not qualify as "rents from real property" if such rent exceeds 15% of the total rent received under the lease. 

&#8226; 

the REIT generally must not operate or manage the property or furnish or render services to tenants, except through an "independent contractor" who is adequately compensated and from whom the REIT derives no income, or through a taxable REIT subsidiary. The "independent contractor" requirement, however, does not apply to the extent the services provided by the REIT are "usually or customarily rendered" in connection with the rental of space for occupancy only, and are not otherwise considered "rendered to the occupant." In addition, a de minimis rule applies with respect to non-customary services. Specifically, if the value of the non-customary service income with respect to a property (valued at no less than 150% of the direct costs of performing such services) is 1% or less of the total income derived from the property, then all rental income except the non-customary service income will qualify as "rents from real property." A taxable REIT subsidiary may provide services (including noncustomary services) to a REIT&#8217;s tenants without "tainting" any of the rental income received by the REIT, and will be able to manage or operate properties for third parties and generally engage in other activities unrelated to real estate. 

We do not anticipate receiving rent that is based in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person (except by reason of being based on a fixed percentage or percentages of gross receipts or sales consistent with the rules described above). We also do not anticipate receiving more than a de minimis amount of rents from any Related Party Tenant or rents attributable to personal property leased in connection with real property that will exceed 15% of the total rents received with respect to such real property. We may receive certain types of income that will not qualify under the 75% or 95% gross income tests. In particular, dividends received from a taxable REIT subsidiary will not qualify under the 75% test. We believe, however, that the aggregate amount of such items and other non-qualifying income in any taxable year will not cause GLPI to exceed the limits on non-qualifying income under either the 75% or 95% gross income tests. 

We may directly or indirectly receive distributions from TRSs or other corporations that are not REITs or qualified REIT subsidiaries. These distributions generally are treated as dividend income to the extent of the earnings and profits of the distributing corporation. Such distributions will generally constitute qualifying income for purposes of the 95% gross income test, but not for purposes of the 75% gross income test. Any dividends that we receive from another REIT or qualified REIT subsidiary, however, will be qualifying income for purposes of both the 95% and 75% gross income tests. 

We believe that we have and will continue to be in compliance with these gross income tests. If we fail to satisfy one or both of the 75% or 95% gross income tests for any taxable year, we may still qualify to be taxed as a REIT for such year if we are entitled to relief under applicable provisions of the Code. These relief provisions will be generally available if (i) our failure to meet these tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect and (ii) following our identification of the failure to meet the 75% or 95% gross income test for any taxable year, we file a schedule with the IRS setting forth each item of our gross income for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income test for such taxable year in accordance with Treasury regulations. It is not possible to state whether we would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions in all circumstances. If these relief provisions are inapplicable to a particular set of circumstances, we will not qualify to be taxed as a REIT. Even if these relief provisions apply, and we retain our status as a REIT, the Code imposes a tax based upon the amount by which we fail to satisfy the particular gross income test. 

Asset Tests 

At the close of each calendar quarter, we must also satisfy four tests relating to the nature of our assets. First, at least 75% of the value of our total assets must be represented by some combination of "real estate assets," cash, cash items, U.S. government securities, and, under some circumstances, stock or debt instruments purchased with new capital. For this purpose, real estate assets include interests in real property and stock of other corporations that qualify as REITs, as well as some kinds of mortgage-backed securities and mortgage loans. Assets that do not qualify for purposes of the 75% asset test are subject to the additional asset tests described below. 

Second, the value of any one issuer's securities that we own may not exceed 5% of the value of our total assets. 

Third, we may not own more than 10% of any one issuer's outstanding securities, as measured by either voting power or value. The 5% and 10% asset tests do not apply to securities of TRSs and qualified REIT subsidiaries and the 10% asset test does not apply to "straight debt" having specified characteristics and to certain other securities described below. Solely for purposes of the 10% asset test, the determination of our interest in the assets of a partnership or limited liability company in which we own an interest will be based on our proportionate interest in any securities issued by the partnership or limited liability company, excluding for this purpose certain securities described in the Code. The safe harbor under which certain types of securities are disregarded for purposes of the 10% value limitation includes (1) straight debt securities (including straight debt securities that provides for certain contingent payments); (2) any loan to an individual or an estate; (3) any rental agreement described in Section 467 of the Code, other than with a "related person"; (4) any obligation to pay rents from real property; (5) certain securities issued by a State or any political subdivision thereof, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; (6) any security issued by a REIT; and (7) any other arrangement that, as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, is excepted from the definition of a security. In addition, for purposes of applying the 10% value limitation, (a) a REIT&#8217;s interest as a partner in a partnership is not considered a security; (b) any debt instrument issued by a partnership is not treated as a security if at least 75% of the partnership&#8217;s gross income is from sources that would qualify for the 75% REIT gross income test; and (c) any debt instrument issued by a partnership is not treated as a security to the extent of the REIT&#8217;s interest as a partner in the partnership. 

Fourth, the aggregate value of all securities of TRSs that we hold, together with other non-qualified assets (such as furniture and equipment or other tangible personal property, or non-real estate securities) may not, in the aggregate, exceed 25% of the value of our total assets. Beginning after December 31, 2017, the aggregate value of all securities of the TRSs that we hold may not exceed 20% of our total assets. 

However, certain relief provisions are available to allow REITs to satisfy the asset requirements or to maintain REIT qualification notwithstanding certain violations of the asset and other requirements. For example, if we should fail to satisfy the asset tests at the end of a calendar quarter such a failure would not cause us to lose our REIT qualification if we (i) satisfied the asset tests at the close of the preceding calendar quarter and (ii) the discrepancy between the value of our assets and the asset requirements was not wholly or partly caused by an acquisition of non-qualifying assets, but instead arose from changes in the relative market values of our assets. If the condition described in (ii) were not satisfied, we still could avoid disqualification by eliminating any discrepancy within 30 days after the close of the calendar quarter in which it arose or by making use of the relief provisions described above. 

In the case of de minimis &#32;violations of the 10% and 5% asset tests, a REIT may maintain its qualification despite a violation of such requirements if (i) the value of the assets causing the violation does not exceed the lesser of 1% of the REIT's total assets and $10,000,000 and (ii) the REIT either disposes of the assets causing the failure within six months after the last day of the quarter in which it identifies the failure, or the relevant tests are otherwise satisfied within that time frame. 

Even if we did not qualify for the foregoing relief provisions, one additional provision allows a REIT which fails one or more of the asset requirements to nevertheless maintain its REIT qualification if (i) the REIT provides the IRS with a description of each asset causing the failure, (ii) the failure is due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect, (iii) the REIT pays a tax equal to the greater of (a) $50,000 per failure and (b) the product of the net income generated by the assets that caused the failure multiplied by the highest applicable corporate tax rate (currently 35%) and (iv) the REIT either disposes of the assets causing the failure within six months after the last day of the quarter in which it identifies the failure, or otherwise satisfies the relevant asset tests within that time frame. 

We believe that we have been and will continue to be in compliance with the asset tests described above. 

Annual Distribution Requirements 

In order to qualify to be taxed as a REIT, we are required to distribute dividends, other than capital gain dividends, to our shareholders in an amount at least equal to: 

(i) 

the sum of 

(a) 

90% of our REIT taxable income, computed without regard to our net capital gains and the deduction for dividends paid; and 

(b) 

90% of our after tax net income, if any, from foreclosure property (as described below); minus 

(ii) 

the excess of the sum of specified items of non-cash income over 5% of our REIT taxable income, computed without regard to our net capital gain and the deduction for dividends paid. 

We generally must make these distributions in the taxable year to which they relate, or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for the year and if paid with or before the first regular dividend payment after such declaration. These distributions will be treated as received by our shareholders in the year in which paid. In order for distributions to be counted as satisfying the annual distribution requirements for REITs, and to provide us with a REIT-level tax deduction, the distributions must not be "preferential dividends." A dividend is not a preferential dividend if the distribution is (i) pro rata among all outstanding shares of stock within a particular class and (ii) in accordance with any preferences among different classes of stock as set forth in our organizational documents. 

To the extent that we distribute at least 90%, but less than 100%, of our REIT taxable income, as adjusted, we will be subject to tax at ordinary corporate tax rates on the retained portion. We may elect to retain, rather than distribute, some or all of our net long-term capital gains and pay tax on such gains. In this case, we could elect for our shareholders to include their proportionate shares of such undistributed long-term capital gains in income, and to receive a corresponding credit for their share of the tax that we paid. Our shareholders would then increase the adjusted basis of their stock by the difference between (i) the amounts of capital gain dividends that we designated and that they include in their taxable income, minus (ii) the tax that we paid on their behalf with respect to that income. 

To the extent that in the future we may have available net operating losses carried forward from prior tax years, such losses may reduce the amount of distributions that we must make in order to comply with the REIT distribution requirements. 

If we fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of (i) 85% of our ordinary income for such year, (ii) 95% of our capital gain net income for such year and (iii) any undistributed net taxable income from prior periods, we will be subject to a non-deductible 4% excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over the sum of (a) the amounts actually distributed, plus (b) the amounts of income we retained and on which we have paid corporate income tax. 

We expect that our REIT taxable income will be less than our cash flow because of depreciation and other non-cash charges included in computing REIT taxable income. Accordingly, we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the distribution requirements described above. However, from time to time, we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet these distribution requirements due to timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses, and the inclusion of income and deduction of expenses in determining our taxable income. In addition, we may decide to retain our cash, rather than distribute it, in order to repay debt, acquire assets, or for other reasons. If these timing differences occur, we may borrow funds to pay dividends or pay dividends through the distribution of other property (including shares of our stock) in order to meet the distribution requirements, while preserving our cash. 

If our taxable income for a particular year is subsequently determined to have been understated, we may be able to rectify a resultant failure to meet the distribution requirements for a year by paying "deficiency dividends" to shareholders in a later year, which may be included in our deduction for dividends paid for the earlier year. In this case, we may be able to avoid losing REIT qualification or being taxed on amounts distributed as deficiency dividends, subject to the 4% excise tax described above. We will be required to pay interest based on the amount of any deduction taken for deficiency dividends. 

For purposes of the 90% distribution requirement and excise tax described above, any distribution must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate, or in the following taxable year if such distributions are declared in October, November or December of the taxable year, are payable to shareholders of record on a specified date in any such month, and are actually paid before the end of January of the following year. Such distributions are treated as both paid by us and received by our shareholders on December 31 of the year in which they are declared. 

In addition, at our election, a distribution for a taxable year may be declared before we timely file our tax return for the year, provided we pay such distribution with or before our first regular dividend payment after such declaration, and such payment is made during the 12-month period following the close of such taxable year. Such distributions are taxable to our shareholders in the year in which paid, even though the distributions relate to our prior taxable year for purposes of the 90% distribution requirement. 

In order for distributions to be counted as satisfying the annual distribution requirements for REITs, and to provide us with a REIT-level tax deduction, the distributions must not be "preferential dividends." A dividend is not a preferential dividend if the distribution is (i) pro rata among all outstanding shares of stock within a particular class and (ii) in accordance with any preferences among different classes of stock as set forth in our organizational documents 

We believe that we have satisfied the annual distribution requirements for the year ending, December 31, 2015 . Although we intend to satisfy the annual distribution requirements to continue to qualify as a REIT for the year ending December 31, 2016 &#32;and thereafter, economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations could limit our ability to meet those requirements. 

Failure to Qualify 

If we fail to satisfy one or more requirements for REIT qualification other than the income or asset tests, we could avoid disqualification as a REIT if our failure is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect and we pay a penalty of $50,000 for each such failure. Relief provisions are also available for failures of the income tests and asset tests, as described above in "&#8212;Income Tests" and "&#8212;Asset Tests." 

If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any taxable year, and the relief provisions described above do not apply, we would be subject to tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. We cannot deduct distributions to shareholders in any year in which we are not a REIT, nor would we be required to make distributions in such a year. In this situation, to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes), distributions to shareholders would be taxable as regular corporate dividends. Such dividends paid to U.S. shareholders that are individuals, trusts and estates may be taxable at the preferential income tax rates (i.e., the 20% maximum U.S. federal rate) for qualified dividends. In addition, subject to the limitations of the Code, corporate distributes may be eligible for the dividends received deduction. Unless we are entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions, we would also be disqualified from re-electing to be taxed as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which we lost our qualification. It is not possible to state whether, in all circumstances, we would be entitled to this statutory relief. 

Legislative or Other Actions Affecting REITs 

The present U.S. federal income tax treatment of REITs may be modified, possibly with retroactive effect, by legislative, judicial or administrative action at any time. The REIT rules are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the Treasury which may result in statutory changes as well as revisions to regulations and interpretations. Changes to the U.S. federal tax laws and interpretations thereof could adversely affect an investment in our common stock. 

Regulation 

The ownership, operation, and management of, and provision of certain products and services to, gaming and racing facilities are subject to pervasive regulation. Gaming laws are generally based upon declarations of public policy designed to protect gaming consumers and the viability and integrity of the gaming industry. Gaming laws also may be designed to protect and maximize state and local revenues derived through taxes and licensing fees imposed on gaming industry participants as well as to enhance economic development and tourism. To accomplish these public policy goals, gaming laws establish procedures to ensure that participants in the gaming industry, including landlords and other suppliers, meet certain standards of character and fitness. In addition, gaming laws require gaming industry participants to: 

&#8226; 

ensure that unsuitable individuals and organizations have no role in gaming operations; 

&#8226; 

establish procedures designed to prevent cheating and fraudulent practices; 

&#8226; 

establish and maintain responsible accounting practices and procedures; 

&#8226; 

maintain effective controls over their financial practices, including establishment of minimum procedures for internal fiscal affairs and the safeguarding of assets and revenues; 

&#8226; 

maintain systems for reliable record keeping; 

&#8226; 

file periodic reports with gaming regulators; 

&#8226; 

ensure that contracts and financial transactions are commercially reasonable, reflect fair market value and are arms-length transactions; and 

&#8226; 

establish programs to promote responsible gaming. 

These regulations impact our business in three important ways: (1) our ownership and operation of the TRS Properties; (2) our ownership of land and buildings in which gaming activities are operated by third party tenants pursuant to long-term leases; and (3) the operations of our gaming tenants. Our ownership and operation of the TRS Properties subject GLPI, its subsidiaries and its officers and directors to the jurisdiction of the gaming regulatory agencies in Louisiana and Maryland. Further, many gaming and racing regulatory agencies in the jurisdictions in which our gaming tenants operate require GLPI and its affiliates to maintain a license as a key business entity or supplier because of its status as landlord, including Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, Mississippi, Pennsylvania and Ohio. 

Our businesses are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations in addition to gaming regulations. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, environmental matters, employees, health care, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and advertising. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our operating results. 

Insurance 

We have comprehensive liability, property and business interruption insurance at our TRS Properties. In regards to our properties subject to triple-net leases, the lease agreements require our tenants to have their own comprehensive liability, property and business interruption insurance policies, including protection for our insurable interests as the landlord. 

Environmental Matters 

Our properties are subject to environmental laws regulating, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges and the handling and disposal of wastes, including medical wastes. Certain of the properties we own utilize above or underground storage tanks to store heating oil for use at the properties. Other properties were built during the time that asbestos-containing building materials were routinely installed in residential and commercial structures. Our triple-net leases obligate the tenants thereunder to comply with applicable environmental laws and to indemnify us if their noncompliance results in losses or claims against us, and we expect that any future leases will include the same provisions for other operators. An operator's failure to comply could result in fines and penalties or the requirement to undertake corrective actions which may result in significant costs to the operator and thus adversely affect their ability to meet their obligations to us. 

Pursuant to U.S. federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be required to investigate, remove and/or remediate a release of hazardous substances or other regulated materials at, or emanating from, such property. Further, under certain circumstances, such owners or operators of real property may be held liable for property damage, personal injury and/or natural resource damage resulting from or arising in connection with such releases. Certain of these laws have been interpreted to provide for joint and several liability unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of responsibility. We also may be liable under certain of these laws for damage that occurred prior to our ownership of a property or at a site where we sent wastes for disposal. The failure to properly remediate a property may also adversely affect our ability to lease, sell or rent the property or to borrow funds using the property as collateral. 

In connection with the ownership of our real property, we could be legally responsible for environmental liabilities or costs relating to a release of hazardous substances or other regulated materials at or emanating from such property. In order to assess the potential for such liability, we conduct routine due diligence of environmental assessments prior to acquisition. We are not aware of any environmental issues that are expected to have a material impact on the operations of any of our properties. 

Pursuant to the Penn Master Lease and a Separation and Distribution Agreement between Penn and GLPI, any liability arising from or relating to environmental liabilities arising from the businesses and operations of Penn's real property holdings prior to the Spin-Off (other than any liability arising from or relating to the operation or ownership of the TRS Properties and except to the extent first discovered after the end of the term of the Penn Master Lease) was retained by Penn and Penn will indemnify GLPI (and its subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees and agents and certain other related parties) against any losses arising from or relating to such environmental liabilities. There can be no assurance that Penn will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Penn any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses while seeking recovery from Penn.
