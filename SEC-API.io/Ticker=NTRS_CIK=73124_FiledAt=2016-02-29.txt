ASSET MANAGEMENT 

Asset Management, through the Corporation&#8217;s various subsidiaries, supports the C&#38;IS and Wealth Management reporting segments by providing a broad range of asset management and related services and other products to clients around the world. Investment solutions are delivered through separately managed accounts, bank common and collective funds, registered investment companies, exchange traded funds, non-U.S. collective investment funds, and unregistered private investment funds. Asset Management&#8217;s capabilities include active, passive and engineered equity; active and passive fixed income; cash management; alternative asset classes (such as private equity and hedge funds of funds); and multi-manager advisory services and products.

Asset Management operates internationally through subsidiaries and distribution arrangements and its revenue and expense are fully allocated to C&#38;IS and Wealth Management. As discussed above, Northern Trust managed $875.3 billion &#32;in assets as of December 31, 2015 , including $648.0 billion &#32;for C&#38;IS clients and $227.3 billion &#32;for Wealth Management clients. 

Competition 

Northern Trust faces intense competition in all aspects and areas of its business. Competition is provided by both unregulated and regulated financial services organizations, whose products and services span the local, national, and global markets in which Northern Trust conducts operations. Our competitors include a broad range of financial institutions and service companies, including other custodial banks, deposit-taking institutions, asset management firms, benefits consultants, trust companies, investment banking firms, insurance companies, and investment counseling firms. As our businesses grow and markets evolve, we may encounter increasing and new forms of competition around the world. 

Northern Trust&#8217;s principal business strategy is to provide quality financial services to targeted market segments in which it believes it has a competitive advantage and favorable growth prospects. As part of this strategy, Northern Trust seeks to deliver a level of service that distinguishes it from its competitors. In addition, Northern Trust emphasizes the development and growth of recurring sources of fee-based income. Northern Trust seeks to develop and expand its recurring fee-based revenue by identifying select markets with attractive growth characteristics and providing a high level of individualized service to clients in those markets. Northern Trust also seeks to preserve its asset quality through established credit review procedures and to maintain a conservative balance sheet. 

Economic Conditions And Government Policies 

The earnings of Northern Trust are affected by numerous external influences. Chief among these are general economic conditions, both domestic and international, and actions that governments and their central banks take in managing their economies. These general conditions affect all of Northern Trust&#8217;s businesses, as well as the quality, value, and profitability of their loan and investment portfolios. 

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board) implements monetary policy through its open market operations in United States Government securities, its setting of the discount rate at which member banks may borrow from Federal Reserve Banks, and its changes in the reserve requirements for deposits. The policies adopted by the Federal Reserve Board directly affect interest rates and hence what banks earn on their loans and investments and what they pay on their savings and time deposits and other purchased funds. 

Supervision And Regulation 

Northern Trust is subject to extensive regulation under state and federal laws in the United States, as well as the applicable laws of each of the various jurisdictions outside the United States in which Northern Trust does business. The discussion below outlines significant elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to Northern Trust. Changes in these laws or regulations, or their application, cannot be predicted, but may have a material effect on Northern Trust&#8217;s businesses and results of operations. 

FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY REGULATION 

Under U.S. law, the Corporation is a bank holding company that has elected to be a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (BHCA). Consequently, the Corporation and its business activities throughout the world are subject to the supervision, examination, and regulation of the Federal Reserve Board. The BHCA and other federal laws subject bank and financial holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage and to a range of supervisory requirements, including enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations. Supervision and regulation of bank holding companies, financial holding companies, and their subsidiaries are intended primarily for the protection of depositors and other clients of banking subsidiaries, the Deposit Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the banking system as a whole, not for the protection of stockholders or other nondepository creditors. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

2015 Annual Report / Northern Trust Corporation 

&#160; 

Under the BHCA, bank holding companies and their banking subsidiaries are generally limited to the business of banking and activities closely related or incidental to banking. As a financial holding company, the Corporation is permitted to engage in other activities that the Federal Reserve Board determines to be financial in nature, incidental to an activity that is financial in nature, or complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally, or to acquire shares of companies engaged in such activities. Activities defined to be financial in nature include: providing financial or investment advice; securities underwriting and dealing; insurance underwriting; and making merchant banking investments in commercial and financial companies, subject to significant limitations. They also include activities previously determined by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. The Corporation may not, however, directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting shares, or substantially all of the assets, of a bank holding company or a bank, without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. 

In order to maintain the Corporation&#8217;s status as a financial holding company, the Bank, as the Corporation&#8217;s sole insured depository institution subsidiary, must remain &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; and &#8220;well-managed&#8221; under applicable regulations, and must have received at least a &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; rating in its most recent examination under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). In addition, as a result of the amendment of the BHCA by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), as discussed further below, the Corporation must remain &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; and &#8220;well-managed&#8221; in order to maintain its status as a financial holding company. Failure to meet one or more of these requirements would mean, depending on the requirements not met, that the Corporation could not undertake new activities, continue certain activities, or make acquisitions other than those permitted generally for bank holding companies. 

SUBSIDIARY REGULATION 

The Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve System, its deposits are insured by the FDIC up to the maximum authorized limit, and it is subject to regulation by both these agencies. As an Illinois banking corporation, the Bank is also subject to Illinois state laws and regulations and to examination and supervision by the Division of Banking of the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation. The Bank is registered as a government securities dealer in accordance with the Government Securities Act of 1986. As a government securities dealer, its activities are subject to the rules and regulations of the Department of the Treasury. The Bank is also registered as a transfer agent with the Federal Reserve Board and is therefore subject to the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board in this area. 

The Bank is registered provisionally with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) under the Commodity Exchange Act as a swap dealer. As a provisionally registered swap dealer, the Bank is subject to significant regulatory obligations regarding swap activity and the supervision, examination and enforcement power of the CFTC and other regulators. Certain of the Corporation&#8217;s other affiliates are registered with the CFTC as commodity trading advisors or commodity pool operators under the Commodity Exchange Act and are subject to that act and the associated rules and regulations of the CFTC. 

The Corporation&#8217;s nonbanking affiliates are all subject to examination by the Federal Reserve Board. Its broker-dealer subsidiary is registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, subject to the rules and regulations of both of these bodies. The Corporation&#8217;s broker-dealer subsidiary also is registered with the SEC and Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board as a municipal securities dealer. Several subsidiaries of the Corporation are registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and are subject to that act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Other subsidiaries are regulated by state banking departments in various states. The Bank and other subsidiaries of the Corporation act as investment advisers to several mutual funds and other asset managers which are subject to regulation by the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940. 

FUNCTIONAL REGULATION 

Federal banking law has established a system of federal and state supervision and regulation based on functional regulation, meaning that primary regulatory oversight for a particular activity generally resides with the federal or state regulator designated as having the principal responsibility for that activity. Banking is supervised by federal and state banking regulators, insurance by state insurance regulators, derivatives and swaps activities by the CFTC, and securities activities by the SEC and state securities regulators. 

A significant component of the functional regulation relates to the application of federal securities laws and SEC oversight of some bank securities activities. Generally, banks may conduct securities activities without broker-dealer registration only if the activities fall within a set of activity-based exemptions designed to allow banks to conduct only those activities traditionally considered to be primarily banking or trust activities. Securities activities outside these exemptions, as a practical matter, need to be conducted by a registered broker-dealer affiliate. The Investment Advisers Act 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

2015 Annual Report / Northern Trust Corporation 

&#160; 

of 1940 requires the registration of any bank or separately identifiable division of the bank that acts as investment adviser for mutual funds. 

Another component of the functional regulation relates to the application of federal commodity and derivatives laws and CFTC oversight of some bank commodity and derivatives activities, including swap-dealing activities. 

THE DODD-FRANK ACT 

The Dodd-Frank Act has had, and is expected to continue to have, a broad impact on the financial services industry, imposing significant new regulatory and compliance requirements, including the imposition of increased capital, leverage, and liquidity requirements, and numerous other provisions designed to improve supervision and oversight of, and strengthen safety and soundness within, the financial services sector. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act established a new framework of authority to conduct systemic risk oversight within the financial system to be distributed among new and existing federal regulatory agencies, including the Financial Stability Oversight Council, the Federal Reserve Board, and the FDIC. The following items provide a brief description of certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that are most relevant to the Corporation and its subsidiaries, including the Bank. 

Enhanced Prudential Standards. &#32;The Dodd-Frank Act imposed enhanced prudential requirements on U.S. bank holding companies with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets, including the Corporation. The enhanced prudential standards include more stringent risk-based capital, leverage, liquidity, risk management, and stress testing requirements and single counterparty credit limits for large bank holding companies, including the Corporation. The Federal Reserve Board also has the discretion to require these large U.S. bank holding companies to limit their short-term debt, to issue contingent capital instruments, and to provide enhanced public disclosures. The Federal Reserve Board has issued final rules implementing enhanced prudential standards for more stringent risk-based capital, leverage, liquidity, risk management, and stress testing requirements. Under the final rules, the Corporation must submit annual capital plans to the Federal Reserve Board, be subject to supervisor-conducted periodic stress tests to evaluate capital adequacy in adverse economic conditions, conduct capital stress tests, implement enhanced risk management procedures, comply with a liquidity risk management framework (discussed below in &#8220;Liquidity Standards&#8221;), conduct liquidity stress tests, and hold a buffer of liquid assets estimated to meet funding needs during a financial stress event. The Federal Reserve Board also has proposed rules that would implement aggregate credit exposure limits and early remediation requirements that are required to be established under sections 165 and 166 of the Dodd-Frank Act. 

Resolution Planning . &#32;As required by Section 165(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve Board and FDIC have jointly issued a final rule requiring each U.S. bank holding company with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets, including the Corporation, to submit periodically to regulators a resolution plan for such bank holding company&#8217;s rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. In addition, the FDIC has issued a final rule requiring insured depository institutions with more than $50 billion in total assets, including the Bank, to submit to the FDIC periodic plans for resolution in the event of such institution&#8217;s failure. The Corporation and the Bank submitted resolution plans pursuant to these rules in December 2015. If the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC jointly determine that the resolution plan submitted by the Corporation in December 2015 pursuant to Section 165(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act is not credible and the Corporation fails to address the deficiencies in a timely manner, the Corporation could be subject to more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements, restrictions on growth, activities or operations, or be required to divest certain assets or operations. The Corporation and the Bank have and will continue to focus management attention and substantial resources to meet regulatory expectations with respect to resolution planning. A similar directive, the European Union Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), was adopted for European Union credit institutions, including certain of the Bank&#8217;s subsidiaries and branches, effective January 1, 2015. In accordance with applicable Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) guidance, a recovery plan for Northern Trust Global Services Limited (NTGSL), a UK incorporated indirect subsidiary of the Bank, has been prepared and will be reviewed at least annually. Applicable PRA guidance requires institutions to produce resolution planning information in two phases. In accordance with such guidance, a phase 1 resolution plan for NTGSL and the Bank&#8217;s London branch has been prepared and such information will be submitted to the PRA every two years. 

Orderly Liquidation Authority. &#32;Under the Dodd-Frank Act, certain financial companies, such as the Corporation and certain of its covered subsidiaries, can be subjected to a new orderly liquidation authority. For the orderly liquidation authority to apply, the U.S. Treasury Secretary, in consultation with the President of the United States, must make a determination, among other things, that the Corporation is in default or danger of default, the failure of the Corporation and its resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code would have serious adverse effects on financial stability in the United States, no viable private sector alternative is available to prevent the default of the Corporation, and orderly liquidation authority proceedings would mitigate these adverse effects. This determination must be recommended by two-thirds of the FDIC Board of Directors and two-thirds of the Federal Reserve Board. Absent such actions, the Corporation, as a bank holding company, would remain subject to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The orderly liquidation authority became effective in July 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

2015 Annual Report / Northern Trust Corporation 

&#160; 

2010, and rulemaking is proceeding in stages. If the Corporation were subject to orderly liquidation authority, the FDIC would be appointed as its receiver, which would give the FDIC considerable powers to resolve the Corporation, including: (1) the power to remove officers and directors responsible for the Corporation&#8217;s failure and to appoint new directors and officers; (2) the power to assign assets and liabilities to a third party or bridge financial company without the need for creditor consent or prior court review; (3) the ability to differentiate among creditors, including by treating junior creditors better than senior creditors, subject to a minimum recovery right to receive at least what such senior creditors would have received in bankruptcy liquidation; and (4) broad powers to administer the claims process to determine distributions from the assets of the receivership to creditors not transferred to a third party or bridge financial institution. 

The Volcker Rule . The Volcker Rule bans proprietary trading subject to exceptions for market-making, hedging, certain trading activities in U.S. and foreign sovereign debt, certain trading activities of non-U.S. banking entities trading outside the United States, and trading activities related to liquidity management. The Volcker Rule also maintains significant restrictions on sponsoring or investing in certain &#8220;covered funds,&#8221; such as hedge funds or private equity funds. A banking entity may &#8220;organize and offer&#8221; certain private funds only if certain requirements are satisfied. Moreover, a banking entity only may retain a limited ownership interest in such funds, and must monitor and track investments in such covered funds carefully to ensure that the ownership interest in the fund does not exceed regulatory thresholds. A banking entity that sponsors or invests in certain private funds is also restricted from providing credit or other support to the funds or permitting the funds to use the name of the bank. The Volcker Rule requires large banking entities, including the Corporation, to implement a detailed compliance program and, on an annual basis, requires the Chief Executive Officer of the banking entity to attest that the compliance program is reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the rule. Compliance with the Volcker Rule generally has been required since July 21, 2015, but the Federal Reserve Board has extended the conformance period for compliance with certain portions of the prohibition against sponsoring or investing in certain legacy covered funds until July 21, 2017. Northern Trust has conducted an enterprise-wide review of affected activities, taken steps to bring those activities into conformance, and has established an enterprise-wide compliance program to comply with the Volcker Rule. The full impact of the Volcker Rule on Northern Trust ultimately will depend on further interpretation and guidance by the regulatory agencies responsible for its enforcement. Northern Trust is monitoring developments with respect to the Volcker Rule actively and will revise further its operations and compliance programs as appropriate or required. 

Swaps and Other Derivatives. &#32;Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act (Title VII) imposes a new regulatory structure on the over-the-counter derivatives market, including requirements for clearing, exchange trading, capital, margin, reporting, and recordkeeping. In addition, certain derivatives activities are required to be &#8220;pushed out&#8221; of insured depository institutions and conducted in separately capitalized nonbank affiliates. Title VII also will require certain persons to register as a &#8220;major swap participant,&#8221; a &#8220;swap dealer,&#8221; a &#8220;major-security-based swap participant&#8221; or a &#8220;security-based swap dealer.&#8221; The CFTC and SEC have finalized joint rules further defining these entities, and the CFTC, SEC and other U.S. regulators are in the process of adopting regulations to implement Title VII. The CFTC also has finalized many rules applicable to swap dealers and other swap market participants including business conduct standards for swap dealers, reporting and recordkeeping, mandatory central clearing for certain swaps, exchange-trading rules applicable to swaps, and regulatory requirements for cross-border swap activities. The SEC has finalized rules that, among other things, enhance the oversight of clearing and trading entities; require regulatory reporting of security-based swap information and the public dissemination of security-based swap transaction, volume, and pricing information by registered swap data repositories; and define the scope of swap data repository registration requirements, the scope of security-based swap dealer and major-security-based swap participant registration requirements, and certain regulatory requirements for cross-border swap activities. It is anticipated that the SEC will continue with its rulemaking process, which will further clarify, among other things, recordkeeping obligations, central clearing requirements, and exchange-traded requirements for security-based swaps. Additionally, in the fall of 2015, the U.S. banking agencies separately finalized rules requiring the posting and collection of margin by swap entities, including the Corporation and the Bank, for certain uncleared swaps. As noted above, the CFTC and SEC have yet to complete the implementation of Title VII, and the complete regulatory framework for swaps and security-based swaps continues to develop. 

Incentive Compensation Arrangements. &#32;The Dodd-Frank Act requires federal regulators to prescribe regulations or guidelines regarding incentive-based compensation practices at certain large financial institutions. No final rule has been issued to date. 

HOLDING COMPANY SUPPORT UNDER THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE ACT 

The Dodd-Frank Act amended the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) to obligate the Federal Reserve Board to require bank holding companies, such as the Corporation, to serve as a source of financial strength for any subsidiary depository institution. The term &#8220;source of financial strength&#8221; is defined as the ability of a company to provide financial assistance to its insured depository institution subsidiaries in the event of financial distress at such subsidiaries. Under this 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

2015 Annual Report / Northern Trust Corporation 

&#160; 

requirement, the Corporation in the future could be required to provide financial assistance to the Bank should the Bank experience financial distress. 

PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS 

The Corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. The Corporation may pay dividends, repurchase stock, and make other capital distributions only in accordance with a capital plan that has been reviewed by the Federal Reserve Board and as to which the Federal Reserve Board has not objected. A significant source of funds for the Corporation is dividends from the Bank. As a result, the Corporation&#8217;s ability to pay dividends on its common stock will depend on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Corporation in amounts sufficient to service its obligations. Dividend payments from the Bank are subject to Illinois law and to regulatory limitations, generally based on capital levels and current and retained earnings, imposed by various regulatory agencies with authority over the Bank. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends is also subject to regulatory restrictions if paying dividends would impair its profitability, financial condition or cash flow requirements. 

Various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends the Bank can pay to the Corporation without regulatory approval. Approval of the Federal Reserve Board is required for payment of any dividend by a state-chartered bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of its retained net income (as defined by regulatory agencies) for that year combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years. In addition, a state member bank may not pay a dividend in an amount greater than its &#8220;undivided profits,&#8221; as defined, without regulatory and stockholder approval. 

The Bank is also prohibited under federal law from paying any dividends if the Bank is undercapitalized or if the payment of the dividends would cause the Bank to become undercapitalized. In addition, the federal regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a bank or bank holding company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound banking practice. The payment of dividends could, depending on the financial condition of the Bank, be deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. The Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III (as defined and discussed further below) impose additional restrictions on the ability of banking institutions to pay dividends. 

CAPITAL PLANNING AND STRESS TESTING 

The Corporation&#8217;s capital distributions are subject to Federal Reserve Board oversight. The major component of that oversight is the Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) exercise, implementing its capital plan rules. These rules require bank holding companies having $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets (including the Corporation) to submit annual capital plans to their respective Federal Reserve Bank. The Corporation also is required to collect and report certain related data on a quarterly basis to allow the Federal Reserve Board to monitor progress against the annual capital plans. The CCAR exercise is an intensive assessment of the capital adequacy of bank holding companies as well as of the processes used by bank holding companies to assess their capital needs. Through CCAR, the Federal Reserve Board assesses whether bank holding companies have robust, forward-looking capital planning processes that account for their unique risks and that permit continued operations during times of economic and financial stress. The Corporation and other affected bank holding companies may pay dividends, repurchase stock, and make other capital distributions only in accordance with a capital plan that has been reviewed by the Federal Reserve Board and as to which the Federal Reserve Board has not objected. The Federal Reserve Board may object to a capital plan for a number of reasons, including if the capital plan does not show that the covered bank holding company will meet, for each quarter throughout the nine-quarter planning horizon covered by the capital plan, all minimum regulatory capital ratios under applicable capital rules as in effect for that quarter, as well as all minimum regulatory capital ratios on a pro forma basis under the base case and stressful scenarios (including a severely adverse scenario provided by the Federal Reserve Board). The capital plan rules also stipulate that a covered bank holding company may not make a capital distribution, unless after giving effect to the distribution, it will meet all minimum regulatory capital ratios. In evaluating a capital plan, the Federal Reserve considers both quantitative and qualitative factors. Consistent with prior Federal Reserve Board guidance, CCAR rules provide that capital plans contemplating dividend payout ratios exceeding 30% of projected after-tax net income will receive particularly close scrutiny. The Corporation&#8217;s common stock dividend payout ratio was 35.3% &#32;in 2015. 

The Corporation submitted its capital plan to the Federal Reserve Board in January 2015 as part of the Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s 2015 CCAR exercise, and the Federal Reserve Board did not object to the Corporation&#8217;s plan. Due to a change in the capital planning schedule, the Corporation will submit its 2016 capital plan to the Federal Reserve Board by April 5, 2016. The Federal Reserve Board has indicated that it expects to publish either its objection or non-objection to the 2016 capital plan and proposed capital actions, such as dividend payments and share repurchases, by June 30, 2016. The Corporation anticipates announcing its proposed 2016 capital plan distributions shortly thereafter.

&#160; 

In addition to the CCAR stress testing requirements, Federal Reserve Board regulations also include the new Dodd-Frank Act stress tests (DFAST). The CCAR and DFAST requirements substantially overlap, and the Federal Reserve Board implements them at the bank holding company level on a coordinated basis. Under the DFAST regulations, the Corporation is required to undergo regulatory stress tests conducted by the Federal Reserve Board annually, and to conduct internal stress tests pursuant to regulatory requirements semi-annually. The Bank also is required to conduct its own annual internal stress test (although it is permitted to combine certain reporting and disclosure of its stress test results with the results of the Corporation). These requirements involve both company-run and supervisory-run testing of capital under various scenarios, including baseline, adverse and severely adverse scenarios provided by the appropriate banking regulator. Results from the Corporation&#8217;s and the Bank&#8217;s annual company-run stress tests are reported to the appropriate regulators and published. Northern Trust published the results of its company-run stress tests on March 5, 2015, and the results of its company-run mid-cycle stress tests on July 29, 2015. 

CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS 

The regulators view capital levels as important indicators of an institution&#8217;s financial soundness. As a general matter, FDIC-insured depository institutions and their holding companies (including the Bank and the Corporation) are required to maintain minimum capital relative to the amount and types of assets they hold. The final supervisory determination on an institution&#8217;s capital adequacy is based on the regulator&#8217;s assessment of numerous factors. 

The risk-based capital guidelines that apply to the Corporation and the Bank are based upon the 2011 capital accord of the International Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), a committee of central banks and bank supervisors, as implemented by the Federal Reserve Board (Basel III). The Basel III rules are currently being phased in, and will come into full effect by January 1, 2022. 

To implement Basel III for bank holding companies, including the Corporation, the Federal Reserve Board established risk-based and leverage capital guidelines. The federal banking regulators also established risk-based and leverage capital guidelines that FDIC-insured depository institutions, such as the Bank, are required to meet. These regulations are generally similar to those established by the Federal Reserve Board for bank holding companies. The Bank&#8217;s risk-based and leverage capital ratios remained strong at December 31, 2015 , and were well above the minimum regulatory requirements established by U.S. banking regulators. 

Under the final Basel III rules, the Corporation is one of a small number of &#8220;core&#8221; banking organizations. The rules require core banking organizations to have rigorous processes for assessing overall capital adequacy in relation to their total risk profiles, and to disclose publicly certain information about their risk profiles and capital adequacy. In order to implement the capital rules, a core banking organization, such as the Corporation, is required to complete satisfactorily a parallel run, in which it calculates capital requirements under both the Basel III rules and previously effective regulations. The Corporation and the Bank completed their parallel runs in 2014 and are required to use the advanced approaches methodologies to calculate and disclose publicly their risk-based capital ratios. 

Pursuant to the Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s implementation in the final Basel III rules of a provision of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Corporation is subject to a capital floor that is based on the Basel III standardized approach. The Corporation is therefore required to calculate its risk-based capital ratios under both the standardized and advanced approaches, and is subject to the more stringent of the risk-based capital ratios as calculated under the standardized approach and the advanced approach in the assessment of its capital adequacy. 

The risk-based and leverage capital ratios for the Corporation and the Bank, together with the regulatory minimum ratios and the ratios required for classification as &#8220;well-capitalized,&#8221; are provided in the following chart.

In addition to the above, beginning in 2018, advanced approaches institutions, such as the Corporation and the Bank, must comply with a supplementary leverage ratio. Under the supplementary leverage ratio rule, advanced approaches institutions 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

2015 Annual Report / Northern Trust Corporation 

&#160; 

will be subject to a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 3.0%. Insured depository institutions that are advanced approaches institutions, such as the Bank, also will be required to maintain at least a 3.0% supplementary leverage ratio to be considered &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; under the rule. The supplementary leverage ratio differs from the leverage ratio in that the leverage ratio does not take into account certain off-balance-sheet assets and exposures that are reflected in the supplementary leverage ratio. 

Basel III also introduced a capital conservation buffer, requiring banking organizations to hold a buffer of common equity Tier 1 capital above the minimum risk-based capital requirements in an amount ranging from at least 0.625% in 2016 to at least 2.5% in 2019. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking organizations with a common equity Tier 1 ratio above the minimum but below the conservation buffer may face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of such shortfall. Basel III also introduced a &#8220;countercyclical buffer&#8221; of 0% to 2.5% of a banking organization&#8217;s total risk-weighted assets for advanced approaches banking organizations, such as the Corporation, which is intended to create a capital buffer for such banking organizations during expansionary economic phases in order to protect against declines in asset prices if credit conditions weaken. In general, the amount of the countercyclical capital buffer is a weighted average of the countercyclical capital buffer established in the various jurisdictions in which the banking organization has credit exposures. 

LIQUIDITY STANDARDS 

In addition to capital adequacy standards, Basel III introduced two quantitative liquidity standards: a liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and a net stable funding ratio (NSFR). The LCR is intended to promote the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of covered banking organizations, improve the banking industry&#8217;s ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress, and improve the measurement and management of liquidity risk. In September 2014, the U.S. banking agencies finalized rules to implement the LCR in the United States for large banking organizations, such as the Corporation and the Bank. Among other things, the finalized LCR rules require covered banking organizations, which include the Corporation and the Bank, to maintain an amount of high-quality liquid assets (HQLAs) equal to or greater than 100% of the banking organization&#8217;s total net cash outflows over a thirty-calendar-day standardized supervisory liquidity stress scenario. The LCR is being phased in, with full implementation beginning on January 1, 2017. Currently, Northern Trust is required to calculate its LCR on a monthly basis. Daily calculation of the LCR will be required beginning in July 2016. Additionally, on November 24, 2015, the Federal Reserve Board proposed rules that would require large banking organizations, such as the Corporation, to disclose publicly certain LCR information on a quarterly basis. 

The NSFR requires banking organizations to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to the composition of their assets and off-balance-sheet activities. More specifically, the NSFR requires that the ratio of available stable funding relative to the amount of required stable funding be equal to at least 100% on an ongoing basis. The Basel Committee finalized its NSFR rules in October 2014, to be implemented by the Federal Reserve Board as a minimum standard by January 1, 2018. The Federal Reserve Board has not yet issued a proposal to implement the NSFR. 

The enhanced prudential standards (discussed above) specify certain liquidity risk management practices to be followed by covered large U.S. banks and bank holding companies, including the Corporation and the Bank. These practices include an independent review of liquidity risk management and the establishment of cash flow projections, a contingency funding plan, and liquidity risk limits. The Corporation&#8217;s Board of Directors (Board) also is required to establish and maintain a liquidity buffer of unencumbered HQLAs based on the results of internal liquidity stress testing. This liquidity buffer must be tailored to Northern Trust&#8217;s business risks and is in addition to other liquidity requirements, such as the LCR and NSFR discussed above. The enhanced prudential standards also establish requirements and responsibilities for the Board of Directors and its Business Risk Committee with respect to liquidity risk management. The enhanced prudential standards require Northern Trust to engage in liquidity stress testing under multiple stress scenarios and time horizons tailored to its specific products and risk profile. In January 2015, the Board of Directors approved a new Liquidity Management Policy establishing the principles and guidelines for the Corporation to govern the processes and activities for the management of its liquidity position. Among other matters, this Policy includes limits and thresholds related to the enhanced prudential standards liquidity buffer and the LCR. 

PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION 

The FDIC Improvement Act of 1991 requires the appropriate federal banking regulator to take &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards. While these regulations apply only to banks, such as the Bank, the Federal Reserve Board is authorized to take appropriate action against a parent bank holding company, such as the Corporation, based on the under-capitalized status of any banking subsidiary. In certain instances, the Corporation would be required to guarantee the performance of the capital restoration plan for its under-capitalized banking subsidiary. 

As noted above, in December 2011, the Federal Reserve Board issued proposed rules to implement requirements in Section 165 and 166 of the Dodd-Frank Act to establish stricter prudential standards for U.S. bank holding companies with 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

2015 Annual Report / Northern Trust Corporation 

&#160; 

total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more. The proposed rule incorporates the Section 166 &#8220;early remediation requirements.&#8221; Similar to prompt corrective action, the early remediation requirements would require firms subject to the proposal to take increasingly stringent corrective measures as the firm&#8217;s financial condition deteriorates. No final rule implementing Section 166 has been issued to date and the final rules implementing Section 165 indicate that the Federal Reserve Board is continuing to consider the comments it received to the proposal. 

RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES AND INSIDERS 

As an insured depository institution, the Bank is subject to restrictions which govern transactions between FDIC-insured banks and any affiliated entity, whether that entity is the Corporation, as the bank&#8217;s parent holding company, a holding company affiliate of the Bank or a subsidiary of the Bank. Regulation W restrictions apply to certain &#8220;covered transactions,&#8221; including extensions of credit, issuance of guarantees, investments or asset purchases. In general, these restrictions require that any extensions of credit must be secured fully with qualifying collateral and are limited, as to any one of the Corporation or such nonbank affiliates, to 10% of the Bank&#8217;s capital stock and surplus, and, as to the Corporation and all such nonbank affiliates in the aggregate, to 20% of the Bank&#8217;s capital stock and surplus. These restrictions are also applied to transactions between the Bank and its financial subsidiaries. Furthermore, these transactions must be on terms and conditions that are, or in good faith would be, offered to nonaffiliated companies (i.e., at arm&#8217;s length). 

The Dodd-Frank Act generally enhanced the restrictions on transactions with affiliates under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, including an expansion of the definition of &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; to include credit exposures related to derivatives, repurchase agreements and securities lending arrangements, and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered credit transactions must be satisfied. The definition of &#8220;affiliate&#8221; was expanded to include any investment fund to which the Corporation or an affiliate serves as an investment adviser. The ability of the Federal Reserve Board to grant exemptions from these restrictions was also narrowed, including by requiring coordination with other bank regulators. In addition, the provision in Section 23A that had permitted the Bank to engage in covered transactions with a financial subsidiary of the Bank in an amount greater than 10% (but less than 20%) of the Bank&#8217;s capital and surplus has been eliminated. 

The restrictions on loans to directors, executive officers, principal stockholders and their related interests (collectively referred to herein as &#8220;insiders&#8221;) contained in the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O apply to all federally insured institutions, including the Bank. These restrictions include, among others, limits on loans to one borrower and conditions that must be met before such a loan can be made. There is also an aggregate limitation on all loans (including credit exposures related to derivatives, repurchase agreements and securities lending arrangements) to insiders and their related interests. These loans cannot exceed the institution&#8217;s total unimpaired capital and surplus, and the FDIC may determine that a lesser amount is appropriate. Insiders are subject to enforcement actions for knowingly accepting loans in violation of applicable restrictions. The Dodd-Frank Act enhanced these restrictions and also imposed restrictions on the purchase or sale of assets between banking institutions and insiders. 

ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING, ANTI-TERRORISM LEGISLATION, AND OFFICE OF FOREIGN ASSETS CONTROL 

The Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, which contains anti-money laundering (AML) and financial transparency provisions and requires implementation of regulations applicable to financial services companies, including standards for verifying client identification and monitoring client transactions and detecting and reporting suspicious activities. AML laws outside the U.S. contain similar requirements. The Corporation and its subsidiaries have implemented policies, procedures and internal controls that are designed to comply with all applicable AML laws and regulations. Compliance with applicable AML and related requirements is a common area of review for financial regulators, and the Corporation&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; level of compliance with these requirements could result in fines, penalties, lawsuits, regulatory sanctions or difficulties in obtaining approvals, restrictions on their business activities or harm to their reputation. 

The U.S. Department of the Treasury&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is responsible for requiring that U.S. entities do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties, as defined by various Executive Orders and Acts of Congress. OFAC publishes lists of persons, organizations and countries suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, known as Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons. If the Corporation or the Bank finds a name on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, the Corporation or the Bank must freeze or block such account or transaction, file a suspicious activity report and notify the appropriate authorities. 

Many other countries have imposed similar laws and regulations that apply to the Corporation&#8217;s non-U.S. offices. The Corporation has established policies and procedures to comply with these laws and the related regulations in all relevant jurisdictions.

DEPOSIT INSURANCE AND ASSESSMENTS 

The Bank accepts deposits, and those deposits have the benefit of FDIC insurance up to the applicable limit. The current limit for FDIC insurance for deposit accounts is $250,000 for each depositor account. Under the FDIA, insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the insured depository institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by a bank&#8217;s federal regulatory agency. The FDIC&#8217;s Deposit Insurance Fund is funded by assessments on insured depository institutions. Certain liquid assets are excluded from the deposit insurance assessment base of custody banks that satisfy certain institutional eligibility criteria. This has the effect of reducing the amount of deposit insurance fund insurance premiums due from custody banks. In October 2015, the FDIC proposed a surcharge assessment on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more, such as the Bank, in connection with the Dodd-Frank Act requirement to increase the Deposit Insurance Fund&#8217;s minimum reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35% without increasing the assessments of small insured depository institutions. 

MONEY MARKET MUTUAL FUNDS 

On July 23, 2014, the SEC approved final rules implementing money market mutual fund reform, which, among other things, require institutional prime money market funds to maintain a floating net asset value and implement procedures that may restrict redemption in certain circumstances through the imposition of liquidity fees and gates against investor redemptions. The implementation of these rules will occur in phases through October 2016. Money market mutual fund reforms also have been proposed by the European Union (EU). A legislative proposal for a regulation on money market mutual funds was published by the EU on April 9, 2013, although the legislative process with respect to the proposed regulation is continuing and the timing of its completion remains unclear. On November 25, 2015, the EU adopted a regulation on securities financing transactions and reuse of collateral as part of its approach to addressing shadow banking. The regulation includes provisions for enhanced transparency and reporting of securities financing transactions, and began to be phased in beginning January 12, 2016. Further regulation containing the technical detail of the regulation has yet to be published, which will delay the effective date of certain provisions. 

COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT 

The Bank is subject to the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). The CRA and the regulations issued thereunder are intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their service areas, including low and moderate income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operations of the banks. These regulations also provide for regulatory assessment of a bank&#8217;s record in meeting the needs of its service area when considering applications to establish branches, merger applications, and applications to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of another bank. In October 2012, the Federal Reserve Board, the federal regulator responsible for monitoring the Bank&#8217;s CRA compliance, approved the designation of the Bank as a &#8220;wholesale bank.&#8221; As a result of this designation, the Bank fulfills its CRA obligations by making qualified investments for the purposes of community development, rather than retail CRA loans. Federal banking agencies are required to make public the rating of a bank&#8217;s performance under the CRA. The Bank received an &#8220;outstanding&#8221; CRA rating from the Federal Reserve Board in its most recent CRA examination. 

PRIVACY AND SECURITY 

Federal law establishes a minimum federal standard of financial privacy by, among other provisions, requiring financial institutions to adopt and disclose privacy policies with respect to consumer information and setting forth certain limitations on disclosure to third parties of consumer information. The Corporation has adopted and disseminated its privacy policies pursuant to law. Regulations adopted under the federal law set standards for protecting the security, confidentiality and integrity of client information, and require notice to regulators, and in some cases, to clients, in the event of security breaches. A number of states and the EU have adopted their own statutes concerning financial privacy and security and requiring notification of security breaches. 

CONSUMER LAWS AND REGULATIONS 

The Corporation&#8217;s banking subsidiaries are subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with clients and monitor account activity when taking deposits, making loans to or engaging in other types of transactions with such clients. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could lead to substantial penalties, operating restrictions and reputational damage to the financial institution. The Dodd-Frank Act established an independent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) within the Federal Reserve System. The CFPB was tasked with establishing and implementing rules and regulations under certain federal consumer protection laws with respect to the conduct of providers of certain consumer financial products and services. The creation of the CFPB by the Dodd-Frank Act is likely to lead to enhanced and strengthened enforcement of consumer financial protection laws.

&#160; 

NON-U.S. REGULATION 

Northern Trust&#8217;s non-U.S. branches and subsidiaries are subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of the jurisdictions in which they operate. For example, branches and subsidiaries conducting banking, fund administration and asset servicing businesses in the United Kingdom are authorized to do so pursuant to the UK Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. They are authorized by the PRA or the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and regulated by the FCA and, in some instances, also the PRA. The PRA and FCA exercise broad supervisory and disciplinary powers that include the power to revoke temporarily or permanently authorization to conduct a regulated business upon breach of the relevant regulations, suspend registered employees, and impose censures and fines on both regulated businesses and their regulated employees. 

Northern Trust&#8217;s European branches and subsidiaries are subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of the European Economic Area (EEA). Moreover, Northern Trust&#8217;s non-European branches and subsidiaries conducting financial services activities also may be within the scope of these laws, given the increasing extraterritorial effect of European legislation. 

On July 23, 2014, the EU published a directive, referred to as UCITS V, on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities. UCITS V will go into effect on March 18, 2016, subject to certain grandfathering provisions. Although secondary legislation setting out technical details and regulatory guidance with respect to UCITS V have yet to be adopted, UCITS V will introduce rules for a depositary, rules on remuneration policies for certain staff and a sanctions regime for noncompliance. 

A number of other regulations that may affect Northern Trust&#8217;s operations have been or currently are being implemented in Europe, including the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD), the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR), the Capital Requirements Directive IV (CRD IV), the FCA&#8217;s Client Assets Sourcebook rules (CASS), revisions to the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) and the BRRD. The EU and some member states also are considering bank structural reform. On January 29, 2014, the EU published a proposal that would prohibit proprietary trading by in-scope banking groups and potentially require that trading activities only be carried out by a trading entity legally, economically and operationally separate from the deposit-taking entities within the banking group. The legislative process is continuing and the timing and content of the final legislative act remains unclear. Northern Trust works diligently to comply with applicable EU rules and regulations, and also monitors the development of EU proposals that might create challenges or opportunities for it. 

Additionally, the Bank&#8217;s and the Corporation&#8217;s subsidiary banks located outside the United States are subject to regulatory capital requirements in the jurisdictions in which they operate. As of December 31, 2015 , each of our non-U.S. banking subsidiaries had capital ratios above their specified minimum requirements. 

Staff 

Northern Trust employed approximately 16,200 &#32;full-time equivalent staff members as of December 31, 2015 .
