 ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS 

We sell stevioside, a natural sweetener, and herbs used in traditional Chinese medicines and veterinary products. Substantially all of our operations are located in the People's Republic of China (the "PRC"). We have built an integrated company with the sourcing and production capabilities designed to meet the needs of our customers. 

During fiscal 2016 and 2015, our operations were organized into two operating segments related to our product lines: 

&#160; - 

&#160; Stevioside, and 

&#160; - 

&#160; Chinese medicines. 

STEVIOSIDE - A NATURAL SWEETENER 

In our Stevioside segment, we produce and sell a variety of purified steviol glycosides with rebaudioside A and stevioside as the principal components, an all natural, low calorie sweetener, and OnlySweet, a stevioside based table top sweetener. In fiscal years 2016 and 2015, our Stevioside segment generated revenues of $15.6 million and $15.2 million, representing 87% and 87% of our total consolidated revenues, respectively. 

The steviol glycosides are extracted from the leaves of the stevia rebaudiana plant of the Aster/Chrysanthemum family. The sweetness of the stevia leaves is caused by eight glycosides contained within the leaves including stevioside, rebaudioside A, C, D, E and F, steviolbioside and dulcoside A. Stevioside is the most abundant of these components and the main cause for the sweetness of the stevia leaves. Stevioside, rebaudiosides A and C as well as dulcoside A are known as the four most important steviol glycosides. Rebaudioside A is the sweetest and least bitter ingredient among the four. The higher purity of rebaudioside A brings better sensory attributes of the sweetener products. 

The leaves of the stevia rebaudiana plant have been used for centuries to sweeten bitter beverages and to make tea in the plant's native Paraguay. Stevia is grown commercially in Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, Central America, Israel, Thailand and China. The stevia rebaudiana plant was first introduced to China in 1977 and commercial harvesting of stevia started in the mid-1980's. There are two major species of stevia grown in China; one was cultivated by Chinese researchers and another was introduced from Japan. Most stevioside produced in China is exported throughout Asia, primarily to Japan and South Korea meanwhile Chinese domestic market demand is also gradually building up in recent years. 

Worldwide use of Stevioside and Related Approvals 

Stevioside is a safe and natural alternative to sugar for people needing low sugar or low calorie diets. Stevioside can be used to replace sugar in beverages and foods, including those that require baking or cooking where man-made chemical based sweetener replacements are not suitable. Stevioside may be used in a wide variety of consumer products including soft drinks, vegetable products, tabletop sweeteners, confectioneries, fruit products and processed seafood products in the United States, Japan, Korea, China, Taiwan, India, Indonesia, Israel, Germany, France, Brazil, Paraguay, Malaysia, Russia, Switzerland Australia and New Zealand. 

We believe worldwide demand for alternative sweeteners, such as our stevia based products, will increase as more countries permit the use of stevioside as a food additive. Stevioside has been sanctioned by the Ministry of Health of China to be used as a food additive, and is listed in the Sanitation Standard of Food Additives. 

The ongoing advocacy to eliminate the European Union's (EU) ban on the consumption of stevia was confirmed by the European Commission in November 2011. The European Stevia Research Center and the European Stevia Association are EU based organizations that focus on stevioside research and the elimination of the EU's ban on the consumption of stevioside. These organizations have determined that stevia is safe for use in foods. In addition, in June 2007, the Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives concluded that steviol glycoside showed no adverse affects and was stable for use in food and acidic beverages under normal conditions and in June 2008 extended its recommendation for acceptable daily intake of up to 4 mg per kg body weight per day. 

&#160;

&#160; 

In April 2010, at the request from the European Commission, the European Food Safety Authority's scientific Panel on additives known as the ANS Panel assessed the safety of steviol glycosides, sweeteners extracted from plant leaves, and established an acceptable daily intake for their safe use. This assessment is being considered by the European Commission in deciding whether or not to authorize the substances in the EU for their proposed use, particularly in sugar free or reduced energy foods such as certain flavored drinks, confectionery with no added sugar or energy reduced soups. The toxicological testing conducted by the ANS Panel showed that the stevia based substances are neither genotoxic nor carcinogenic, nor are they linked to any adverse effects on the human reproductive system or for the developing child. The ANS Panel set an acceptable daily intake of 4 mg per kg body weight per day for steviol glycosides, a level consistent with that already established by the Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives. 

In July 2011, the EU Standing Committee on Food Chain and Animal Health announced that steviol glucoside derived from the stevia plant was safe for use in food ingredients throughout the 27 countries of the EU. In November 2011, the European Commission formally authorized the use of steviol glucoside derived from the stevia plant as a non-caloric sweetener for EU-wide use. 

On March 23, 2010, we received a "no objection letter" from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") regarding our request for FDA Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) status on five of our stevia extract products, including Rebaudioside A 98, Rebaudioside A 95, Rebaudioside A 80, Rebaudioside A 60, and Stevioside 90 Stevia Extracts. The FDA affirmed GRAS status confirms that these stevia extracts are considered safe for use as a general purpose sweetener in foods, excluding meat and poultry products. This affirmation was based on our conclusion which is supported by the extensive independent review of our production processes and the overall quality of these stevia products by a panel of qualified scientists. 

In furtherance of our efforts to move toward production of organic, all natural and low calorie products and to enhance our international position and market penetration as a stevia producer along with our distribution partners around the world, we underwent an extensive audit in 2011 by CERES GmbH, an international organization that specializes in inspection and certification in the areas of organic farming and food processing. Upon completion of their audit in November 2011, CERES GmbH notified us that our stevia extracts production process had been certified organic and free of synthetic chemical inputs and uses clean and sanitized procedures that avoid chemical contamination under standards established by the USDA National Organic Program and European Commission (EC) 834/2007 and EC 889/2008. 

In fiscal 2015, our stevia products have obtained certification of National Organic Program (NOP Certificate No: 50OGA1400229) and certification of non-genetically modified organisms ("Non-GMO") with the ID number of 52462. NOP is the federal regulatory framework governing organic food. Certification is handled by state, non-profit and private agencies that have been approved by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). NOP regulations cover in detail all aspects of food production, processing, delivery and retail sale. Under the NOP, farmers and food processors who wish to use the word "organic" in reference to their businesses and products, must be certified organic. A USDA Organic seal identifies products with at least 95% organic ingredients. 

Steviosin 

Steviosin is a natural low calorie stevia extract for medicinal use, containing stevioside at 90% with the total steviol glycosides meeting or exceeding 95% on a dry weight basis. Steviosin is used as an alternative sweetener in the pharmaceutical production in China. 

OnlySweet 

OnlySweet is an all natural, zero calorie, tabletop sweetener comprised of three natural ingredients, including stevioside. In June 2008 we began production of a new blend of OnlySweet increasing its sweetness. We believe this OnlySweet formulation represented a significant advancement in quality resulting in a sweeter and more natural taste compared to other manufacturers of stevioside based sweeteners. We believe consumers are attracted to these improvements in taste, absence of aftertaste and overall mouth feel of this new blend of OnlySweet. OnlySweet is manufactured in the United States at an FDA approved blending facility. 

In March 2014, we entered an exclusively 5-year distribution agreement with Qingdao Dongfang Tongxiang International Trading Co., Ltd, and authorized them to use the trademark "OnlySweet" to sell the Company's Stevia products.

Our Customers 

The majority of our stevioside is sold on a wholesale basis to domestic food and drug manufacturers and ingredient distributor foreign trade companies. Our top 10 customers accounted for 61% of our sales in the Stevioside segment in fiscal 2016. Our biggest customers Qufu Shengwang Import and Export Trade Co., Ltd., a related party, accounted for 48% and 40% respectively, of our stevioside sales in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015. We do not have long term supply agreements with our customers and sales are generally made under a purchase order arrangement. The payment terms are generally 60 to 90 days after receipt of products. We control the default risk by conducting due diligence on the customers' credit record before acceptance of a purchase order. 

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials - Stevioside 

The Shandong Province is a primary harvesting base of stevia leaves as well as the main region for the production of stevioside in China. We purchase all raw materials directly from local suppliers at market prices and pay for the leaves at the time of purchase. We test stevia leaves prior to purchase in an effort to maintain quality control. Our internal policy is to purchase leaves with stevioside content in excess of 9%. 

Manufacturing, Extraction and Packaging 

We have been engaged in the continuous production of stevioside since 1998. We use a traditional extraction technology process known as "aqueous extraction" which involves the use of purified water extraction and air dehydration to produce stevioside. The extraction process for stevioside generally takes seven days. The plant leaves are first dried and then inspected to insure quality leaves are used in the extraction process. We then use a combined process involving a solid/liquid extraction procedure, followed by a liquid-purifying step that is traditionally used to extract the stevioside from the stevia leaves. This all natural method results in a pure white stevia crystal, with no brownish coloring. Once the extraction process has been completed, the final product is ready for packaging and shipment to our customers. We bulk package our stevioside in 10 kilogram packages, two per box. 

In July 2008, our stevioside manufacturing facility located in the Shuyuan Economic Zone of Qufu City, of the Shandong Province received a Certificate of Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) from the PRC. 

In early 2011, our stevia production facility operated by Qufu Shengren received ISO 22000 and ISO 9001:2008 integrated process and systems certifications, in addition to HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points) certification from SGS S.A. and its country head offices in UK and China for this facility. SGS is one of the world's leading inspection, verification, testing and certification companies. 

The ISO certifications cover all of the processes throughout the production cycle that deal directly or indirectly with the end product being consumed and quality management principles. These certifications together with our comprehensive management system demonstrate the safety of our stevia products and our compliance with the requirements for food safety management systems by incorporating all the elements of GMP and HACCP. HACCP Certification is an international principle defining the requirements for effective control of food safety. HACCP compliance and certification demonstrates our focus on the hazards that affect food safety and hygiene and systematic identification of such by setting up control limits at critical points during the food production process. By achieving these high level certifications, we have further demonstrated our commitment to quality, safety and continuous improvement. 

In December 2012, Qufu Shengren finished the construction of a new stevia extraction line in the same location of its current stevioside manufacturing facility. This line facility applies a new stevia extraction technology to produce both high and low grade stevioside. The annual production capacity of this line facility is 500 metric tons including 300 metric tons of high purity rebaudioside A products and 200 metric tons of low purity Rebaudioside A product. 

Since January 2014, our facilities have the capability of producing A3-99 stevia products, which is the highest quality stevioside extracts produced in the world and are used in the pharmaceutical and food industries. We generated $327,808 and $405,497 in revenue from producing over 3.3 metric tons and 3.9 metric tons of A3-99 in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Since fiscal 2014, our facilities have the capability of producing Enzyme treated stevia, which is one of the most advanced types of steviosides produced in the world for use in the food and beverage industries. We generated $3,571,271 and $2,819,308 in revenue from producing over 69.9 metric tons and 37.2 metric tons of Enzyme treated stevia in fiscal 2015.

&#160; 

&#160;

In fiscal 2015 and 2016, we have invested approximately one million dollars, including in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 we have invested $402,000 and $670,000, respectively, to start building a new facility with annual capacity of 500 metric tons in order to meet substantially increased demand for its high-grade stevia products. The new manufacturing facility is fully equipped with stainless steel equipment and a fully automated system in order to prevent any potential contamination from operators and plastic. In addition, the new manufacturing facility uses the most advanced production equipment that is the first time to be used for stevia production in the industry, such as scraper with centrifuge and fluidized drying system. 

As of now, Sunwin Stevia has approximately 1,200 metric tons in manufacturing capacity per year to produce high-grade stevia extract. With these manufacturing facilities, Sunwin Stevia is able to deliver stevia products containing Rebaudioside A in a range of 50% to 99% with a format of powder, granular, or tablet. 

We set our production schedules based on the market demand and our capacity. Our total stevioside production capacity is approximately 1,200 metric tons annually which we believe is sufficient to meet demand. In fiscal 2016, we manufactured approximately 576 metric tons of stevioside, an increase of 210 metric tons from the prior year, to better supply the market demand. 

CHINESE MEDICINE SEGMENT 

In our Chinese medicine segment, we manufacture and sell traditional Chinese medicine formula extracts which are used in products made for use by both humans and animals. In fiscal 2016 and 2015, this segment generated revenues of $2.4 million and $2.3 million, representing 13% and 13% of our total consolidated revenues, respectively. 

Chinese herbal medicine has been applied as a means of both the prevention and treatment of illness and disease. We believe many modern chemical medicines contain high toxicities and present numerous side effects. Purely chemical based medicines are difficult, time consuming and expensive to develop. We believe natural Chinese traditional medicines represent an alternative approach offering advantages over a variety of chemical medicines and the process of combining herbal extraction and chemical medicines is becoming a popular alternative, following the current trends of "natural" and "green" products in a variety of industries. 

We manufactured and sold approximately 199 different extracts in fiscal 2016, compared to 236 different extracts in fiscal 2015. These extracts, can be divided into the following three general categories: 

&#160; - 

&#160; single traditional Chinese medicine extracts; 

&#160; - 

&#160; compound traditional Chinese medicine extracts; and 

&#160; - 

&#160; purified extracts, including active parts and monomer compounds such as soy isoflavone. 

Our Customers 

We sell our traditional Chinese medicine formula extracts on a wholesale basis to domestic traditional Chinese medicine manufacturers and animal pharmaceutical manufacturers primarily located in China. In fiscal year 2016, we have no customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company's revenue. In fiscal year 2015, Beijing Haomiao Huifeng Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd, accounted for 10.2% of our Chinese medicine sales. We do not have contracts with our customers and sales are made under a purchase order arrangement. We deliver upon the acceptance of a purchase order with no deposit required. The payment terms are generally 60 to 90 days after receipt of products. We control the default risk by conducting due diligence on the customers' credit record before acceptance of a purchase order. 

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials - Chinese Medicines 

We purchase raw materials for our traditional Chinese medicine formula extracts on the open market at market prices. The prices of raw materials for Chinese medicines fell back to and steadily stay on the downward track since fiscal 2012 due to effective measures by Chinese governments to tame speculations on raw materials and the increase of market supply from harvest season. 

In fiscal 2016, our top five suppliers represented approximately 54% of our purchases of raw materials used in our Chinese medicine segment. In fiscal 2015, our top five suppliers represented approximately 59% of our purchases of raw materials used in our Chinese medicine segment, including Shandong Heze Zhongshun Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Gansu Fanzhi Bio Tech Co., Ltd and Qufu Longheng Fuel Material Co., Ltd. respectively accounting for 11.6%, 13.1% and 16.4% of our total supply purchase.

Formulation, Manufacturing and Packaging 

The extract formulas used in our manufacturing are either commonly used formulas published in the National Medicine Dictionary or industry standard formulas which may have been developed by university research scientists or internally developed by our research and development personnel. Internally developed formulas must be approved by the Shandong Bureau of Quality and Technical Supervision prior to public use. 

NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT 

&#160; We engage in new product development both through our internal research facilities, industry consultants and specialists to provide research and development for the planting of stevia plants, for the development of biological methods to improve lower-grade stevia product to higher grade stevia, and applying biological method to change the taste of stevia to meet market demand. In partnership with a number of research facilities in the PRC including: 

&#160; - 

&#160; Tianfulai Bio-Tech Technology Co., Ltd. (Beijing), where we are seeking to develop the traditional Chinese medicine polysaccharide anthone extract powder for forage; 

&#160; - 

&#160; Beijing Medical University and China Agriculture University; and 

&#160; - 

&#160; Shandong Chinese Medicine University. 

We pay for the use of these facilities on an as needed basis and the costs are included in our research and development expenses. In fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 we spent approximately $836,000 and $254,000, respectively, on research and development. 

&#160; 

In fiscal 2015 and 2016, we have invested approximately one million dollars, including in fiscal 2016 and in fiscal 2015 we have invested $402,000 and $670,000, respectively, to start building a new facility with annual capacity of 500 metric tons in order to meet substantially increased demand for its high-grade stevia products. The new manufacturing facility is fully equipped with stainless steel equipment without any plastic while it has a fully automated system in order to prevent any potential contamination from operators and plastic. In addition, the new manufacturing facility uses the most advanced production equipment that is the first time to be used for stevia production in the industry, such as scraper with centrifuge and fluidized drying system. 

As of now, Sunwin Stevia has approximately 1,200 metric tons in manufacturing capacity per year to produce high-grade stevia extract. With these manufacturing facilities, Sunwin Stevia is able to deliver stevia products containing Rebaudioside A in a range of 50% to 99% with a format of powder, granular, or tablet. 

Competition 

Our subsidiaries and the business segments operate with unique challenges and extensive competition. 

Stevioside . There are approximately 30 stevioside manufacturers operating on a continuing basis in China. Our primary competitors in the stevioside market are Ganzhou Julong High Technology Food Industry Co., Ltd., GLG Live Tech Corp. and PureCircle Limited. While these competitors have production capacity similar to ours, we believe we are able to compete effectively with them based on our production capabilities and product quality. In addition, other companies periodically enter the market depending upon demand. These intermittent producers may choose to stop production when raw materials are not readily available in the marketplace. The sporadic oversupply of product from these competitors can adversely affect our market share. Furthermore, if demand wanes these competitors may reduce the price of their products, which can adversely affect market prices. In addition to competing with other Chinese companies, we also compete with foreign growers and processors. 

We are one of the few steviosin manufacturers that are GMP certified and granted with drug approval number. We believe that the combination of eligibility to supply pharmaceutical ingredients and capability for stevia extraction provides us with a competitive advantage compared to our competitors, most of whom are either not eligible to supply pharmaceutical ingredients or not experienced in large-scale stevia extraction. 

Chinese medicine . The market in the PRC for traditional Chinese medicine extracts is extremely competitive. We believe there are more than 500 companies engaged in herb extraction in the PRC. Companies in many different industries, including pharmaceutical companies, chemical companies, health products companies, herb extraction companies, biological engineering companies and research and development institutions, are now engaged in herb extraction. Our major competitors include Anhui Xuancheng Baicao Plants Industry &#38; Trade Co., Ltd., Sichuan Shifangkangyuan Medicine Materials Co., Ltd. and Lanzhou Lantai Bio-Engineering Tech Co., Ltd. Most products from these companies are exported to overseas markets. Competitive factors primarily include price and quality. We believe our ability to compete is related to our product quality and reputation in the market place. Globally, we believe we will be able to effectively compete against similar companies from other countries as a result of our lower labor costs and China's soil and growing conditions, which enable us to produce higher quality products. 

&#160;

&#160; 

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 

Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property which includes various raw materials purification technologies used in our products. We have received a trademark from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office covering the trade name "OnlySweet", which we are using for the North American distribution of our stevia based tabletop sweetener product. 

&#160; 

To protect our proprietary rights outside the PRC we generally rely on confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties, and agreements with consultants, vendors and customers, although we have not signed such agreements in every case. We do not have any similar agreements with any of our employees or consultants in the PRC. Despite such protections, a third party could, without authorization, utilize our propriety technologies without our consent. In the past three of our traditional Chinese medicine products have been copied by our competitors. We can give no assurance that our agreements with employees, consultants and others who participate in the production of our products will not be breached, or that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our proprietary technologies will not otherwise become known or independently developed by competitors. 

GOVERNMENT REGULATION 

Our business and operations are primarily located in the PRC. We are subject to state and local environmental laws related to certification of water release. We are subject to registration and inspection by the State Food and Drug Administration of China ("SFDA") with respect to the manufacturing and distribution of traditional Chinese medicine extracts and steviosides. In addition, we are licensed by the Shandong Provincial Government to manufacture stevioside. We believe we are in compliance with all provisions of those registrations, inspections and licenses and have no reason to believe that they will not be renewed as required by the applicable rules of the Central Government and the Shandong Province. In addition, our operations must conform to general governmental regulations and rules for private (non-state owned) companies doing business in China. 

The production, distribution and sale of our products in the United States is subject to various federal and state regulations, including but not limited to: the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act ("FDCA"); the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994; the Occupational Safety and Health Act; various environmental statutes; and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products. 

Compliance with applicable federal and state regulations is essential to our business. Although we believe that we are in compliance with applicable regulations, should the FDA or any state in which we operate amend its guidelines or impose more stringent interpretations of current laws or regulations, we may not be able to comply with these new guidelines. Such regulations could require the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards, market withdrawal or discontinuation of certain products we are unable to reformulate, imposition of additional record keeping requirements, expanded documentation regarding the properties of certain products, expanded or different labeling and/or additional scientific substantiation. Failure to comply with applicable requirements could result in sanctions being imposed on us or the manufacturers of any of our products, including but not limited to fines, injunctions, product recalls, seizures and criminal prosecution. 

The FDCA generally regulates ingredients added to foods and requires that such ingredients making up a food product are themselves safe for their intended uses. In this regard, when a company adds an ingredient to a food, the FDCA generally requires that the ingredient either be determined by the company to be generally regarded as safe by qualified experts or go through FDA's review and approval process as a food additive. 

PRC Legal System 

Despite efforts to develop its legal system over the past several decades, including but not limited to legislation dealing with economic matters such as foreign investment, corporate organization and governance, commerce, taxation and trade, the PRC continues to lack a comprehensive system of laws. Further, the laws that do exist in the PRC are often vague, ambiguous and difficult to enforce, which could negatively affect our ability to do business in China and compete with other companies in our segments. 

In September 2006, the Ministry of Commerce ("MOFCOM") promulgated the Regulations on Foreign Investors' Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises (M&#38;A Regulations) in an effort to better regulate foreign investment in China. The M&#38;A Regulations were adopted in part as a needed codification of certain joint venture formation and operating practices, and also in response to the government's increasing concern about protecting domestic companies in perceived key industries and those associated with national security, as well as the outflow of well-known trademarks, including traditional Chinese brands. 

&#160; 

- 6 - 

&#160; 

As a U.S. based company doing business in China, we seek to comply with all PRC laws, rules and regulations and pronouncements, and endeavor to obtain all necessary approvals from applicable PRC regulatory agencies such as the MOFCOM, the State Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, the State Administration for Taxation, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange ("SAFE"). 

Currency 

&#160; The value of the Renminbi ("RMB"), the main currency used in China, fluctuates and is affected by, among other things, changes in China's political and economic conditions. The conversion of RMB into foreign currencies such as the U.S. dollar have generally been based on rates set by the People's Bank of China, which are set daily based on the previous day's interbank foreign exchange market rates and current exchange rates on the world financial markets. 

OUR CORPORATE HISTORY 

We were incorporated in Nevada in August 1987 under the name Network USA, Inc. for the purposes of completing a merger or other business combination with an operating entity. From our inception through April 2002 we did not conduct business. On April 9, 2002, we acquired 20% of One Genesis, Inc., a privately-held Texas real estate corporation, from one of our then principal stockholders in exchange for approximately 4,333,332 shares of our common stock. The shares of One Genesis, Inc. were sold on July 31, 2002 for $120,000 in cash. 

Effective on April 30, 2004, we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Sunwin Tech from its stockholders in exchange for approximately 17,000,000 shares of our common stock which resulted in a change of control of our company. Sunwin Tech was organized in January 2004 before its acquisition of 80% of Qufu Natural Green. Prior to the acquisition of Qufu Natural Green, we did not have any business and operations. Concurrent with the closing of the acquisition of Qufu Natural Green, our officers and directors resigned and current officers and directors of Qufu Natural Green were appointed to their positions. In connection with the transaction, Sunwin Tech purchased 4,500,000 shares of our common stock owned by our former principal stockholders for $175,000, and, at the closing, Sunwin Tech distributed the 4,500,000 shares to Messrs. Baozhong Yuan, Laiwang Zhang, Xianfeng Kong and Lei Zhang, pro-rata to their ownership of Sunwin Tech immediately prior to the closing. Following the transactions, the former Sunwin Tech stockholders owned approximately 68 % of our issued and outstanding capital stock. 

Prior to our acquisition of Sunwin Tech, effective February 1, 2004, Sunwin Tech acquired 80% of Qufu Natural Green from Pharmaceutical Corporation, a company controlled by Mr. Laiwang Zhang, our President and Chairman, in exchange for 32,500,000 shares of Sunwin Tech's common stock. At the time of this merger the minority stockholders of Qufu Natural Green included Pharmaceutical Corporation (17%) and Shandong Group (2.5%), both of which are controlled by Mr. Laiwang Zhang, our President and Chairman. The remaining minority stockholder, Qufu Veterinary Medicine Company, Ltd. (0.5%) was controlled by a Chinese state owned agency. 

In July 2004 following the transaction with Sunwin Tech, we changed the name of our company from Network USA, Inc. to Sunwin International Neutraceuticals, Inc. 

Subsequent to the acquisition of 80% of Qufu Natural Green, Shandong Group acquired the 17% interest of Qufu Natural Green owned by Pharmaceutical Corporation, and ultimately the Shandong Group acquired the 0.5% Qufu Natural Green interest owned by Qufu Veterinary Medicine Company, Ltd., after it was dissolved. These events resulted in Shandong Group owning 20% of Qufu Natural Green. 

In February 2006, we acquired the remaining 20% of Qufu Natural Green from Shandong Group in exchange for 5,000,000 shares of our common stock valued at $2,775,000. At the request of Mr. Zhang, the control person of Shandong Group, 2,000,000 shares were issued to Ms. Dongdong Lin, our Chief Executive Officer, and the remaining 3,000,000 shares were issued to Mr. Zhang. Of the total purchase price, approximately $179,994 was allocated to consulting expenses paid to Mr. Zhang and Ms. Lin as it represented the difference between the purchase price and the valuation of the minority interest purchased. 

&#160; 

On June 30, 2008, Qufu Natural Green, agreed to acquire a 60% interest in Qufu Shengwang from Shandong Group for $7,016,200. This purchase price was based on 60% of the value of the net tangible assets of Qufu Shengwang as of April 30, 2008. Upon completion of the acquisition of Qufu Shengwang in June 2008, Shandong Group agreed to purchase 29,000,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $0.25 per share. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

On September 2, 2008, Qufu Natural Green amended its June 30, 2008 acquisition agreement with Qufu Shengwang and Shandong Group. Under the terms of the amendment, Qufu Natural Green agreed to acquire Shandong Group's 60% interest in Qufu Shengwang for $6,200,413. The purchase price was based on 60% of the revised value of the net tangible assets of Qufu Shengwang of $10,334,022 as of April 30, 2008. The net tangible assets of Qufu Shengwang were reduced from $11,693,666 to $10,334,022 as a result of the application of generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP") which require elimination of the difference between the fair market value and cost basis of the land use rights recorded by Qufu Shengwang upon completion of an audit of its financial statements as of April 30, 2008. 

In addition, on September 2, 2008, we entered into an amendment to the June 30, 2008 stock sale and purchase agreement with Shandong Group to purchase 29,525,776 shares of the common Stock at $0.21 per share, representing approximately 34% of our issued and outstanding common stock. In addition, the amendment provided that in the event Qufu Shengwang did not earn a minimum of $5,000,000 in net income as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP (the "Target Amount") over a period of 36 consecutive months beginning the first day of the month following the closing (the "Earnings Target Period"), then Shandong Group was obligated to return to us a number of shares of our common stock equal to an amount computed by multiplying (i) a fraction, the numerator of which was the Target Amount less the amount of Qufu Shengwang's net income earned over the Earnings Target Period and the denominator was the Target Amount; by 29,525,776, the number of shares purchase under the amendment. As set forth below, the provision for the possible return of shares to us was terminated in November 2008 a subsequent amendment to this amended agreement. 

On November 18, 2008, Qufu Natural Green entered into a second amendment to the June 30, 2008 acquisition agreement with Qufu Shengwang and its shareholder, Shandong Group, to further reduce the purchase price for the acquisition of a 60% interest in Qufu Shengwang to $4,026,851. The revised purchase price represents 60% of the revised value of the net assets of Qufu Shengwang of $6,711,418 as of April 30, 2008. The net assets of Qufu Shengwang were further revised to account for a $698,115 decrease in the value of inventory and a $2,924,489 decrease in the value of intangible assets as of April 30, 2008. 

In addition, on November 18, 2008, we entered into a second amendment to the stock sale and purchase agreement to reduce the total number of shares of common stock to be purchased by Shandong Group from 29,525,776 shares to 19,175,480 shares at $0.21 per share. As a result of the second amendment, we cancelled 10,350,296 shares of our common stock issued to Shandong Group, reduced the amount due from Shandong Group by $2,173,562 reflecting the difference between the purchase price under the first amendment and the purchase price for the shares under the second amendment and eliminated the requirement for the earnings target amount provided for in the first amendment. In satisfaction of this term, the purchase was completed by Shandong Group's delivery of the 60% interest in Qufu Shengwang. The 19,175,480 shares of common stock purchased by Shandong Group represented approximately 22% of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock prior to completion of the transaction. 

On March 25, 2009 Qufu Natural Green acquired Qufu Shengren for $3,097,242. The purchase price was equal to the value of the assets of Qufu Shengren as determined by an independent asset appraisal in accordance with PRC issued asset appraisal principles in China. Qufu Shengren is engaged in the production and distribution of bulk drugs and pharmaceuticals. 

&#160; 

Upon completion of the acquisition of Qufu Shengren in March 2009, the shareholders of Qufu Shengren purchased 21,434,201 shares of our common stock at $0.145 per share representing approximately 14.4% of our issued and outstanding common stock at the time of the sale. In satisfaction of this term, the purchase was completed by delivery of the 100% interest in Qufu Shengren by its shareholders. 

On February 5, 2009, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with WILD Flavors to purchase 20,000,000 shares of our common stock at $0.15 per share together with five year warrants to purchase 26,666,666 shares of our common stock with an exercise price of $0.35 per share. In connection with the securities purchase agreement we paid fees of $100,000 in cash and 1,000,000 shares of our common stock and paid legal fees of $10,000. We used the net proceeds from this transaction for expansion of our production facilities in China and general corporate purposes. In February 2014, the warrants expired and were cancelled. 

Pursuant to the terms of the securities purchase agreement, we converted our Sunwin Stevia International subsidiary into a limited liability company called Sunwin USA. In exchange for our contribution of Sunwin Stevia International0&#8222;30&#8230;3s capital, we received 5,500 membership units in Sunwin USA, representing a 55% interest after giving effect to the issuance of 4,500 membership units to WILD Flavors. In addition, WILD Flavors provided sales, marketing, logistics and supply chain management, product development and regulatory services to Sunwin USA over a period of two years beginning on February 5, 2009. We valued the services at $1,000,000 over the two year period. WILD Flavors agreed to act as the sole manager of Sunwin USA and is responsible for all of its business and affairs. WILD Flavors has the right of first refusal to purchase additional membership units in Sunwin USA at $222.22 per unit to provide any additional capital required by Sunwin USA as mutually determined by us and WILD Flavors.

Under the terms of the securities purchase agreement, WILD Flavors had the option to exchange its 45% interest in Sunwin USA into 6,666,666 shares of our common stock at any time until December 31, 2010. This exchange option expired unexercised. WILD Flavors is also entitled to a bonus option which would entitle it to receive the greater of: 

- 6% of the issued and outstanding membership units of Sunwin USA or 

- the number of membership units of Sunwin USA necessary to increase WILD Flavor's ownership interest to 51% if Sunwin USA achieved cumulative pre-tax profits of $3,000,000 on or before December 31, 2011 computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP exclusive of the cost of product liability insurance. 

The bonus option expired unexercised as the threshold profit criteria was not reached. 

On February 5, 2009 as part of the transactions we entered into a distributorship agreement with WILD Flavors for the worldwide distribution of our stevioside products. The distributorship agreement is for an initial term of 60 months with automatic renewal terms of 12 successive 36 month renewal periods. 

In July 2010 Qufu Natural Green sold its 100% ownership interest in Shengya Veterinary Medicine to Mr. Laiwang Zhang, our president and chairman of our board of directors. Shengya Veterinary Medicine historically represented less than 20% of our total revenues and represented approximately 12% of our total revenues in fiscal 2010, compared to 16.7% in fiscal 2009. Under the terms of the agreement, Mr. Zhang tendered to us for cancellation 7,818,545 shares of our common stock he owned, valued at $3,674,716, based on the closing stock price at July 31, 2010. The carrying value of Shengya Veterinary Medicine's net assets totaled $4,906,747 at July 31, 2010 and we recognized a foreign currency translation gain of $1,243,481 that had previously been reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income. As a result, we booked a gain on sale of subsidiary of $11,450 in fiscal 2011. 

On September 30, 2011, Qufu Shengwang purchased the 40% equity interest in Qufu Shengwang owned by our Korean partners, Korea Stevia Company, Limited, for $626,125 in cash, and as a result of this repurchase transaction we now own 100% equity interest in all of the net assets of our subsidiary Qufu Shengwang. Therefore, the non-controlling interest of $2,109,028 in our balance sheet as of April 30, 2012 has been eliminated to reflect our 100% interest in Qufu Shengwang. Qufu Shengwang has resumed production in the last quarter of fiscal 2014 for the products including bio-fermentation bacterial fertilizers, foliar fertilizers, and biological pesticides. 

In April 2012 we changed our corporate name to Sunwin Stevia International, Inc. 

In August 2012, the Company entered into an Exchange Agreement with WILD Flavors pursuant to which it purchased its 45% membership interest in Sunwin USA for an aggregate consideration of approximately $1,625,874, which includes the issuance of 7,666,666 shares of our common stock valued at approximately $1,533,333 and a cash payment of $92,541. In connection with the Exchange Agreement, WILD Flavor granted, transferred and assigned to Sunwin USA all of its rights, title and interest, and the trade name OnlySweet, including any trademarks, trademark registrations and applications, service marks, service mark registrations and applications, copyrights, copyright registrations and applications, trade dress, trade names (whether or not registered or by whatever name or designation), owned, applied for, or registered in the name of, the WILD Flavor (the "OnlySweet Name Rights"). 

On August 8, 2012 we entered into an Exchange Agreement with WILD Flavors pursuant to which we purchased its 45% membership interest in Sunwin USA for an aggregate consideration of approximately $1,625,874, which includes the issuance of 7,666,666 shares of our common stock valued at approximately $1,533,333 and a cash payment of $92,541. The transaction closed on August 20, 2012. On August 22, 2012, we issued 7,666,666 shares of our common stock and paid $92,541 cash to WILD Flavors. &#160; The $92,541 cash payment was paid by China Direct Investment, Inc. ("CDI"), our corporate management services provider, and reimbursed by us to CDI through the issuance of our common shares as part of the terms of the consulting agreement with CDI dated May 1, 2012. The net tangible assets of Sunwin USA were reduced from $1,825,804 to $1,625,874 as a result of the application of generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP") which requires elimination of the difference between the purchase price of the 45% membership interest in Sunwin USA and cost basis of the intangible assets recorded by Sunwin USA. Intangible assets include the product development and supply chain for OnlySweet. 

Under the terms of the agreement, WILD Flavors assumed certain pre-closing obligations of Sunwin USA totaling approximately $694,000, including trade accounts receivable, loans, health care and monthly expenses of an employee, potential chargebacks, bank fees and broker commissions incurred prior to the closing date. The agreement also contained customary joint indemnification and general releases. As a result of this transaction, we began consolidating the operations of Sunwin USA from the date of acquisition (August 20, 2012). 

In addition to the Exchange Agreement, on August 8, 2012 we entered into the following additional agreements with WILD Flavors or its affiliate: 

&#160; 

- 9 - 

&#160; 

&#160;

- We entered into an Amendment to Operating Agreement with WILD Flavors pursuant to which we are now the sole manager of Sunwin USA and certain sections of the original agreement dated April 29, 2009 were cancelled as they were no longer relevant following our purchase of the minority interest in Sunwin USA described above; 

- We entered into a Termination of Distribution Agreement with WILD Flavors and Sunwin USA pursuant to which the Distribution Agreement dated February 5, 2009 was terminated; and 

- We entered into a Distributorship Agreement with WILD Procurement Gmbh, a Swiss corporation ("WILD Procurement") which is an affiliate of WILD Flavors. Under the terms of this agreement, we appointed WILD Procurement as a non-exclusive world-wide distributor for the resale of our stevia products. There are no minimum purchase quantities under the agreement, and the pricing and terms of each order will be negotiated by the parties at the time each purchase order is placed. The agreement restricts WILD Procurement from purchasing steviosides or other forms of stevia that are included in our products from sources other than our company under certain circumstances. In addition, at such time as we desire to offer new products, we must first offer WILD Procurement the non-exclusive right to distribute those products and the parties will have 60 days to reach mutually agreeable terms. The agreement contains certain representations by us as to the quality of the products we may sell WILD Procurement and the products' compliance with applicable laws and good manufacturing practices, as well as customary confidentiality and indemnification provisions. 

In the event WILD Procurement should fund research on stevia used in food, beverage or dietary supplement applications, and as a result of this research it develops new intellectual property, such intellectual property shall be the sole property of WILD Procurement. In the event we should jointly fund research, any new intellectual property developed from this effort will be jointly owned and each party will have the right to use the developed intellectual property in stevia-based products. 

The agreement is for an initial term of 12 months and will automatically renew for successive 12 month terms unless the agreement has been terminated by either party upon 45 days prior written notice. There are no assurances any purchase orders will be placed under the terms of the Distribution Agreement. The agreement may also be terminated by either party upon a material breach by the other party, or upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition, both subject to certain cure periods. In the event the agreement is terminated, WILD Procurement has the right to continue to distribute our products on a non-exclusive basis for 24 months upon terms and conditions to be negotiated by the parties. At the end of fiscal year 2016, we have received the notice for termination from WILD and we are under negotiation for a new distribution agreement. 

EMPLOYEES 

As of July 21, 2016, we have 244 full time employees. All of our employees are primarily based in Qufu, China while some managerial and sales staff occasionally work in other Chinese cities or overseas on different projects. Each full-time Chinese employee is a member of a local trade union. Labor relations have remained positive and we have not had any employee strikes or major labor disputes. Unlike trade union in western countries, trade unions in most parts of China are organizations mobilized jointly by the government and the management of the corporation.
