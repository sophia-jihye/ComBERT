 ITEMS 1. AND 2. BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES &#160; 

General 

We provide a wide range of well site services in the United States to oil and natural gas drilling and producing companies, including completion and remedial services, fluid services, well servicing and contract drilling. These services are fundamental to establishing and maintaining the flow of oil and natural gas throughout the productive life of a well. Our broad range of services enables us to meet multiple needs of our customers at the well site. We were organized in 1992 as Sierra Well Service, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and in 2000 we changed our name to Basic Energy Services, Inc. 

Our operations are managed regionally and are concentrated in major United States onshore oil and natural gas producing regions located in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Wyoming, North Dakota, Colorado, Utah, Montana, West Virginia, California, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Our operations are focused on liquids-rich basins that have historically exhibited strong drilling and production economics in recent years as well as natural gas-focused shale plays characterized by prolific reserves. Specifically, we have a significant presence in the Permian Basin and the Bakken, Eagle Ford, Haynesville and Marcellus shales. We provide our services to a diverse group of over 2,000 oil and gas companies. 

Our current operating segments are Completion and Remedial Services, Fluid Services, Well Servicing, and Contract Drilling. These segments were selected based on management&#8217;s resource allocation and performance assessment in making decisions regarding the Company. The following is a description of our business segments: 

&#8226; Completion and Remedial Services. Our completion and remedial services segment (38% of our revenues in 2015) operates our fleet of pumping units, an array of specialized rental equipment and fishing tools, coiled tubing units, snubbing units, thru-tubing, air compressor packages specially configured for underbalanced drilling operations, cased-hole wireline units and nitrogen units. The largest portion of this business segment consists of pumping services focused on cementing, acidizing and fracturing services in niche markets. 

&#8226; Fluid Services. Our fluid services segment (32% of our revenues i n 2015) utilizes our fleet of 985 fluid service trucks and related assets, including specialized tank trucks, storage tanks, water wells, disposal facilities, water treatment and construction and other related equipment. These assets provide, transport, store and dispose of a variety of fluids, as well as provide well site construction and maintenance services. These services are required in most workover, completion and remedial projects and are routinely used in daily producing well operations. 

&#8226; Well Servicing. Our well servicing segment (27% of our revenues in 2015) operates our fleet of 421 well servicing rigs and related equipment. This business segment encompasses a full range of services performed with a mobile well servicing rig, including the installation and removal of downhole equipment and elimination of obstructions in the well bore to facilitate the flow of oil and natural gas. These services are performed to establish, maintain and improve production throughout the productive life of an oil and natural gas well and to plug and abandon a well at the end of its productive life. Our well servicing equipment and capabilities also facilitate most other services performed on a well. &#160; 

&#8226; Contract Drilling. Our contract drilling segment (3% of our revenues in 2015) operates our fleet of 12 drilling rigs and related equipment. We use these assets to penetrate the earth to a desired depth and initiate production from a well. 

Please see Part II &#160; Item 8 . Business Segment Information for further f inancial information about our segments. 

Our Competitive Strengths 

We believe that the following competitive strengths currently position us well within our industry: 

Extensive Domestic Footprint in the Most Prolific Basins. Our operations are focused on liquids-rich basins located in the United States that have exhibited strong drilling and production economics in recent years as well as natural gas-focused shale plays characterized by prolific reserves. Specifically, we have a significant presence in the Permian Basin and the Bakken, Eagle Ford, Haynesville and Marcellus shales. We operate in the 48 contiguous states that accounted for approximately 9 9 % of U.S. onshore oil natural gas production. We believe that our operations are located in the most active U.S. well services markets, as we currently focus our operations on onshore domestic oil and natural gas production areas that include both the highest concentration of existing oil and natural gas production activities and the largest prospective acreage for new drilling activity. We believe our extensive footprint allows us to offer our suite of services to more than 2 ,000 customers who are active in those areas and allows us to redeploy equipment between markets as activity shifts, reducing the risk that a basin-specific slowdown will have a disproportionate impact on our cash flows and operational results. 

Diversified Service Offering for Further Revenue Growth and Reduced Volatility. We believe our range of well site services provides us a competitive advantage over smaller companies that typically offer fewer services. Our experience, equipment and netw or k of 1 4 6 area offices positi on us to market our full range of well site services to our existing customers. By utilizing a wider range of our services, our customers can use fewer service providers, which enables them to reduce their administrative costs and simplify their logistics. Furthermore, offering a broader range of services allows us to capitalize on our existing customer base and 

&#160;

management structure to grow within existing markets, generate more business from existing customers, and increase our operating profits as we spread our overhead costs over a larger revenue base. 

Significant Market Position. We maintain a significant market share for each of our lines of business within our core operating areas: the Permian Basin of West Texas and Southeast New Mexico; the Gulf Coast region of South Texas and Louisiana; the Mid-Continent region of North Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas; the Ark-La-Tex region of East Texas, North Louisiana and Arkansas; California; and the Rocky Mountain region of North New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, Montana and North Dakota. Our goal is to be one of the top two providers of the services we provide in each of our core operating areas. Our position in each of these markets allows us to expand the range of services performed on a well throughout its life, such as drilling, maintenance, workover, stimulation, completion and plugging and abandonment services. 

Modern and Competitive Fleet. We operate a modern fleet matched to the needs of the local markets in each of our business segments. We are driven by a desire to maintain one of the most efficient, reliable and safest fleets of equipment in the country, and we have an established program to routinely monitor and evaluate the condition of our equipment. We selectively refurbish equipment to maintain the quality of our service and to provide a safe working environment for our personnel. Since 2003, we have obtained annual independent reviews and evaluations of substantially all of our assets, which confirmed the location and condition of these assets. We believe that by maintaining a modern and active asset base, we are better able to earn our customers&#8217; business while reducing the risk of potential downtime. 

Decentralized Experienced Management with Strong Corporate Infrastructure. Our corporate group is responsible for maintaining a unified infrastructure to support our diversified operations through standardized financial and accounting, safety, environmental and maintenance processes and controls. Below our corporate level, we operate a decentralized operational organization in which our nine regional or division managers are responsible for their operations, including asset management, cost control, policy compliance and training and other aspects of quality control. With the majority having over 30 years of industry experience, each regional manager has extensive knowledge of the customer base, job requirements and working conditions in each local market. Below our nine regional or division managers, our area managers are directly responsible for customer relationships, personnel management, accident prevention and equipment maintenance, the key drivers of our operating profitability. This management structure allows us to monitor operating performance on a daily basis, maintain financial, accounting and asset management controls, integrate acquisitions, prepare timely financial reports and manage contractual risk. 

Our Business Strategy 

The key components of our business strategy include: 

Establishing and Maintaining Leadership Positions in Core Operating Areas. We strive to establish and maintain market leadership positions within our core operating areas. To achieve this goal, we maintain close customer relationships, seek to expand the breadth of our services and offer high quality services and equipment that meet the scope of customer specifications and requirements. In addition, our significant presence in our core operating areas facilitates employee retention and attraction, a key factor for success in our business. Our significant presence in our core operating areas also provides us with brand recognition that we intend to utilize in creating leading positions in new operating areas. 

Selectively Expanding Within Our Regional Markets. We intend to continue strengthening our presence within our existing geographic footprint through internal growth and acquisitions of businesses with strong customer relationships, well-maintained equipment and experienced and skilled personnel. We typically enter into new markets through the acquisition of businesses with strong management teams that will allow us to expand within these markets. Management of acquired companies often remain with us and retain key positions within our organization, which enhances our attractiveness as an acquisition partner. We have a record of successfully implementing this strategy. By concentrating on targeted expansion in areas in which we already have a meaningful presence, we believe we maximize the returns on expansion capital while reducing downside risk. 

Developing Additional Service Offerings Within the Well Servicing Market. We intend to continue broadening the portfolio of services we provide to our clients by utilizing our well servicing infrastructure. A customer typically begins a new maintenance or workover project by securing access to a well servicing rig, which stays on site for the duration of the project. As a result, our rigs are often the first equipment to arrive at the well site and typically the last to leave, providing us the opportunity to offer our customers other complementary services. We believe the fragmented nature of the well servicing market creates an opportunity to sell more services to our core customers and to expand our total service offering within each of our markets. We have expanded our suite of services available to our customers and increased our opportunities to cross-sell new services to our core well servicing customers through acquisitions and internal growth. We expect to continue to develop or selectively acquire capabilities to provide additional services to expand and further strengthen our customer relationships. 

Pursuing Growth Through Selective Capital Deployment. We intend to continue growing our business through selective acquisitions, continuing a new &#160; build program and/or upgrading our existing assets. Our capital investment decisions are determined by an analysis of the projected return on capital employed of each of those alternatives. Acquisitions are evaluated for &#8220;fit&#8221; with our area and regional operations management and are reviewed by corporate level financial, equipment, safety and environmental specialists to ensure consideration is given to identified risks. We also evaluate the cost to acquire existing assets from a third party, the capital required to build new equipment and the point in the oil and natural gas commodity price cycle. Based on these factors, we make 

&#160;

capital investment decisions that we believe will support our long-term growth strategy and these decisions may involve a combination of asset acquisitions and the purchase of new equipment. 

General Industry Overview 

Our business is influenced substantially by both operating and capital expenditures by oil and gas companies. Exploration and production spending is categorized as either an operating expenditure or a capital expenditure. Activities designed to add hydrocarbon reserves are classified as capital expenditures, while those associated with maintaining or accelerating production are categorized as operating expenditures. &#160; 

Because existing oil and natural gas wells require ongoing spending to maintain production, expenditures by oil and gas companies for the maintenance of existing wells historically have been relatively stable and predictable. In contrast, capital expenditures by oil and gas companies for exploration and drilling are more directly influenced by current and expected oil and natural gas prices and generally reflect the volatility of commodity prices. We believe our focus on production and workover activity partially insulates our financial results from the volatility of the active drilling rig count. However, significantly lower commodity prices have impacted production and workover activities due to both customer cash liquidity limitations and well economics for these service activities. 

Capital expenditures by oil and gas companies tend to be relatively sensitive to volatility in oil or natural gas prices because project decisions are tied to a return on investment spanning a number of years. As such, capital expenditure economics often require the use of commodity price forecasts which may prove inaccurate in the amount of time required to plan and execute a capital expenditure project (such as the drilling of a deep well). When commodity prices are depressed for even a short period of time, capital expenditure projects are routinely deferred until prices return to an acceptable level. 

In contrast, both mandatory and discretionary operating expenditures are substantially more stable than exploration and drilling expenditures. Mandatory operating expenditure projects involve activities that cannot be avoided in the short term, such as regulatory compliance, safety, contractual obligations and projects to maintain the well and related infrastructure in operating condition (for example, repairs to a central tank battery, downhole pump, saltwater disposal system or gathering system). Discretionary operating expenditure projects may not be critical to the short-term viability of a lease or field, but these projects are relatively insensitive to commodity price volatility. Discretionary operating expenditure work is evaluated according to a simple short-term payout criterion that is far less dependent on commodity price forecasts. 

Demand for services offered by our industry is a function of our customers&#8217; willingness to make operating and capital expenditures to explore for, develop and produce hydrocarbons in the United States . Our customers&#8217; expenditures are affected by both current and expected levels of oil and natural gas prices. N atural gas prices have remained at lower levels in the 2011- 201 5 period s , which resul ted in decreased activity in our natural gas-driven markets. Oil prices increased during the first half of 2011 primarily due to political and economic instability in several oil producing countries and remained relatively stable until the fourth quarter of &#160; 2014 , whe n &#160; oil prices declined due to oversupply concer n s worldwide and continued to decline significantly throughout 2015 . Despite natural gas prices remaining at lower levels , several markets that produce significant natural gas liquids, such as the Eagle Ford shale, and/or that have other advantages like proximity to key consuming markets, such as the Marcellus shale, continued to see relatively stable activity during 201 5 .

Increased expenditures for exploration and production activities generally drive the increased demand for our services. In 201 3 , oil prices remained stable and natural gas prices increased, and the average oil-based drilling rig count also remained stable. In the first three quarters of 2014, oil prices and natural gas prices increased incrementally causing the lan d- based drilling rig count to &#160; increase approximately 10 % . In the fourth quarter of 2014, oil prices began to decline &#160; resulting in a decrease in the land based rig count of approximately 5%. Average natural gas-focuse d drilling rig count decreased 4 0 % from 2013 to 2014 . In 2015, oil prices declined significantly and the average oil-based drilling rig count decreased approximately 64% throughout the year . Gas prices also declined leading to a 52% decrease in natural gas-focused drilling rig count. Data for each of the foregoing rig counts are based on information from the Baker Hughes rig count. 

&#160;

Overview of Our Segments and Services 

Completion and Remedial Services Segment 

Our completion and remedial services segment provides oil and natural gas operators with a package of services that include the following: 

&#8226; pumping services, such as cementing, acidi zing, fracturing, nitrogen and pressure testing; 

&#8226; rental and fishing tools; 

&#8226; coiled tubing; 

&#8226; snubbing services; 

&#8226; thru-tubing; 

&#8226; cased-hole wireline services; and 

&#8226; underbalanced drilling in low pressure and fluid sensitive reservoirs. 

This segment operates 291 &#160; pum ping units, with approximately 44 4 ,000 horsepower of capacity, to conduct a variety of services designed to stimulate oil and natural gas production or to enable cement slurry to be placed in or circulated within a well. We also operate 42 air compressor packages, including foam circulation units, for underbalanced drilling , 3 6 snubbing units , 1 5 coiled tubing units &#160; and 8 wireline units for cased-hole measurement and pipe recovery services . &#160; 

Just as a well servicing rig is required to perform various operations over the life cycle of a well, there is a similar need for equipment capable of pumping fluids into the well under varying degrees of pressure. During the drilling and completion phase, the well bore is lined with large diameter steel pipe called casing. Casing is cemented into place by circulating slurry into the annulus created between the pipe and the rock wall of the well bore. The cement slurry is f orced into the well by pumping equipment located on the surface. Cementing services are also utilized over the life of a well to repair leaks in the casing, to close perforations that are no longer productive and ultimately to &#8220;plug&#8221; the well at the end of its productive life. 

A hydrocarbon reservoir is essentially an interval of rock that is saturated with oil and/or natural gas, usually in combination with water. Three primary factors determine the productivity of a well that intersects a hydrocarbon reservoir: porosity (the percentage of the reservoir volume represented by pore space in which the hydrocarbons reside), permeability (the natural propensity for the flow of hydrocarbons toward the well bore), and &#8220;skin&#8221; (the degree to which the portion of the reservoir in close proximity to the well bore has experienced reduced permeability as a result of exposure to drilling fluids or other contaminants). Well productivity can be increased by artificially improving either permeability or skin through stimulation methods described below. 

Permeability can be increased through the use of fracturing methods by which a reservoir is subjected to fluids pumped into it under high pressure. This pressure creates stress in the reservoir and causes the rock to fracture, thereby creating additional channels through which hydrocarbons can flow. In most cases, sand or another form of proppant is pumped with the fluid as a means of holding open the newly created fractures. 

The most common means of reducing near-well bore damage, or skin, is the injection of a highly reactive solvent (such as hydrochloric acid) solution into the area where the hydrocarbons enter the well. This solution has the effect of dissolving contaminants that have accumulated and are restricting the flow of hydrocarbons. This process is generically known as acidizing. 

After a well is drilled and completed, the casing may develop leaks as a result of abrasions from production tubing, exposure to corrosive elements or inadequate support from the original attempt to cement the casing in place. When a leak develops, it is necessary to place specialized equipment into the well and to pump cement in such a way as to seal the leak, a process known as &#8220;squeeze&#8221; cementing.

Our pumping services business focuses primarily on lower horsepower cementing, acidizing and fracturing services markets. Curren tly, there are several pumping companies that provide their services on a national basis. For the most part, these companies have concentrated their assets in markets characterized by complex work with higher horsepower requirements. This has created an opportun ity in the markets for pumping services in mature areas with less complex characteristics and lower horsepower requirements. We, along with a number of smaller, regional companies, have concentrated our efforts on these markets. 

The level of activity of our pumping services business is tied to drilling and workover activity. The bulk of pumping work is associated with cementing casing in place as the well is drilled or pumping fluid that stimulates production from the well during the completion phase. P umping service work is awarded based on a combination of price and expertise. 

Our rental and fishing tool business provides a range of specialized services and equipment that is utilized on a non-routine basis for both drilling and well servicing operations. Drilling and well servicing rigs are equipped with an array of tools to complete routine operations under normal conditions for most projects in the geographic area in which they are employed. When downhole problems develop with drilling or servicing operations or conditions require non-routine equipment, our customers will usually rely on a provider of rental and fishing tools to augment equipment that is provided with a typical drilling or well servicing rig package. 

The term &#8220;fishing&#8221; applies to a wide variety of downhole operations designed to correct a problem that has developed during the drilling or servicing of a well. The problem most commonly involves equipment that has become lodged in the well and cannot be removed without special equipment. Our technicians utilize tools that are specifically suited to retrieve, or &#8220;fish,&#8221; and remove the trapped equipment, allowing our customers to resume operations. 

Coiled tubing services involve the use of a continuous metal pipe spooled on a large reel for oil and natural gas well interventions, including wellbore maintenance, nitrogen services, thru-tubing services, and formation stimulation using acid and other chemicals. 

Our snubbing service business utilizes specialized e quipment to run or remove pipe and other associated downhole tools into a wellbore. This process is accomplished with a wellbore having surface pressure or with the anticipation of surface pressure. Our snubbing services are utilized for both routine and non-routine workover, completion and remedial activities. 

Cased-hole wireline services typically utilize a single truck equipped with a spool of wireline that is used to lower and raise a variety of specialized tools in and out of a cased wellbore. These tools can be used to measure pressures and temperature as well as the condition of the casing and the cement that holds the casing in place. Other applications for wireline tools include placing equipment in or retrieving equipment from the wellbore, or perforating the casing and cutting off pipe that is stuck in the well so that the free section can be recovered. Wireline trucks are utilized throughout the life of a well. 

Fluid Services Segment 

Our fluid services segment provides oilfield fluid supply, transportation, storage and construction services. These services are required in most workover, completion and remedial projects and are routinely used in daily producing well operations. These services include: 

&#160; 

&#8226; the transportation of fluids used in drilling and workover operations and of salt water produced as a by-product of oil and natural gas production; 

&#8226; the sale and transportation of fresh and brine water used in drilling and workover activities; 

&#8226; the rental of portable frac turing tanks and test tanks used to store fluids on well sites; 

&#8226; the recycling and treatment of wastewater, including produced water and flowback, to be reused in the completion and production process; 

&#8226; the operation of company-owned fresh water and brine source wells and of non-hazardous wastewater disposal wells; and 

&#8226; the preparation, construction and maintenance of access roads, drilling locations, and production facilities. 

&#160;

This segment utilizes our fleet of fluid service trucks and related assets, including specialized tank trucks, portable storage tanks, water wells, disposal facilities and related equipment.

Requirements for minor or incidental fluid services are usually purchased on a &#8220;call out&#8221; basis and charged according to a published schedule of rates. Larger projects, such as servicing the requirements of a multi-well drilling program or frac turing program, generally involve a bidding process. We compete for both services on a call out basis and for multi-well contract projects. 

We provide a full array of fluid sales, transportation, storage , treatment and disposal services required on most workover, completion and remedial projects. Our breadth of capabilities in this segment allows us to serve as a one-stop source of equipment and services for our customers. Many of our smaller competitors in this segment can provide some, but not all, of the equipment and services required by oil and gas operators, requiring them to use several companies to meet their requirements and increasing their administrative burden. 

Our fluid services segment has a base level of business volume related to the regular maintenance of oil and natural gas wells. Most oil and natural gas fields produce residual salt water in conjunction with oil or natural gas. Fluid service trucks pick up this fluid from tank batteries at the well site and transport it to a salt water disposal well for injection. This type of regular maintenance work must be performed if a well is to remain active. Transportation and disposal of produced water is considered a low value service by most operators, and it is difficult for us to command a premium over rates charged by our competition. Our ability to outperform competitors in this segment depends on our ability to achieve significant economies relating to logistics, specifically the proximity between the areas where salt water is produced and the areas where our company-owned disposal wells are located. We operate salt water disposal wells in most of our markets, and our ownership of these disposal wells eliminates the need to pay third parties a fee for disposal. 

Workover, completion and remedial activities also provide the opportunity for higher operating margins from tank rentals and fluid sales. Drilling and workover jobs typically require fresh or brine water for drilling mud or circulating fluid used during the job. Completion and workover procedures often also require large volumes of water for fracturing operations, which involves stimulating a well hydraulically to increase production. Spent mud and flowback fluids from drilling and completion activities are required to be transported from the well site to an approved disposal facility. &#160; &#160; Water treatment solutions are also utilized by customers to treat produced water and flowback, in order to be reused during the production and completion process. 

Our competitors in the fluid services industry are mostly small, regionally focused companies. There are currently no companies that have a dominant position on a nationwide basis. The level of activity in the fluid services industry is comprised of a relatively stable demand for services related to the maintenance of producing wells and a highly variable demand for services used in the drilling and completion of new wells. As a result, the level of onshore drilling activity significantly affects the level of activity in the fluid services industry. While there are no industry-wide statistics, the Baker Hughes Land Drilling Rig Count is an indirect indication of demand for fluid services because it directly reflects the level of onshore drilling activity. 

Fluid Services. &#160; At December 31, 201 5 , w e own ed and operate d &#160; 985 fluid service trucks equipped with a n ave r age fluid hauling capacity of up to 150 barrels apiece. Each fluid service truck is equipped to pump fluids from or into wells , pits, tanks and other storage facilities. The majority of our fluid service trucks are also used to transport water to fill fracturing tanks on well locations, including fracturing tanks provided by us and others, to transport produced salt water to disposal wells, including injection wells owned and operated by us, and to transport drilling and completion fluids to and from well locations. In conjunction with the rental of our fracturing tanks, we mainly use our fluid service trucks to transport water for use in fracturing operations. Following completion of fracturing operations, our fluid service trucks are used to transport the flowback produced as a result of the fracturing operations from the well site to disposal wells. Fluid service trucks are usually provided to oilfield operators within a 50-mile radius of our nearest yard. 

Salt Water Disposal Well Services. &#160; At December 31, 201 5 , we owned 8 5 salt water disposal facilities . Disposal wells are permitted to dispose of salt water and incidental non-hazardous oil and natural gas wastes. Our fluid service trucks frequently transport the fluids that are disposed of in these salt water disposal wells. Our disposal wells have an average permitted injection capacity of over 6,000 barrels per day per well and are strategically located in close proximity to our customers&#8217; producing wells. Most oil and 

&#160;

natural gas wells produce varying amounts of salt water throughout their productive lives. In the states in which we operate, oil and natural gas wastes and salt water produced from oil and natural gas wells are required by law to be disposed of in authorized facilities, including permitted salt water disposal wells. Injection wells are licensed by state authorities and are completed in permeable formations below the fresh water table. We maintain separators at most of our disposal wells, allowing us to salvage residual crude oil that we later sell for our account. 

Fresh and Brine Water Stations. Our network of fresh and brine water stations, particularly in the Permian Basin where surface water is normally not available, is used to supply water necessary for the drilling and completion of oil and natural gas wells. Our strategic locations, in combination with our other fluid handling services, give us a competitive advantage over other service providers in those areas in which these other companies cannot provide these services. 

Fluid Storage Tanks. Our fluid storage tanks can store up to 500 barrels of fluid and are used by oilfield operators to store various fluids at the well site, including fresh water, brine and acid for frac turing jobs, flowback, temporary production and mud storage. We transport the tanks on our trucks to well locations that are usually within a 50-mile radius of our nearest yard. Frac turing tanks are used during all phases of the life of a producing well. We typical ly rent fluid services tanks at daily rates for a minimum of three days. A typical fracturing operation can be completed within four days using 5 to 50 frac turing tanks. 

Water Treatment Services. We utilize a number of water treatment methods in order to treat produced water and flowback that is transported to one of several treatment locations throughout our geographic footprint. Treated water is then sold to customers to be reused for fracturing or other oil and gas-related uses on wells. We typically c harge for these services on a per -barrel basis. 

Construction Services. We utilize a fleet of power units, including dozers, trenchers, motor graders, backhoes and other heavy equipment used in road construction. In addition, we own rock pits in some markets in our Rocky Mountain operations to ensure a reliable source of rock to support our construction activities. Contracts for well site construction services are normally awarded by our customers on the basis of competitive bidding and may range in scope from several days to several months in duration. &#160; 

Well Servicing Segment 

Our well servicing segment encompasses a full range of services performed with a mobile well servicing rig, also commonly referred to as a workover rig, and ancillary equipment. Our rigs and personnel provide the means for hoisting equipment and tools into and out of the well bore, and our well servicing equipment and capabilities also facilitate most other services performed on a well. Our well servicing segment services, which are performed to maintain and improve production throughout the productive life of an oil and natural gas well, include: 

&#8226; maintenance work involving removal, repair and replacement of down-hole equipment and returning the well to production after these operations are completed; 

&#8226; hoisting tools and equipment required by the operation into and out of the well, or removing equipment from the well bore, to facilitate specialized production enhancement and well repair operations performed by other oilfield service companies; and 

&#8226; plugging and abandonment services when a well has reached the end of its productive life. 

Our well servicing segment also includes the manufacturing and sale of new workover rigs through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Taylor Industries, LLC, which we formed in connection with the acquisition of a rig manufacturing bu siness in &#160; 2010. 

Regardless of the type of work being performed on the well, our personnel and rigs are often the first to arrive at the well site and the last to leave. We typical ly charge our customers an hourly rate for these services, which rate varies based on a number of considerations including market conditions in each region, the type of rig and ancillary equipment required, and the necessary personnel. 

Our fleet included 42 1 well servicing rigs as of December 31, 201 5 , incl uding 2 2 1 newbuilds since October 2004 and 76 rebuilds since the beginning of 200 9 . Our well servicing rigs operate from facilities in Texas, Wyoming, Oklahoma, North Dakota, New Mexico, Louisiana, Colorado, California, Arkansas, Utah, Montana, Kansas, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Ou r well servicing rigs are mobile units that normall y operate within a radius of approximately 75 to 100 miles from their respective bases. 

&#160;

The following table sets forth the location, characteristics and number of the well servicing rigs that we operated at December 31, 201 5 . We categorize our rig fleet by the rated capacity of the mast, which indicates the maximum weight that the rig is capable of lifting. The maximum weight our rigs are capable of lifting is the limiting factor in our ability to provide these services.

We operate a total of 42 1 well servicing rigs, one of the largest fleets in the United States. Based on the most recent publicly available information, five of our competitors operate more than 100 well servicing rigs: Key Energy Services , Inc. , C&#38;J Energy Services, Ltd. , Superior Energy Services , Inc. , &#160; Forbes Energy Services Ltd. , and Pioneer Energy Services &#160; Corp. &#160; 

Maintenance. Regular maintenance is required throughout the life of a well to sustain optimal levels of oil and natural gas production. Regular maintenance currently comprises the largest portion of our work in this segment, and because ongoing maintenance spending is required to sustain production, we generally experience relatively stable demand for these services. We provide well service rigs, equipment and crews to our customers for these maintenance services. Maintenance services are often performed on a series of wells in proximity to each other and consist of routine mechanical repairs necessary to maintain production, such as repairing inoperable pumping equipment in an oil well or replacing defective tubing in a natural gas well, and removing debris such as sand and paraffin from the well. Other services include pulling the rods, tubing, pumps and other downhole equipment out of the well bore to identify and repair a production problem. These downhole equipment failures are typically caused by the repetitive pumping action of an oil well. Corrosion, water cut, grade of oil, sand production and other factors can also result in frequent failures of downhole equipment. 

The need for maintenance activity does not directly depend on the level of drilling activity, although it is somewhat impacted by short-term fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices. Demand for our maintenance services is driven primarily by the production requirements of local oil or natural gas fields and is therefore affected by changes in the total number of producing oil and natural gas wells in our geographic service areas. 

Our regular well maintenance services involve relatively low-cost, short-duration jobs which are part of normal well operating costs. Well operators cannot delay all maintenance work without a significant impact on production. Operators may, however, choose to shut in producing wells temporarily when oil or natural gas prices are too low to justify additional expenditures, including maintenance. 

Workover. In addition to periodic maintenance, producing oil and natural gas wells occasionally require major repairs or modifications called workovers, which are typically more complex and more time consuming than maintenance operations. Workover services include extensions of existing wells to drain new formations either through perforating the well casing to expose additional productive zones not previously produced, deepening well bores to new zones or the drilling of lateral well bores to improve reservoir drainage patterns. Our workover rigs are also used to convert former producing wells to injection wells through which water or carbon dioxide is then pumped into the formation for enhanced oil recovery operations. Workovers also include major subsurface repairs such as repair or replacement of well casing, recovery or replacement of tubing and removal of foreign objects from the well bore. These extensive workover operations are normally performed by a workover rig with additional specialized auxiliary equipment, which may include rotary drilling equipment, mud pumps, mud tanks and fishing tools, depending upon the particular type of workover operation. Most of our well servicing rigs are designed to perform complex workover operations. A workover may require a few days to several weeks and additional auxiliary equipment. The demand for workover services is sensitive to oil and natural gas producers&#8217; intermediate and long-term expectations for oil and natural gas prices. As oil and natural gas prices increase, the level of workover activity tends to increase as oil and natural gas producers seek to increase output by enhancing the efficiency of their wells. &#160; 

New Well Completion. New well completion services involve the preparation of newly drilled wells for production. The completion process may involve selectively perforating the well casing in the productive zones to allow oil or natural gas to flow into the well bore, stimulating and testing these zones and installing the production string and other downhole equipment. We provide well service rigs to assist in this completion process. Newly drilled wells are frequently completed by well servicing rigs to minimize the use of higher cost drilling rigs in the completion process. The completion process typically requires a few days to several weeks, depending on the nature and type of the completion, and require additional auxiliary equipment. Accordingly, completion services require less well-to-well mobilization of equipment and norm ally provide higher operating margins than regular maintenance work. 

&#160;

The demand for completion services is directly related to drilling activity levels, which are sensitive to expectations relating to and changes in oil and natural gas prices. 

Plugging and Abandonment. Well servicing rigs are also used in the process of permanently closing oil and natural gas wells no longer capable of producing in economic quantities. Plugging and abandonment work can be performed with a well servicing rig along with wireline and cementing equipment; however, this service is typically provided by companies that specialize in plugging and abandonment work. Many well operators bid this work on a &#8220;turnkey&#8221; basis, requiring the service company to perform the entire job, including the sale or disposal of equipment salvaged from the well as part of the compensation received, and comply with state regulatory requirements. Plugging and abandonment work can provide favorable operating margins and is less sensitive to oil and natural gas prices than drilling and workover activity since well operators must plug a well in accordance with state regulations when it is no longer productive. We perform plugging and abandonment work throughout our core areas of operation in conjunction with equipment provided by other service companies. 

Contract Drilling Segment 

Our contract drilling segment employs drilling rigs and related equipment to penetrate the earth to a desired depth and initiate production. 

We own and operate 12 land drilling rigs, which are currently deployed in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico. A land drilling rig consists of engines, a drawworks, a mast, pumps to circulate the drilling fluid (mud) under various pressures, blowout preventers, drill string and related equipment. The engines power the different pieces of equipment, including a rotary table or top drive that turns the drill string, causing the drill bit to bore through the subsurface rock layers. These jobs are typically bid by &#8220;daywork&#8221; contracts, in which an agreed upon rate per day is charged to the customer, or &#8220;footage&#8221; contracts, in which an agreed upon rate per the number of feet drilled is charged to the customer. The demand for drilling services is highly dependent on the availability of new drilling locations available to well operators, as well as sensitivity to expectations relating to and changes in oil and natural gas prices. 

Properties 

Our principal executive offices are located at 801 Cherry Street, Suite 2100, Fort Worth, Texas 76102. We currently conduct our busi ness from 1 46 area offices, 87 of which we own and 59 of which we lease. Each office typically includes a yard, administrative office and maintenance facility. Of our 1 46 area offices, 88 are located in Texas, twelve are in New Mexico, &#160; Oklahoma and Colorado each have nine , five are in North Dakota, six are in Wyoming, Louisiana and Kansas each have four , Utah , California, Montana , and Pennsylvania each have two, and Arkansas has one . 

Customers &#160; 

We serve numerous major and independent oil and gas companies that are active in our core areas of operations. During 2015, no single customer comprised over 10% of our total revenues. The majority of our business is with independent oil and gas companies. In the current market conditions, the loss of any current material customers could have an adverse effect on our business until the equipment is redeployed. 

Operating Risks and Insurance 

Our operations are subject to hazards inherent in the oil and natural gas industry, such as accidents, blowouts, explosions, craters, fires and oil spills that can cause: 

&#8226; personal injury or loss of life; 

&#8226; damage to or destruction of property, equipment and the environment; and 

&#8226; suspension of operations. 

In addition, claims for loss of oil and natural gas production and damage to formations can occur in the well services industry. If a serious accident were to occur at a location where our equipment and services are being used, it could result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting large claims. 

Because our business involves the transportation of heavy equipment and materials, we may also experience traffic accidents which may result in spills, property damage and personal injury. 

Despite our efforts to maintain high safety standards, we from time to time have suffered accidents in the past and anticipate that we could experience accidents in the future. In addition to the property and personal losses from these accidents, the frequency and severity of these incidents affect our operating costs and insurability and our relationships with customers, employees and regulatory agencies. Any significant increase in the frequency or severity of these incidents, or the general level of damage awards, could adversely affect the cost of, or our ability to obtain, workers&#8217; compensation and other forms of insurance, and could have other material adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160;

Although we maintain insurance coverage of types and amounts that we believe to be customary in the industry, we are not fully insured against all risks, either because insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs. We do maintain employer&#8217;s liability, pollution, cargo, umbrella, comprehensive commercial general liability, workers&#8217; compensation and limited physical damage insurance. There can be no assurance, however, that any insurance obtained by us will be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities, or that this insurance will continue to be available or available on terms which are acceptable to us. Liabilities for which we are not insured, or which exceed the policy limits of our applicable insurance, could have a material adverse effect on us. 

Competition 

Our competition includes small regional contractors as well as larger companies with international operations. We believe our five largest competitors, Key Energy Services, Inc. , Superior Energy Services Inc. , C&#38;J Energy Services Ltd . , Forbes Energy Services Ltd. , and Pioneer Energy Services Corp. , each own a significant number of the U.S. marketable well servicing rigs according to the most recent publicly available data, including the Guiberson-AESC well service rig count. All five are public companies that operate in most of the large oil and natural gas producing regions in the United States. They each have centralized management teams that direct their operations and decision-making primarily from corporate and regional headquarters. In addition, because of their size, they market a large portion of their work to the major oil and gas companies. 

We differentiate ourselves from our major competition by our operating philosophy. We operate a decentralized organization, where local, experienced management teams are largely responsible for sales and operations and developing stronger relationships with our customers at the field level. We target areas that are attractive to independent oil and gas operators who in our opinion tend to be more aggressive in spending, less focused on price and more likely to award work based on performance. We concentrate on providing services to a diverse group of large and small independent oil and gas companies. These independents typically are relationship driven, make decisions at the local level and are willing to pay higher rates for services. We have been successful using this business model and believe it will enable us to continue to grow our business. 

Safety Program 

Our business involves the operation of heavy and powerful equipment which can result in serious injuries to our employees and third parties and substantial damage to property. We have comprehensive safety and training programs designed to minimize accidents in the workplace and improve the efficiency of our operations. In addition, many of our larger customers now place greater emphasis on safety and quality management programs of their contractors. We believe that these factors will gain further importance in the future. We have directed substantial resources toward employee safety and quality management training programs as well as our employee review process. While our efforts in these areas are not unique, we believe many competitors, and particularly smaller contractors, have not undertaken similar training programs for their employees. 

We believe our approach to safety management is consistent with our decentralized management structure. Company-mandated policies and procedures provide the overall framework to ensure our operations minimize the hazards inherent in our work and are intended to meet regulatory requirements, while allowing our operations to satisfy customer-mandated policies and local needs and practices. 

Environmental Regulation and Climate Change 

Environment, Health and Safety Regulation, Including Climate Change 

Our operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to health and safety or the protection of the environment. Numerous governmental agencies, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, commonly referred to as the &#8220;EPA,&#8221; and analogous state agencies issue regulations to implement and enforce these laws, which often require stringent and costly compliance measures. These laws and regulations may, among other things, require the acquisition of permits; govern the amounts and types of substances that may be released into the environment in connection with oil and gas drilling; restrict the way we handle or dispose of our materials and wastes; limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands, wilderness areas or areas inhabited by endangered or threatened species; or require investigatory and remedial actions to mitigate pollution conditions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as the possible issuance of injunctions limiting or prohibiting our activities. In addition, some laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment may, in certain circumstances, impose liability for environmental damages and cleanup costs without regard to negligence or fault. Strict adherence with these regulatory requirements increases our cost of doing business and consequently affects our profitability. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on our operations. However, environmental laws and regulations have been subject to frequent changes over the years, and the imposition of more stringent requirements could have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or our competitive position. Below is a discussion of the principal environmental laws and regulations that relate to our business. 

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, referred to as &#8220;CERCLA&#8221; or the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability, potentially without regard to fault or legality of the activity at the time, on certain classes of persons that are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include 

&#160;

the current or former owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances that have been released at the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to joint and several liabilit ies for the costs of investigating and cleaning up hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of some health studies. In addition, neighboring landowners and other third parties may file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment. 

The federal Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, referred to as &#8220;RCRA,&#8221; regulates the management and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. Some wastes associated with the exploration and production of oil and natural gas are exempted from the most stringent regulation in certain circumstances, such as drilling fluids, produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of oil and natural gas. However, these wastes and other wastes may be otherwise regulated by the EPA or state agencies. Moreover, in the ordinary course of our operations, industrial wastes such as paint wastes and waste solvents may be regulated as hazardous waste under RCRA or considered hazardous substances under CERCLA. 

We currently own or lease, and have in the past owned or leased, a number of properties that have been used as service yards in support of oil and natural gas exploration and production activities. Although we have utilized operating and disposal practices that we considered standard in the industry at the time, there is the possibility that repair and maintenance activities on rigs and equipment stored in these service yards, as well as fluids stored at these yards, may have resulted in the disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes on or under these yards or other locations where these wastes have been taken for disposal. In addition, we own or lease properties that in the past were operated by third parties whose operations were not under our control. These properties and the hydrocarbons or wastes disposed thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes or property contamination. 

In the course of our operations, some of our equipment may be exposed to naturally occurring radiation associated with oil and natural gas deposits, and this exposure may result in the generation of wastes containing naturally occurring radioactive materials, or &#8220;NORM.&#8221; NORM wastes exhibiting trace levels of naturally occurring radiation in excess of established state standards are subject to special handling and disposal requirements, and any storage vessels, piping and work area affected by NORM may be subject to remediation or restoration requirements. Because many of the properties presently or previously owned, operated or occupied by us have been used for oil and natural gas production operations for many years, it is possible that we may incur costs or liabilities associated with elevated levels of NORM. 

Our operations are also subject to the federal Clean Water Act and analogous state laws. Under these laws, permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into regulated surface or subsurface waters. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements under federal law require appropriate operating protocols, including containment berms and similar structures, to help prevent the contamination of regulated waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities or during construction activities. This program requires covered facilities to obtain individual permits, or seek coverage under a general permit. Additionally, permits for discharges of storm water runoff may be required for certain of our properties. 

The federal Clean Water Act and the federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 contain numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to oil spills into regulated waters, and require some owners or operators of facilities that store or otherwise handle oil to prepare and implement spill prevention, control and countermeasure plans, also referred to as &#8220;SPCC plans,&#8221; relating to the possible discharge of oil into regulated waters. &#160; 

&#160; 

Our underground injection operations are subject to the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, referred to as the &#8220;SDWA,&#8221; as well as analogous state and local laws and regulations including the Underground Injection Control (&#8220;UIC&#8221;) program, which program includes requirements for permitting, testing, monitoring, record keeping and reporting of injection well activities. The federal Energy Policy Act of 2005 amended the UIC provisions to exclude certain hydraulic fracturing activities from the definition of &#8220;underground injection&#8221; under certain circumstances. However, the repeal of this exclusion has been advocated by certain advocacy organizations and others in the public. Legislation to amend the SDWA to repeal this exemption and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, as well as legislative proposals to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process, were proposed in recent sessions of Congress. Similar legislation could be introduced in the current session of Congress, which commenced in January 201 6 , or at the state level. For example at the state level, several states in which we operate, including Wyoming, Texas, Colorado and Oklahoma, have adopted regulations requiring operators t o disclose certain information regarding hydraulic fracturing fluids. In addition, public concerns have recently been raised regarding the disposal of &#160; hydraulic fluid in injection wells. Partly in response to public concerns, the Texas Railroad Commission , referred to as &#160; (&#8220;RRC&#8221;) , &#160; amended its existing oil and &#160; gas disposal well regulations to require seismic activity data in permit applications and provisions to authorize the imposition of &#160; certain limitations on existing wells if seismic activity increases in the area of an injection well, including a temporary injection ban. &#160; Our operations employ hydraulic fracturing techniques to stimulate natural gas production from unconventional geological formations, which entails the injection of pressurized fracturing fluids (consisting of water, sand and certain chemicals) into a well bore. Our hydraulic fracturing activities are principally in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas and Colorado. Our operations also involve the 

&#160;

disposal of produced salt water by underground injection. The substantial majority of our saltwater disposal wells are located in Texas and are regulated by the RRC. We also operate salt water disposal wells in New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana and North Dakota and are subject to similar regulatory controls in those states. Regulations in these states require us to obtain a permit from the applicable regulatory agencies to operate each of our underground salt water disposal wells. We believe that we have obtained the necessary permits from these agencies for each of our underground injection wells and that we are in substantial compliance with permit conditions and commission rules. Nevertheless, these regulatory agencies have the general authority to suspend or modify one or more of these permits if continued operation of one of our underground injection wells is likely to result in pollution of freshwater, substantial violation of permit conditions or applicable rules, or leaks to the environment or other conditions such as earthquakes . Although we monitor the injection process of our wells, any leakage from the subsurface portions of the injection wells could cause degradation of fresh groundwater resources, potentially resulting in cancellation of operations of a well, issuance of fines and penalties from governmental agencies, incurrence of expenditures for remediation of the affected resource and imposition of liability by third parties for property damages and personal injuries. In addition, our sales of residual crude oil collected as part of the saltwater injection process could impose liability on us in the event that the entity to which the oil was transferred fails to manage the residual crude oil in accordance with applicable environmental health and safety laws. 

We maintain insurance against some risks associated with environmental liabilities that may occur as a result of well service activities. However, there can be no assurance that this insurance will cover all potential losses, that insurance will continue to be commercially available or that this insurance will be available at premium levels that justify its purchase by us. The occurrence of a significant event that is not fully insured or indemnified against could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations. 

We are also subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, known as ( &#8220;OSHA,&#8221; ) and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and the public. 

We are also subject to the requirements of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations ( &#8220;DOT &#8211; FMCSA&#8221; ) of the U.S. Department of Transportation (&#8220;DOT&#8221;) and comparable state statutes that regulate commercial motor vehicle operations. In addition, we are also subject to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration &#8220;DOT-PHMSA&#8221; and comparable state statutes that regulate hazardous materials shipments. 

The federal Clean Air Act, as amended, known as the &#8220;Clean Air Act&#8221; or ( &#8220;CAA ) &#8221; and state air pollution permitting laws, restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources, including drilling operations and related equipment, and as a result affect oil and natural gas operations. In addition, more stringent regulations governing emissions of air pollutants, including greenhouse gases such as methane (a component of natural gas) and carbon dioxide (&#8220;CO 2 &#8221;), are being developed by the federal government and may increase the costs of compliance for our drilling services or our customers&#8217; operations. For example, on January 14, 2015, the Obama &#160; administration announced a new emission reduction target for methane emissions associated with the oil and gas sector. 

Responding to scientific studies that have suggested that emissions of gases, commonly referred to as &#8220;greenhouse gases,&#8221; including gases associated with the oil and gas sector such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide among others, may be contributing to global warming and other environmental effects, the U.S. Congress has considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. In the recent Congress, numerous legislative measures were introduced that would have imposed restrictions or costs on greenhouse gas emissions, including from the oil and gas industry. It is uncertain whether similar measures will be introduced in, or passed by, the new Congress which co nvened in January 201 6 . However, any such legislation may have the potential to affect our business, customers or the energy sector generally. In addition, the United States has been involved in international negotiations regarding greenhouse gas reductions under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (&#8220;UNFCCC&#8221;). The U.S. was among 195 nations that signed an international accord in December 2015, the so-called Paris Agreement, with the objective of limiting greenhouse gas emissions. The EPA has also taken action under the CAA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, some states have taken or proposed legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. 

Following the U.S. Supreme Court&#8217;s decision in Massachusetts, et al. v. EPA , 549 U.S. 497 (2007), finding that greenhouse gases fall within the CAA definition of &#8220;air pollutant,&#8221; the EPA determined that greenhouse gases from certain sources &#8220;endanger&#8221; public health or welfare. &#160; As a result, the EPA took the position that existing CAA provisions require an assessment of greenhouse gas emissions within the permitting process for certain large new or modified stationary sources under the EPA&#8217;s Prevention of Significant Deterioration (&#8220;PSD&#8221;) and Title V permit programs beginning in 2011. In 2014, the Supreme Court&#8217;s decision in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA limited the EPA to include greenhouse gasses in the permitting process only if PSD was already triggered by another listed pollutant. If deemed cost-effective, facilities that trigger permit requirements may be required to reduce greenhouse gas emissions consistent with the &#8220;best available control technology&#8221; standards. Such changes will also affect state air permitting programs in states that administer the CAA under a delegation of authority, including states in which we have operations. Additionally, in November 2010, the EPA finalized rules expanding its Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule, originally promulgated in October 2009, to be applicable to the oil and natural gas industry. The expansion requires annual, on-site monitoring and additional inventory and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions and affects many of our existing operations and must be considered when planning for future operations. Although subject to legal challenge, the EPA rules promulgated thus far are currently 

&#160;

final and effective, and will remain so unless the regulations are overturned by a court ruling, or Congress adopts legislation altering the EPA&#8217;s regulatory authority. 

&#160; In January 2015, the White House announced plans to regulate methane emissions attributable to the upstream oil and gas industry, including activities related to gathering and compression, as a greenhouse gas. In August 2015, the EPA proposed new regulations that set methane emission standards for new and modified natural gas production and natural gas processing and transmission facilities. The EPA has announced plans to finalize these rules this spring . The rules are a result of the Obama administration&#8217;s efforts to reduce methane emissions from the oil and natural gas sector by up to 45% from 2012 levels by 2025. Until such proposed rules are finalized, the impact on our operations is not known; however, it is believed that the only facilities impacted by this proposed rule would be those placed into service after the rules are finalized. 

A number of states, individually or in regional cooperation, have also imposed restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions under various policies and approaches, including establishing a cap on emissions, requiring efficiency measures, or providing incentives for pollution reduction, use of renewable energy, or use of fuels with lower carbon content. 

These federal, regional and state measures generally apply to industrial sources, including facilities in the oil and gas sector, and could increase the operating and compliance costs of our services and facilities. International accords such as the Paris Agreement may result in additional regulations to control greenhouse gas emis s ions. These regulations could also adversely affect market demand or pricing for our services, by affecting the price of, or reducing the demand for, fossil fuels or providing competitive advantages to competing fuels and energy sources. The potential increase in the costs of our operations could include costs to operate and maint ain our equipment or facilities install new emission controls on our equipment or facilities, acquire allowances to authorize our greenhouse gas emissions, pay taxes related to our greenhouse gas emissions, or administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions program. While we may be able to include some or all of such increased costs in the rates charged for our services, such recovery of costs is uncertain and may depend on events beyond our control, including the provisions of any final regulations. In addition, changes in regulatory policies that result in a reduction in the demand for hydrocarbon products that are deemed to contribute to greenhouse gases, or restrictions on their use, may reduce demand for our services. 

There is considerable debate as to global warming and the environmental effects of greenhouse gas emissions and associated consequences affecting global climate, oceans, and ecosystems. As a commercial enterprise, we are not in a position to validate or repudiate the existence of global warming or various aspects of the scientific debate. However, if global warming is occurring, it could have an impact on our operations. For example, our operations in low lying areas such as the coastal regions of Louisiana and Texas may be at increased risk due to flooding, rising sea levels or disruption of operations from more frequent and severe weather events. Facilities in areas with limited water availability may be impacted if droughts become more frequent or severe. Changes in climate or weather may hinder exploration and production activities or increase or decrease the cost of production of oil and natural gas resources and consequently affect demand for our field services. Changes in climate or weather may also affect consumer demand for energy or alter the overall energy mix. However, we are not in a position to predict the precise effects of global warming on energy markets or the physical effects of global warming. We are providing this disclosure based on publicly available information on the matter. &#160; 

Employees 

As of December 31, 201 5 , we employed approximately 3 , 9 00 people, with approximately 8 0 % employed on an hourly basis. Our future success will depend partially on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements, and we consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory.
