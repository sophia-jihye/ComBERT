DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES 

The Crawford Solution SM &#32; offers comprehensive, integrated claims services, business process outsourcing and consulting services for major product lines including property and casualty claims management; workers' compensation claims and medical management; and legal settlement administration. &#32;The Crawford Solution is delivered to clients through the Company's four operating segments: U.S. Services, which serves the U.S. property and casualty insurance company markets; International, which serves the property and casualty insurance company and self-insurance markets outside of the U.S.; Broadspire&#174;, which serves the self-insurance marketplace, primarily in the U.S.; and Garden City Group, which serves the class action, regulatory, mass tort, bankruptcy, and other legal administration markets, primarily in the U.S. 

A significant portion of our revenues are derived from international operations. For a discussion of certain risks attendant to international operations, see Item 1A, "Risk Factors." 

U.S. SERVICES. The &#32; U.S. Services &#32; segment accounted for &#32; 20.7% &#32; of the Company's revenues before reimbursements in &#32; 2015 . The Company's &#32; U.S. Services &#32; segment provides claims management services in the U.S. Substantially all of the Company's &#32; U.S. Services &#32; segment revenues are derived from the insurance company market. These insurance companies customarily manage their own claims administration function, but often rely upon third-parties for certain services which the Company provides, primarily with respect to field investigation, evaluation and resolution of property and casualty insurance claims, and the provision of outsourced managed contractor services. 

Claims management services offered by our U.S. Services &#32;segment are provided to clients pursuant to a variety of different referral assignments which generally are classified by the underlying insured risk categories used by insurance companies. These major risk categories are: 

&#8226; 

Property &#8212; losses caused by physical damage to commercial or residential real property and certain types of personal property. 

&#8226; 

Catastrophe &#8212; losses caused by all types of natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and floods, and man-made disasters such as oil spills, chemical releases, and explosions. 

&#8226; 

Public Liability &#8212; a wide range of non-automobile liability claims such as product liability; owners, landlords and tenants liabilities; and comprehensive general liability. 

&#8226; 

Automobile &#8212; all types of losses involving use of an automobile, including bodily injury, physical damage, medical payments, collision, fire, theft, and comprehensive liability. 

U.S. Services &#32; is comprised of four major service lines: U.S. Claims Field Operations, U.S. Technical Services, U.S. Catastrophe Services, and U.S. Contractor Connection &#174; . 

&#8226; 

U.S. Claims Field Operations &#32;is the largest service line of the Company's U.S. Services &#32;operations. Services provided by U.S. Claims Field Operations &#32;include property claims management, casualty claims management, and vehicle services.

This innovative service solution for high-frequency, low-complexity claims optimizes the time and work process needed to resolve property claims. &#32; U.S. Contractor Connection &#32; supports our business process outsourcing strategy by providing high-quality outsourced contractor management to national and regional insurance carriers. 

INTERNATIONAL. &#160; The International &#32;segment accounted for 43.3% &#32;of the Company's revenues before reimbursements in 2015 . International &#32; segment revenues are derived primarily from the insurance company and third-party administration markets . The major elements of international claims management services are substantially the same as those provided to U.S. property and casualty insurance company clients by our &#32; U.S. Services &#32; segment. The &#32; International &#32; segment also derives &#32;revenues from third-party administration services provided under the Broadspire &#32;brand. 

BROADSPIRE. &#160; The &#32; Broadspire &#32;segment, which operates in the U.S., accounted for 25.0% &#32;of the Company's revenues before reimbursements in 2015 . Broadspire &#32; Services, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is a leading third-party administrator to employers and insurance companies, offering a comprehensive, integrated approach to workers' compensation, liability claims management, medical management, care management, and disability management services in the U.S. &#32;&#32; Major risk categories serviced by the Broadspire &#32;segment are:

Financial results from the Company's operations outside of the U.S., Canada, and the Caribbean, and from certain subsidiaries in the Philippines are reported and consolidated on a two-month delayed basis in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 810, "Consolidation," in order to provide sufficient time for accumulation of their results and, accordingly, the Company's &#32; December 31, 2015 , &#32; 2014 , and &#32; 2013 &#32; consolidated financial statements include the financial position of such operations as of October 31, &#32; 2015 &#32; and &#32; 2014 , respectively, and the results of such operations and cash flows for the fiscal periods ended October 31, &#32; 2015 , &#32; 2014 , and &#32; 2013 , respectively . 

In the normal course of the Company's business, it sometimes incurs certain out-of-pocket expenses that are thereafter reimbursed by its clients. Under generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. ("GAAP"), these out-of-pocket expenses and associated reimbursements are required to be included when reporting expenses and revenues, respectively, in the Company's consolidated results of operations. However, because the amounts of reimbursed expenses and related revenues offset each other in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations with no impact to net income or operating earnings, management does not believe it is informative or beneficial to include these amounts in expenses and revenues, respectively. As a result, unless otherwise indicated, revenue amounts on a consolidated basis and for each of our operating segments described herein exclude reimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses. &#32; A reconciliation of revenues before reimbursements to consolidated revenues determined in accordance with GAAP is self-evident from the face of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Additional financial information regarding each of the Company's segments and geographic areas, including the information required by Item 101(b) of Regulation S-K, is included in Note 13, "Segment and Geographic Information," to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

MATERIAL CUSTOMERS 

Revenues and operating earnings from the Garden City Group &#32;operating segment are project based and can vary significantly from period to period depending on the timing of project engagement and the work performed in a given period. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, Garden City Group &#32;derived more than 10% of its revenues from each of the Deepwater Horizon class action settlement projects and from another non-Gulf related class action settlement project. The revenues from each of these projects were individually less than 10% of our consolidated revenues in each of 2015, 2014, and 2013. We expect activity on these projects to continue in 2016, although at further reduced rates. 

In addition, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our U.S. Services &#32;segment derived in excess of 10% of its revenue from each of two customers, although individually neither of these customers accounted for in excess of 10% of our consolidated revenues. The services provided to these customers are primarily project based and are covered by the terms of multiple contractual arrangements which expire at various times in the future. 

In the event we are not able to retain these relationships, or replace any lost revenues from these projects as they reach their respective end dates, revenues and operating earnings within these segments, and possibly for the Company as a whole, could be materially adversely affected. 

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND TRADEMARKS 

The Company's intellectual property portfolio is an important asset which it seeks to expand and protect globally through a combination of trademarks, trade names, copyrights and trade secrets. The Company owns a number of active trademark applications and registrations which expire at various times. As the laws of many countries do not protect intellectual property to the same extent as the laws of the U.S., the Company cannot ensure that it will be able to adequately protect its intellectual property assets outside of the U.S. The failure to protect our intellectual property assets could have a material adverse affect on our business , however the loss of any single patent, trademark or service mark, taken alone, would not have a material adverse effect on any of our segments or on the Company as a whole . 

SERVICE DELIVERY 

The Company's claims management services are offered primarily through its global network serving clients in more than 70 countries. Contractor Connection services are offered by providing high-quality outsourced contractor management to national and regional insurance carriers. 

COMPETITION 

The global claims management services market is highly competitive and comprised of a large number of companies of varying size and that offer a varied scope of services. The demand from insurance companies and self-insured entities for services provided by independent claims service firms like us is largely dependent on industry-wide claims volumes, which are affected by, among other things, the insurance underwriting cycle, weather-related events, general economic activity, overall employment levels, and workplace injury rates. Demand is also impacted by decisions insurance companies and self-insured entities may make with respect to the level of claims outsourced to independent claim service firms as opposed to those handled by their own in-house claims adjusters. In addition, our ability to retain clients and maintain or increase case referrals is also dependent in part on our ability to continue to provide high-quality, competitively priced services and effective sales efforts. 

We typically earn our revenues on an individual fee-per-claim basis for claims management services we provide to insurance companies and self-insured entities. Accordingly, the volume of claim referrals to us is a key driver of our revenues. Generally, fees are earned on cases as services are provided, which generally occurs in the period the case is assigned to us, although sometimes a portion or substantially all of the revenues generated by a specific case assignment will be earned in subsequent periods. We cannot predict the future trend of case volumes for a number of reasons, including the frequency and severity of weather-related cases and the occurrence of natural and man-made disasters, which are a significant source of cases for us and are not subject to accurate forecasting. 

The Company competes with a substantial number of smaller local and regional claims management services firms located throughout the U.S. and internationally. Many of these smaller firms have rate structures that are lower than the Company's or may, in certain markets, have local knowledge which provides them a competitive advantage. The Company does not believe that these smaller firms offer the broad spectrum of claims management services in the range of locations the Company provides and, although such firms may secure business which has a local or regional source, the Company believes its quality product offerings, broader scope of services, and geographically dispersed offices provide the Company with an overall competitive advantage in securing business from both U.S. and international clients. There are also national and global independent companies that provide a similar broad spectrum of claims management services and who directly compete with the Company. 

The legal settlement administration market within which our Garden City Group segment operates is also highly competitive but is comprised of a smaller number of specialized entities. The demand for legal settlement administration services is generally not directly tied to or affected by the insurance underwriting cycle. The demand for these services is largely dependent on the volume of securities and product liability class action settlements, the volume of bankruptcy filings and the resulting settlements, volume of mass torts and general economic conditions. &#32; Competition in this segment is primarily on pricing, resource allocation ability, and experience servicing similar matters. &#32; The Company believes that our experienced leadership, coupled with global resources and state-of-the-art technology, provide a competitive advantage in this market. 

EMPLOYEES 

At &#32; December 31, 2015 , the total number of full-time equivalent employees ("FTEs") was &#32;8,941. I n addition, the Company also from time to time uses the resources of a significant number of available temporary employees and a network of independent contractors, as and when the demand for services requires. These temporary employees primarily provide catastrophe adjuster services. The Company, through Crawford Educational Services, provides many of its employees with formal classroom training in basic and advanced skills relating to claims administration and healthcare management services. In many cases, employees are required to complete these or other professional courses in order to qualify for promotions from their existing positions. The Company generally considers its relations with its employees to be good. 

BACKLOG 

Backlog is not meaningful other than in our &#32; Garden City Group &#32; segment. At &#32; December 31, 2015 &#32; and &#32; 2014 , our &#32; Garden City Group &#32; segment had an estimated revenue backlog related to projects awarded totaling approximately &#32; $81 million &#32; and &#32; $102 million , respectively. Additional information regarding this backlog is contained in Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption " Garden City Group ."
