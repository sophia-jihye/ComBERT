 Item 1. Business. &#160; 

GENERAL 

&#160; 

We are engaged in the development, production and marketing of TOFUTTI&#174; brand non-dairy frozen desserts and other food products. TOFUTTI products are soy-based, non-dairy products which contain no butterfat, cholesterol or lactose. Our products are 100% milk free yet offer the same texture and full-bodied taste as their dairy counterparts. Our products are also free of cholesterol and derive their fat from soy and corn, both naturally lower in saturated fat than dairy products. With the exception of Mintz&#8217;s Blintzes, all of our products are completely vegan and our soy-cheese products are gluten free as well. In addition, all of our products are certified kosher-parve and all of our soy-cheese products are also certified halal. 

&#160; 

We were organized under the laws of the State of New York in 1981 and became a Delaware corporation in 1984. Our registered office and principal executive offices are located at 50 Jackson Drive, Cranford, New Jersey 07016, our telephone number is 908-272-2400. Our address on the Internet is www.tofutti.com. The information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this annual report. 

&#160; 

STRATEGY 

&#160; 

Our objective is to be a leading provider of non-dairy, vegan, soy-based food products, primarily frozen desserts and soy-cheese products, to supermarkets and health food stores in the United States and abroad. We intend to continue to introduce new products that offer good taste while containing no butterfat, cholesterol or dairy to these markets. 

&#160; 

We focus our marketing efforts toward those consumers who find our products essential to their everyday diets because of health, lifestyle or religious reasons. In order to broaden the use of our soy-cheese products, we incorporate them into our branded food products such as blintzes, pizza, and other frozen entr&#233;e products. As part of this strategy, we seek to achieve brand awareness through product innovation, eye-catching packaging, trade advertising, and a strong word-of-mouth marketing program. We believe that our ability to offer a wide range of non-dairy, vegan soy-based, kosher-parve products will continue to provide us with a competitive advantage. 

&#160; 

TOFUTTI PRODUCT LINE 

&#160; 

We offer a broad product line of soy-based, non-dairy products. Our non-dairy products include frozen desserts, soy-based cheeses and spreads, and other frozen food products. 

&#160; 

Frozen Desserts 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Premium TOFUTTI&#174; non-dairy frozen dessert, available in pre-packed pints, three-gallon cans, and soft serve mix, is sold nationally in supermarkets, health food stores, retail shops, and restaurants. Premium TOFUTTI was the first non-dairy frozen dessert to be marketed to the general public through supermarkets. We currently offer ten flavors of premium, hard frozen TOFUTTI in pints, including four newly introduced Special Edition flavors, three flavors in three gallon bulk cans and one soft-serve flavor. &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; TOFUTTI CUTIES&#174; , our best-selling frozen dessert product, are bite size frozen sandwiches combining a choice of one of five different fillings between two chocolate wafers. Half the size of traditional ice cream sandwiches, TOFUTTI CUTIES offer consumers a portion controlled treat. Unlike ice cream sandwiches, CUTIES are totally dairy free, without butterfat or cholesterol, yet with the same great taste that makes ice cream sandwiches one of the bestselling novelties in the freezer case. Like all our frozen dessert products, they are completely trans-fat free, including the wafers. For those individuals who cannot have chocolate, we offer our TOTALLY VANILLA TOFUTTI CUTIE , made from vanilla TOFUTTI between two vanilla wafers. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; YOURS TRULY cones have a generous scoop of creamy vanilla TOFUTTI set in a chocolate-coated crispy cone, then covered in deep, rich chocolate and topped with a crispy chocolate cookie crunch. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; TOTALLY FUDGE POPS&#174;, CHOCOLATE FUDGE TREATS, and COFFEE BREAK TREATS are stick novelties that offer the consumer the same taste as real fudge or coffee bars. The TOTALLY FUDGE POPS, made with organic sugar and with no gluten added, have 70 calories and 1 gram of fat per bar, while fat free, no sugar added CHOCOLATE FUDGE TREATS and COFFEE BREAK TREATS&#8482; have only 30 calories per bar. Both products appeal to anyone on either a low fat or low carb diet. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; HOORAY HOORAY is a sugar free stick novelty made with stevia, a natural sugar replacement ideal for those individuals who want to avoid sugar without using an artificial sweetener. Each bar has a creamy center of vanilla Tofutti, surrounded by a sugar-free chocolate coating containing crisped rice. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; The MOJITO BAR is a creamy, lime flavored TOFUTTI stick novelty, which tastes likes a mojito and offers the consumer a refreshing novelty stick item. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; MARRY ME BARS&#228; are stick novelties that feature creamy vanilla TOFUTTI surrounded by a dark chocolate coating. Made with organic sugar and with no gluten added, MARRY M E BARS satisfy important diet requirements of certain consumers with that great TOFUTTI taste. &#160; 

Non-dairy Soy-Based Cheese Products 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; BETTER THAN CREAM CHEESE&#174; is similar in taste and texture to traditional cream cheese, but is milk-free, butterfat-free, gluten-free and contains no cholesterol. It is as versatile as real cream cheese, whether spread on a bagel, used as a dip for snack items, such as crackers or chips, or used in any favorite recipe. BETTER THAN CREAM CHEESE comes in four flavors, plain, Herb &#38; Chives, French Onion and Garlic &#38; Herb and is available in 8 oz. retail packages and in 5 lb. containers and 30 lb. bulk boxes for food service customers. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; SOUR SUPREME&#174; is similar in taste and texture to traditional sour cream, but is milk-free, butterfat-free, gluten-free and contains no cholesterol. SOUR SUPREME has the versatility of sour cream with the added benefit of being dairy free. The 12 oz. retail packages are available in plain and guacamole. The plain version is also available in 5 lb. containers and 30 lb. bulk boxes for food service customers. Like BETTER THAN CREAM CHEESE, SOUR SUPREME is sold nationally in most health food stores and select supermarkets. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; TOFUTTI SOY-CHEESE SLICES&#8482; offer consumers a delicious non-dairy, gluten-free, vegan alternative to regular cheese slices and contain no trans fatty acids. Available as individually wrapped slices in 8 oz. packages, TOFUTTI SOY-CHEESE SLICES are sold in most health food stores and select supermarkets and come in two flavors: Mozzarella and American. The Mozzarella version is also available in 40 lb. blocks for food service customers. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; BETTER THAN RICOTTA CHEESE&#174; our dairy free ricotta cheese alternative, offers consumers a dairy-free and gluten-free alternative that tastes and works just like real ricotta cheese in all their favorite recipes. Available in 16 oz. retail containers, BETTER THAN RICOTTA is available nationally in supermarkets and health food stores. &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Frozen Food Products 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; TOFUTTI PIZZA PIZZAZ combines a delicious pan crust, zesty sauce and TOFUTTI totally dairy free mozzarella cheese into a completely authentic, yet healthy pizza. TOFUTTI PIZZA PIZZAZ is sold nine square slices to a package and is available in freezer cases in select supermarkets and health food stores. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; TOFUTTI BLINTZES are frozen crepes filled with TOFUTTI BETTER THAN CREAM CHEESE that are dairy and cholesterol free, yet taste just like real cheese blintzes. Our BLINTZES are available in freezer cases in select supermarkets and health food stores and can be served hot, warm, or slightly chilled as a main meal or a snack. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; TOFUTTI RAVIOLI combine our BETTER THAN RICOTTA CHEESE&#174; blend with egg free pasta into a healthy and filling meal.

Planned 2016 Product Introductions 

&#160; 

Beginning in the third quarter of 2016, we plan to introduce a new line of vegan dips, shredded cheddar and mozzarella soy-cheeses, and several new frozen dessert stick novelties. 

&#160; 

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION 

&#160; 

TOFUTTI products are sold and distributed across the United States and internationally, and can be found in gourmet specialty shops, kosher supermarkets, natural/health food stores, and national and regional supermarket chains. All of our products are sold by independent unaffiliated food brokers to distributors and sometimes on a direct basis to retail chain accounts or to warehouse accounts that directly service chain accounts. Such direct accounts include Walmart, Kroger, Roundy&#8217;s Supermarkets, King Soopers, Fred Meyer, Restaurant Depot, DeMoulas/Market Basket, Wakefern Food Corp., and Ahold USA. Food brokers act as our agents within designated territories or for specific accounts and receive commissions, which average 5% of net collected sales. Certain key domestic accounts and all international accounts are handled directly by us. Our products are also sold in approximately thirty other countries. 

&#160; 

We currently sell our dairy-free frozen dessert products, frozen entrees and soy-cheese products in most major markets in the United States, including Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Charlotte, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, Nashville, New York, Orlando, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Portland, Richmond, Salt Lake City, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, St. Louis, Tampa and Washington, D.C. 

&#160; 

We currently distribute all of our products by common carrier or by allowing customers to pick-up products from outside storage facilities. We do not own, lease or otherwise maintain any vehicles involved in the shipping of our products. From our co-packing facilities, we either ship direct to our customers or we ship to outside public storage facilities from which our customers are able to pick up products. Use of outside storage facilities in several key locations in the United States allows us to provide our customers with products in a timely fashion. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

In addition to ice cream and cheese distributors, our products are handled by most major national and regional natural and/or gourmet specialty distributors in the country. We distribute our products through thirty-five (35) distributors in the national health food market. 

&#160; 

Our sales to health food accounts in fiscal 2015 decreased to approximately $6,081,000, or 44% of total sales, from approximately $6,379,000, or 44% of total sales, in fiscal 2014. Our sales to the kosher market increased slightly to approximately $1,436,000, or 10% of sales, in fiscal 2015, from sales of approximately $1,418,000, or 10% of sales, in fiscal 2014. 

&#160; 

The following table presents the geographical breakdown of our sales in our largest domestic markets for the last two fiscal years. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; Fiscal Year ended January 2, 2016 &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year ended December 27, 2014 &#160; &#160; &#160; Sales &#160; &#160; % of total Sales &#160; &#160; Sales &#160; &#160; % of total Sales &#160; &#160; &#160; (Dollars in thousands) &#160; Midwest &#160; $ 2,182 &#160; &#160; &#160; 16 % &#160; $ 2,325 &#160; &#160; &#160; 16 % Metropolitan New York &#160; &#160; 2,172 &#160; &#160; &#160; 16 % &#160; &#160; 2,351 &#160; &#160; &#160; 16 % California &#160; &#160; 1,712 &#160; &#160; &#160; 12 % &#160; &#160; 1,815 &#160; &#160; &#160; 13 % New England &#160; &#160; 1,176 &#160; &#160; &#160; 9 % &#160; &#160; 1,685 &#160; &#160; &#160; 12 % Northwest &#160; &#160; 867 &#160; &#160; &#160; 6 % &#160; &#160; 745 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5 % Florida &#160; &#160; 764 &#160; &#160; &#160; 6 % &#160; &#160; 769 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5 % Upstate New York &#160; &#160; 687 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5 % &#160; &#160; 455 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3 % Mid-Atlantic &#160; &#160; 515 &#160; &#160; &#160; 4 % &#160; &#160; 631 &#160; &#160; &#160; 4 % Southwest &#160; &#160; 456 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3 % &#160; &#160; 445 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3 % Southeast &#160; &#160; 276 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2 % &#160; &#160; 248 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2 % Rocky Mountains &#160; &#160; 210 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2 % &#160; &#160; 298 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2 % &#160; 

During fiscal 2015, we shipped our products to distributors in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Egypt, England, Ireland, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico, Panama, South Africa, and Trinidad. Our distributor in England is our master distributor for all of Europe and part of the Middle East, excluding Israel, and sells our products to approximately twenty other countries. Sales to foreign distributors decreased to $2,319,000, or 17% of sales, in fiscal 2015, as compared to $2,495,000, or 17% of sales, in fiscal 2014. We conduct all of our foreign business in U.S. dollars. Accordingly, our future export sales could be adversely affected by an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against local currencies, which could increase the local currency price of our products. 

&#160; 

COMPETITION 

&#160; 

TOFUTTI frozen desserts compete with all forms of ice cream products, yogurt-based desserts and other soy-based frozen desserts. We believe that we are a leader in the non-dairy frozen dessert product market and offer the most complete line of non-dairy frozen dessert products. Other soy-based frozen dessert products are presently being sold throughout the United States by established manufacturers and distributors of ice cream and other frozen dessert products. The ice cream and frozen dessert industry is highly competitive and most companies with whom we compete are substantially larger and have significantly greater resources than us. Our other products also face substantial competition from non-dairy and dairy products marketed by companies with significantly greater resources than we have. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

In most product categories, we compete not only with widely advertised branded products, but also with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices. Competition in our product categories is based on product innovation, product quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing, promotional activity, and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. Our market share and ability to grow our revenue could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing innovative products in response to changing consumer demands or by new product introductions of our competitors. If we are unable to build and sustain brand equity by offering recognizably superior product quality, we may be unable to maintain premium pricing over competitive products. We believe that we are able to compete effectively due to our ability to offer an array of non-dairy frozen dessert, soy-cheese and other food products that contain no butterfat, cholesterol or lactose and are 100% milk-free, yet offer the same texture and full-bodied taste as their dairy counterparts. 

&#160; 

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT 

&#160; 

All of our current products were developed by us in our own laboratory. David Mintz, our Chief Executive Officer, devotes a substantial amount of his time and effort to new product development and product reformulation. In fiscal 2015 and 2014, our product development expenses were approximately $523,000 and $641,000, respectively. These amounts do not include any portion of Mr. Mintz&#8217;s salary. All product development costs are expensed as incurred and are recorded as operating expenses in our financial statements. 

&#160; 

PRODUCTION 

&#160; 

We believe that all of our products are produced under the strictest quality control procedures that are available in each manufacturing facility used by us. These quality control procedures include, but are not limited to, the cleaning processes utilized prior to running our products; spot line inspections during production; in-house laboratory testing as required by government agencies; supervision of all our production by our kosher supervisory service; supervision of all our soy-cheese production by our halal supervisory service; and random testing by outside independent laboratories to ensure that our internal quality control procedures and guidelines are being properly followed. 

&#160; 

All of our products are produced by co-packers to whom we supply certain key ingredients and packaging for the manufacturing processes. Our co-packing facilities are fully licensed and must comply with all state and federal laws and regulations. We currently utilize six co-packers. Our co-packers manufacture and package our products and, in certain instances, warehouse such products pending shipment. For certain key product categories, such as non-dairy frozen desserts and non-dairy soy-based cheeses, we have more than one co-packer. In selecting an appropriate co-packer, we take into account all of the preceding factors, plus cost considerations such as product processing fees and freight and warehouse expenses. 

&#160; 

During the years ended January 2, 2016 and December 27, 2014, we purchased approximately 24% and 26%, respectively, of our finished goods from Ice Cream Specialties, our frozen dessert novelty co-packer, and 29% and 28% of our finished goods, respectively, from Franklin Foods, our BETTER THAN CREAM CHEESE, SOUR SUPREME, and BETTER THAN RICOTTA co-packer. 

&#160; 

Relationships with Co-Packers 

&#160; 

We do not have any written production agreements with our co-packers and do not anticipate that we would encounter any material difficulty in obtaining alternative production sources, at a comparable cost, if one or all of our co-packers decide to terminate their relationships with us. Nevertheless, any disruption in supply could have a material adverse effect on our company. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

In order to protect our formulas, we have entered into confidentiality arrangements with our co-packers and some of our co-packers&#8217; employees. All of our employees, including officers, sign similar confidentiality agreements. There can be no assurance that such confidentiality arrangements can or will be maintained, or that our trade secrets, know-how and marketing ability cannot be obtained by others, or that others do not now possess similar or even more effective capabilities. 

&#160; 

Kosher Certification 

&#160; 

KOF-K Kosher Supervision, or KOF-K, of Teaneck, New Jersey provides us with our kosher certification service. Before KOF-K will permit its certification, evidenced by its symbol, to be placed on a product, KOF-K must approve both the ingredients contained in the product and the facility processing the product. Approval of the manufacturing facilities we use include periodic inspections, and in most cases, on-site supervision of actual production. We pay a yearly renewal fee for certification. We believe that our ability to successfully market and distribute our products is dependent upon our continued compliance with the requirements of rabbinical certification. All TOFUTTI products meet the requirements for certification as kosher-parve. 

&#160; 

Halal Certification 

&#160; 

In early 2013, we completed a halal certification process at Franklin Foods, the co-packer of our BETTER THAN CREAM CHEESE , SOUR SUPREME and BETTER THAN RICOTTA products and at Whitehall Specialties, the co-packer of our soy-cheese slices and bulk Better Than Mozzarella products. This certification is provided by the Islamic Food and Nutrition Council of America (IFANCA) of Park Ridge, Illinois and currently applies only to those products manufactured by Franklin Foods and Whitehall Specialties. Before IFANCA will permit its certification to be placed on a product, which is evidenced by its symbol, IFANCA must approve both the ingredients contained in the product and the facility processing the product. Approval of the manufacturing facilities we use includes periodic inspections. There is a yearly renewal fee for certification. All TOFUTTI soy-cheese products meet the requirements for certification as halal. 

&#160; 

TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS 

&#160; 

We have registered our trademark, TOFUTTI&#174;, and other trademarks for our frozen desserts and other products in the United States and approximately thirty-seven foreign countries. We believe our trademarks are an important means of establishing consumer recognition for our products and we will vigorously oppose any unauthorized use of our trademarks. We are not currently involved in any trademark litigation. 

&#160; 

Although we believe that our formulas and processes are proprietary, we have not sought patent protection for such technology. Instead, we are relying on the complexity of our technology, on trade secrecy laws and on confidentiality agreements. We believe that our technology has been independently developed and does not infringe the patents of others. 

&#160; 

GOVERNMENT REGULATION 

&#160; 

Companies engaged in the manufacture, packaging and distribution of food items are subject to extensive regulation by various government agencies which, pursuant to statutes, rules, and regulations, prescribe quality, purity, manufacturing and labeling requirements. Food products are often subject to &#8220;standard of identity&#8221; requirements, which are promulgated at either the Federal or state level to determine the permissible qualitative and quantitative ingredient content of food. To the extent that any product that we seek to market does not conform to an applicable standard, special permission to market such a product is required. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Our United States product labels are subject to regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA. Such regulations include standards for product descriptions, nutritional claims, label format, minimum type sizes, content and location of nutritional information panels, nutritional comparisons, and ingredient content panels. Our labels, ingredients and manufacturing processes are subject to inspection by the FDA. We believe that we are in compliance with current labeling requirements and conduct periodic reviews to make certain that such compliance is on-going. 

&#160; 

The Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Food Safety Modernization Act and rules and regulations promulgated by the FDA thereunder, contain no specific Federal standard of identity which is applicable to our products. Our frozen dessert products meet the New York State standard of identity for &#8220;parevine,&#8221; which has been adopted by at least eight other states. Many states require registration and label review before food products can be sold. While approval in one jurisdiction generally indicates the products will meet with approval in other jurisdictions, there is no assurance that approval from other jurisdictions will be forthcoming. 

&#160; 

Food manufacturing facilities are subject to inspections by various safety, health and environmental regulatory authorities. A finding of a failure to comply with one or more regulatory requirements can result in the imposition of sanctions including the closing of all or a portion of a company&#8217;s facilities, subject to a period during which the company can remedy the alleged violations. Our Cranford, New Jersey facility is subject to inspection by the New Jersey-Kosher Enforcement Bureau and the New Jersey Environmental Health Services. We believe that we, our distributors and our co-packers are in compliance in all material respects with governmental regulations regarding our current products and have obtained the material governmental permits, licenses, qualifications and approvals required for our operations. Our compliance with Federal, state and local environmental laws has not materially affected us either economically or in the manner in which we conduct our business. However, there can be no assurance that our company, our distributors and our co-packers will be able to comply with such laws and regulations in the future or that new governmental laws and regulations will not be introduced that could prevent or temporarily inhibit the development, distribution and sale of our products to consumers. 

&#160; 

New government laws and regulations may be introduced in the future that could result in additional compliance costs, seizures, confiscations, recalls or monetary fines, any of which could prevent or inhibit the development, distribution and sale of our products. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

&#160; 

EMPLOYEES 

&#160; 

On January 2, 2016, we employed nine persons on a full-time basis as compared to twelve persons on a full time basis on December 27, 2014. We do not have any collective bargaining agreements with our employees. 

&#160;
