 ITEM 1: 

BUSINESS 

Introduction 

Allied Ventures Holdings Corp., (the Company), was incorporated on March 31, 1980, under the laws of the State of California as Expertelligence, Inc. On June 26, 2006, the Company reincorporated in Nevada. On March 24, 2011, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to change its name to Pay Mobile, Inc. On January 2, 2013, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to change its name to Allied Ventures Holding Corp. On February 21, 2013 the Company changed its name to Dephasium Corp. and thereafter, on February 23, 2015, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to change its name to Allied Ventures Holdings Corp.

&#160;

On March 24, 2011, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the Agreement) with Pay Mobile, Inc. (PMD) a Delaware corporation and its shareholders. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of PMD. On June 11, 2012 the Agreement with PMD was rescinded and the common shares of the Company which were previously issued to the PMD shareholders pursuant to the Agreement were canceled.

&#160;

On March 5, 2013, the Registrant entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement for the purchase of certain patents and trademarks from Dephasium, Ltd., a limited partnership organized under the laws of the United Kingdom. Pursuant to the Agreement, in consideration of the transfer to the Registrant of the ANCILIA patent and trademark, Registration Number 4,085,620, the Registrant agreed to issue Dephasium 70,000,000 shares of its restricted common stock. In addition, in consideration of $15,000, the Registrant redeemed and cancelled 50,000,000 shares of its restricted common stock previously issued its former sole officer and director, Colon-Alonso, who as of that date, ceased to be a shareholder of the Registrant. The Registrant has also agreed to name Lucien Gerard AIM to its Board of Directors.

&#160;

In exchange for the issuance of the 70,000,000 shares of our restricted common stock, we relied on a Patent Evaluation which had been received from an independent third party, OMECA for purposes of determining the patent &#8217; s value. At that time. Dephasium, Ltd., had already established a web site for its operations in Europe which can viewed at www.dephasiums.com. Thereafter, Dephasium Ltd. set up an online store at www.Dephasiumstore.com . The on line store enabled the Company to sell the products which it was distributing in the United States and Canada in conjunction with its Distribution Agreement with Dephasium, Ltd. The Company was to receive 30% of the revenues generated from sales within the United States and Canada. The site failed to generate any sales and the Company does not have the resources to hire a sales force to market the products in the United States and Canada. As such, the Company has determined that it is in its best interest to discontinue its plans to sell products in the United States and Canada. In doing so, the Company has also determined that the ANCILIA patent does not have any value on our books and records.

&#160;

Effective December 31, 2013 the Company entered into two agreements with Dephasium Ltd. The first one was a restructuring of its prior Asset Purchase Agreement whereby the Company had issued 70,000,000 to Dephasium Ltd. In exchange for the ANCILIA patent and trademark registration number 4,085,627. Pursuant to the Restructuring Agreement, the Company transferred back the ANCILIA patent and trademark and Dephasium Ltd. agreed to cancel the 70,000,000 shares of the Company &#8217; s common which were previously issued to it. In addition the Company committed up to $25,000 to be used to market Dephasium, Ltd. &#8217; s products and entered into a separate Licensing Agreement with Dephasium, Ltd. That Licensing Agreement, also dated December 31, 2013, granted the Company a license to market Dephasium, Ltd. products in North American in return for a 25% net license fee. That licensing agreement expired on December 31, 2014.

&#160;

In addition, on December 31, 2013 Hal Lansky entered into a Promissory Note with the Company in the sum of $50,000 in return for the Company agreeing to issue him 50,000,000 shares of the Company &#8217; s common stock. The stock was to be cancelled if the $50,000 due on the Note was not paid to the Company on or before July 1, 2014.The Company received the $50,000 on June 30, 2014 and as such the Note has been canceled and the funds have been added to the working capital of the Company. Furthermore, as reported in the 8-K filed with the SEC on January 24, 

2015, J. Francisco resigned as an officer and director of the Company, thus resigning all his positions and Harold Minksky was appointed the Company &#8217; s sole officer and director.

The Company underwent a change of control on January 21, 2016, at which time Harold Minsky resigned all the management positions he held. G. Reed Petersen and White Rim Cattle Company LLC each purchased 25,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company from Harold Minsky. Mr. Petersen is the Member Manager of White Rim Cattle Company , LLC and thus can be considered a control person of all 50,000,000 shares of stock of the Company. Pursuant to a Board of Directors meeting, Mr. Petersen was elected to and accepted all the management positions that Harold Minsky had previously held. 

On January 22, 2016 Mr. Petersen advanced the company the sum of $20,000 classified as an advance from shareholder to pay the accounts payable and to pay the necessary professionals to bring the company current so it can apply for a listing on the OTCQB.

Current Status of our Business 

The Company is considered to be shell corporation and in the development stage and has not yet generated or realized any revenues from business operations. The Company's business strategy has changed to seeking potential merger candidates and we are now considered a shell as defined by the SEC. The Company's auditors have issued a going concern opinion on our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. This means that our auditors believe there is doubt that the Company can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless it obtains additional capital to pay its bills. This is because the Company has not generated any revenues and no revenues are currently anticipated. Accordingly, we must raise cash from sources such as investments by others in the Company and through possible transactions with strategic or joint venture partners. We do not plan to use any capital raised for the purchase or sale of any plant or significant equipment. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the Company and the accompanying notes appearing subsequently under the caption &#34;Financial Statements.&#34;

Employees 

At December 31, 2015 the Company did not have any employees. 

We have engaged consultants for accounting, legal, and other part-time and occasional services.
