 Item 1. Business Overview 

We are a leading provider of cloud-based supply chain management solutions, providing network-proven integrations and comprehensive retail performance analytics to thousands of customers worldwide. We provide our solutions through the SPS Commerce platform, a cloud-based product suite that improves the way suppliers, retailers, distributors and other customers place, manage and fulfill orders. Implementing and maintaining supply chain management capabilities is resource intensive and not a core competency for most businesses. The SPS Commerce platform eliminates the need for on-premise software and support staff, which enables our supplier customers to focus their resources on their core business. The SPS Commerce platform enables retailers and suppliers to shorten supply cycle times, optimize inventory levels and sell-through, reduce costs and ensure suppliers satisfy exacting retailer requirements. 

As of December 31, 2015, we had over 23,000 customers with contracts to pay us monthly fees, which we refer to as recurring revenue customers. We have also generated revenues by providing our cloud-based supply chain management solutions to an additional 42,000 organizations that, together with our recurring revenue customers, we refer to as our customers. Once connected to our platform, our customers often require integrations to new organizations that represent an expansion of our platform and new sources of revenues for us. 

As a provider of cloud services, we enable our customers to easily interact with their trading partners around the world without the local implementation and servicing of software that traditional on-premise solutions require. Our delivery model also enables us to offer functionality, integration, analytics and reliability with less cost and risk than traditional solutions. 

For 2015, 2014 and 2013, we generated revenues of $158.5 million, $127.9 million and $104.4 million, respectively. Our fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2015 represented our 60th consecutive quarter of increased revenues. Recurring revenues from recurring revenue customers accounted for 91%, 90% and 89% of our total revenues for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our revenues are not concentrated with any customer, as our largest customer represented 2% or less of total revenues for 2015, 2014 and 2013. 

Our Industry 

Today&#146;s Retail Landscape 

One of the driving factors in the retail industry today is the rising influence of e-commerce and the mobile shopping experience. The retail industry is in the midst of a transformation, as retailers, suppliers and the many companies that facilitate transactions in the industry reshape how they do business and adapt to omnichannel retailing &#151; defined as providing a shopper with a consistent experience regardless of where they might engage a retailer (or increasingly a supplier), whether bricks-and-mortar, website, or mobile experience. 

Supply Chain Management Industry Background 

The supply chain management industry enables thousands of retailers around the world to transact and grow their relationships with tens of thousands of suppliers. Additional participants in this market include distributors, third-party logistics providers, manufacturers, fulfillment and warehousing providers and sourcing companies. Supply chain management involves communicating data about the goods themselves, data related to the exchange of goods among these trading partners, and information about the many thousands of companies who are members of the supply chain community. At every stage of the supply chain there are inefficient, labor-intensive processes between trading partners with significant documentation requirements, such as the counting, sorting and verifying of goods before shipment, while in transit and upon delivery. Supply chain management 

&#160; 

solutions must address trading partners&#146; needs for integration, collaboration, connectivity, visibility and data analytics to improve the speed, accuracy and efficiency with which goods are ordered and supplied. 

The industry initially focused on automating and streamlining the processing of fulfillment transactions between retailers and suppliers, and others in the supply chain, ensuring orders were placed accurately and quickly, and that goods were delivered on time and meeting the retailer&#146;s requirements. As the pace of change in retailing has accelerated with the emergence of e-commerce, today&#146;s supply chain solutions need to also encompass a growing set of valuable capabilities that draw on this foundational transaction information, and add value beyond the supply chain management function within retailers and suppliers. In today&#146;s rapidly changing omnichannel retail market, where retailers and suppliers are increasingly focused on electronic commerce and brick-and-mortar commerce as a continuum, supply chain information has a role across the entire enterprise. Demand planning and forecasting groups need visibility from the front of the store all the way back to the factory to ensure supply meets demand. Sourcing operations require access to thousands of new items to drive their e-commerce growth and ensure physical stores have the items consumers will find compelling and engaging. 

As familiarity and acceptance of cloud-based services continues to accelerate, we believe companies, both large and small, will continue to turn to cloud-based services similar to ours for their supply chain integration needs, as opposed to traditional on-premise software deployment. 

The Omnichannel Foundation &#151; Fulfillment Automation Between Retailers and Suppliers 

Retailers impose specific work-flow rules and standards on their trading partners for electronically communicating their supply chain information. These &#147;rule books&#148; include specific business processes for suppliers to exchange data and documentation requirements such as invoices, purchase orders and advance shipping notices. Rule books can be hundreds of pages, and retailers frequently have multiple rule books for international requirements or specific fulfillment models. Suppliers working with multiple retailers need to accommodate different rule books for each retailer. These rule books are not standardized between retailers, but vary based on a retailer&#146;s size, industry and technological capabilities. The responsibility for creating information &#147;maps,&#148; which are integration connections between the retailer and the supplier that comply with the retailer&#146;s rule books, resides primarily with the supplier. The cost of noncompliance can be refusal of delivered goods, fines and ultimately a termination of the supplier&#146;s relationship with the retailer. The complexity of retailers&#146; requirements and consequences of noncompliance create growing demand for specialized supply chain management automation solutions. 

Traditional Supply Chain Management Solutions 

Traditional supply chain management solutions, which range from non-automated paper or fax solutions to electronic solutions, implemented using on-premise licensed software, tend to focus primarily on fulfillment automation. On-premise licensed software provides connectivity between only one organization and its trading partners and typically requires significant time and technical expertise to configure, deploy and maintain. Historically these software providers primarily linked retailers and suppliers through the Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) protocol that enables the structured electronic transmission of data between organizations. Increasingly organizations are utilizing direct communication between systems utilizing application programming interfaces (APIs). Because of set-up and maintenance costs, technical complexity and a growing volume of requirements from retailers, the traditional software model is not well suited for many suppliers, especially those small and medium in size. 

Additionally, the traditional approach to supply chain automation involves a system architecture made up of many point-to-point connections between retailers and their suppliers. These collections of connections are inherently error prone and can be difficult to adapt to changing requirements and market circumstances. For instance, if there is a broad trend in the market (such as the growing popularity of mobile commerce) that many members of a retailing segment would like to adapt to, a supplier would be faced with a series of enhancements, 

&#160; 

on a one-by-one basis, to the collection of connections they have with their retailers. Traditional approaches do not have the inherent, or architectural, capabilities to enable the flexibility and adaptability to embrace the ongoing change that omnichannel retailing requires. 

Moving Beyond Transactions &#151; Insight and Data Analysis Powering Intelligent Decision Making 

Fulfillment automation is a first step toward addressing the complexities in the supply chain ecosystem, but is only the necessary first step in providing omnichannel retail success. As the number and geographic dispersion of trading partners has grown, it has never been more important for retailers and suppliers to have precise, timely insight into demand and supply, by item and by location. In today&#146;s retailing marketplace, where an order can be placed by a consumer with the swipe of a finger, retailers need to make fulfillment decisions in an instant, deciding the most cost efficient location of inventory (which could be a warehouse, a store, or a vendor&#146;s warehouse). As a result, trading partners need a solution that effectively consolidates, distills and provides sell-through information to managers and decision-makers who can use the information to drive efficiency, revenue growth and profitability. The abundance of data produced by these processes, including data for fulfillment, sales and inventory levels, is often inaccessible to trading partners for analysis. The data and related analytics are essential for optimizing the inventory and fulfillment process and will continue to drive demand for supply chain management solutions. 

Cloud Services Provide Flexibility, Adaptability and a Key Source of Information Across the Supply Chain 

Cloud services are well suited for providing supply chain management solutions because they inherently enable rapid provisioning of capabilities and offer robust and reliable integration with retailer and supplier systems. Cloud services are able to continue utilizing standard connectivity protocols, such as EDI, but also are able to support the growing use of standard internet protocols that retailers require, such as XML, in addition to enabling API-based integration. These cloud services connect suppliers and retailers more efficiently than traditional on-premise software solutions by leveraging the integrations created for a single supplier across all participating suppliers. 

Traditionally the supply chain depended on integration with a retailer or supplier&#146;s enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, which is the system of record for the bulk of information related to placing an order. In today&#146;s retailing market, many systems working closely together are essential to provide the consumer with the information they need to make a purchase decision (e.g., ecommerce systems) as well as information required to fulfill the order (e.g., warehouse and transportation systems). Cloud services enable an organization to connect across the range of systems that service the supply chain ecosystem, addressing increased retailer demands, globalization and increased complexity affecting the supply chain. In addition, cloud services can integrate supply chain management applications with organizations&#146; existing enterprise resource planning systems. 

Cloud services and API-based service integration provide retailers and suppliers with access to new and powerful capabilities quickly, often integrated with analytics to enable rapid service innovation and responsiveness as the retailing landscape continues to respond to omnichannel advancements. 

Our Platform 

We operate one of the largest retail trading partner networks through a cloud-based services suite that improves the way suppliers, retailers, distributors and other trading partners manage and fulfill orders, manage sell-through performance and source new items. Approximately 65,000 customers across more than 60 countries have used our platform to improve the performance of their trading relationships. Our platform fundamentally changes how organizations use electronic communication to manage their supply chains by replacing the collection of traditional, custom-built, point-to-point integrations with a network model whereby a single integration to our platform enables an organization to connect seamlessly to the entire SPS Commerce network of trading partners. 

&#160; 

From that single connection, a member of our network can make use of the full suite of our solutions, from fulfillment automation, to the analysis and optimization of item sell-through performance, to sourcing new items, new retailing relationships or providers of logistics and other services. This represents a fundamental change to fulfillment automation and enables inherent adaptability and flexibility not possible with traditional supply chain management system architectures. 

Our platform is comprised of a set of coupled cloud services that deliver value as stand-alone offerings, but also provide additional value when used collectively. Our fulfillment product combines integrations that comply with numerous rule books for retailers and distributors with whom we and our customers have done business. By maintaining current integrations with retailers, our platform removes the need for suppliers to continually stay up-to-date with the rule book changes required by retailers. Moreover, by utilizing a cloud services model, we eliminate or greatly reduce the burden on suppliers to support and maintain an on-premise software application, thereby reducing ongoing operating costs. As the transaction hub for trading partners, we also are able to provide increased performance visibility and data analytics capabilities for retailers and suppliers across their supply chains, each of which is difficult to gain from traditional, point-to-point integration solutions. 

The following solutions are enabled through the SPS Commerce cloud services platform: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Trading Partner Fulfillment. &#160; Our Fulfillment solution provides fulfillment automation and replaces or augments an organization&#146;s existing trading partner electronic communication infrastructure, enabling suppliers to comply with retailers&#146; rule books and enabling the electronic exchange of information among numerous trading partners through various protocols. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Trading Partner Analytics. &#160; Our Analytics solution consists of data analytics applications that enable our customers to improve their visibility across, and analysis of, their supply chains. When focused on point-of-sale data, for example, retailers and suppliers can ensure inventory is located where demand is highest. Retailers improve their visibility into supplier performance and their understanding of product sell-through. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Trading Partner Assortment. Today&#146;s retail marketplace requires the management of tens and even hundreds of individual attributes associated with each item a retailer or supplier sells today. This information can include digital images/video, customer facing descriptions and measurements, and warehouse information. Our Assortment product provides robust, extensible management of this information, enabling accurate orders and rapid fulfillment. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Trading Partner Sourcing . Through Retail Universe, our social network for the retail industry, retailers can source providers of new items, suppliers can connect with new retailers, and the broader retailing community can make connections to expand their business networks and grow. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Trading Partner Community Development. &#160; Our Community Development solution provides communications programs based on our best practices, enabling organizations, from large to small retailers and suppliers to emerging providers of value-added products and services, to establish trading partner relationships with new trading partners to expand their businesses. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Other Trading Partner Solutions. &#160; We provide a number of peripheral solutions such as barcode labeling and our scan and pack application, which helps trading partners process information to streamline the picking and packaging process. 

Our Customer and Sales Sources 

As one of the largest providers of cloud services for supply chain management, the trading partner relationships that we enable among our retailer, supplier and fulfillment customers naturally lead to new customer acquisition opportunities. 

&#160; 

&#147;Network Effect&#148; 

Once connected to our network, trading partners can exchange electronic supply chain information with each other. Through our platform, we have helped approximately 65,000 customers to improve the performance of their trading partner relationships. The value of our platform increases with the number of trading partners connected to the platform. The addition of each new customer to our platform enables that new customer to communicate with our existing customers and enables our existing customers to do business with the new customer. Additionally, through Retail Universe, our community now has a social network focused on facilitating connections and business interactions among retailers and suppliers. This &#147;network effect&#148; of adding an additional customer to our platform creates a significant opportunity for existing customers to realize incremental sales by working with our new trading partners and vice versa. As a result of this increased volume of activity amongst our network participants, we earn additional revenues from these participants. 

Customer Acquisition Sources 

Trading Partner Community Development. As retailers and suppliers reshape how they do business in an omnichannel landscape, they need to bring new capabilities and services to their trading partner networks. For instance, a supplier may wish to collaborate with their retailers around point-of-sale analytics data, or a retailer may decide to change the workflow or protocol by which it interacts with its suppliers. In each case, the supplier and retailer may engage us to work with its trading partner base to enable the new capability. Performing these programs on behalf of retailers and suppliers often generates supplier sales leads for us. 

Referrals from Our Customers. We also receive sales leads from our customers seeking to communicate electronically with their trading partners. For example, a supplier may refer to us its third-party logistics provider or manufacturer which is not in our network. 

Channel Partners. In addition to the customer acquisition sources identified above, we market and sell our solutions through a variety of channel partners including software providers, resellers, system integrators and logistics partners. For example, software partners such as Microsoft, NetSuite, Oracle, SAP, Sage and their business partner communities generate sales for us as part of broader enterprise resource planning, warehouse management system and/or transportation management system sales efforts. Our logistics partners also drive new sales both by providing leads and by embedding our solutions as part of their service offerings. 

Our Sales Force 

We also sell our solutions through a global sales force which is organized as follows: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Retailer Sales. &#160; We employ a team of sales professionals who focus on selling our cloud services suite to retailers and distributors. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Supplier Sales. &#160; We employ a team of supplier sales representatives focused on selling our cloud services suite to suppliers. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Business Development Efforts. &#160; Our business development organization is tasked with finding new sources of revenue and development of new business opportunities through channel partners and other areas that present opportunity for growth. 

Our Growth Strategy 

Our objective is to be the leading global provider of supply chain management solutions. Key elements of our strategy include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Further Penetrate Our Current Market. &#160; We believe the global supply chain management market is underpenetrated and, as the retail industry continues to respond to the changing requirements of the omnichannel marketplace, and as the supply chain ecosystem becomes more complex and geographically 

&#160; 

&#160; dispersed, the demand for supply chain management solutions will increase, especially among small- and medium-sized businesses. We intend to continue leveraging our relationships with customers and their trading partners to obtain new sales leads. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Increase Revenues from Our Customer Base. &#160; We believe our overall customer satisfaction is strong and will lead our customers to further expand their use of the solutions they have currently purchased as well as purchase additional services to continue improving the performance of their trading partner relationships, generating additional revenues for us. In 2015, we hired a Chief Customer Success Officer to lead our customer success efforts and to increase opportunities to sell additional solutions and services to our existing customers. We also expect to introduce new solutions to sell to our customers. We believe our position as the incumbent supply chain management solution provider to our customers, our integration into our recurring revenue customers&#146; business systems and the modular nature of our platform are conducive to deploying additional solutions with customers. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Expand Our Distribution Channels. &#160; We intend to grow our business by expanding our network of sales representatives to gain new customers. We also believe there are valuable opportunities to promote and sell our solutions through collaboration with other providers. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Expand Our International Presence. &#160; We believe our presence in Asia Pacific, as well as Europe, represents a significant competitive advantage. We plan to increase our international sales efforts to obtain new supplier and retailer customers around the world. We intend to leverage our current international presence to increase the number of integrations we have with retailers in foreign markets to make our platform more valuable to suppliers based overseas. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Enhance and Expand Our Platform. &#160; We intend to further improve and develop the functionality and features of our platform, including, from time to time, developing new solutions and applications. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Selectively Pursue Strategic Acquisitions. &#160; The fragmented nature of our market provides opportunity for selective acquisitions. In 2014, we purchased substantially all of the assets of Leadtec Systems Australia Pty Ltd (&#147;Leadtec&#148;) and its affiliates, a privately-held provider of cloud-based integration solutions in Australia and New Zealand. This acquisition expanded our base of recurring revenue customers and added suppliers to our network. In 2016, we purchased Toolbox Solutions, Inc., a Canadian based point-of-sale analytics and category management services provider to retailers and consumer packaged goods suppliers in North America. To complement and accelerate our internal growth, we may pursue acquisitions of other supply chain management companies to add customers or additional functionalities. We plan to evaluate potential acquisitions of other supply chain management companies primarily based on the number of customers and revenue the acquisition would provide relative to the purchase price. We also may pursue acquisitions that allow us to expand into regions where we do not have a significant presence or to offer new functionalities we do not currently provide. We plan to evaluate potential acquisitions to expand into new regions or offer additional functionalities primarily based on the anticipated growth the acquisition would provide, the purchase price and our ability to integrate and operate the acquired business. 

Technology, Development and Operations 

Technology 

We were an early provider of cloud services to the retail supply chain management industry, launching the first version of our platform in 1997. We use commercially available hardware and cloud services with a combination of proprietary and commercially available software. 

Our cloud platform treats all customers as logically separate tenants in a common platform. As a result, we spread the cost of delivering our solutions across our customer base. Because we do not manage thousands of distinct applications with their own business logic and database schemes, we believe that we can scale our business faster than traditional software vendors, even those that modified their products to be accessible over the Internet. 

&#160; 

Development 

Our research and development efforts focus on improving and enhancing our existing solutions, as well as developing new solutions and applications and maintaining our existing solutions. Our multi-tenant platform serves all of our customers, which allows us to maintain relatively low research and development expenses and release more frequently compared to traditional on-premise licensed software solutions that support multiple versions. Our development efforts take place at our locations in Minnesota and New Jersey, as well as in Kiev, Ukraine. 

Operations 

We operate infrastructure in third-party data centers located in Minnesota and New Jersey, as well as provision services in public cloud providers. In all cases, infrastructure and services on which our platform runs is managed by us. 

We have internal and third party monitoring software that continually checks our platform and key underlying components for continuous availability and performance, ensuring our platform is available and providing adequate service levels. We have a technology operations team that provides system provisioning, management, maintenance, monitoring and back-up. 

To facilitate high availability, we operate a multi-tiered system configuration with load-balanced web server pools, replicated database servers and fault-tolerant storage devices. Our databases are replicated between locations insuring a quick recovery point objective. 

Our Customers 

As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 23,000 recurring revenue customers and approximately 65,000 total customers. Our primary source of revenue is from small- to mid-sized suppliers in the consumer packaged goods industry. We also generate revenues from other members of the supply chain ecosystem, including retailers, distributors, third-party logistics providers and other trading partners. Our revenues are not concentrated with any customer, as our largest customer represented 2% or less of total revenues in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

Competition 

Vendors in the supply chain management industry offer solutions through three delivery methods: on demand or cloud-based, traditional on-premise software and managed services. 

The market for cloud-based supply chain management solutions is fragmented and rapidly evolving. Cloud service vendors compete directly with each other based on the following: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; breadth of pre-built connections to retailers, third-party logistics providers and other trading partners; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; history of establishing and maintaining reliable integration connections with trading partners; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; reputation of the cloud service vendor in the supply chain management industry; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; price; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; specialization in a customer market segment; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; speed and quality with which the cloud service vendor can integrate its customers to their trading partners; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; functionality of the cloud service solution, such as the ability to integrate the solution with a customer&#146;s business systems; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; breadth of complementary supply chain management solutions the cloud service vendor offers; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; training and customer support services provided during and after a customer&#146;s initial integration. 

We expect to encounter new and increased competition as this market segment consolidates and matures. Consolidation among cloud service vendors could create a direct competitor that is able to compete with us more effectively than the numerous, smaller vendors currently offering cloud service supply chain management solutions. Increased competition from cloud service vendors could reduce our market share, revenues and operating margins or otherwise adversely affect our business. 

Cloud service vendors also compete with traditional on-premise software companies and managed service providers. Traditional on-premise software companies focused on supply chain integration management include IBM-Sterling Commerce and OpenText-GXS. These companies offer a &#147;do-it-yourself&#148; approach in which customers purchase, install and manage specialized software, hardware and value-added networks for their supply chain integration needs. This approach requires customers to invest in staff to operate and maintain the software. Traditional on-premise software companies use a single-tenant approach in which information maps to retailers are built for and used by one supplier, as compared to cloud service solutions that allow multiple customers to share information maps with a retailer. 

Managed service providers focused on the supply chain management market include IBM-Sterling Commerce and OpenText-GXS. These companies combine traditional on-premise software, hardware and value-added networks with professional information technology services to manage these resources. Like traditional on-premise software companies, managed service providers use a single-tenant approach. 

Customers of traditional on-premise software companies and managed service providers typically make significant upfront investments in the supply chain management solutions these competitors provide, which can decrease the customers&#146; willingness to abandon their investments in favor of a cloud service solution. Cloud service supply chain management solutions also are at a relatively early stage of development compared to traditional on-premise software and managed service providers. Cloud service vendors compete with these better established solutions based on total cost of ownership and flexibility. If suppliers do not perceive the benefits of cloud service solutions, or if suppliers are unwilling to abandon their investments in other supply chain management solutions, our business and growth may suffer. In addition, many traditional on-premise software companies and managed service providers have larger customer bases and may be better capitalized than we are, which may provide them with an advantage in developing, marketing or servicing solutions that compete with ours. 

Intellectual Property and Proprietary Content 

We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade secret laws as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. We enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants and other third parties and control access to software, documentation and other proprietary information. We have registered trademarks and pending trademark applications in the United States of America and certain foreign countries. We do not have any patents, but we have pending patent applications. Our trade secrets consist primarily of the software we have developed for our SPS Commerce platform. Our software is also protected under copyright law, but we do not have any registered copyrights. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 1,046 employees. We also employ independent contractors to support our operations. We believe that our continued success will depend on our ability to continue to attract and retain skilled technical and sales personnel. We have never had a work stoppage, and none of our employees are represented by a labor union. We believe our relationship with our employees is good. 

&#160;
