 Item 1. Business.

&#160;

GENERAL 

&#160;

The Company is a Maryland corporation that invests in residential mortgage loans. GMFS, a mortgage banking platform the Company acquired in October 2014, originates, sells and services residential mortgage loans and the Company acquires performing, re-performing and newly originated loans through other channels. The Company also invests in, finances and manages RMBS that are not issued or guaranteed by a federally chartered corporation, such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or an agency of the U.S. Government, such as Ginnie Mae (&#34;non-Agency RMBS&#34;), with an emphasis on securities that, when originally issued, were rated in the highest rating category by one or more of the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations and mortgage servicing rights (&#8220;MSRs&#8221;). The Company also has the discretion to invest in RMBS that are issued or guaranteed by a federally chartered corporation or a U.S. Government agency (&#34;Agency RMBS&#34;), including through To-Be-Announced (&#34;TBA&#34;) contracts, and in other real estate-related and financial assets, such as interest only strips created from RMBS (&#34;IOs&#34;). The Company refers collectively to its assets as its &#8220;target assets&#8221;.

&#160;

The Company's income is generated primarily by the net spread between the income it earns on its assets and the cost of its financing and hedging activities in its residential mortgage investments segment, and the origination, sale and servicing of residential mortgage loans in its residential mortgage banking segment. The Company's objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to its stockholders, primarily through quarterly dividend distributions and secondarily through capital appreciation.

&#160;

The Company was incorporated in Maryland on May 24, 2011, and has elected to be taxed and to qualify as a real estate investment trust (&#34;REIT&#34;) for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2011. The Company is organized in a format pursuant to which it serves as the sole general partner of, and conducts substantially all of its business through, its Operating Partnership subsidiary, ZAIS Financial Partners, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership. The Company also expects to operate its business so that it is not required to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act. The Company is externally managed by the Advisor, a subsidiary of ZAIS Group, LLC (&#34;ZAIS&#34;), and has no employees other than those employed by GMFS, its wholly-owned subsidiary. GMFS had 246 employees at December 31, 2015.

&#160; 

As announced on November 4, 2015, the Company has engaged a financial advisor to assist it in evaluating potential strategic alternatives to enhance stockholder value. The continuing strategic review includes the exploration of merger or sale transactions involving the Company or a liquidation of the Company's assets. The Company and its financial advisor have engaged in preliminary discussions with several potential counterparties. While the Company is currently engaged in discussions with a potential counterparty about a potential merger or sale transaction, there is no assurance that the discussions will lead to a definitive merger or sale transaction, which would be subject to approval by the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors and its stockholders. In the event that the Company does not reach a definitive agreement with respect to a merger or sale transaction, management of the Company intends to present to the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors for its consideration a plan of liquidation. There is no assurance that the Company&#8217;s board of directors will approve any plan of liquidation and recommend its acceptance by the Company&#8217;s stockholders. In light of the strategic review and in order to reduce current market risk in its investment portfolio , the Company has recently begun the process of selling its seasoned, re-performing mortgage loans from its residential mortgage investments segment. A sale of these assets is expected to be completed early in the second quarter of 2016. If completed, these mortgage loan sales are likely to result in a reduction of the Company&#8217;s investment income and may therefore result in a decision to curtail dividends in the future. Additionally, as part of the strategic review, the Company has made the decision to cease the purchase of newly originated residential mortgage loans as part of its mortgage conduit purchase program and will begin the unwinding of the Company&#8217;s mortgage conduit business. Consistent with these changes to the Company&#8217;s strategy, on March 9, 2016, Brian Hargrave resigned as the Company&#8217;s Chief Investment Officer and will be succeeded by Christian Zugel, the current Chairman of the Company&#8217;s board of directors. The Company does not intend to disclose further developments until the review is complete and the Company&#8217;s board of directors has taken action with respect to the strategic review.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Acquisition of GMFS 

&#160;

On August 5, 2014, the Company entered into a merger agreement with GMFS (the &#8220;GMFS Merger Agreement&#8221;). Pursuant to the terms of the GMFS Merger Agreement among ZFC Honeybee TRS, LLC (&#34;Honeybee TRS&#34;), an indirect subsidiary of the Company, ZFC Honeybee Acquisitions, LLC (&#34;Honeybee Acquisitions&#34;), a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeybee TRS, GMFS, and Honeyrep, LLC, solely in its capacity as the security holder representative, Honeybee Acquisitions merged with and into GMFS on October 31, 2014, with GMFS continuing as the surviving entity and an indirect subsidiary of the Company. GMFS is an approved Fannie Mae Seller-Servicer, Freddie Mac Seller-Servicer, Ginnie Mae issuer, Department of Housing and Urban Development (&#34;HUD&#34;) / Federal Housing Administration (&#34;FHA&#34;) Mortgagee, U.S. Department of Agriculture (&#34;USDA&#34;) approved originator and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (&#34;VA&#34;) Lender. GMFS currently originates loans that are eligible to be purchased, guaranteed or insured by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, FHA, USDA and VA through retail, correspondent and broker channels. GMFS also originates and sells reverse mortgage loans as part of its existing operations.

&#160;

The final purchase price was approximately $61.2 million, net of approximately $1.7 million received from an escrow account pursuant to the GMFS Merger Agreement, based on the final reconciliation of GMFS's net tangible assets. The net tangible assets at closing were comprised of the estimated fair value of GMFS's MSR portfolio, the estimated value of GMFS's net tangible assets and a purchase price premium. In addition to cash paid at closing, two contingent $1 million deferred premium payments payable in cash over two years, plus potential additional consideration based on future loan production and profits will be payable over a four-year period if certain conditions are met (the &#8220;Production and Profitability Earn-Out&#8221;). The $2 million of deferred premium payments is contingent on GMFS remaining profitable and retaining certain key employees. The Production and Profitability Earn-Out is dependent on GMFS achieving certain profitability and loan production goals and is capped at $20 million. Up to 50% of the Production and Profitability Earn-Out may be paid in common stock of the Company, at the Company's option. The estimated present value of the total contingent consideration at October 31, 2014 was $11.4 million based on the future production and earnings projections of GMFS over the four-year earn-out period (at December 31, 2015 the contingent consideration liability was $11.3 million). The Company funded the closing cash payment through a combination of available cash and the sale of a portion of its non-Agency RMBS portfolio. As discussed above, pursuant to the GMFS Merger Agreement, based on the final reconciliation of the October 31, 2014 values, the Company received approximately $1.7 million in June 2015 from an escrow account established at the time of the closing. The Company recorded a reduction to goodwill in the consolidated balance sheets that included this amount, along with other final closing adjustments.

&#160;

The Company is externally managed by the Advisor, a subsidiary of ZAIS. On March 17, 2015, a business combination was completed between HF2 Financial, a special purpose acquisition company, and ZAIS Group Parent, LLC (&#34;ZGP&#34;), which wholly owns ZAIS, pursuant to a definitive agreement dated September 16, 2014. The current owners of ZGP did not receive any proceeds at the closing of the transaction and retained a significant equity stake in ZGP. Following the close of the transaction, ZAIS's management team has remained in place to continue to lead the combined organization.

&#160;

At December 31, 2015, the Company held a diversified portfolio of mortgage loans, RMBS assets and MSRs with an aggregate fair value of $671.2 million, comprised of:

&#160; 

Residential Mortgage Investments 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; Performing, re-performing and newly originated loans held for investment with a fair value of $397.7 million, &#160;

&#160; &#8226; RMBS assets with a fair value of $109.3 million, consisting primarily of senior tranches of non-Agency RMBS that were originally highly rated but subsequently downgraded, &#160;

Residential Mortgage Banking 

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; Mortgage loans originated by the GMFS mortgage banking platform and held for sale with a fair value of $116.0 million, and &#160;

&#160; &#8226; MSRs with a fair value of $48.2 million. &#160;

The borrowings the Company used to fund its portfolio held for investment totaled $426.6 million at December 31, 2015, under: (i) a master repurchase agreement with Citibank, N.A. (the &#34;Citi Loan Repurchase Facility&#34;) to fund its distressed and re-performing loan portfolio, (ii) a master repurchase facility with Credit Suisse First Boston Mortgage Capital LLC (the &#34;Credit Suisse Loan Repurchase Facility&#34;, and together with the Citi Loan Repurchase Facility, the &#34;Loan Repurchase Facilities&#34;) to fund its newly originated loan portfolio, (iii) master securities repurchase agreements with four counterparties and (iv) the 8.0% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2016 (the &#34;Exchangeable Senior Notes&#34;). Additionally, the borrowings the Company used to fund the origination of its mortgage loans held for sale portfolio totaled $100.8 million at December 31, 2015 under warehouse lines of credit and repurchase agreements with four lenders with an aggregate borrowing capacity of $185.0 million.

INVESTMENT STRATEGY 

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to its stockholders, primarily through quarterly distributions and secondarily through capital appreciation. The Company uses the experience and relationships developed in managing the whole loan investment platform of funds managed by ZAIS. The Company&#8217;s whole loan strategy has included secondary market purchases of seasoned mortgage loans, a newly originated non-agency loan purchase program and an origination platform. The Company believes that its target assets have presented attractive risk-adjusted return profiles. As market conditions have changed over time, the Company has adjusted its strategy by shifting its asset allocations across its target asset classes to take advantage of changes in interest rates and credit spreads as well as economic and credit conditions. See &#8220;Item 1. Business-General&#8221; included in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion on the Company&#8217;s recent strategic review.

&#160;

The Company relies on the Advisor&#8217;s investment expertise in identifying and efficiently financing its assets. The Advisor makes investment decisions based on a variety of factors, including expected risk-adjusted returns, credit fundamentals, liquidity, availability of adequate financing, borrowing costs and macroeconomic conditions, as well as maintaining the Company&#8217;s REIT qualification and its exemption from registration as an investment company under the 1940 Act. The Company has followed a predominantly long-term buy and hold strategy with respect to many of the assets that it has acquired outside its mortgage banking operations. The Company&#8217;s target assets are as follows:

&#160; 

Residential Mortgage Loans . Prime, subprime and alternative-A and alternative-B mortgage loans, which may be adjustable-rate, hybrid and/or fixed-rate residential mortgage loans, and pay option adjustable rate mortgage loans (&#8220;ARMs&#8221;). The Company acquires seasoned residential mortgage loans that are primarily, but not exclusively, performing and re-performing at the time of acquisition. The Company also acquires newly originated non-agency loans through its loan purchase program, which provides approved sellers a web-based platform for the pricing, locking and funding of individual loans which must adhere to loan eligibility criteria and underwriting guidelines. The Company also originates and services agency and government guaranteed residential mortgage loans through GMFS.

&#160; 

Non - Agency RMBS . RMBS that are not issued or guaranteed by a U.S. Government agency or federally chartered corporation, with an emphasis on securities that, when originally issued, were rated in the highest rating category by one or more of the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations.

&#160;

The mortgage loan collateral for non-Agency RMBS consists of residential mortgage loans that do not generally conform to underwriting guidelines issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae, due to certain factors, including mortgage balances in excess of agency underwriting guidelines, borrower characteristics, loan characteristics and level of documentation, and therefore are not issued or guaranteed by an agency of the U.S Government. The mortgage loan collateral may be classified as prime, subprime and alternative-A and alternative-B mortgage loans, which may be adjustable-rate, hybrid and/or fixed-rate residential mortgage loans, and pay option ARMs.

&#160; 

MSRs . MSRs provide a mortgage servicer with the right to service a pool of mortgages in exchange for a portion of the interest payments made on the underlying mortgages.

&#160;

Agency RMBS . RMBS that are issued or guaranteed by a federally chartered corporation or a U.S. Government agency. The Agency RMBS the Company targets can be collateralized by either fixed rate loans or ARMs. The Company has the discretion to invest in Agency RMBS through TBA contracts, which are forward contracts for the purchase of Agency RMBS at a predetermined price with a stated face amount, coupon and stated maturity at an agreed upon future date.

&#160;

Other Real Estate-Related and Financial Assets . IOs created from RMBS are mortgage-backed securities structured with two or more classes that receive different distributions of interest on a pool of Agency RMBS or non-Agency RMBS or whole loans. Subject to maintaining its REIT status pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code, the Company may acquire debt and equity tranches of securitizations backed by various asset classes, including small balance commercial mortgages, manufactured housing, aircraft, automobiles, credit cards, equipment, franchises, recreational vehicles and student loans.

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

Asset Allocations . At December 31, 2015, the Company held a diversified portfolio of mortgage loans, RMBS assets and MSRs with an aggregate fair value of $671.2 million, comprised of: (i) performing, re-performing and newly originated loans held for investment with a fair value of $397.7 million, (ii) mortgage loans originated by the GMFS mortgage banking platform and held for sale with a fair value of $116.0 million, (iii) RMBS assets with a fair value of $109.3 million, and (iv) MSRs with a fair value of $48.2 million. As market conditions have changed, the Company has adjusted its strategy by shifting its asset allocations across its target asset classes. The Company has relied on the Advisor&#8217;s expertise in identifying assets within the target assets described above and, to the extent that leverage was employed, efficiently financing those assets. The Company&#8217;s allocation decisions have been based on a variety of factors, including expected risk-adjusted returns, credit fundamentals liquidity and the availability of certain assets.

&#160;

FINANCING STRATEGY 

&#160;

The Company uses leverage primarily for the purposes of financing its portfolio and increasing potential returns to stockholders rather than for the purpose of speculating on changes in interest rates. The Company funds the origination and acquisition of its target assets through the use of prudent amounts of leverage. The borrowings the Company used to fund its portfolio totaled approximately $527.4 million as of December 31, 2015 under the warehouse lines of credit and repurchase agreements with four counterparties, Loan Repurchase Facilities and master securities repurchase agreements with four counterparties. Additionally, $57.5 million aggregate principal amount of the Exchangeable Senior Notes were outstanding as of December 31, 2015.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s income is generated primarily by the net spread between the income it earns on its assets and the cost of its financing and hedging activities in its residential mortgage investments segment, and the origination, sale and servicing of residential mortgage loans in its residential mortgage banking segment. Although the Company is not required to maintain any particular leverage ratio, the amount of leverage it deploys for particular investments in its target assets depends upon the Advisor&#8217;s assessment of a variety of factors, which may include the anticipated liquidity and price volatility of the assets in its investment portfolio, the gap between the duration of its assets and liabilities, including hedges, the availability and cost of financing assets, its opinion of the creditworthiness of its financing counterparties, the health of the U.S. economy and residential and commercial mortgage-related markets, its outlook for the level, slope, and volatility of interest rates, the credit quality of collateral underlying the Company&#8217;s residential mortgage loans, non-Agency RMBS and other target assets, its outlook for asset spreads relative to the LIBOR curve and regulatory requirements limiting the permissible amount of leverage to be utilized. Based on market conditions, the Company has deployed, on a debt-to-equity basis, up to four to one leverage on its seasoned residential whole loans and up to three to one leverage on its non-Agency RMBS assets. Any leverage on newly originated loans may have been significantly greater than the leverage used on its seasoned loan portfolio depending on the characteristics of the newly originated loans. Additionally, to the extent the Company securitizes any residential mortgage loans in the future, it expects that the leverage obtained through such structures will vary considerably depending on the characteristics of the underlying loans.

&#160;

The Company is restricted in the amount of leverage it may employ by the terms and provisions of its existing borrowings as well as other financing agreements that it may enter into in the future. The Company may also be subject to margin calls as a result of its financing activities. In addition, the Company intends to rely on short-term financing such as warehouse lines of credit, the duration of which may be less than 1 year, and repurchase transactions under master repurchase agreements, the duration of which may be 30 days for its securities repurchase agreements and 364 days for its Loan Repurchase Facilities.

&#160;

See Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,&#8221; of this annual report on Form 10-K, for a discussion of the Company&#8217;s borrowings under the warehouse lines of credit and repurchase agreements, Loan Repurchase Facilities and securities repurchase agreements as of December 31, 2015 and the terms of the Exchangeable Senior Notes.

&#160;

The Company utilizes derivative financial instruments to hedge the interest rate risk associated with its borrowings. Subject to maintaining its qualification as a REIT and exemption from registration as an investment company under the 1940 Act, the Company may also engage in a variety of interest rate management techniques that seek on one hand to mitigate the influence of interest rate changes on the values of some of its assets and on the other hand help the Company achieve its risk management objectives. The Company&#8217;s interest rate management techniques may include: interest rate swap agreements, interest rate cap agreements, MBS forward sales, exchange-traded derivatives and swaptions; puts and calls on securities or indices of securities; U.S. Department of the Treasury securities and options on U.S. Department of the Treasury securities; IOs and MSRs; and other similar transactions and financial instruments.

&#160;

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 

&#160;

The Company strives to maintain an ethical workplace in which the highest standards of professional conduct are practiced.

&#160;

&#8226; The Company&#8217;s board of directors is composed of a majority of independent directors. The Audit, Nominating and Corporate Governance and Compensation Committees are composed exclusively of independent directors. &#160;

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; In order to foster the highest standards of ethics and conduct in all business relationships, the Company has adopted a Code of Conduct and Ethics policy, which covers a wide range of business practices and procedures, that applies to its officers, directors, employees, if any, and independent contractors, to its Advisor and its Advisor&#8217;s officers and employees, to ZAIS and ZAIS&#8217; officers and employees, and to any other affiliates of ZAIS or the Advisor, and such affiliates&#8217; officers and employees, who provide services to the Company or the Advisor in respect of the Company. In addition, the Company has implemented Whistleblowing Procedures for Accounting and Auditing Matters and Code of Conduct and Ethics Violations (the &#8220;Whistleblower Policy&#8221;) that set forth procedures by which any Covered Persons (as defined in the Whistleblower Policy) may raise, on a confidential basis, concerns regarding, among other things, any questionable or unethical accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters and any potential violations of the Code of Conduct and Ethics with the Audit Committee of the Company or the Chief Compliance Officer of ZAIS. 

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; The Company has adopted an Insider Trading Policy for Trading in the Securities of the Company (the &#8220;Insider Trading Policy&#8221;), that governs the purchase or sale of the Company&#8217;s securities by any of directors, officers, and associates (as defined in the Insider Trading Policy) of the Company, if any, and independent contractors, as well as officers and employees of the Advisor and officers, employees and affiliates of ZAIS, and that prohibits any such persons from buying or selling the Company&#8217;s securities on the basis of material nonpublic information. &#160;

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

COMPETITION 

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s earnings depend, in large part, on its ability to originate or acquire assets at favorable spreads over its borrowing costs and its ability to efficiently manage its portfolio risks. In originating or acquiring its target assets and establishing hedge positions, the Company competes with other existing mortgage REITs (both internally and externally managed), mortgage finance and specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, hedge funds (including those managed by ZAIS), ZAIS, to the extent that ZAIS holds assets directly on its own behalf or indirectly through one or more of its subsidiaries, affiliates or other newly formed entities, mutual funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, governmental bodies and other companies with similar asset acquisition objectives. It is likely that the Company will also compete with other entities which may be organized in the future. Some of the Company&#8217;s competitors may have greater financial resources and access to lower cost of capital. These competitors may not be subject to the same regulatory constraints (such as REIT compliance or maintaining an exemption under the 1940 Act) as the Company. The effect of the existence of additional REITs and other market participants may be to increase competition for the available supply of mortgage assets suitable for origination or purchase, as well as the amount of financing available to the Company through warehouse lines of credit, repurchase agreements and other financing arrangements.

&#160;

EMPLOYEES; STAFFING 

&#160;

The Company is managed by the Advisor, a subsidiary of ZAIS, pursuant to an amended and restated investment advisory agreement between the Company and the Advisor, dated as of August 11, 2014, as amended from time to time (the &#8220;Investment Advisory Agreement&#8221;). The Company&#8217;s GMFS mortgage banking platform employed a total of 246 people as of December 31, 2015. The Company has no employees other than those employed in connection with its GMFS mortgage banking platform. ZAIS was established in 1997 and is an investment adviser registered with the SEC specializing in structured credit, including residential whole loans, RMBS and ABS. As of December 31, 2015, ZAIS had approximately $4.2 billion of assets under management (comprised primarily of (i) total assets for mark-to-market funds and separately managed accounts; (ii) uncalled capital commitments, if any, for funds that are not in liquidation; and (iii) for issued structured vehicles, all assets being managed calculated per the management fee basis methodology defined in the respective vehicles&#8217; indenture, although in certain circumstances some or all of the referenced management fees may be waived. Assets under management also includes assets in the warehouse phase for new structured credit vehicles and is based on actual assets managed without reductions for leverage and most other liabilities and includes all assets regardless of whether management fees are being earned.
