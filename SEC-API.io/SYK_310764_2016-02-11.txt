Stryker's products are sold in over 100 countries through company-owned sales subsidiaries and branches as well as third-party dealers and distributors. 

As used herein, and except where the context otherwise requires, "Stryker," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Stryker Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.

Orthopaedics 

Orthopaedics products consist primarily of implants used in hip and knee joint replacements and trauma and extremities surgeries. We bring patients and physicians advanced implant designs and specialized instrumentation that make orthopaedic surgery and recovery simpler, faster and more effective. We support surgeons with the technology and services they need as they develop new surgical techniques. 

Stryker is one of four leading competitors globally for joint replacement and trauma products; the other three being Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (Zimmer), DePuy Synthes (companies of Johnson &#38; Johnson) and Smith &#38; Nephew plc (Smith &#38; Nephew).

In 2015 we received clearance by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for our Mako total knee application. This expands our Mako product offerings of partial knee and total hip applications to provide a comprehensive solution in the robotic arm-assisted reconstructive surgery line. 

In 2014 we acquired certain assets of Small Bone Innovations, Inc. (SBi). SBi products are designed and promoted for upper and lower extremity small bone indications, with a focus on small joint replacement. 

In 2012 we voluntarily recalled our Rejuvenate and ABG II Modular-Neck hip stems and terminated global distribution of these hip products. In November 2014 we entered into a settlement agreement to compensate eligible United States patients who had surgery to replace their Rejuvenate and ABG II Modular-Neck hip stems, known as a "revision surgery", prior to November 3, 2014. To date we have recorded charges to earnings totaling $1,824 ($2,056 before $232 of insurance recoveries) representing the actuarially determined low end of the range of probable loss to resolve this entire matter globally. In 2015 we made recall-related payments of $1,202 to eligible United States patients who had revision surgery to replace their Rejuvenate and/or ABG II Modular-Neck hip stem as part of the settlement agreement. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for further information.

In 2015 the New England Journal of Medicine released results of a study finding that intra-arterial treatment to remove stroke-causing blood clots provides better outcomes than using a clot dissolving drug. One of the devices used in this study was our Trevo&#8482; Retriever. Medical professionals in the field believe that the study's results will change the practice of acute stroke treatments. Stryker's Trevo&#8482; Retriever is a leading device in the market that allows physicians to visualize blood clot interaction during treatment. 

Geographic Areas 

In 2015 &#32;approximately 71.5% of our revenues were generated from customers in the United States. Additional geographic information is included under "Results of Operations" in Item 7 of this report and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. 

Raw Materials and Inventory 

Raw materials essential to our business are generally readily available from multiple sources. Substantially all products we manufacture are stocked in inventory, while certain MedSurg products are assembled to order. The dollar amount of backlog orders at any given time is not considered material to an understanding of our business taken as a whole. 

Patents and Trademarks 

Patents and trademarks are significant to our business to the extent that a product or an attribute of a product represents a unique design or process. Patent protection of such products restricts competitors from duplicating these unique designs and features. We seek to obtain patent protection on our products whenever appropriate for protecting our competitive advantage. On December 31, 2015 &#32;we owned approximately 1,884 United States patents and approximately 3,014 international patents. 

&#160;

Seasonality 

Our business is generally not seasonal in nature; however, the number of orthopaedic implant surgeries is typically lower during the summer months, and sales of capital equipment are generally higher in the fourth quarter. 

Competition 

In all of our product lines we compete with local and global companies. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. The development of new and innovative products is important to our success in all areas of our business and competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research and in maintaining sales forces. 

The principal factors that we believe differentiate us in the highly competitive product categories in which we operate and enable us to compete effectively include our commitment to innovation and quality, service and reputation. We believe that our competitive position in the future will depend to a large degree on our ability to develop new products and make improvements to existing products. 

Product Development 

Most of our products and product improvements have been developed internally at research facilities in the United States, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Puerto Rico and Switzerland. We also invest through acquisitions in technologies developed by third parties that have the potential to expand the markets in which we operate. We maintain close working relationships with physicians and medical personnel in hospitals and universities who assist us in product development efforts. The total costs of research, development and engineering activities were $625, $614, and $536 in 2015, 2014 and 2013. 

Regulation 

Our businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which we operate, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation. 

In the United States the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and its subsequent amendments, and the regulations issued and proposed thereunder, provide for regulation by the FDA of the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices, including most of our products. Many of our new products fall into FDA classifications that require notification submitted as a 510(k) and review by the FDA before we begin marketing them. Certain of our products require extensive clinical testing, consisting of safety and efficacy studies, followed by pre-market approval (PMA) applications for specific surgical indications. 

The FDA's Quality System regulations set forth standards for our product design and manufacturing processes, require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our facilities by the FDA. There are also certain requirements of state, local and foreign governments that must be complied with in the manufacture and marketing of our products. 

The member states of the European Union (EU) have adopted the European Medical Device Directives that form a single set of medical device regulations for all EU member countries. These regulations require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in EU member countries to meet certain quality system requirements and obtain CE marking for their products. We have authorization to apply the CE marking to substantially all of our products. In addition, we comply with the 

&#160;

STRYKER CORPORATION 2015 Form 10-K 

unique regulatory requirements of each of the countries in Europe and other countries in which we market our products. 

Initiatives sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare expenses generally and hospital costs in particular, including price regulation and competitive pricing, are ongoing in markets where we do business. It is not possible to predict at this time the long-term impact of such cost containment measures on our future business. In addition, business practices in the healthcare industry are scrutinized, particularly in the United States, by federal and state government agencies, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties. 

Employees 

On December 31, 2015 &#32;we had approximately 27,000 employees globally. Certain international employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that we maintain positive relationships with our employees globally.
