 ITEM 1&#8212;BUSINESS 

Texas Roadhouse, Inc. (the " Company " ) was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware in 2004. The principal executive office is located in Louisville, Kentucky. 

General Development of Business 

Texas Roadhouse, Inc. is a growing restaurant company operating predominately in the casual dining segment . Our founder, chairman and chief executive officer ( " CEO " ), W. Kent Taylor, started the business in 1993 with the opening of the first Texas Roadhouse restaurant in Clarksville, Indiana. Since then, we have grown to 4 83 restaurants in 49 states and four foreign countries. Our mission statement is " Legendary Food, Legendary Service &#174; . " Our operating strategy is designed to position each of our restaurants a s the local hometown favorite for a broad segment of consumers seeking high quality, affordable meals served with friendly, att entive service. As of December 29 , 201 5, we owned and operated 401 restaurant s and franchised an additional 82 restaurants. 

Financial Information about Operating Segments 

We consider our restaurant and franchising operations as similar and have aggregated them into a single reportable segment. The majority of the restaurants operate in the U.S. within the casual dining segment of the restaurant industry, providing similar products to similar customers, and possessing similar pricing structures, resulting in similar long &#8209;term expected financial performance characteristics. Each o f our 401 company &#8209;owned restaurants is considered an operating segment. 

Narrative Description of Business 

Of the 401 restaurants we owned and operated at the end of 201 5 , we operated 3 92 as T exas Roadhouse restaurants and seven as Bubba&#8217;s 33 restaurants. In addition, we operated two restaurants outside of the casual dining segment. In 2016, we plan to open approximately 30 company restaurants. While the majority of our restaurant growth in 2016 will be Texas Roadhouse restaurants, we currently expect to open approximately seven Bubba&#8217;s 33 restaurants . Throughout this report, we use the term "restaurants" to include Texas Roadhouse and Bubba&#8217;s 33, unless otherwise noted. 

Texas Roadhouse is a moderately priced, full &#8209;service, casual dining restaurant concept &#160; offer ing an assortment of specially seasoned and aged steaks hand &#8209;cut daily on the premises and coo ked to order over open grills. In addition to steaks, we also offer our guests a selection of ribs, fish, seafood, chicken, pork chops, pulled pork and vegetable plates, and an assortment of hamburgers, salads and sandwiches. The majority o f our entr&#233;es include two made &#8209; from &#8209;scratch side items, and we offer all our guests a free unlimited supply of roasted in &#8209;she ll peanuts and fresh baked yeast rolls. 

Bubba&#8217;s 33 is a family-friendly sports restaurant offering an assortment of wings, sandwiches, pizza and burgers including our signature 33% bacon grind patty. In addition, we also offer our guests a selection of chicken, beef, fish and seafood. Bubba&#8217;s 33 also offers an extensive selection of draft beer. Our first Bubba&#8217;s 33 restaurant opened in May 2013. 

The operating strategy that underlies the growth of our concepts is built on the following key components: 

&#183; 

Offering high quality, freshly prepared food. We place a great deal of emphasis on providing our guests with high quality, freshly prepared food. At our Texas Roadhouse restaurants, w e hand &#8209;cut all but one of our assortment of steaks and make our sides from scratch. At our Bubba&#8217;s 33 restaurants, we make our sides and bake our buns from scratch. As part of our process, we have developed proprietary recipes to provide consistency in quality and taste throughout all restaurants. We expect a management level employee to inspect every entr&#233;e before it leaves the kitchen to confirm it matches the guest&#8217;s order and meets our standards for quality, appearance and presentation. In addition, we employ a team of product coaches whose function is to provide continual, hands &#8209;on training and education to our kitchen staff for the purpose of promoti ng consistent adherence to recipes, food preparation procedures, food safety standards, food appearance, freshness and portion size. 

&#183; 

Offering performance &#8209;based manager compensation. We offer a performance &#8209;based compensation program to our individual restaurant managers and multi &#8209;restaurant operator s, who are called " managing partners " and 

&#160;

" market partners, " respectively. Each of these partners earns a base salary plus a performance bonus, which represents a percentage of each of their respective restaurant&#8217;s pre &#8209;tax net income. By providing our partners with a significant stake in the success of our restaurants, we believe that we are able to attract and retain talented, experienced and highly motivated managing and market partners. 

&#183; 

Focusing on dinner. In a high percentage of our restaurants, we limit our operating hours to dinner only during the weekdays with approximately one half of our restaurants offering lunch on Friday. By focusing on dinner, our restaurant teams have to prepare for and manage only one shift per day during the week. We believe this allows our restaurant teams to offer higher quality, more consistent food and service to our guests. In addition, we believe the dinner focus provides a better " quality &#8209;of &#8209;life " for our management teams and, therefore, is a key ingredient in attracting and retaining talented and experienced management personnel. We also focus o n keeping our table &#8209; to &#8209;server ratios low to allow our servers to truly focus on their guests and serve their needs in a personal, individualized manner. 

&#183; 

Offering attractive price points. We offer our food and beverages at moderate price points that we believe are as low as or lower than those offered by many of our competitors. Within each menu category, we offer a choice of several price points with the goal of fulfilling each guest&#8217;s budget and value expectations. For example, at our Texas Roadhouse restaurants, our steak entr&#233;es, which include the choice of two side items, generally ra nge from $9.99 for our 6 &#8209;ounce S irloin to $2 6 .99 for our 23 &#8209;ounce Porterhouse T &#8209;Bone. The per guest average check for the Texas Roadhouse restaurants we owned and operated in 201 5 was $16.31 . Per guest average check represents restaurant sales divided by the number of guests served. We consider each sale of an entr&#233;e to be a single guest served. Our per guest average check is higher as a result of our weekday dinner only focus. At our Bubba&#8217;s 33 restaurants, our entrees range from $7.99 for a turkey burger to $19.99 for our 14-ounce ribeye. 

&#183; 

Creating a fun and comfortable atmosphere. We believe the atmosphere we establish in our restaurants is a key component for fostering repeat business. Our Texas Roadhouse restaurants feature a rustic southwestern lodge d&#233;cor accentuated with hand &#8209;painted murals, neon signs, and southwestern prints, rugs and artifacts. Additionally, we offer jukeboxes, which continuously play upbeat country hits. Our Bubba&#8217;s 33 restaurants feature walls lined with televisions playing sports events and are decorated with sports jerseys, neon signs and other local flair. 

Unit Prototype and Economics 

We design our restaurant prototypes to provide a relaxed atmosphere for our guests, while also focusing on restaurant &#8209;level returns over time. Our current prototypical Texas Roadhouse restaurants consist of a freestanding building with approximately 6,700 to 7,500 square feet of space constructed on sites of approximately 1.7 to 2.0 acres or retail pad sites, with seating of approximately 57 to 68 tables for a total of 245 to 329 guests, including 15 bar seats, and parking for approximately 160 vehicles either on &#8209;site or in combination with some form of off &#8209;site cross parking arrangement. Our current prototypes are adaptable to in &#8209;line and end &#8209;cap locations and/or spaces within an enclosed mall or a shopping center. Our prototypical Bubba&#8217;s 33 restaurant remains under development as we continue to open additional restaurants. We expect most Bubba&#8217;s 33 restaurants to range between 7,700 and 8,900 square feet depending on location. 

As of December 29 , 201 5 , we leased 271 properties and owned 130 properties. Our 201 5 average unit volume for all Texas Roadhouse company restaurants open before July 1, 201 4 was $4.7 million . The time required for a new Texas Roadhouse restaurant to reach a steady level of cash flow is approximately three to six months. For 201 5 , the average capital investment, including pre &#8209;opening costs, for the 2 4 Texas Roadhouse company restaurants opened during the year was $ 4 . 7 million, broken down as follows:

Primarily liquor licensing costs, where applicable. This cost varies based on the licensing requirements in each state. 

Our average capital investment in 2014 and 2013 was $ 5 .1 million and $4 . 1 million , respectively . The increase in our 2014 average capital investment was primarily due to higher building costs at certain locations, such as Anchora ge, Alaska and the New York , N ew Y ork vicinity, along with higher pre &#8209;opening costs due to unexpected delays in restaurant openings throughout the year. We expect our average capital investment for Texas Roadhous e restaurants opened in 2016 to be approximately $4.8 million. 

For 2015, the average capital investment, including pre-opening costs, for the four Bubba&#8217;s 33 company restaurants opened during the year was $6.0 million. We expect our average capital investment for Bubba&#8217;s 33 restaurants opened in 2016 to be approximately $5.7 million to $6.0 million. 

&#160; Our capital investment (including cash and non &#8209;cash costs) for new restaurants varies significantly depending on a number of factors including, but not limited to: the square footage, layout, scope of any required site work, type of construction labor (union or non &#8209;union), local permitting requirements, our ability to negotiate with landowners and/or landlords, cost of liquor and other licenses and hook &#8209;up fees and geographical location. 

Site Selection 

We continue to refine our site selection process. In analyzing each prospective site, our real estate team, including our restaurant market partners, devotes significant time and resources to the evaluation of local market demographics, population density, household income levels and site &#8209;specific characteristics such as visibility, accessibility, traffic generators, proximity of other retail activities, traffic counts and parking. We work actively with real estate brokers in target markets to select high quality sites and to maintain and regularly update our database of potential sites. We typically require three to six months to locate, approve and control a restaurant site and typically six to 12 additional months to obtain necessary permits. Upon receipt of permits, it requires approximately four to five months to construct, equip and open a restaurant. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Entr&#233;e prices include unlimited peanuts, fresh baked yeast rolls and most include the choice of two made &#8209;from &#8209;scratch sides . Other menu items include specialty appetizers such as the " Cactus Blossom &#174; " . We also provide a " 12 &#38; Under " menu for children that includes a selection of smaller-sized entr&#233;es served with one side item and a beverage at prices generally between $3.99 and $8.99. At Bubba&#8217;s 33 restaurants, our menu prices, excluding appetizers, generally range from $5.99 to $19.99. We offer a broad assortment of wings , sandwiches, pizzas and burgers, including our signature 33% bacon grind patty. In addition, we also offer our guests a selection of chicken, beef, fish and seafood. Bubba&#8217;s 33 also offers an extensive selection of draft beer. We provide a "12 &#38; Under" menu for children at Bubba&#8217;s 33 that includes a selection of items, including a beverage, at prices generally between $3.99 and $5.99. 

Most of our restaurants feature a full bar that offers an extensive selection of draft and bottled beer, major brands of liquor and wine as well as margaritas. Managing partners are encouraged to tailor their beer selection to include regional and local brands. Alcoholic beverages at our Texas Roadhouse restaurants accounted for approximately 11% of restaurant sales in fiscal 2015 . 

We strive to maintain a consistent menu at our restaurants over time. We continually review our menu to consider enhancements to existing menu items or the introduction of new items. We change our menu only after guest feedback and an extensive study of the operational and economic implications. To maintain our high levels of food quality and service, we generally remove one menu item for every new menu item introduced so as to facilitate our ability to execute high quality meals on a focused range of menu items. 

Food Quality and Safety. We are committed to serving a varied menu of high &#8209;quality, great tasting food items with an emphasis on freshness. We have developed proprietary recipes to promote consistency in quality and taste throughout all restaurants and provide a unique flavor experience to our guests. At each Texas Roadhouse restaurant, a trained meat cutter hand cuts our steaks and other restaurant team members prepare our side items and yeast rolls from scratch in the restaurants daily. At both Texas Roadhouse and Bubba&#8217;s 33, w e assign individual kitchen employees to the preparation of designated food items in order to f ocus on quality, consistency, speed and food safety . Additionally, we expect a management level employee to inspect every entr&#233;e before it leaves the kitchen to confirm it matches the guest&#8217;s order and meets our standards for quality, appearance and presentation. 

We employ a team of product coaches whose function is to provide continual, hands &#8209;on training and education to the kitchen staff in our restaurants for the purpose of reinforcing food quality, recipe consistency , food preparation procedures, food safety and sanitation standards, food appearance, freshness and portion size. The team currently consists of over 45 product coaches, supporting substantially all restaurants system &#8209;wide. 

Food safety is of utmost importance to us. We currently utilize several programs to help facilitate adherence to proper food preparation procedures and food safety standards including our daily Taste and Temp procedures. We have a food team whose function, in conjunction with our product coaches, is to develop, enforce and maintain programs designed to promote compliance with food safety guidelines. As a requirement of our quality assurance process, primary food items purchased from qualified vendors have been inspected by reputable, outside inspection services confirming that the vendor is compliant with United States Food and Drug Administration ( " FDA " ) and United States Department of Agriculture ( " USDA " ) guidelines. 

We perform food safety and sanitation audits on our restaurant s each year and these results are reviewed by various members of operations and management. To maximize adherence to food safety protocols, we have incorporated HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points) principles and Critical procedures (such as hand washing) in each recipe. In addition, most of our product coaches and food team members have obtained or are in the process of obtaining their Certified Professional&#8212;Food Safety designation from the National Environmental Health Association. 

Purchasing. Our purchasing philosophy is designed to supply fresh, quality products to the restaurants at competitive prices while maximizing operating efficiencies. We negotiate directly with suppliers for substantially all food and beverage products to maximize quality and freshness and obtain competitive prices. 

&#160;

Food and supplies are ordered by and shipped direc tly to the domestic restaurants . Most food products used in the operation of our restaurants are distributed to individual restaurants through an independent national distribution company. We strive to qualify more than one supplier for all key food items and believe that beef of comparable quality as well as all other essential food and beverage products are available, upon short notice, from alternative qualified suppliers. 

Service 

Service Quality. We believe that guest satisfaction and our ability to continually evaluate and improve the guest experience at each of our restaurants is important to our success. We employ a team of service coaches whose function is to provide consistent , hands &#8209;on training and education to our service staff in our restaurants for the purpose of reinforcing service quality and consistency, staff attitude, team work and manage interaction in the dining room. 

Guest Satisfaction. Through the use of guest surveys, our website s, &#160; "texasroadhouse.com" and "bubbas33.com", a toll &#8209;free guest response telephone line, social media, and personal interaction in the restaurant, we receive valuable feedback from guests. Additionally, we employ an outside service to administer a " Secret Shopper " program whereby trained individuals periodically dine and comprehensively evaluate the guest experience at each of our domestic restaurants. Particular attention is given to food, beverage and service quality, cleanliness, staff attitude and teamwork, and manager visibility and interaction. The resulting reports are used for follow up training and providing feedback to both staff and management. We continue to evaluate and implement processes relating to guest satisfaction, including reducing guest wait times and improving host interaction with the guest. 

Atmosphere. The atmosphere of our restaurants is intended to appeal to b road segments of the population including children, families, couples, adults and business persons. Substantially all Texas Roadhouse restaurants are of our prototype design, reflecting a rustic southwestern lodge atmosphere, featuring an exterior of rough &#8209;hewn cedar siding and corrugated metal. The interiors feature pine floors and stained concrete and are decorated with hand &#8209;painted murals, neon signs, southwestern prints, rugs and artifacts. The restaurants contain jukeboxes that continuously play upbeat country hits. Guests may also view a display &#8209;baking a rea, where our fresh baked yeast rolls are prepared, and a meat cooler displaying fresh cut steaks. Guests may wait for seating in either a spacious, comfortable waiting area or a southwestern style bar. While waiting for a table, guests can enjoy complimentary roasted in &#8209; shell peanuts and upon being seated at a table, guests can enjoy fresh baked yeast rolls along with roasted in &#8209;shell peanuts. Our Bubba&#8217;s 33 restaurants feature walls lined with televisions playing a variety of sports events and are decorated with sports jerseys, neon signs and other local flair. 

People 

Management Personnel. Each of our restaurants is generally staffed with one managing partner, one kitchen manager, one service manager and one or more additional assistant managers. Managing partners are single restaurant operators who have primary responsibility for the day &#8209;to &#8209;day operations of the entire restaurant. K itchen managers have primary responsibility for managing operations relating to our food prep aration and food quality , and service managers have primary responsibility for managing our service quality and guest experiences . The assistant managers support our kitchen and service managers ; these managers are collectively responsible for the operations of the restaurant in the absence of a managing partner. All managers are responsible for maintaining our standards of qual ity and performance . We use market partners to oversee the operation of our restaurants. Generally, each market partner oversees up to 10 to 15 managing partners and their respective management teams. Market partners also assist with our site selection process and recruitment of new management teams. Through regular visits to the restaurants, the market partners facilitate adherence to all aspects of our concept s, strategies and standards of quality. To further facilitate adherence to our standards of quality and to maximize uniform execution throughout the system, we employ product coaches and service coaches who regularly visit the restaurants to assist in training of both new and existing employees and to grade food and service quality. The attentive service and high quality food, which results from each restaurant having a managing partner, at least two to three managers and the hands &#8209;on assistance of a product coach and a service coach , are critical to our success. 

Training and Development. All restaurant employees are required to complete varying degrees of training before and during employment. Our comprehensive training program emphasizes our operating strategy, procedures and standards and is conducted individually at our restaurants and in groups in Louisville, Kentucky. 

&#160;

Our managing and market partners are generally required to have significant experience in the full &#8209;service restaurant industry and are generally hired at a minimum of nine to 12 months before their placement in a new or existing restaurant to allow time to fully train in all aspects of restaurant operations. All managing partners, kitchen and service managers and other management team members are requ ired to complete a n extensive training program of up to 20 weeks, which includes training for every position in the restaurant. Trainees are validated at pre &#8209;determined points during their training by the market partner, product coach and service coach. 

A number of our restaurants have been certified as training centers by our training department. This certification confirms that the training center adheres to established operating procedures and guidelines. Additionally, most restaurants are staffed with training coordinators responsible for ongoing daily training needs. 

For new restaurant openings, a full team of designated trainers, each specializing in a specific restaurant position, is deploye d to the restaurant at least 10 days before opening. Formal employee training begins seven days before opening and follows a uniform, comprehensive training course as directed by a service coach. 

Marketing 

Our marketing strategy aim s to promote our brand s while retaining a localized focus. We strive to increase comparable restaurant sales by increasing the frequency of visits by our current guests and attracting new guests to our restaurants and also by communicating and promoting our brands&#8217; food quality, the guest experience and value. We accomplish these objectives through three major initiatives. 

Local Restaurant Area Marketing. Given our strategy to be a neighborhood destination, local restaurant area marketing is integral in developing brand awareness in each market. Managing partners are encouraged to participate in creative community &#8209;based marketing. We also engage in a variety of promotional activities, such as contributing time, money and complimentary meals to charitable, civic and cultural programs. We employ marketing coordinators at the restaurant and market level to develop and execute the majority of the local marketing strategies. 

In &#8209;restaurant Marketing. A significant portion of our marketing fund is spent communicating with our guests inside our restaurants through point of purchase materials. We believe special promotions such as Valentine&#8217;s Day and Mother&#8217;s Day drive notable repeat business. Our eight &#8209;week holiday gift card campaign is one of our most impactful promotions. 

Advertising. Our restaurants do not rely on national advertising to promote the brand. Earned media on a local level is a critical part of our strategy that features our product and people. Our restaurants use a p ermission &#8209; based email loyalty program, as well as social media, to promote the brand and engage with our guests. Our approach to media aligns with our focus on local store marketing and community involvement. 

Restaurant Franchise Arrangements 

Franchise Restaurants. As of December 29 , 201 5 , we ha d 22 franchisees that operated 82 &#160; Texas Roadhouse restaurants in 23 states and four foreign countries. Domestically, franchise rights are granted for specific restaurants only, as we have not granted any rights to develop a territory in th e United States. We are currently not accepting new Texas Roadhouse franchisees. Approximately 75 % of our franchi se restaurants are operated by 10 franchisees and &#160; n o franchisee operates more than 14 restaurants. 

Our standard domestic franc hise agreement has a term of 10 years with two renewal options for an additional five years each if certain conditions are satisfied. Our current form of domestic franchise agreement requires the franchisee to pay a royalty fee of 4.0% of gross sales. The royalty fee varies depending on when the agreements were entered into and range from 2.0% of gross sales to the current 4.0% fee. We may, at our discretion, waive or reduce the royalty fee on a temporary or permanent basis. " Gross sales " means the total selling price of all services and products related to the restaurant. Gross sales do not include: 

&#183; 

employee discounts or other discounts; 

&#183; 

tips or gratuities paid directly to employees by guests; 

&#183; 

any federal, state, municipal or other sales, value added or retailer&#8217;s excise taxes; or 

&#160;

&#183; 

adjustments for net returns on salable goods and discounts allowed to guests on sales. 

Domestic franchisees are currently required to pay 0.3% of gross sales to a national marketing fund for the system &#8209;wide promotions and related marketing efforts. We have the ability under our agreements to increase the required marketing fund contribution up to 2.5% of gross sales. We may also charge a marketing fee of 0.5% of gross sales, which we may use for market research and to develop system &#8209;wide promotional and marketing materials. A franchisee&#8217;s total required marketing contribution or spending will not be more than 3.0% of gross sales. 

Our standard domestic franchise agreement gives us the right, but not the obligation, to compel a franchisee to transfer its assets to us in exchange for shares of our stock, or to convert its equity interests into shares of our stock. The amount of shares that a franchisee would receive is based on a formula that is included in the franchise agreement. 

We have entered into area development agreements for the development of Texas Roadhouse restaurants in foreign countries. In 2010, we entered into an agreement for the development of Texas Roadhouse restaurants in eight countries in the Middle East over a 10 year period . In 2015, we amended our agreement in the Middle East to add one additional country to the territory. We currently have eight restaurants open in the Middle East. In addition to the Middle East, we currently have signed franchise development agreements for the development of Texas Roadhouse re staurants in Taiwan , the Philippines and Mexico . We currently have two restaurants open in Taiwan. For the existing international agreements, the franchisee is required to pay us a franchise fee for each restaurant to be opened, royalties on the gross sales of each restaurant and a development fee for our grant of development rights in the named countries. The term of the agreements may be extended. We anticipate that the specific business terms of any future franchise agreement for international restaurants might vary significantly from the standard terms of our domestic agreements and from the terms of existing international agreements, depending on the territory to be franchised and the extent of franchisor &#8209;provided services to each franchisee. 

Any of our franchise agreements, whether domestic or international, may be terminated if the franchisee defaults in the performance of any of its obligations under the franchise agreement, including its obligations to operate the restaurant in strict accordance with our standards and specifications. A franchise agreement may also be terminated if a franchisee becomes insolvent, fails to make its required payments, creates a threat to the public health or safety, ceases to operate the restaurant, or misuses the Texas Roadhouse trademarks. 

Franchise Compliance Assurance. We have various systems in place to promote compliance with our systems and standards, both during the development and operating of franchise restaurants. We actively work with our franchisees to support successful franchise operations as well as compliance with the Texas Roadhouse standards and procedures. During the restaurant development phase, we approve the selection of restaurant sites and make available copies of our prototype building plans to franchisees. In addition, we ensure that the building design is in compliance with our standards. We provide training to the managing partner and up to three other managers of a franchisee&#8217;s first restaurant. We also provide trainers to assist in the opening of every domestic franchise restaurant; we provide trainers to assist our international franchisees in the opening of their restaurants until such time as they develop an approved restaurant opening training program. Finally, on an ongoing basis, we conduct reviews on all franchise restaurants to determine their level of effectiveness in executing our concept at a variety of operational levels. Our franchisees are required to follow the same standards and procedures regar ding equipment and food purchases, preparation and safety procedures as we maintain in our company restaurants. Reviews are conducted by seasoned operations teams and focus on key areas including health, safety and execution proficiency. 

Management Services. We provide management services to 24 of the franchise restaurants in which we and/or our founder have an ownership interest and six additional franchise restaurants in which neither we nor our founder have an ownership interest. Such management services include accounting, operational supervision, human resources, training, and food, beverage and equipment consulting for which we receive monthly fees of up to 2.5% of gross sales. We also make available to these restaurants certain legal services, restaurant employees and employee benefits on a pass &#8209;through cost basis. In addition, we receive a monthly fee from 15 franchise restaurants for providing payroll and accounting services. 

Information Technology 

All of our company &#8209;owned restaurants utilize computerized management information systems, which are designed to improve operating efficiencies, provide restaurant and Support Center management with timely access to financial and operating data and reduce administrative time and expense. With our current information systems, we have the ability to 

&#160;

query, report and analyze this intelligent data on a daily, weekly, period, quarterly and year &#8209;to &#8209;date basis and beyond, on a company &#8209;wide, regional or individual restaurant basis. Together, this enables us to closely monitor sales, food and beverage costs and labor and operating expenses at each of our restaurants. We have a number of systems and reports that provide comparative information that enables both restaurant and Support Center management to supervise the financial and operational performance of our restaurants and to recognize and understand trends in the business. Our accounting department uses a standard, integrated system to prepare monthly profit and loss statements, which provides a detailed analysis of sales and costs. These monthly profit and loss statements are compared both to the restaurant &#8209;prepared reports and to prior periods. Restaurant hardware and software support for all of our restaurants is provided and coordinated from the restaurant Support Center in Louisville, Kentucky. Currently, we utilize cable, digital subscriber lines (DSL) or T &#8209;1 technology at the restaurant level, which serves as a high &#8209;speed, secure communication link between the restaurants and our Support Center as well as our credit and gift card processor s . We guard against business interruption by maintaining a disaster recovery plan, which includes storing critical business information off &#8209;site, testing the disaster recovery plan and providing on &#8209;site power backup. 

We accept credit cards and gift cards as payment at our restaurants. We have systems and processes in place that focus on the protection of our guests&#8217; credit card information and other private information that we are required to protect, such as our employees&#8217; personal information. Our systems have been carefully designed a nd configured to safeguard data loss or compromise. We submit our systems to regular audit and review, including the requirements of Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards. We also periodically scan our networks to check for vulnerability. 

We believe that our current systems and practice of implementing regular updates will position us well to support current needs and future growth. Information systems projects are prioritized based on strategic, financial, regulatory and other business advantage criteria. 

Competition 

Competition in the restaurant industry i s intense. We compete with mid &#8209; priced, full &#8209;service, casual dining restaurants primarily on the basis of taste, quality and price of the food offered, service, atmosphere, location and overall dining experience. Our competitors include a large and diverse group of restaurants that range from independent local operators to well &#8209;capitalized national restaurant chains. We also face growing competition from the supermarket industry, which offers " convenient " meals in the form of improved entrees and side dishes from the deli section. In addition, improving product offerings of fast casual and quick &#8209;service restaurants, together with negative economic conditions could cause consumers to choose less expensive alternatives. Although we believe that we compete favorably with respect to each of the above factors, other restaurants and retail establishments compete for the same casual dining guests, quality site locations and restaurant &#8209;level employees as we do. We expect intense competition to continue in all of the se areas. 

Trademarks 

Our registered trademarks and service marks include, among others, our trade names and our stylized logos. We have registered all of our significant marks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We have registered or have registrations pending for our most significant t rademarks and service marks in 46 foreign jurisdictions including the European Union. To better protect our brand, we have also registered various Internet domain names. We believe that our trademarks, service marks and other proprietary rights have significant value and are important to our brand &#8209;building efforts and the marketing of our restaurant concepts. 

Government Regulation 

We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws affecting our businesses. Each of our restaurants is subject to permitting, licensing and regulation by a number of government authorities, which may include among others, alcoholic beverage control, health and safety, nutritional menu labeling, health care, sanitation, building and fire codes, and to compliance with the applicable zoning, land use and environmental laws and regulations. Difficulties in obtaining or failure to obtain required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the development of a new restaurant in a particular area. Additionally, difficulties or inabilities to retain or renew licenses, or increased compliance costs due to changed regulations, could adversely affect operations at existing restaurants. 

In 2015 , the sale of alcoholic beverag es at our Texas Roadhouse restaurants accounted for approximately 11 % of our restaurant sales. Alcoholic beverage control regulations require each of our restaurants to apply to a state authority and, in certain locations, county or municipal authorities, for a license or permit to sell alcoholic beverages on the 

&#160;

premises that must be renewed annually and may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. Alcoholic beverage control regulations affect numerous aspects of restaurant operations, including minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, training, wholesale purchasing, inventory control and handling, storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. The failure of a restaurant to obtain or retain liquor or food service licenses or permits would have a material adverse effect on the restaurant&#8217;s operations. To reduce this risk, each company restaurant is operated in accordance with procedures intended to facilitate compliance with applicable codes and regulations. 

We are subject in certain states to " dram shop " statutes, which generally provide a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person. Consistent with industry standards, we carry liquor liability coverage as part of our existing comprehensive general liability insurance as well as excess umbrella coverage. 

Our restaurant operations are also subject to federal and state labor laws governing such matters as minimum and tip wage requirements, overtime pay, health benefits, unemployment tax rates, workers&#8217; compensation rates, citizenship requirements, working conditions, safety standards and hiring and employment practices. Significant numbers of our service, food preparation and other personnel are paid at rates related to the federal mini mum wage (which currently is $7.25 per hour) or federal minimum tip ped wage (which currently is $2.13 per hour). Our employees who receive tips as part of their compensation, such as servers, are paid at or above a minimum wage rate, after giving effect to applicable tip credits. We rely on our employees to accurately disclose the full amount of their tip income, and we base our FICA tax reporting on the disclosures provided to us by such tipped employees. Numerous states in which we operate have passed legislation governing the applicable state minimum hourly and/or tipped wage. Further planned and unplanned increases in federal and/or state minimum hourly and tipped wages or state unemployment tax rates will increase our labor costs. These increases may or may not be offset by additional menu price adjustments and/or guest traffic growth. 

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (the " PPACA " ) includes provisions requiring all Americans to obtain health care coverage in 2015. As part of these provisions, we are required to offer health insurance benefits to some of our employees that were not previously offered coverage or pay a penalty. In 2014, we offered coverage to an expanded group of hourly employees that worked a minimum of 35 hours a week which resulted in approximately $3.0 million in higher health care benefit costs. At the beginning of 2015, we offered coverage to an expanded group of employees , which included hourly employees that work a minimum of 30 hours per week. As a result of this change, our h ealth care benefit costs were &#160; approximately $4.5 million higher in 2015 compared to the prior ye ar . We continue to assess the ongoing impact of these provisions on our health care benefit costs . While we believe that the impact of the requirement to provide more extensive health insurance benefits to employees is manageable, the requirements could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. These increases may or may not be offset by additional menu price adjustments and/or guest traffic growth. 

We are subject to laws and regulations relating to the preparation and sale of food, including regulations regarding product safety, nutritional content and menu labeling. We are or may become subject to laws and regulations requiring disclosure of calorie, fat, trans &#8209;fat, salt and allergen content. The PPACA establishes a uniform, federal requirement for certain restaurants to post nutritional information on their menus, which specifically requires chain restaurants with 20 or more locations operating under the same name and offering substantially the same menus to publish the total number of calories of standard menu items on menus and menu boards, along with a statement that puts this calorie information in the context of a total daily calorie intake. The PPACA also requires covered restaurants to provide to consumers, upon request, a written summary of detailed nutritional information for each standard menu item and to provide a statement on menus and menu boards about the availability of this information. The PPACA further permits the FDA to require covered restaurants to make additional nutrient disclosures, such as disclosure of trans &#8209;fat content. The FDA released final regulations to implement the menu labeling provision of the PPACA in November 2014 with a compliance date of December 1, 2016. Compliance with current and future laws and regulations regarding the ingredients and nutritional content of our menu items may be costly and time &#8209;consuming. Additionally, if consumer health regulations or consumer eating habits change significantly, we may be required to modify or discontinue certain menu items, and we may experience higher costs associated with the implementation of those changes. In addition, we cannot make any assurances regarding our ability to effectively respond to changes in consumer health perceptions or our ability to successfully implement the nutrient content disclosure requirements and to adapt our menu offerings to trends in eating habits. The imposition of menu &#8209;labeling laws could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position, as well as the restaurant industry in general. 

Our facilities must comply with the applicable requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ( " ADA " ) and related state accessibility statutes. Under the ADA and related state laws, we must provide equivalent 

&#160;

service to disabled persons and make reasonable accommodation for their employment. In addition, when constructing or undertaking significant remodeling of our restaurants, we must make those facilities accessible. 

We are subject to laws relating to information security, privacy, cashless payments and consumer credit, protection and fraud. An increasing number of governments and industry groups worldwide have established data privacy laws and standards for the protection of personal information, including social security numbers, financial information (including credit card numbers), and health information. 

See Item 1A " Risk Factors " below for a discussion of risks relating to federal, state and local regulation of our business. 

Seasonality 

Our business is also subject to minor seasonal fluctuations. Historically, sales in most of our restaurants have been higher during the winter months of each year. Holidays, changes in weather, severe weather and similar conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions. As a result, our quarterly operating results and comparable restaurant sales may fluctuate as a result of seasonality. Accordingly, results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year and comparable restaurant sales for any particular future period may decrease. 

Employees 

As of December 29 , 201 5, we employed approximately 47,900 people in the company restaurants we own and operate and our corporate suppor t center. This amount includes 528 executive an d administrative personnel and 1,854 restaurant management personnel, while the remainder were hourly restaurant personnel. Many of our hourly restaurant employees work part &#8209;time. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
