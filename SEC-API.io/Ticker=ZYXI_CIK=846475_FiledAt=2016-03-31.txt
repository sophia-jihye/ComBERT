 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

History 

Zynex Inc. was founded by Thomas Sandgaard in 1996, when he founded smaller private companies that eventually were folded into Zynex, Inc. Zynex Inc., a Nevada corporation, that was formed in December 2001, is the parent company of and conducts business within six subsidiaries: Zynex Medical, Inc. (&#8220;ZMI&#8221;), a Colorado corporation, Zynex Neurodiagnostics, Inc. (&#8220;ZND&#8221;), a Colorado corporation, Zynex Monitoring Solutions, Inc. (&#8220;ZMS&#8221;), a Colorado corporation, Zynex Billing and Consulting, LLC (&#8220;ZBC&#8221;), a Colorado limited liability company, Zynex Europe (Zynex Europe ApS) (&#8220;ZEU&#8221;), a Danish corporation, and Pharmazy, Inc. (&#8220;Pharmazy&#8221;), which was incorporated under the laws of Colorado in June 2015 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of ZMI collectively referred to as &#8220;Zynex&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;. Over 99% of total 2015 consolidated revenue is attributable to ZMI. The only other subsidiary which, at the date of this annual report, is operating is ZEU which is only operating at a minimal level. Our headquarters are located in Lone Tree, Colorado. 

Beginning in 2012, we experienced significant declines in revenue and incurred significant operating losses for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 as reflected in the following table:

&#160;

At December 31, 2015, we had negative working capital of approximately $4.8 million, negative shareholders&#8217; equity of approximately $4.1 million and are in default under the terms of its secured line of credit with its lender. All of these factors question our ability to continue as a going concern.

In response to the decline in revenue, we have reduced our operating expenses through headcount reductions, negotiation of a new facility lease and general spending controls. We have also reduced our inventory levels during 2015 and 2014, thus reducing the level of purchases and conserving cash. We are operating with limited cash and most vendors require payment in advance, so inventory remains at a low level.

As noted above, we are in default of our line of credit. While the lender, Triumph Healthcare Finance, a division of TBK Bank, SSB (formerly known as Triumph Community Bank) (the &#8220;Lender&#8221;) notified us of the default in July 2014, it has continued to advance funds to us based on cash collections, even though it has no contractual obligation to do so. The Lender has agreed to forbear on exercising its rights through June 30, 2016. However, there can be no assurance that the lender will continue to make such advances or continue to forebear on exercising its rights.

We need to raise a substantial amount of additional capital to replace the line of credit and to provide sufficient working capital. The net losses, existing bank default and negative working capital make it difficult to raise any new capital and any such capital raised (if any) may result in significant dilution to existing stockholders.

Subsidiaries 

&#160;

Zynex Medical, Inc. (ZMI): 

ZMI designs, manufactures and markets medical devices that treat chronic and acute pain, as well as activate and exercise muscles for rehabilitative purposes with electrical stimulation. ZMI devices are intended for pain management to reduce reliance on drugs and medications and provide rehabilitation and increased mobility through the utilization of non-invasive muscle stimulation, electromyography technology, interferential current (&#8220;IFC&#8221;), neuromuscular electrical stimulation (&#8220;NMES&#8221;) and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (&#8220;TENS&#8221;). All our medical devices are intended to be patient friendly and designed for home use. The ZMI devices are small, portable, battery operated and include an electrical pulse generator which is connected to the body via electrodes. The products are cost effective when compared to traditional physical therapy, and often result in better mobility, less pain and increased potential for a patient to return to work and live a fuller life significantly earlier than with traditional therapies alone. All of our medical devices are marketed in the U.S. and are subject to US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulation and approval. Our products require a physician&#8217;s prescription before they can be dispensed in the U.S. We consider the physician&#8217;s prescription as an &#8220;order&#8221;, and it is on this basis that we provide the product to the patient and either bill the patient directly or the patient&#8217;s private or government insurer for payment. 

&#160;

&#160;

ZMI&#8217;s primary product is the NexWave device. The NexWave is marketed to physicians and therapists by our field sales representatives. The NexWave requires consumable supplies, such as electrodes and batteries, which are shipped to patients on a recurring monthly basis, as needed. 

ZMI also designs, manufactures and markets the NeuroMove product. The NeuroMove contains electromyography and electric stimulation technology that is primarily used for stroke, spinal cord and traumatic brain injury rehabilitation (&#8220;SCI&#8221;), by reaching parts of the brain to re-connect with muscles, also known as neuroplasticity. The NeuroMove product is primarily marketed to medical clinics.

&#160; 

In early 2014, ZMI slowly introduced the EZ Rx Prescription program, a new distribution model for dispensing ZMI products to patients. The program is known to prescribers, as EZ Rx Prescription and has streamlined the way physicians prescribe, patients receive our products, and how ZMI utilizes inventory. Under the program prescriptions are faxed directly to ZMI reducing the requirements on the physician or office staff to spend time with filling out device paperwork and educating patients on how to use the device. After receiving a prescription, ZMI contacts the patient directly to process the necessary paperwork and ships the device directly to the patient. Upon the patient receiving the device, they are taught how to use the device via instructional videos on the ZMI website.

The EZ Rx Prescription program ramped up significantly during 2015 whereas it represented over 75% of new orders by December 2015 as compared to only 15% at the start of the year. The EZ Rx Prescription program has reduced the number of units consigned to clinics for patient dispensing, thus virtually eliminating the amount of consignment inventory held by clinics. In addition, the EZ Rx Prescription program provides ZMI more control over the decision to ship a unit to a patient, whereas consigned inventory held in clinics was more difficult to control. In 2015 and 2014, ZMI medical devices accounted for 90% and 86%, respectively of our total net revenue and the compound pharmacy accounted for 10% and 10%, respectively. 

Zynex Medical, Inc. dba Pharmazy (ZMI) and Pharmazy, Inc (Pharmazy): 

&#160;

Beginning in 2012, many industry sales representatives, including those representing Zynex, began offering prescription TransDermal Pain Creams (TDPC) to their accounts, a product that paid much higher commissions with less paperwork than TENS devices. TDPC, like TENS, offers very effective, non-addictive pain management with minimal side effects. In order to attract sales representatives and to counter the number of sales representatives who either dropped or spent less time promoting Zynex&#8217;s TENS products in favor of TDPC, in late 2013, Zynex opened its own compounding pharmacy. The new pharmacy operated within ZMI, (ZMI dba &#8220;Pharmazy&#8221;) and obtained its first state license in February 2014. In June 2015, we incorporated Pharmazy, Inc. in Colorado as a wholly owned subsidiary of ZMI with the intent of transferring the pharmacy operations to the newly formed corporation. This transfer never occurred, but during January 2016 we shut down our compound pharmacy business. The business struggled due to the unfavorably changing pharmacy insurance reimbursements. In addition, we focused on our core electrotherapy product business and our potential and future blood volume monitor business described for ZMS, below. 

&#160;

In 2015 and 2014, the compound pharmacy accounted for 10% and 10%, respectively, of our revenues. We anticipate our focus on core electrotherapy business and the projected growth opportunities therein (as discussed elsewhere) will generate sufficient future operating results to offset the 2015 and 2014 pharmacy operating results.

Zynex Monitoring Solutions (ZMS): 

ZMS was formed in 2011 to develop and market medical devices for non-invasive cardiac monitoring. During 2015, ZMS was still in development and did not have any revenue. The blood volume monitor is a non-invasive medical device for monitoring central blood volume that would be used in operating and recovery rooms to detect blood loss during surgery and internal bleeding during recovery. This device has been subjected to multiple clinical studies, which are being utilized for collecting data to further validate the algorithm used to determine changes in central blood volume and planning for future, additional clinical studies. We have submitted a 510(k) application to the FDA and are responding to their questions. There is no guarantee when or if the product will be cleared for marketing by the FDA.

&#160;

The blood volume monitor has been tested in several International Review Board (IRB) approved studies and, during 2015, was used in several blood donation settings where hundreds of subjects have donated half a liter of blood with strong correlation to the index on the device. We have built a number of commercial devices in pilot-production and continue to refine the algorithms for the Blood Volume Index (BVI). A utility patent has been filed for this unique application (pending), which we believe could serve a currently unmet need in the market for safer surgeries and safer monitoring of patients during recovery. ZMS did not produce any revenue for the years ending December, 31, 2015 and 2014. During 2015, ZMS was still in development and did not have any revenue. 

&#160;

Zynex Internatio nal (Zynex Europe) (ZEU): 

ZEU was formed in 2012 to further progress Zynex&#8217;s international expansion. ZEU is not currently conducting business and was intended to be focused on sales and marketing our products within the international marketplace, upon receipt of necessary regulatory approvals. ZEU did not produce significant revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.

Zynex NeuroDiagnostics (ZND): 

ZND was formed in 2011 to market electromyography (&#8220;EMG&#8221;), electroencephalography (&#8220;EEG&#8221;), sleep pattern, auditory and nerve conductivity neurological diagnosis devices to hospitals and clinics worldwide, through the utilization of existing ZMI diagnostic EMG technology. ZND has not generated significant revenue and we are no longer actively pursuing sales of this product line.

Zynex Billing and Consulting (ZBC): 

During the latter part of 2012, we established a medical billing and consulting subsidiary, ZBC. ZBC provided outsourced billing services for private medical practices, which include collection services, medical coding and general billing consulting. ZBC is majority owned by Zynex, Inc. (80%) and has a non-controlling interest member, owning 20%. We ceased providing billing and consulting services in April of 2015. ZBC produced .4% and 3.8% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Product Uses 

Pain Management and Control 

Standard electrotherapy is a clinically proven and medically accepted alternative to manage acute and chronic pain. Electrical stimulation has been shown to reduce most types of local pain, such as tennis elbow, neck or lower back pain, arthritis, and others. The devices used to accomplish this are commonly described as the TENS family of devices. Electrotherapy is not known to have any negative side effects, a significant advantage over most pain relief medications. The benefits of electrotherapy can include: pain relief, increased blood flow, reduced edema, prevention of venous thrombosis, increased range-of-motion, prevention of muscle disuse atrophy, and reduced urinary incontinence. 

Electrotherapy introduces an electrical current applied through surface electrodes. The electrical current &#8220;distorts&#8221; a pain signal on its way to the central nervous system and the brain, thus reducing the pain. Additionally, by applying higher levels of electricity, muscles contract and such contraction may assist in the effects mentioned above. 

Numerous clinical studies have been published over several decades showing the effectiveness of IFC and TENS for pain relief. Zynex&#8217;s primary TENS device, the NexWave has received FDA 510(k) clearance. The NexWave is a digital IFC, TENS and NMES device that delivers pain-alleviating electrotherapy. In addition to our electrotherapy solutions, ZMI during 2014 and 2015 also 

&#160;

provided a line of prescription pain creams under its Pharmazy brand, which incorporate two to eight different active pharmaceutical ingredients to alleviate pain in localized areas, resulting in minimal systemic absorption and thus minimal side effects. The pain c reams are individualized for each patient&#8217;s unique pain symptoms, utilizing the multiple mechanisms of actions of the active pharmaceuticals. These varying pain creams provide pain relief for a wide range of ailments, from inflammatory pain, peripheral neu ropathic pain, general pain, headache pain, as well as painful scars. We ceased pharmacy operations during January 2016. 

Stroke and Spinal Cord Injury Rehabilitation 

Our proprietary NeuroMove product is a Class II medical device that has been cleared by the FDA for stroke and SCI rehabilitation. Stroke and SCI usually affect a survivor&#8217;s mobility, functionality, speech, and memory, and the NeuroMove helps the survivor regain movement and functionality. 

The NeuroMove product utilizes the relatively new science of &#8220;neuroplasticity&#8221;, the process by which healthy parts of the brain learn to compensate and assume functions previously carried out by the damaged areas. To accomplish this task, the extraordinarily sensitive NeuroMove technology monitors muscle activity and detects brain signals that indicate, even without any visible movement, the brain&#8217;s effort to move a specific muscle or area of the body. Once the effort is detected, the NeuroMove induces actual movement through electrical stimulation, thus providing effective feedback to initiate relearning in the healthy part of the brain. 

We believe the NeuroMove product is unique because its built-in microprocessor can recognize low-level attempts by muscles to contract and then &#8220;reward&#8221; such detection with electrical stimulation. We do not believe there are similar products in the stroke rehabilitation market. Some generic devices are being offered in international markets; however, we do not believe these products provide similar results with respect to stroke rehabilitation. When conscientiously using the NeuroMove product for three to twelve months, studies show that the majority of NeuroMove patients can re-establish the connection between the brain and impaired muscle and thus regain movement and functionality . When movement and functionality are restored, the patient may experience increased mobility, increased productivity, an improved outlook, and a reduced risk of accidents, and may be able to engage in activities they were precluded from before using the NeuroMove. 

Our Markets 

Zynex Medical (ZMI): 

To date, the majority of our revenue has been generated by our ZMI electrotherapy products. Thus, we primarily compete in the home electrotherapy market, with products based on IFC, TENS and NMES devices and consumable supplies. We estimate the annual domestic market for home electrotherapy products at approximately $350 million. Since 2013, we have experienced significant challenges related to health care reform, including the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act dramatically alters the United States health care system and is intended to decrease the number of uninsured Americans and reduce the overall cost of healthcare. The Affordable Care Act attempts to achieve these goals by, among other things, requiring most Americans to obtain health insurance, expanding Medicaid eligibility, reducing Medicare payments to providers, expanding the Medicare program&#8217;s use of value-based purchasing programs and instituting certain private health insurance reforms. Although a majority of the measures contained in the Affordable Care Act did not take effect until 2014, certain measures became effective in 2013, and additional government policies designed to reduce the overall cost of the Medicare program through reduced reimbursement and reduced coverage for certain items and services have already become effective. It is difficult to predict the full impact of the Affordable Care Act because of its complexity, lack of implementing regulations and interpretive guidance, gradual and potentially delayed implementation, future potential legal challenges, and possible repeal and/or amendment, as well as the inability to foresee how individuals and businesses will respond to the choices afforded them by the Affordable Care Act. As a result, it is difficult to predict the full impact that health care reform, including the Affordable Care Act, will have on the electrotherapy market. In the market segments in which we compete, we face a mixture of competitors ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small manufacturers that offer a limited selection of products. The primary competitor in our market is International Rehabilitative Sciences, Inc. d/b/a RS Medical. During the fourth quarter of 2015 EMPI, Inc (a DJO Global, Inc. Company) (Empi), a former competitor, announced the closure of the Empi electrotherapy division. This resulted from the challenging Medicare coverage and reimbursement environment. We do no longer take Medicare prescriptions. In addition, we face competition from providers of alternative medical therapies, such as pharmaceutical companies. Many of these competitors have greater financial and/or technical resources than we do. 

Key characteristics of our electrotherapy market are: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Collection cycles of initial payment from insurance carriers can range from 30 days to many months and considerably longer for many attorney, personal injury and worker&#8217;s compensation cases. Such delayed payment impacts our cash flow and can slow our growth or strain our liquidity. Collections are also impacted by whether effective billing submissions are made by our billing and collections department to the insurance carriers. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#9679; 

Prior to payment, the third party payors often make significant payment &#8220;adjustments or discounts.&#8221; This can also lead to denials and billing disputes with third party payors. &#160;

&#160;

&#9679; 

Despite the uncertainty created by health care reform, including the Affordable Care Act, as noted above in 2015, we experienced better reimbursement per order through 2015 compared to earlier years in our history. This has resulted primarily from increased efficiency and effectiveness in our billing department practices. The majority of our revenue is generated by the sale and rental of medical devices and from recurring patient supplies, specifically from our electrotherapy products sold through ZMI. We are reliant on insurance reimbursement. For 2015, approximately 70% of our consolidated net revenue was from commercial insurance carriers. 

Zynex Monitoring Solutions (ZMS): 

ZMS is focused on developing products within the non-invasive multi-parameter patient-monitoring marketplace. ZMS is currently focusing on developing its blood volume monitor.. We believe our product, once released into the marketplace (of which there can be no guarantee), will compete against multiple competitors, ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small manufacturers that offer a limited range of products. We have not yet identified competitors for this product. ZMS has not generated any revenue as its product is still in development.

Zynex NeuroDiagnostics (ZND): 

ZND was focused on developing products within the neurosensing marketplace in an effort to diversify our concentration of ZMI electrotherapy revenue. To date, ZND has not generated significant revenue and we are no longer actively pursuing product development of this product line other than continuing the sales of the acquired product line from NeuroDyne in 2012.

Sales and Growth Strategies 

To date, ZMI accounts for substantially all of our revenue. In an effort to increase revenue and diversification to become less sensitive to reimbursement changes, we are continually seeking new products that are less impacted by insurance reimbursement to our ZMI sales channel and are pursuing other opportunities, including the Blood Volume Monitor which is still in development. 

&#160;

&#183; 

During 2015 and 2014, we entered the compound pharmacy business, which generated $1,126 and $1,114, respectively of revenue. As discussed elsewhere, the pharmacy operations were closed in January 2016. 

&#160;

&#183; 

In late November 2015, the electrotherapy industry experienced a significant development when our largest competitor, Empi, announced the closure of their Empi electrotherapy division. Empi previously held a large share of the electrotherapy market with approximately $250 million in annual revenue. We believe this presents a significant opportunity for our existing sales team to capture accounts previously serviced by Empi and an opportunity for recruiting former Empi representatives in new areas where we do not have representation currently. Through February 2016, we have has engaged, both as employees and contractors, 71 former Empi representatives. Our orders have increased from an average of 1,000 during the first 11 months of 2015 to 2,600 and 2,800 during January and February 2016, respectively. 

We believe these events and actions will serve to focus and increase our market share in the electrotherapy market and, in the future, diversify our product mix. We also continue to modify and refine our geographic sales channels through experienced sales representatives, representing a mix of Zynex employees, sales contractors and international distributors. As of March 15, 2016 we had approximately180 active field sales representatives. An insignificant amount of our revenue is derived from international sales; however we continue to take steps to penetrate the global medical device marketplace. 

Manufacturing and Product Assembly 

Our manufacturing and product assembly strategy consists of the following elements: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Compliance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Use of contract manufacturers as much as possible, thereby allowing us to quickly respond to changes in volume and avoid large capital investments for assembly and manufacturing equipment. Domestically and internationally, there is a large pool of highly qualified contract manufacturers for the type of devices we manufacture. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Utilization of in-house final assembly and test capabilities. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Development of proprietary software and hardware for all products in house. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Testing all units in a real-life, in-house environment to help ensure the highest possible quality, patient safety, and reduce the cost of warranty repairs. 

&#160;

We utilize contract manufacturers ( principally located in the United States) to manufacture components for our NexWave and NeuroMove units and for some of our other products ; and manufacture / assemble in-house for our NexWave and NeuroMove units. We do not have long term supply agreements with our contract manufacturers, but utilize purchase orders with agreed upon terms for our ongoing needs. We be lieve there are numerous suppliers that can manufacture our products and provide our required raw materials. Generally, we have been able to obtain adequate supplies of our required raw materials and components. However, the majority of our suppliers at th is time require payment in advance and as a result we have limited flexibility in obtaining supplies of our required raw materials and component. We are always evaluating our suppliers for price, quality, delivery time and service. The reduction or interru ption in supply, and an inability to develop alternative sources for such supply, could adversely affect our operations. 

&#160;

Our significant suppliers as of March 2016 are: 

Axelgaard Manufacturing Co., LTD, Fallbrook, CA 

ATL Technology, Springville, UT 

Staples Advantage, Chicago, IL 

Pac-Tec, Division of LaFrance Corporation, Concordville, PA

Western Electronics LLC, Meridian, ID

See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements regarding our primary supplier of electrotherapy products. 

Distribution and Revenue Streams: 

To date, substantially all of our revenue is generated through our ZMI subsidiary from our electrotherapy products and, during 2015 and 2014, pain creams. Since our revenues are all pledged to its principal lender to collateralize a loan that is in default, the lender receives the revenues, and to date notwithstanding the default, the lender has allowed us to continue using our c ash collections for operational purposes. 

We sell most of our medical devices through direct and independent sales representatives in the United States. Our field sales representatives are engaged to sell in predefined geographic markets and are compensated based on the amount of cash collected from products sold. At times, we place our medical device inventory with certain field sales representatives to more quickly fill orders, which are typically consigned to various medical clinics and physician offices. Currently, the United States has been the market that we have focused on; however, we have established international distributors in Canada, Australia, Russia, China, India, Singapore, Holland, Germany, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Viet Nam. Typically, we sell and ship product directly to our international distributors, who work directly with the ultimate patient or end-user. To date these international customers have not generated significant revenue.

Our medical device products may be purchased or rented on a monthly basis based on the receipt and verification of a valid prescription. Renters and purchasers are primarily patients, health care providers and dealers. If the patient is covered by health insurance, the third party payor typically determines whether the patient will rent or purchase a unit depending on the anticipated time period for its use. When a rental unit is returned, it may be refurbished, tested and made available for additional rentals. 

A significant portion of our revenue is derived from patients with private health insurance carriers with insurance plans, typically known as HMO or PPO, on behalf of their insureds as well as worker&#8217;s compensation agencies. The balance of the revenue is primarily received from attorneys representing injured patients, hospitals, clinics and private-pay individuals. We no longer accept Medicare and Medicaid orders. 

A large part of our revenue is recurring. Recurring revenue results from renting our products, typically for two or more months, and the sale of surface electrodes and batteries sent to existing patients on both rental and purchased units. Electrodes and batteries are consumable items that are considered an integral part of our products.

Private Labeled Distributed Products 

In addition to our own products, we distribute, through our sales force, a number of private labeled products from other domestic manufacturers in order to complement our products. These products generally include patient consumables, such as electrodes and batteries. Customarily, there are no formal contracts between vendors in the durable medical equipment industry. Replacement products and components are easily found, either from our own products or other manufacturers, and purchases are made by purchase order. 

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

Although we do not own any patents, we believe that our products contain certain proprietary software. We currently have applied for patents for products related to cardiac monitoring within ZMS. In the future, we may seek patents for advances to our existing products and for new products as they are developed. During 2015 and 2014, we incurred approximately $256 and $394, respectively, of research and development expenses. We expect our research and development expenditures will be limited throughout 2016. 

We hold registered trademarks for NeuroMove in the U.S. and the European Union. Zynex and Zynex Medical are trademarked in the U.S. 

We utilize non-disclosure and trade secret agreements with employees and third parties to protect our proprietary information. 

Regulatory Approval and Process 

Federal Drug Association (FDA) 

All our ZMI products are classified as Class II (Medium Risk) devices by the FDA, and clinical studies with our products are considered to be NSR (Non-Significant Risk Studies). Our business is regulated by the FDA, and all products typically require 510(k) market clearance before they can be put in commercial distribution. Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act, is available in certain instances for Class II (Medium Risk) products. It requires that before introducing most Class II devices into interstate commerce, our introducing the product must first submit information to the FDA demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent in terms of safety and effectiveness to a device legally marketed prior to March 1976 or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that do not require approval of a premarket approval application. When the FDA determines that the device is substantially equivalent, the agency issues a &#8220;clearance&#8221; letter that authorizes marketing of the product. We are also regulated by the FDA&#8217;s GMP and QSR (Quality Systems Regulation). We believe that our products have obtained or are good candidates for the requisite FDA clearance or are exempt from the FDA clearance process. In September 2011, Zynex received FDA 510(k) clearance to market the NexWave, our current generation IFC, TENS and NMES device. In August 2012, Zynex received FDA 510(k) clearance to market the InWave, our next generation muscle stimulator for treatment of female incontinence. Failure to comply with FDA requirements could adversely affect us. In January, 2014 the FDA performed an inspection of Zynex Medical. At the end of the inspection a Form 483 was issued listing items that needed to be corrected to be in complete compliance with FDA regulations. In January 2015, the FDA performed a follow up inspection. We are have complied with all requests from the FDA to this point.

Changes in reimbursement for our products may adversely affect us. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) issued a Decision Memo on June 8, 2012 that eliminated Medicare reimbursement for TENS for any diagnosis code related to chronic low back pain unless the patient was enrolled in a CMS approved clinical trial. This change was implemented in 2013 and eliminated reimbursement for approximately 50% of the Medicare patients we normally served. We no longer take Medicare insurance plans. 

International 

&#160;

Zynex has received European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;) CE Marking approval for several of its products. CE Marking is a certification that a product meets the standards established by the 28 nations of the EU and qualifies for sale in the EU and 4-nation European Free Trade Association. 

The Far East, Middle East, Eastern Europe and Latin American markets have different regulatory requirements. We comply with applicable regulatory requirements within the markets in which we currently sell. If and when we decide to enter additional geographic areas, we intend to comply with applicable regulatory requirements within those markets. 

Zynex has received ISO13485: 2012 certification for its compliance with international standards in quality management systems for design, development, manufacturing and distribution of medical devices. This certification is not only important as an assurance that we have the appropriate quality systems in place but is also crucial to our international expansion efforts as many countries require this certification as part of their regulatory approval. The quality management system is audited on an annual basis and we received recertification in October 2015.

&#160;

Government Regulation 

The delivery of health care services and products has become one of the most highly regulated of professional and business endeavors in the United States. Both the federal government and individual state governments are responsible for overseeing the activities of individuals and businesses engaged in the delivery of health care services and products. Federal law and regulations are based primarily upon the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Each program is financed, at least in part, with federal funds. State jurisdiction is based upon the state&#8217;s interest in regulating the quality of health care in the state, regardless of the source of payment. Many state and local jurisdictions impose additional legal and regulatory requirements on our business including various states and local licenses, taxes, limitations regarding insurance claim submission and limitations on relationships with referral parties. Failure to comply with this myriad of regulations in a particular jurisdiction may subject us to fines or other penalties, including the inability to sell our products in certain jurisdictions. 

Federal health care laws apply to us when we submit a claim to any other federally funded health care program, in addition to requirements to meet government standards. The principal federal laws that we must abide by in these situations include: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Those that prohibit the filing of false or improper claims for federal payment. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Those that prohibit unlawful inducements for the referral of business reimbursable under federally funded health care programs. 

The federal government may impose criminal, civil and administrative penalties on anyone who files a false claim for reimbursement from federally funded programs. 

A federal law commonly known as the &#8220;anti-kickback law&#8221; prohibits the knowing or willful solicitation, receipt, offer or payment of any remuneration made in return for: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

The referral of patients covered under federally-funded health care programs; or 

&#160;

&#9679; 

The purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for any goods, facility, items or service reimbursable under those programs.
