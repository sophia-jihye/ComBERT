 Item 1 Business &#160; 

When we use the terms &#147;Innospec,&#148; &#147;the Corporation,&#148; &#147;the Company,&#148; &#147;Registrant,&#148; &#147;we,&#148; &#147;us&#148; and &#147;our,&#148; we are referring to Innospec Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires. 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

Innospec develops, manufactures, blends, markets and supplies fuel additives, oilfield chemicals, personal care and other specialty chemicals. Our products are sold primarily to oil and gas exploration and production companies, oil refiners, fuel users, personal care companies, and other chemical and industrial companies throughout the world. Our fuel additives help improve fuel efficiency, boost engine performance and reduce harmful emissions. Our oilfield services business supplies drilling, completion and production chemicals which make exploration and production more cost-efficient and more environmentally-friendly. Our other specialty chemicals provide effective technology-based solutions for our customers&#146; processes or products focused in the Personal Care, and Polymers markets. Our Octane Additives business manufactures products for use in automotive gasoline and provides services in respect of environmental remediation. 

&#160; 

Segment Information 

&#160; 

Innospec divides its business into three segments for management and reporting purposes: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; Fuel Specialties 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; Performance Chemicals 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; Octane Additives 

&#160; 

The Fuel Specialties and Performance Chemicals segments operate in markets where we actively seek growth opportunities although their ultimate customers are different. The Octane Additives segment is generally characterized by unpredictable and declining demand. For financial information about each of our segments, see Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160; 

Fuel Specialties 

&#160; 

Our Fuel Specialties segment develops, manufactures, blends, markets and supplies a range of specialty chemical products used as additives to a wide range of fuels. These fuel additive products help improve fuel efficiency, boost engine performance and reduce harmful emissions; and are used in the efficient operation of automotive, marine and aviation engines, power station generators, and heating oil. 

&#160; 

Our Fuel Specialties segment also includes our activities in the oilfield services sector, which develops and markets products to prevent loss of mud in drilling operations, chemical 

&#160; 

solutions for fracturing and stimulation operations and products for oil and gas production which aid flow assurance and asset integrity. 

&#160; 

In addition to our acquisitions in the oilfield services sector, the segment has grown organically through our development of new products to address what we believe are the key drivers in demand for fuel additives. In fuels, these drivers include increased focus on fuel economy, changing engine technology and legislative developments. We have also devoted substantial resources towards the development of new and improved products that may be used to improve fuel efficiency. 

&#160; 

Our customers in this segment include national oil companies, multinational oil companies, oil and gas exploration and production companies and fuel retailers. 

&#160; 

Performance Chemicals 

&#160; 

Our Performance Chemicals segment provides effective technology-based solutions for our customers&#146; processes or products focused in the Personal Care and Polymers markets. 

&#160; 

This segment has also grown organically, through the development and marketing of innovative products to the personal care industry. The focus for our Performance Chemicals segment is to develop high performance products from its technology base in a number of targeted markets. 

&#160; 

Our customers in this segment include large multinational companies, manufacturers of personal care and household products and specialty chemical manufacturers operating in niche industries. 

&#160; 

Octane Additives 

&#160; 

Our Octane Additives segment, which we believe is the world&#146;s only producer of tetra ethyl lead (&#147;TEL&#148;), comprises sales of TEL for use in automotive gasoline and provides services in respect of environmental remediation. We are continuing to responsibly manage the decrease in the sales of TEL for use in automotive gasoline in line with the transition plans to unleaded gasoline for our one remaining refinery customer. Cost improvement measures continue to be taken to respond to declining market demand. 

&#160; 

Sales of TEL for use in automotive gasoline are made principally to state-owned refineries located in Northern Africa. Our environmental remediation business manages the cleanup of redundant TEL plants as refineries complete the transition to unleaded gasoline. 

&#160; 

Strategy 

&#160; 

Our strategy is to develop new and improved products and technologies to continue to strengthen and increase our market positions within our Fuel Specialties and Performance Chemicals segments. The segments together have had average organic revenue growth of 4% per annum, and average operating income growth of 8% per annum, since 2010. We also 

&#160; 

actively continue to assess potential strategic acquisitions, partnerships and other opportunities that would enhance and expand our customer offering. We focus on opportunities that would extend our technology base, geographical coverage or product portfolio. We believe that focusing on the Fuel Specialties and Performance Chemicals segments, in which the Company has existing experience, expertise and knowledge, provides opportunities for positive returns on investment with reduced operating risk. We also continue to develop our geographical footprint, consistent with the development of global markets. 

&#160; 

Geographical Area Information 

&#160; 

Financial information with respect to our domestic and foreign operations is contained in Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160; 

Working Capital 

&#160; 

The nature of our customers&#146; businesses generally requires us to hold appropriate amounts of inventory in order to be able to respond quickly to customers&#146; needs. We therefore require corresponding amounts of working capital for normal operations. We do not believe that this is materially different to what our competitors do, with the exception of cetane number improvers, in which case we maintain high enough levels of inventory, as required, to retain our position as market leader in sales of these products. 

&#160; 

The purchase of large amounts of certain raw materials for our Fuel Specialties and Octane Additives segments can create some variations in working capital requirements, but these are planned and well managed by the business. 

&#160; 

We do not believe that our terms of sale, or purchase, differ markedly from those of our competitors. 

&#160; 

Raw Materials and Product Supply 

&#160; 

We use a variety of raw materials and chemicals in our manufacturing and blending processes and believe that sources for these are adequate for our current operations. Our major purchases are cetane number improvers, Ethylene, various solvents, octane enhancers and lubricity improvers. 

&#160; 

These purchases account for a substantial portion of the Company&#146;s variable manufacturing costs. These materials are, with the exception of Ethylene for our operations in Germany, readily available from more than one source. Although Ethylene is, in theory, available from several sources, it is not permissible to transport Ethylene by road in Germany. As a result, we source Ethylene for our German operations via a direct pipeline from a neighboring site, making it effectively a single source. Ethylene is used as a primary raw material in products representing approximately 5% of the Company&#146;s sales. 

&#160; 

We use long-term contracts (generally with fixed or formula-based costs) and advance bulk purchases to help ensure availability and continuity of supply, and to manage the risk of cost 

&#160; 

increases. From time to time, for some raw materials the risk of cost increases is managed with commodity swaps. 

&#160; 

We continue to monitor the situation and adjust our procurement strategies as we deem appropriate. The Company forecasts its raw material requirements substantially in advance, and seeks to build long-term relationships and contractual positions with supply partners to safeguard its raw material positions. In addition, the Company operates an extensive risk management program which seeks to source key raw materials from multiple sources and to develop suitable contingency plans. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

Our intellectual property, including trademarks, patents and licenses, forms a significant part of the Company&#146;s competitive advantage, particularly in the Fuel Specialties and Performance Chemicals segments. The Company does not, however, consider its business as a whole to be dependent on any one trademark, patent or license. 

&#160; 

The Company has a portfolio of trademarks and patents, both granted and in the application stage, covering products and processes in several jurisdictions. The majority of these patents were developed by the Company and, subject to maintenance obligations including the payment of renewal fees, have at least 10 years life remaining. 

&#160; 

The trademark &#147;Innospec and the Innospec device&#148; in Classes 1, 2 and 4 of the &#147;International Classification of Goods and Services for the Purposes of the Registration of Marks&#148; are registered in all jurisdictions in which the Company has a significant market presence. The Company also has trademark registrations for certain product names in all jurisdictions in which it has a significant market presence. 

&#160; 

We actively protect our inventions, new technologies, and product developments by filing patent applications and maintaining trade secrets. In addition, we vigorously participate in patent opposition proceedings around the world where necessary to secure a technology base free from infringement of our intellectual property. 

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160; 

In 2015, the Company had as a significant customer in the Fuel Specialties segment, Royal Dutch Shell plc and its affiliates (&#147;Shell&#148;), which accounted for $65.8 million (6.5%) of our net group sales. In 2014 and 2013, Shell accounted for $81.9 million (8.5%) and $83.1 million (10.1%) of our net group sales, respectively. 

&#160; 

We have sales contracts with customers in some markets using fixed or formula-based prices, as appropriate, to maintain our gross profits. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Certain markets in which the Company operates are subject to significant competition. The Company competes on the basis of a number of factors including, but not limited to, product 

&#160; 

quality and performance, specialized product lines, customer relationships and service, and regulatory and toxicological expertise. 

&#160; 

Fuel Specialties: Within the Fuel Specialties segment, the Fuels sub market is generally fragmented and characterized by a small number of competitors, none of which hold a dominant position. The oilfield services sub-market is very fragmented and &#150; although there are a small number of very large competitors, there are also a large number of smaller players focused on specific technologies or regions. We consider our competitive edge to be our proven technical development capacity, independence from major oil companies and strong long-term customer relationships. 

&#160; 

Performance Chemicals: We operate in two principal markets within Performance Chemicals &#150; Personal Care and Polymers. The Personal Care market is highly fragmented, and the Company experiences substantial competition from a large number of multinational and specialty chemical suppliers in each geographical market. The Polymers market is more concentrated, with a small number of principal competitors. Our competitive position in these markets is based on us supplying a superior, diverse product portfolio which solves particular customer problems or enhances the performance of new or existing products. In a number of specialty chemicals markets, we also supply niche product lines, where we enjoy market-leading positions. 

&#160; 

Octane Additives: We believe our Octane Additives segment is the world&#146;s only producer of TEL and accordingly is the only supplier of TEL for use in automotive gasoline. The segment therefore competes with marketers of products and processes that provide alternative ways of enhancing octane performance in automotive gasoline. 

&#160; 

Research, Development, Testing and Technical Support 

&#160; 

Research, product/application development and technical support (&#147;R&#38;D&#148;) provide the basis for the growth of our Fuel Specialties and Performance Chemicals segments. Accordingly, the Company&#146;s R&#38;D activity has been, and will continue to be, focused on the development of new products and formulations. Our R&#38;D department provides technical support for all of our reporting segments. Expenditures to support R&#38;D services were $25.3 million, $22.2 million and $21.2 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

&#160; 

We believe that our proven technical capabilities provide us with a significant competitive advantage. In the last five years, the Fuel Specialties segment has developed new detergent, cold flow improvers, stabilizers, anti-foulants, lubricity and combustion improver products, in addition to the introduction of many new cost effective fuel additive packages. This proven technical capability has also been instrumental in enabling us to produce innovative new products within our Performance Chemicals segment including Iselux &#153; and Statsafe &#174; . 

&#160; 

Health, Safety and Environmental Matters 

&#160; 

We are subject to environmental laws in the countries in which we conduct business. Management believes that the Company is in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and has made the necessary provisions for the continued costs of compliance with environmental laws, including where appropriate asset retirement obligations. 

&#160; 

Our principal site giving rise to environmental remediation liabilities is the Octane Additives manufacturing site at Ellesmere Port in the United Kingdom. There are also environmental remediation liabilities on a much smaller scale in respect of our other manufacturing sites in the U.S. and Europe. At Ellesmere Port there is a continuing asset retirement program related to certain manufacturing units that have been closed. 

&#160; 

We recognize environmental liabilities when they are probable and costs can be reasonably estimated, and asset retirement obligations when there is a legal obligation and costs can be reasonably estimated. This involves anticipating the program of work and the associated future expected costs, and so involves the exercise of judgment by management. We regularly review the future expected costs of remediation and the current estimate is reflected in Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160; 

The European Union legislation known as the Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemical Substances Regulations (&#147;REACH&#148;) requires most of the Company&#146;s products to be registered with the European Chemicals Agency. Under this legislation the Company has to demonstrate that its products are appropriate for their intended purposes. During this registration process, the Company incurs expense to test and register its products. The Company estimates that the cost of complying with REACH will be approximately $2 million over the next three years. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

The Company had approximately 1300 employees in 20 countries as at December 31, 2015 and 2014.
