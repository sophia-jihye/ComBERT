 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. &#160; 

General 

Worlds Online currently operates in two separate segments with one segment being a 3D entertainment portal which leverages its proprietary licensed technology to offer visitors a network of virtual, multi-user environments which we call &#34;worlds&#34; and the second segment, MariMed Advisors, being a management company in the medical cannabis industry. 

Corporate History &#160; 

We were formed on January 25, 2011 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Worlds Inc. (formerly known as Worlds.com Inc.). Effective May 16, 2011 Worlds Inc. transferred to us the majority of its operations and related operational assets, except for its patent portfolio. Worlds Inc. has also given us a perpetual world-wide license to its patented technology. Pursuant to the license and we have the right to issue unlimited sublicenses to the licensed technology, subject to Worlds Inc.&#8217;s reasonable consent. 

The assets transferred to us include: Worlds Inc.&#8217;s technology platform, Worlds Chat, Aerosmith World, DMC Worlds, Cinema Virtual, Pearson contracts and related revenue, the following URLs: Worlds.com, Cybersexworld.com, Hang.com, and Worldsfunds.com, a digital inventory of over 10,000 3D objects, animation sequences, an extensive avatar library, texture maps and virtual world architectures. 

The transfer of assets occurred in the context of the spin-off by Worlds Inc. of its online and operational technologies businesses to us. The spin-off was effectuated by Worlds Inc. (formerly known as Worlds.com Inc.) declaring a dividend of its shares of its then wholly-owned subsidiary, Worlds Online, Inc. with each share of Worlds Inc. to receive 1/3 of a share of Worlds Online with all fractional shares rounded up. Worlds Inc. did not want a trading market to develop for its shares until the SEC completed its review of its registration statement on Form 10. Accordingly, the actual distribution of the dividend did not occur until the payment date of March 12, 2012. Our stock is quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board. Approximately 23,859,248 shares were issued as part of the dividend distribution and immediately following the distribution Worlds Inc. continued to own approximately 19.6% of our outstanding shares. Worlds Inc. intends to dispose of its stock in an orderly fashion into the open market or in private sales, in either case in ways designed not to impact the market, but in any event within five years of the dividend payment debt. While it holds any of our shares it will vote them in proportion to the votes by other stockholders. 

On May 19, 2014, Worlds Online Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;) between MariMed Advisors Inc. (&#8220;MariMed&#8221;), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, Sigal Consulting LLC (&#8220;Sigal&#8221;), a Massachusetts limited liability company, and the Members of Sigal (&#8220;Sellers&#8221;). The transaction closed on September 29, 2014. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company, through MariMed, acquired all of the assets of Sigal and the Sellers received the aggregate amount of (i) the Company&#8217;s common stock (WORX) equal to 50% of the Company&#8217;s outstanding common stock on the Closing Date; (ii) three million options to purchase shares of common stock which are exercisable over five years with various exercise prices ranging from $0.15 to $0.35 and (iii) 49% of MariMed&#8217;s outstanding common stock. As a result, the Company&#8217;s ownership of MariMed was reduced from 100% to 51%. 

The transaction was accounted for as a purchase acquisition/merger wherein the Company is both accounting acquirer and legal acquirer. Accordingly, the company recorded the assets purchased and liabilities assumed as part of the merger and the portion that the fair value of the common stock issued and options granted for acquisition over the book value of Sigal was recorded as goodwill, which was subsequently impaired in full. 

Our fiscal year ends on December 31.

Medical Cannabis &#160; 

&#160; 

Through MariMed the Company offers a comprehensive suite of products in those states with newly passed medical marijuana regulations and/or recreational use marijuana. These services include fee-based to assistance to applicants to apply for state regulated cannabis licenses. For those who are awarded a license MariMed provides consultative services for all aspects required for the design , and operation of cannabis cultivation, production, and dispensing facilities.

Business Activities &#160; 

MariMed does not own licenses nor sell cannabis products. MariMed&#8217;s goal is to be an industry leader in providing professional management services. MariMed has developed proprietary operating processes and procedures to provide best practices to its clients.These services are also offered to existing licensed marijuana facilities. In such cases, MariMed can reengineer their facilities, purchase and develop new ones to maximize the value of their licenses and provide ongoing management services. 

Cannabis remains a Controlled Substance under federal law which makes conventional funding difficult to obtain. Accordingly, the demand for private funding in this industry is enormous. MariMed has raised private capital to fund some of its clients. 

MariMed intends to develop a brand of licensed cannabis infused products that are designed to be precision dosed for specific symptoms or conditions. These products are expected to be developed by the MariMed team in cooperation with licensed facilities. MariMed intends to license branded products to licensed facilities across the country. 

MariMed is working to develop for licensed facilities patient assessment programs to support research in the industry We believe that tracking outcomes and maintaining a good regimen with the patient will assist dispensaries in safely providing safe and reliable products to patients.

&#160; 

Business Structure 

&#160; 

MariMed creates private limited liability companies to fund and develop cultivation, processing, and dispensing facilities. These single facility LLCs are sometimes jointly owned by MariMed and investors with the share of ownership and the allocation of return negotiated on a deal specific basis. This structure was used in projects in Delaware, Illinois, and Nevada. 

As of December 31, 2015 MariMed was managing for clients one operating facility, building three facilities and assisting four applicants to obtain licenses in other States. 

Alliances &#160; 

&#160; 

MariMed is developing a licensed branded product line, Kalm Fusion. These products are being test marketed by MariMed licensed clients in two states. MariMed has entered into a licensing agreement with Tikun Olam, the first developer of medical cannabis products in Israel, to introduce certain medical cannabis strains developed in Israel with our Delaware client licensed facility. 

No assurance can be given that any of the alliances will result in increased revenues for MariMed. 

3D Technology 

&#160; 

Our worlds are visually engaging online environments featuring animation, motion and content where people can come together and, by navigating through the website, shop, interact with others, attend events and be entertained. In support of this portal and our overall business strategy, we can design and develop software, content and related technology for the creation of interactive, three-dimensional (&#34;3D&#34;) Internet web sites. Using our licensed technology, we create our own Internet sites, as well as sites available through third-party online service providers. 

Sites using our technology allow numerous, simultaneous visitors to enter, navigate and share interactive &#34;worlds&#34;. Our 3D Internet sites are designed to promote frequent, repeat and prolonged visitation by users by providing them with unique online communities featuring dynamic graphics, highly useful and entertaining information content, and interactive capabilities. We believe that our sites should be highly attractive to advertisers because they offer access to demographic-specific user bases comprised of people that visit the site frequently and stay for relatively long periods of time. 

In addition to our current business of developing and/or maintaining 3D worlds for our customers, we also hope to facilitate revenue generation through the acquisition of target companies that are either related to our core online virtual world properties or are operating in the areas of mobile content, casual games, virtual currency, micro transactions, online advertising and e-learning. We believe that targeted acquisition candidates offer a new cross platform opportunity to acquire customers and revenue while synergistically complementing our core competencies and technology platforms. 

Going forward we intend to focus o n establishing strategic partnerships and pursuing related synergistic technology acquisitions. With respect to acquisitions, there are no signed agreements or letters of intent at this time and we are only in the initial stages of discussion and negotiation. No assurance can be given that we will be successful in closing any deals or, even if we successfully close any deals, that we will see any revenues from such transactions. 

We believe that some of the uncertainty surrounding the legal challenge to the patents of our licensor, Worlds Inc., is having a negative impact on our ability to generate revenues from our 3D business and we do not expect any material changes until the patent litigation is resolved. Accordingly, we are currently directing our efforts to developing and expanding the medical marijuana part of our business and we are currently contemplating spinning off the 3D business.

&#160; 

The Technology &#160; 

&#160; 

We license our technology to produce three-dimensional portals and web sites for ourself and for third parties. We believe that our core technology delivers a considerably faster frame rate for user experiences and, in some cases, a meaningful productivity increase in art production and integration over its previous generation production tools. Our licensed technology permits the development of virtual worlds which have broad applications. These applications include but are not limited to a virtual meeting place (such as a fan club); a 3D e-commerce store (where merchandise can be viewed in 3D and purchased online); and a virtual classroom (where content can be viewed via video streaming and then discussed in real time). 

The core technology has substantial elements written in, Java, including WorldsBrowser and WorldsShaper, so we expect that it can be made portable across Windows and UNIX Platforms because of Java's platform independence. Our core technology includes: WorldsShaper, WorldsServer, WorldsBrowser, WorldsPlayer&#8482; and Worlds Gamma Libraries. 

Worlds 3D Chat 

&#160; 

We license a proprietary online 3D Internet chat site known as Worlds.com, an interactive site employing our licensed 3D technology. Our licensed 3D technology enhances users' chat experiences by allowing users to see a representation of each other in the form of highly textured characters, known as avatars, and to explore a 3D environment together. Users have the option to create their own avatars or choose from pre-defined figures in our library. Users communicate with each other through text chat, as well as voice-to- voice chat and can move through the many virtual &#34;worlds&#34; of the 3D environment. 

The user moves his or her avatar through these worlds using a mouse or keyboard arrow keys and can engage other avatars in one-on-one text-based or real voice-to-voice discussions; enter theme-based chat rooms featuring group discussions on numerous music styles, specific recording artists and other topics; experience interactive advertising and promotions; access information on various recording artists, concert schedules and other music-related and non-music-related information; view new music videos by leading recording artists; listen to selections from newly released CDs by numerous recording artists; purchase music and recording artist-related merchandise online; and design their own unique avatar as a VIP subscriber. 

We believe that the user base to the Worlds 3D Chat site could develop into a valuable asset if we have sufficient funds to market the site and increase its visibility. Worlds 3D Chat also contains an e-commerce component in the form of a real 3D virtual store online, selling music merchandise of various major recording artists. 

In the event we are successful in increasing the user base of Worlds 3D Chat it may also increase corporate brand identity that could translate into valuable consumer data and related advertising potential. A free demo of Worlds 3D Chat can be accessed by going to www.worldsonline.com and following instructions for a log- in account.

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

In both of our business segments, many companies now compete with us in one way or another and new ones may emerge in the future. The competition may be through entry into the same markets, or through technology that either obviates our advantages or lowers the barrier to entry in one of our markets. The markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid changes in technology and customer requirements, new laws and regulations, frequent new service and product introductions and evolving industry standards which could result in product obsolescence or short product life cycles. Accordingly, our ability to compete will be dependent upon our ability to develop and successfully introduce new products into the marketplace in a timely manner and to continually enhance and improve our products, services and technology to meet the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our users and prospective users. 

The competitive nature of each market segment varies based upon capitalization, historic positioning and technical capabilities among other attributes relative to these segments of each of the competitors within these markets. We believe we have (i) the technical capability to compete in all of these segments, and (ii) existing relationships in most of these market segments. However, we believe we are currently undercapitalized to effectively compete in all of the emerging market segments listed above and until we can raise sufficient capital to compete across the board we will have to cede certain segments while we focus our resources on those segments we believe we can be most competitive. Since as described above, the barriers to entry to any single segment are relatively low, a limited but sharply focused competitor will likely be able to overwhelm us in a specific segment. We are also unable to predict with any precision the particular segment in which such a competitor may arise and what our response will be as that will depend upon the resources available to us at that time. 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

Our 3D technology utilizes the trademark Worldsplayer&#8482; which is especially designed to allow users to view and experience the multi-user, interactive Worlds Gamma technology. Any world created with the WorldsShaper will be viewable and navigable with WorldsPlayer. The WorldsPlayer offers users the unique and creative experience of customizing their Avatars, while maintaining the ability to animate and activate their Avatars. 

MariMed has filed for trademarks for some of its branded product lines. 

In addition to our trademarks, we intend to enter into confidentiality agreements with key employees and consultants to protect our IP and general know-how. 

Employees 

&#160; 

We currently have four full time employees, three of which are involved in MariMed operations. Our president and CEO, Thomas Kidrin, who is also the president and CEO of our former parent, Worlds, Inc., continues to provide services on an as-needed basis. We do not believe that Mr. Kidrin&#8217;s obligations to Worlds Inc. will interfere with his ability to act as our president and CEO. Mr. Chris Ryan, our chief financial officer is a part-time employee who provides services to us on an as-needed basis. Mr. Ryan, who has the same arrangement with Worlds Inc., also has a full time job but based upon his past performance of his duties for Worlds Inc. we do not believe his outside duties will affect his ability to perform services for us as&#8211;needed. In the event our future growth requires a full time CFO, we expect to make any necessary arrangements which could include hiring Mr. Ryan on a full time basis or hiring a new full time CFO. We similarly expect to monitor Mr. Kidrin&#8217;s performance to determine if his duties to Worlds Inc. are interfering with his obligations to us.
