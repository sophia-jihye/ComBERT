 ITEM 1. Business 

Company Overview

DXP was incorporated in Texas in 1996 to be the successor to SEPCO Industries, Inc., founded in 1908. Since our predecessor company was founded, we have primarily been engaged in the business of distributing maintenance, repair and operating (MRO) products, equipment and service to industrial customers. The Company is organized into three business segments: Service Centers, Supply Chain Services and Innovative Pumping Solutions. Sales, operating income, and other financial information for 2013, 2014 and 2015, and identifiable assets at the close of such years for our business segments are presented in Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &#8220;financial statements&#8221; in Item 8 of this Report.

Our total sales have increased from $125 million in 1996 to $1.2 billion in 2015 through a combination of internal growth and business acquisitions. At December 31, 2015 we operated from 191 locations in forty-one states in the U.S., nine provinces in Canada, Dubai and one state in Mexico, serving more than 50,000 customers engaged in a variety of industrial end markets. We have grown sales and profitability by adding additional products, services, locations and becoming customer driven experts in maintenance, repair and operating solutions.

Our principal executive office is located at 7272 Pinemont Houston, Texas 77040, and our telephone number is (713) 996-4700. Our website address on the Internet is www.dxpe.com and emails may be sent to info@dxpe.com. The reference to our website address does not constitute incorporation by reference of the information contained on the website and such information should not be considered part of this Report.

Industry Overview

The industrial distribution market is highly fragmented. Based on 2014 sales as reported by Industrial Distribution magazine, we were the 20th largest distributor of MRO products in the United States. Most industrial customers currently purchase their industrial supplies through numerous local distribution and supply companies. These distributors generally provide the customer with repair and maintenance services, technical support and application expertise with respect to one product category. Products typically are purchased by the distributor for resale directly from the manufacturer and warehoused at distribution facilities of the distributor until sold to the customer. The customer also typically will purchase an amount of product inventory for its near term anticipated needs and store those products at its industrial site until the products are used.

We believe that the distribution system for industrial products, as described in the preceding paragraph, creates inefficiencies at both the customer and the distributor levels through excess inventory requirements and duplicative cost structures. To compete more effectively, our customers and other users of MRO products are seeking ways to enhance efficiencies and lower MRO product and procurement costs. In response to this customer desire, three primary trends have emerged in the industrial supply industry:

&#183; Industry Consolidation. Industrial customers have reduced the number of supplier relationships they maintain to lower total purchasing costs, improve inventory management, assure consistently high levels of customer service and enhance purchasing power. This focus on fewer suppliers has led to consolidation within the fragmented industrial distribution industry. 

&#183; Customized Integrated Service. As industrial customers focus on their core manufacturing or other production competencies, they increasingly are demanding customized integration services, consisting of value-added traditional distribution, supply chain services, modular equipment and repair and maintenance services 

&#160;

&#183; Single Source, First-Tier Distribution. As industrial customers continue to address cost containment, there is a trend toward reducing the number of suppliers and eliminating multiple tiers of distribution. Therefore, to lower overall costs to the customer, some MRO product distributors are expanding their product coverage to eliminate second-tier distributors and become a &#8220;one stop source&#8221;. 

&#160;

We believe we have increased our competitive advantage through our traditional fabrication of integrated system pump packages and integrated supply programs, which are designed to address our customers&#8217; specific product and procurement needs. We offer our customers various options for the integration of their supply needs, ranging from serving as a single source of supply for all or specific lines of products and product categories to offering a fully integrated supply package in which we assume procurement and management functions, which can include ownership of inventory, at the customer's location. Our approach to integrated supply allows us to design a program that best fits the needs of the customer. Customers purchasing large quantities of product are able to outsource all or most of those needs to us. For customers with smaller supply needs, we are able to combine our traditional distribution capabilities with our broad product categories and advanced ordering systems to allow the customer to engage in one-stop sourcing without the commitment required under an integrated supply contract.

Business Segments

&#160;

The Company is organized into three business segments: Service Centers (SC), Supply Chain Services (SCS) and Innovative Pumping Solutions (IPS). Our segments provide management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. The segments enable the alignment of strategies and objectives and provide a framework for timely and rational allocation of resources within our businesses. The following table sets forth DXP&#8217;s sales recognition by business segments as of December 31, 2015:

Service Centers

The Service Centers are engaged in providing MRO products, equipment and integrated services, including technical expertise and logistics capabilities, to industrial customers with the ability to provide same day delivery. We offer our customers a single source of supply on an efficient and competitive basis by being a first-tier distributor that can purchase products directly from manufacturers. As a first-tier distributor, we are able to reduce our customers' costs and improve efficiencies in the supply chain. We offer a wide range of industrial MRO products, equipment and integrated services through a continuum of customized and efficient MRO solutions. We also provide services such as field safety supervision, in-house and field repair and predictive maintenance.

A majority of our Service Center segment sales are derived from customer purchase orders for products. Sales are directly solicited from customers by our sales force. DXP Service Centers are stocked and staffed with knowledgeable sales associates and backed by a centralized customer service team of experienced industry professionals. At December 31, 2015, our Service Centers&#8217; products and services were distributed from 171 service centers and 8 distribution centers.

DXP Service Centers provide a wide range of MRO products in the rotating equipment, bearing, power transmission, hose, fluid power, metal working, industrial supply and safety product and service categories. We currently serve as a first-tier distributor of more than 1,000,000 items of which more than 60,000 are stock keeping units (SKUs) for use primarily by customers engaged in the oil and gas, food and beverage, petrochemical, transportation and other general industrial industries. Other industries served by our Service Centers include mining, construction, chemical, municipal, agriculture and pulp and paper.

&#160;

The Service Centers segment&#8217;s long-lived assets are located in the United States, Canada, Dubai and Mexico. Approximately 12.6% of the Service Centers segment&#8217;s revenues were in Canada and the remainder was virtually all in the U.S.

At December 31, 2015, the Service Centers segment had approximately 1,982 full-time employees.

Supply Chain Services

DXP&#8217;s Supply Chain Services (SCS) segment manages all or part of its customers&#8217; supply chains, including procurement and inventory management. The SCS segment enters into long-term contracts with its customers that can be cancelled on little or no notice under certain circumstances. The SCS segment provides fully outsourced MRO solutions for sourcing MRO products including, but not limited to, the following: inventory optimization and management; store room management; transaction consolidation and control; vendor oversight and procurement cost optimization; productivity improvement services; and customized reporting. Our mission is to help our customers become more competitive by reducing their indirect material costs and order cycle time by increasing productivity and by creating enterprise-wide inventory and procurement visibility and control.

&#160;

DXP has developed assessment tools and master plan templates aimed at taking cost out of supply chain processes, streamlining operations and boosting productivity. This multi-faceted approach allows us to manage the entire MRO products channel for maximum efficiency and optimal control, which ultimately provides our customers with a low-cost solution.

&#160;

DXP takes a consultative approach to determine the strengths and opportunities for improvement within a customer&#8217;s MRO products supply chain. This assessment determines if and how we can best streamline operations, drive value within the procurement process, and increase control in storeroom management.

&#160;

Decades of supply chain inventory management experience and comprehensive research, as well as a thorough understanding of our customers&#8217; businesses and industries have allowed us to design standardized programs that are flexible enough to be fully adaptable to address our customers&#8217; unique MRO products supply chain challenges. These standardized programs include:

&#160;

&#183; SmartAgreement, a planned, pro-active MRO products procurement solution for MRO categories leveraging DXP&#8217;s local Service Centers. 

&#183; SmartBuy, DXP&#8217;s on-site or centralized MRO procurement solution. 

&#183; SmartSource SM , DXP&#8217;s on-site procurement and storeroom management by DXP personnel. 

&#183; SmartStore, DXP&#8217;s customized e-Catalog solution. 

&#183; SmartVend, DXP&#8217;s industrial dispensing solution. It allows for inventory-level optimization, user accountability and item usage reduction by 20-40%. 

&#183; SmartServ, DXP&#8217;s integrated service pump solution. It provides a more efficient way to manage the entire life cycle of pumping systems and rotating equipment. 

&#160;

DXP&#8217;s SmartSolutions programs listed above help customers to cut product costs, improve supply chain efficiencies and obtain expert technical support. DXP represents manufacturers of up to 90% of all the maintenance, repair and operating products of our customers. Unlike many other distributors who buy products from second-tier sources, DXP takes customers to the source of the products they need.

At December 31, 2015, the Supply Chain Services segment operated supply chain installations in sixty-nine (69) of our customers&#8217; facilities.

&#160;

At December 31, 2015, all of the Supply Chain Services segment&#8217;s long-lived assets are located in the U.S. and all of 2015 sales were recognized in the U.S.

At December 31, 2015, the Supply Chain Services segment had approximately 284 full-time employees.

&#160;

Innovative Pumping Solutions

&#160;

DXP&#8217;s Innovative Pumping Solutions&#174; (IPS) segment provides integrated, custom pump skid packages, pump remanufacturing and manufactures branded private label pumps to meet the capital equipment needs of our global customer base. Our IPS segment provides a single source for engineering, systems design and fabrication for unique customer specifications.

&#160;

Our sales of integrated pump packages, remanufactured pumps or branded private label pumps are generally derived from customer purchase orders containing the customers&#8217; unique specifications. Sales are directly solicited from customers by our dedicated sales force.

&#160;

DXP&#8217;s engineering staff can design a complete custom pump package to meet our customers&#8217; project specifications. Drafting programs such as Solidworks&#174; and AutoCAD&#174; allow our engineering team to verify the design and layout of packages with our customers prior to the start of fabrication. Finite Elemental Analysis programs such as Cosmos Professional&#174; are used to design the package to meet all normal and future loads and forces. This process helps maximize the pump packages&#8217; life and minimizes any impact to the environment.

With over 100 years of fabrication experience, DXP has acquired the technical expertise to ensure that our pumps and pump packages are built to meet the highest standards. DXP utilizes manufacturer authorized equipment and manufacturer certified personnel. Pump packages require MRO products and original equipment manufacturers&#8217; (OEM) equipment such as pumps, motors, valves, and consumable products, such as welding supplies. DXP leverages its MRO product inventories and breadth of authorized products to lower the total cost and maintain the quality of our pump packages.

DXP&#8217;s fabrication facilities provide convenient technical support and pump repair services. The facilities contain state of the art equipment to provide the technical expertise our customers require including, but not limited to, the following:

&#183; Structural welding 

&#183; Pipe welding 

&#183; Custom skid assembly 

&#183; Custom coatings 

&#183; Hydrostatic pressure testing 

&#183; Mechanical string testing 

Examples of our innovative pump packages include, but are not limited to:

&#183; Diesel and electric driven firewater packages 

&#183; Pipeline booster packages 

&#183; Potable water packages 

&#183; Pigging pump packages 

&#183; Lease Automatic Custody Transfer (LACT) charge units 

&#183; Chemical injection pump packages wash down units 

&#183; Seawater lift pump packages 

&#183; Jockey pump packages 

&#183; Condensate pump packages 

&#183; Cooling water packages 

&#183; Seawater/produced water injection packages 

&#183; Variety of packages to meet customer required industry specifications such as API, ANSI and NFPA 

&#160;

At December 31, 2015, the Innovative Pumping Solutions segment operated out of twelve facilities, ten of which are located in the United States and two in Canada.

Approximately 1.7% of the IPS segment&#8217;s long-lived assets are located in Canada and the remainder were located in the U.S. Approximately 9.4% of the IPS segment&#8217;s 2015 revenues were recognized in Canada and 90.6% were in the U.S.

At December 31, 2015, the IPS segment had approximately 653 full-time employees.

Total backlog, representing firm orders for the IPS segment products that have been received and entered into our production systems, was $85.5 million and $140.6 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Products

Most industrial customers currently purchase their MRO products through local or national distribution companies that are focused on single or unique product categories. As a first-tier distributor, our network of service and distribution centers stock more than 60,000 SKUs and provide customers with access to more than 1,000,000 items. Given our breadth of product and our industrial distribution customers&#8217; focus around specific product categories, we have become customer driven experts in five key product categories. As such, our three business segments are supported by the following five key product categories: rotating equipment, bearings &#38; power transmission, industrial supplies, metal working and safety products &#38; services. Each business segment tailors its inventory and leverages product experts to meet the needs of its local customers.

Key product categories that we offer include:

&#183; Rotating Equipment . Our rotating equipment products include a full line of centrifugal pumps for transfer and process service applications, such as petrochemicals, refining and crude oil production; rotary gear pumps for low- to- medium pressure service applications, such as pumping lubricating oils and other viscous liquids; plunger and piston pumps for high-pressure service applications such as disposal of produced water and crude oil pipeline service; and air-operated diaphragm pumps. We also provide a large variety of pump accessories. 

&#183; Bearings &#38; Power Transmission . Our bearing products include several types of mounted and un-mounted bearings for a variety of applications. The power transmission products we distribute include speed reducers, flexible-coupling drives, chain drives, sprockets, gears, conveyors, clutches, brakes and hoses. 

&#183; Industrial Supplies . We offer a broad range of industrial supplies, such as abrasives, tapes and adhesive products, coatings and lubricants, fasteners, hand tools, janitorial products, pneumatic tools, welding supplies and welding equipment. 

&#183; Metal Working . Our metal working products include a broad range of cutting tools, abrasives, coolants, gauges, industrial tools and machine shop supplies. 

&#183; Safety Products &#38; Services . We sell a broad range of safety products including eye and face protection, first aid, hand protection, hazardous material handling, instrumentation and respiratory protection products. Additionally, we provide safety services including hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) gas protection and safety, specialized and standby fire protection, safety supervision, training, monitoring, equipment rental and consulting. Our safety services include safety supervision, medic services, safety audits, instrument repair and calibration, training, monitoring, equipment rental and consulting. 

We acquire our products through numerous OEMs. We are authorized to distribute certain manufacturers' products only in specific geographic areas. All of our oral or written distribution authorizations are subject to cancellation by the manufacturer, some upon little or no notice. For the last three fiscal years, no manufacturer provided products that accounted for 10% or more of our revenues. We believe that alternative sources of supply could be obtained in a timely manner if any distribution authorization were canceled. Accordingly, we do not believe that the loss of any one distribution authorization would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

&#160;

Over 90% of our business relates to sales of products. Service revenues are less than 10% of sales.

&#160;

The Company has operations in the United States of America, Canada, Dubai, and Mexico. Information regarding financial data by geographic areas is set forth in Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

&#160;

Competition

Our business is highly competitive. In the Service Centers segment we compete with a variety of industrial supply distributors, some of which may have greater financial and other resources than we do. Some of our competitors are small enterprises selling to customers in a limited geographic area. We also compete with catalog distributors, large warehouse stores and, to a lesser extent, manufacturers. While many of our competitors offer traditional distribution of some of the product groupings that we offer, we are not aware of any major competitor that offers on a non-catalog basis a variety of products and services as broad as our offerings. Further, while certain catalog distributors provide product offerings as broad as ours, these competitors do not offer the product application, technical expertise and after-the-sale services that we provide. In the Supply Chain Services segment we compete with larger distributors that provide integrated supply programs and outsourcing services, some of which might be able to supply their products in a more efficient and cost-effective manner than we can provide. In the Innovative Pumping Solutions segment we compete against a variety of manufacturers, distributors and fabricators, many of which may have greater financial and other resources than we do. We generally compete on expertise, responsiveness and price in all of our segments.

Insurance

We maintain liability and other insurance that we believe to be customary and generally consistent with industry practice. We retain a portion of the risk for medical claims, general liability, worker&#8217;s compensation and property losses. The various deductibles of our insurance policies generally do not exceed $250,000 per occurrence. There are also certain risks for which we do not maintain insurance. There can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate for the risks involved, that coverage limits will not be exceeded or that such insurance will apply to all liabilities. The occurrence of an adverse claim in excess of the coverage limits that we maintain could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The premiums for insurance have increased significantly over the past three years. This trend could continue. Additionally, we are partially self-insured for our group health plan, worker&#8217;s compensation, auto liability and general liability insurance. The cost of claims for the group health plan has increased over the past three years. This trend is expected to continue.

Government Regulation and Environmental Matters

We are subject to various laws and regulations relating to our business and operations, and various health and safety regulations including those established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Canadian Occupational Health and Safety.

Certain of our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations as well as provincial regulations controlling the discharge of materials into or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment.

Although we believe that we have adequate procedures to comply with applicable discharge and other environmental laws, such laws and regulations could result in costs to remediate releases of regulated substances into the environment or costs to remediate sites to which we sent regulated substances for disposal. In some cases, these laws can impose strict liability for the entire cost of clean-up on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of others or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. New laws have been enacted and regulations are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis and the costs of compliance with these new laws can only be broadly appraised until their implementation becomes more defined.

The risks of accidental contamination or injury from the discharge of controlled or hazardous materials and chemicals cannot be eliminated completely. In the event of such a discharge, we could be held liable for any damages that result, and any such liability could have a material adverse effect on us. We are not currently aware of any situation or condition that we believe is likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

&#160;

Employees

At December 31, 2015, DXP had approximately 3,234 full-time employees. We believe that we maintain positive relationships with all of our employees. Less than two percent (2%) of our employees are unionized.
