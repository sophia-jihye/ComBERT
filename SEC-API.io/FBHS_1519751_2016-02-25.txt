Our Company 

We are a leading home and security products company that competes in attractive long-term growth markets in our product categories. With a foundation of market-leading brands across a diversified mix of channels, and lean and flexible supply chains, as well as a tradition of strong product innovation and customer service, we are focused on outperforming our markets in both growth and returns, and driving increased shareholder value. We sell our products through a wide array of sales channels, including kitchen and bath dealers, wholesalers oriented toward builders or professional remodelers, industrial and locksmith distributors, &#147;do-it-yourself&#148; remodeling-oriented home centers and other retail outlets. We believe the Company&#146;s impressive track record reflects the long-term attractiveness and potential of our categories and our leading brands. Our performance since becoming an independent publicly traded company demonstrates the strength of our operating model and our ability to generate profitable growth as sales volume increases and we leverage our structural competitive advantages to gain share in our categories. 

Our Strategy 

Build on leading business and brand positions in attractive growth and return categories. We believe that we have leading market positions and brands in many of our product categories. We continue to invest in targeted advertising and other strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing brand awareness and educating consumers regarding the breadth, features and benefits of our product lines. We also strive to leverage our brands by expanding into adjacent product categories and continue to develop new programs through working closely with our customers. 

&#160; 

Continue to develop innovative products for customers, designers, installers and consumers . Sustained investments in consumer-driven product innovation and customer service, along with our lower cost structures, have contributed to our success in winning in the marketplace and creating consumer demand. MasterBrand Cabinets continues to provide cabinetry solutions for the home, ranging from kitchens, bathroom vanities, to home offices. Norcraft Companies, Inc. (&#147;Norcraft&#148;), acquired in May 2015, strengthens our overall product offering, deepens our access to the dealer channel, expands our regional market presence and enhances our frameless cabinetry capabilities. In 2015, MasterBrand Cabinets launched innovative new cabinet door designs, color palettes and features in a range of styles that allows consumers to create a custom kitchen look at an affordable price and introduced new, exclusive laminate door &#38; finish options across multiple price segments. We continue to provide channel support with a responsive website featuring our cabinet brands in one convenient location that drives leads to our dealerships. Moen&#146;s track record of continued innovation includes hand showers featuring the Magnetix magnetic docking system, a powerful new line of garbage disposals, the market-leading Spot Resist finish, our touchless Motionsense electronic faucets and our pull-out and pull-down faucets with Reflex self-retraction. The Therma-Tru portfolio of on-trend door and glass collections continued to advance to meet current and emerging architectural design trends including wider and taller door styles, with its contemporary Pulse line of doors, as well as additional decorative, privacy and textured glass designs. In addition, Therma-Tru launched its Doorway App, an innovative app allowing homeowners to customize and visualize Therma-Tru doors on their own homes. Master Lock continues to be a leader in innovative security products and services, such as its Bluetooth enabled padlocks and Professional Lockout Services, a group of experts providing customized procedures and training for lockout programs. John D. Brush &#38; Co., Inc. (&#147;SentrySafe&#148;), acquired in July 2014, continues to provide quality and innovative fire-resistant safes that secure consumers&#146; property and important documents. 

Expand in international markets . We expect to have opportunities to expand sales by further penetrating international markets, which represented approximately 15% of net sales in 2015. In 2015, Moen opened a manufacturing facility in China as part of our continued international expansion. In Cabinets, Kitchen Craft remained a leading cabinetry brand in Canada in 2015, while WoodCrafters provides a presence in Mexico. Master Lock continued to expand its presence in Europe and Asia, while Therma-Tru has made inroads in Canada as consumers transition from traditional entry door materials to more advanced and energy-efficient fiberglass doors. 

Leverage our global supply chains . We are using lean manufacturing, design-to-manufacture and distributive assembly techniques to make our supply chains more flexible and improve supply chain quality, cost, response times and asset efficiency. We view our supply chains as a strategic asset not only to support strong operating leverage as volumes increase, but also to enable the profitable growth of new products, adjacent market expansion and international growth. 

Enhance returns and deploy our cash flow to high-return opportunities . We continue to believe our most attractive opportunities are to invest in profitable organic growth initiatives, pursue accretive strategic acquisitions and joint ventures, and return cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and repurchases of shares of our common stock under our share repurchase programs. Both add-on acquisitions and share repurchase opportunities may be particularly attractive in the next few years. In 2015, we took a number of steps to position ourselves for the future including purchasing Norcraft, pricing a $900 million bond issuance, further integrating our SentrySafe business, investing in capacity, and strategically repurchasing our shares. 

&#160; 

Our Competitive Strengths 

We believe our competitive strengths include the following: 

Leading brands . We have leading brands in many of our product categories. We believe that established brands are meaningful to both consumers and trade customers in their respective categories and that we have the opportunity to, among other things, continue to expand many of our brands into adjacent product categories and international markets. 

Strategic focus on attractive consumer-facing categories . &#160; We believe we operate in categories that, while very competitive, are among the more attractive categories in the home products and security products markets. Some of the key characteristics that make these categories attractive in our view include the following: 

&#160;

&#62; &#160; product quality, innovation, fashion, finish, durability and functionality, which are key determinants of product selection in addition to price; 

&#160;

&#62; &#160; established brands, which are meaningful to both consumers and trade customers; 

&#160;

&#62; &#160; the opportunity to add value to a complex consumer purchasing decision with excellent service propositions, reliability of products, ease of installation and superior delivery lead times; 

&#160;

&#62; &#160; the value our products add to a home, particularly with kitchen and bath remodeling and additions, and the curb appeal offered by stylish entry door systems; 

&#160;

&#62; &#160; favorable long-term trends in household formations that benefit the outlook for our markets over time; 

&#160;

&#62; &#160; the relatively stable demand for plumbing and security products; and 

&#160;

&#62; &#160; the opportunity to expand into adjacent categories. 

Operational excellence . We believe our investments in lean manufacturing and productivity initiatives have resulted in supply chain flexibility and the ability to cost-effectively add capacity in order to match demand levels. In 2015 and 2014, we invested in incremental capacity to support long-term growth potential. In addition, our supply chains and lower cost structures have created favorable operating leverage as volumes grow without sacrificing customer service levels. We believe that margin improvement will continue to be driven predominantly by organic volume growth that can be readily accommodated by additional production shifts and equipment as necessary. 

Commitment to innovation . We have a long track record of successful product and process innovations that introduce valued new products and services to our customers and consumers. We are committed to continuing to invest in new product development and enhance customer service to strengthen our leading brands and penetrate adjacent markets. 

Diverse sales end-use mix . We sell in a variety of product categories in the U.S. home and security products markets. In addition, our exposure to changing levels of U.S. residential new home construction activity is balanced with repair-and-remodel activity, which comprises a substantial majority of the overall U.S. home products market and about two-thirds of our U.S. home products sales. We also benefit from a stable market for plumbing and security products and international sales growth opportunities. 

Diverse sales channels . We sell through a wide array of sales channels, including kitchen and bath dealers, wholesalers oriented to builders or professional remodelers, industrial and locksmith distributors, &#147;do-it-yourself&#148; remodeling-oriented home centers and other retail outlets. We also sell security products to locksmiths, industrial distributors and mass merchants. We are able to leverage existing sales channels to expand into adjacent product categories. In 2015, sales to our top ten customers represented less than half of total sales. 

&#160; 

Decentralized business model . Our business segments are focused on distinct product categories and are responsible for their own performance. This structure enables each of our segments to independently best position itself within each category in which it competes and reinforces strong accountability for operational and financial performance. Each of our segments focus on its unique set of consumers, customers, competitors and suppliers, while also sharing best practices. 

Strong capital structure. We exited 2015 with a strong balance sheet, even as we completed the $648.6 million acquisition of Norcraft and repurchased $51.7 million of our shares in 2015. In June 2015, we issued $900 million of unsecured senior notes (&#147;Senior Notes&#148;) in a public offering. As of December 31, 2015, we had $238.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and total debt was $1,172.4 million, resulting in a net debt position of $933.9 million. In addition, we had $975 million available under our credit facilities as of December 31, 2015. 

Business Segments 

We have four business segments: Cabinets, Plumbing, Doors and Security. The following table shows net sales for each of these segments, including key brands within each segment:

Our segments compete on the basis of innovation, fashion, quality, price, service and responsiveness to distributor, retailer and installer needs, as well as end-user consumer preferences. Our markets are very competitive. Approximately 15% of 2015 net sales were to international markets, and sales to two of the Company&#146;s customers, The Home Depot, Inc. (&#147;The Home Depot&#148;) and Lowe&#146;s Companies, Inc. (&#147;Lowe&#146;s&#148;), each accounted for more than 10% of the Company&#146;s net sales in 2015. Sales to all U.S. home centers in the aggregate were approximately 30% of net sales in 2015. 

Cabinets. Our Cabinets segment manufactures custom, semi-custom and stock cabinetry, as well as vanities, for the kitchen, bath and other parts of the home through a regional supply chain footprint to deliver high quality and service to our customers. This segment sells a portfolio of brands that enables our customers to differentiate themselves against competitors. This portfolio includes brand names such as Aristokraft, Diamond, Kitchen Craft, Mid-Continent, Kitchen Classics, Schrock, Omega, Thomasville, Homecrest, Ultracraft and StarMark. Substantially all of this segment&#146;s sales are in North America. This segment sells directly to kitchen and bath dealers, home centers, wholesalers and large builders. In aggregate, sales to The Home Depot and Lowe&#146;s comprised approximately 35% of net sales of the Cabinets segment in 2015. This segment&#146;s competitors include Masco, American Woodmark and RSI, as well as a large number of regional and local suppliers. 

&#160; 

Plumbing. Our Plumbing segment manufactures or assembles and sells faucets, accessories, kitchen sinks and waste disposals in North America and China, predominantly under the Moen and Waste King brands. Although this segment sells products principally in the U.S., Canada and China, this segment also sells in Mexico, Southeast Asia and South America. Approximately 23% of 2015 net sales were to international markets. This segment sells directly through its own sales force and indirectly through independent manufacturers&#146; representatives, primarily to wholesalers, home centers, mass merchandisers and industrial distributors. In aggregate, sales to The Home Depot and Lowe&#146;s comprised approximately 26% of net sales of the Plumbing segment in 2015. This segment&#146;s chief competitors include Delta (owned by Masco), Kohler, Pfister (owned by Spectrum Brands), American Standard (owned by LIXIL Group), InSinkErator (owned by Emerson Electronic Company) and imported private-label brands. 

Doors. Our Doors segment manufactures and sells fiberglass and steel entry door systems under the Therma-Tru brand and urethane millwork product lines under the Fypon brand. This segment benefits from the long-term trend away from traditional materials, such as wood, steel and aluminum, toward more energy-efficient and durable synthetic materials. Therma-Tru products include fiberglass and steel residential entry door and patio door systems, primarily for sale in the U.S. and Canada. This segment&#146;s principal customers are home centers, millwork building products and wholesale distributors, and specialty dealers that provide products to the residential new construction market, as well as to the remodeling and renovation markets. In aggregate, sales to The Home Depot and Lowe&#146;s comprised approximately 11% of net sales of the Doors segment in 2015.

Our Security segment&#146;s products consist of locks, safety and security devices, and electronic security products manufactured, sourced and distributed under the Master Lock brand and fire resistant safes, security containers and commercial cabinets manufactured, sourced and distributed under the SentrySafe brand.

&#160; 

Other Information 

Raw materials. The table below indicates the principal raw materials used by each of our segments. These materials are available from a number of sources. Volatility in the prices of commodities and energy used in making and distributing our products impacts the cost of manufacturing our products. 

&#160;

&#160; &#160; Segment &#160; Raw Materials Cabinets 

&#160; Hardwoods (maple, cherry and oak), plywood and particleboard Plumbing 

&#160; Brass, zinc, resins, stainless steel and copper Doors 

&#160; Glass, resins, wood, steel, aluminum and foam Security 

&#160; Rolled steel and brass Intellectual property. Product innovation and branding are important to the success of our business. In addition to the brand protection offered by our trademarks, patent protection helps distinguish our unique product features in the market by preventing copying and making it more difficult for competitors to benefit unfairly from our design innovation. We hold U.S. and foreign patents covering various features used in products sold within all of our business segments. Although each of our segments relies on a number of patents and patent groups that, in the aggregate, provide important protections to the Company, no single patent or patent group is material to any of the Company&#146;s segments. 

Employees. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 21,400 full-time employees. 2,635 of these employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements of which less than 5% of these employees are subject to agreements that will expire within one year of the date on which this Annual Report on Form 10-K was filed. Employee relations are generally good. 

Information about geographic areas. For additional information about net sales and assets by geographic areas, refer to Note 18, &#147;Information on Business Segments,&#148; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Seasonality. All of our operating segments traditionally experience lower sales in the first quarter of the year when new home construction, repair-and-remodel activity and security buying are at their lowest. As a result of sales seasonality and associated timing of working capital fluctuations, our cash flow from operating activities is typically higher in the second half of the year. 

Environmental matters. We are involved in remediation activities to clean up hazardous wastes as required by federal and state laws. Liabilities for remediation costs of each site are based on our best estimate of undiscounted future costs, excluding possible insurance recoveries or recoveries from other third parties. Uncertainties about the status of laws, regulations, technology and information related to individual sites make it difficult to develop estimates of environmental remediation exposures. Some of the potential liabilities relate to sites we own, and some relate to sites we no longer own or never owned. Several of our subsidiaries have been designated as potentially responsible parties (&#147;PRP&#148;) under &#147;Superfund&#148; or similar state laws. As of December 31, 2015, ten such instances have not been dismissed, settled or otherwise resolved. In the calendar year 2015, none of our subsidiaries were identified as a PRP in any new instances and no instances were settled, dismissed or otherwise resolved. In most instances where our subsidiaries are named as a PRP, we enter into cost-sharing arrangements with other PRPs. We give notice to insurance carriers of potential PRP liability, but very rarely, if ever, receive reimbursement from insurance for PRP costs. We believe that the cost of complying with the present environmental protection laws, before considering estimated recoveries either from other PRPs or insurance, will not have a material 

&#160; 

adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had accruals of $2.8 million, relating to environmental compliance and clean up including, but not limited to, the above mentioned Superfund sites.
