 ITEM 1. BUSINESS

&#160;

Overview

We were incorporated in the State of Nevada in 2001, and in 2009 changed name to Sport Endurance, Inc.

On April 25, 2016, shareholders holding 55,030,600 shares of the outstanding common stock of the Company, representing approximately 71% of the Company&#8217;s outstanding shares, acted by written consent to remove the Company&#8217;s existing members of the Board of Directors, and in their place appoint David Lelong as the sole director of the Company. Previously, on February 4, 2016, shareholders representing a majority of the outstanding common stock of the Company acted by written consent to remove the Company&#8217;s directors and appoint Mr. Lelong as sole director of the Company, and following the February 4, 2016 shareholder action, Mr. Lelong, acting as sole director, replaced Mr. Gerald Ricks as President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Company. However, under Nevada law, directors may be removed only by shareholders representing two-thirds of outstanding shares; consequently the February 4, 2016 shareholder action was not valid, and on April 25, 2016 the Company sought, and received, new approval from shareholders representing a sufficient percentage of outstanding shares to act validly under Nevada law.

&#160;

The Company is presently marketing for sale three products in the areas of Total Wellness, Performance, and Recovery. The products are called Ultra Peak T, Sports Leg &#38; Lung Formula, and Pain-Freeze Recovery Gel.

&#160;

The Company has acquired product inventory from an unaffiliated outside provider (PureSource, Inc.). The Company is in the process of ramping its direct marketing efforts through online and direct mail channels and has not yet achieved material revenue in connection with its business to date. As a result we are a startup company, with a limited operating history or revenue, and are at a competitive disadvantage.

&#160;

The competition for and difficulty in selling our products may affect our ability to develop profitable operations in the future. Companies that are engaged in selling health supplements include large, established companies with substantial capabilities and long earnings records.

&#160;

We have only received insignificant revenues from our operations and are in the process of ramping our sales and marketing operations. Our auditors note the absence of revenues and operations in the Independent Audit Report dated December 5, 2016, cites a going concern. The going concern statement opinion issued by the independent auditors is the result of a lack of operations and working capital.

The company will need to raise capital which concerned the independent auditors because there is insufficient cash for operations for the next twelve months. We will have to seek other sources of capital. 

We established the minimum amount of $200,000 that the Company will need to raise through debt instruments such as bank loans, or private financing so that sales and marketing operations can proceed in order to generate revenue. Presently no other sources of financing have been identified, and it is unknown if any other sources will be identified. There is no assurance that the company will be able to obtain any bank loans or private financing.

The Company has developed marketing plans and materials for reaching prospective customers directly through online advertising and direct mail. The necessary systems and processes to accept, fulfill, and service customer orders have been implemented and tested. Sales and marketing efforts will ramp up once the Company receives a next round of financing. &#160;
