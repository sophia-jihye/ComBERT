 ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS 

Overview 

Chico&#8217;s FAS, Inc. 1 , is a cultivator of brands serving the lifestyle needs of fashion-savvy women 35 years and older. The Company&#8217;s portfolio currently consists of three brands: Chico&#8217;s, White House Black Market (&#8220;WHBM&#8221;) and Soma. The Company operated a fourth brand, Boston Proper, through January 15, 2016, when it was sold by the Company. Our omni-channel brands are specialty retailers of private label women&#8217;s apparel, accessories, and related products. Our product is available to customers in our domestic and international retail stores, through our optimized e-commerce websites, via telephone through our call centers, and through an unaffiliated franchise partner in Mexico. As of January 30, 2016 , we operated 1,518 &#32;stores across 48 states, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Canada, and sold merchandise through 37 &#32;franchise locations in Mexico. 

Since 1983, we have grown by offering high quality and unique merchandise, supported by compelling marketing and outstanding, personalized customer service. While each of our brands has a distinct customer base, the overall portfolio caters to a broad age and economic demographic, with household incomes ranging from $50,000 to well over $100,000. Since 2003, we have also grown by the acquisition or organic development of other specialty retail concepts and execution of our omni-channel capabilities. 

Our Brands 

Chico&#8217;s 

The Chico&#8217;s brand, which began operations in 1983, primarily sells exclusively designed, private branded clothing focusing on women 45 and older with a moderate to high income level. The style sensibility is unique with an individual expression created to illuminate the women wearing the brand. Chico's apparel, including the Black Label, Zenergy and Travelers collections, emphasizes a style that has a comfortable and relaxed fit. Accessories and jewelry are designed to elevate the clothing assortment, allowing our customer to individualize her personal style. Chico's is vertically integrated, controlling almost all aspects of the apparel design process, including choices of pattern, print, construction, design specifications, fabric, finishes and color through in-house designers, purchased designs and independent suppliers. 

The distinctive nature of Chico&#8217;s clothing is also reflected in its sizing, which is comprised of sizes 000, 00 (size 0-2), 0 (size 4-6), 1 (size 8-10), 2 (size 12-14), 3 (size 16-18), and 4 (size 20-22). Chico&#8217;s will occasionally offer half-sizes (up to 4.5), one-size-fits-all, petite sizes, short and tall inseams, and small, medium and large sizing for some items. The relaxed fit allows us to utilize this kind of sizing and thus offer a wide selection of clothing without having to invest in a large number of sizes within a single style.

White House Black Market 

The WHBM brand, which began operations in 1985 and which we acquired in September 2003, is dedicated to becoming a go-to style destination and authority on wardrobe building. WHBM primarily sells exclusively designed, private branded clothing focusing on women 35 and older with a moderate to high income level. WHBM offers a modern collection for the way women live now, selling stylish and versatile clothing and accessory items, including everyday basics, wear-to-work, denim and elegant occasion. Historically known for its black and white color palette, WHBM's collection reflects of-the-moment colors and pattern. The accessories at WHBM, such as shoes, belts, scarves, handbags and jewelry, are specifically designed to coordinate with each collection, allowing customers to easily individualize their wardrobe selections. WHBM is vertically integrated, controlling almost all aspects of the apparel design process, including choices of pattern, prints, construction, design specifications, fabric, finishes and color through in-house designers, purchased designs and independent suppliers. 

WHBM uses American sizes in the 00-14 range (with online sizes up to 16), including petite sizing, as well as short and long inseams, which we believe is appropriate for the target WHBM customer. The fit of the WHBM clothing is tailored to complement the figure of a body-conscious woman, while still remaining comfortable. 

Soma 

The Soma brand, which began operations in 2004, primarily sells exclusively designed, private branded lingerie, sleepwear, loungewear and beauty products focusing on women 35 and older with a moderate to high income level. Soma offers innovative lingerie, sleepwear, loungewear and beauty, with designer quality at affordable prices. The lingerie category includes bras, panties, shapewear and swimwear while the loungewear category includes tops, bottoms and dresses. Bras range in size from 32A-44G. The sleepwear and loungewear offerings range from extra small to extra-extra large sizing. The beauty category consists of the Enticing and Oh My Gorgeous lines of fine fragrance. The Soma brand product offerings are developed by working closely with a small number of independent suppliers to design proprietary products in-house and, in some cases, it includes designs provided by its independent suppliers under labels other than the Soma label. 

Boston Proper 

The Boston Proper brand, which we acquired in September 2011, primarily sells women&#8217;s apparel and accessories, marketing to affluent women between 35 and 55 years old. During fiscal 2015 , we completed the sale of the Boston Proper direct-to-consumer business and closure of its stores. 

Our Business Strategy 

Our overall business strategy is focused on building and cultivating a portfolio of high-performing retail brands serving the fashion needs of women 35 and older. We are focused on increasing the sales volume and profitability of our existing brands through our four focus areas: evolving our customer experience, strengthening our brands' positions, leveraging actionable retail science, and sharpening our financial principles. Over the long term, we may build our brand portfolio by organic development or acquisition of other specialty retail concepts if research indicates that the opportunity complements our current brands and is appropriate and in the best interest of the shareholders. 

We pursue the growth of the brands in our portfolio by building our omni-channel capabilities, which includes managing our store base and our growing online presence, executing marketing plans, effectively leveraging expenses and optimizing the potential of each of our three brands. We have invested heavily in our omni-channel capabilities in order to allow customers to fully experience our brands, and not just a channel within our brands. In essence, we view our various sales channels as a single, integrated process rather than as separate sales channels operating independently. To that end, we often refer to our brands&#8217; respective websites as &#8220;our largest store&#8221; within the brand. 

Under this integrated, omni-channel approach, we encourage our customers to take advantage of each of our sales channels in whatever way best fits their needs. Customers may shop our products through one channel and consummate the purchase through a different channel. Our domestic customers have the option of returning merchandise to a store or to our distribution center, regardless of the channel used for purchase. We believe this omni-channel approach meets our customers&#8217; expectations, enhances the customer experience, contributes to the overall success of our brands, reflects that our customers do not differentiate between channels, and is consistent with how we plan and manage our business. As a result, we maintain a shared inventory platform for our operations, allowing us to fulfill orders for all channels from our distribution center in Winder, Georgia. We also fulfill in-store orders directly from other stores or our distribution center and offer domestic online and catalog customers the option of returning items to our stores. 

We seek to acquire and retain omni-channel customers by leveraging existing customer-specific data and through targeted marketing, including e-marketing, television, catalogs and mailers. We seek to optimize the potential of our brands with improved product offerings, which includes potential new merchandise opportunities and brand extensions that complement the current offerings, as well as our continued emphasis on our &#8220;Most Amazing Personal Service&#8221; standard. 

As part of our continuous efforts to improve our overall strategy while seeking to enhance and support our long-term growth, in 2014 we introduced capital allocation and cost reduction initiatives focused on advancing our omni-channel capabilities in order to improve the overall customer experience, reducing overall capital expenditures, re-balancing our store fleet, effectively managing other expenses and improving our inventory management. 

Our Customer Service Model 

Our customers deserve outstanding and personalized customer service, and we strive to achieve this through our trademark &#8220;Most Amazing Personal Service&#8221; standard. We believe this service model is one of our competitive advantages and a key to the success of our omni-channel approach. An important aspect of our successful implementation of this model involves the specialized training we give sales associates to help meet their customers&#8217; fashion and wardrobe needs, including clothing and accessory style, color selection, coordination of complete outfits, and suggestions on different ways in which to wear the clothing and accessories. Our sales associates are encouraged to develop long-term relationships with their customers, to know their customers&#8217; preferences, and to assist those customers in selecting merchandise best suited to their tastes and wardrobe needs. In 2015, the Chico's brand completed the roll-out of the &#8220;Client Book&#8221; program to all Chico&#8217;s store locations. Sales associates can use tablets in stores to access customer purchase history and style preferences as a clienteling tool that enhances her shopping experience in a personalized and efficient way. The program has been successful in reducing manual processes and streamlining customer/associate communication and service. 

We also serve our customers&#8217; needs and build customer loyalty through our customer rewards programs. Our programs are designed to reward our loyal customers and deliver an omni-channel shopping experience by leveraging the rich data our customers share with us to deliver a relevant and engaging experience with our brands. 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Chico&#8217;s . &#32;The &#8220;Passport&#8221; program is designed to encourage repeat sales and foster customer loyalty for the brand. A Chico&#8217;s customer can join the Passport program at no cost and receive additional benefits after spending a fixed amount. Features of the program include a 5% discount, exclusive offers, special promotions, free shipping, invitations to private sale events and advance notice regarding new arrivals. 

&#8226; 

WHBM . With &#8220;WHBM Rewards,&#8221; a customer can join at no cost for tier-based discounts, special promotions, a 5% discount, free shipping and invitations to private sales based on annual spend. These benefits will be continuously evaluated in conjunction with our overall customer relationship management and marketing activities to ensure they remain a compelling reason for customers to shop at the WHBM brand. 

&#8226; 

Soma. &#32;&#32; A Soma customer can join "Love Soma Rewards" at no cost and earns points based on purchases. Features of the program include reward coupons at specified loyalty point levels, exclusive promotions and free shipping. 

Our Boutiques and Outlet Stores 

Our boutiques are located in upscale outdoor shopping areas, indoor shopping malls, and standalone street-front locations. Boutique locations are determined on the basis of various factors, including, but not limited to: geographic and demographic characteristics of the market, nearby competitors, our own network of existing boutiques, the location of the shopping venue, including the site within the shopping center, proposed lease terms, anchor or other co-tenants, parking accommodations and convenience. Our merchandise is sold through franchise locations in Mexico, including boutique locations as well as shop-in-shop formats within a department store environment. 

Our outlet stores are located in quality outlet centers. The Chico&#8217;s and WHBM brand outlets contain a mixture of made-for-outlet and clearance merchandise. The made-for-outlet product carries a higher margin than the clearance items from our boutique stores. Soma outlets contain a mix of boutique and clearance merchandise. We also sell clearance merchandise on our websites. We regularly review the appropriate ratio of made-for-outlet and clearance merchandise sold at our outlets and will adjust that ratio as appropriate. 

As of January 30, 2016 , we operated 1,518 &#32;retail stores in 48 states, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and Canada. As of January 30, 2016 , our merchandise was also sold through 37 &#32;franchise locations in Mexico. The following tables set forth information concerning our retail stores during the past five fiscal years:

________________________ 

1 Our fiscal years end on the Saturday closest to January 30 and are designated by the calendar year in which the fiscal year commences. The periods presented in these financial statements are the fiscal years ended January 30, 2016 &#32;("fiscal 2015 ", " 2015 ", or "current period"), January 31, 2015 &#32;(&#8220;fiscal 2014 &#8221;, &#8220; 2014 &#8221;, or &#8220;prior period&#8221;), February 1, 2014 &#32;(&#8220;fiscal 2013 &#8221;, or &#8220; 2013 &#8221;), February 2, 2013 &#32;(&#8220;fiscal 2012 &#8221;, or &#8220; 2012 &#8221;), and January 28, 2012 &#32;(&#8220;fiscal 2011 &#8221;, or &#8220; 2011 &#8221;). Each of these periods had 52 weeks, except for fiscal 2012, which consisted of 53 weeks. 

In fiscal 2016 , we anticipate opening approximately 25 stores while closing 50 stores in our efforts to continue our capital allocation and cost reduction initiatives. We expect 21-25 net closures of Chico's stores, 10-14 net closures of WHBM stores, and 8-12 net openings of Soma stores. Our unaffiliated franchisee expects to continue opening franchise locations in Mexico, including Soma brand stores and shop-in-shops. 

Our Websites 

Each of our brands has its own dedicated website, www.chicos.com, www.whbm.com and www.soma.com, which provide customers the ability to browse our offerings, locate our stores, and order merchandise online. Our websites are designed to complement the in-store experience we deliver and play a vital role in our omni-channel strategy. Some items are only available online, such as extended size offerings, additional style and color choices, premier partner brands and clearance items. Online merchandise is also available through our call centers. We offer domestic online customers the option of returning items to our stores. 

We experienced a significant increase in mobile traffic in 2015 across all brands. We continue to focus on optimizing our websites so that they provide responsive design to optimize the customer experience regardless of what device she is using to browse and shop. For fiscal 2016 , we also will continue to focus on our omni-channel approach to retailing by enhancing all brand websites through new design, features, functionality and content to improve the customer's experience. 

In fall 2015, we successfully launched Inside Chic, our first blog for the Chico's brand, featuring original and curated content. Inside Chic provides our customer with a deepened connection to the aspirational lifestyle of our Chico's brand through elevated photography and storytelling. 

Our Catalogs 

We currently mail a Chico&#8217;s, WHBM and Soma catalog or mailer to current and prospective customers approximately every month. Catalogs are designed to educate our customers about our products, assist with new customer acquisition, drive customer traffic and promote sales. 

Marketing and Advertising 

Our marketing program currently consists of the following omni-channel components: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Loyalty and rewards programs; 

&#8226; 

Direct marketing activities: direct mail and localized direct mail and calling campaigns; 

&#8226; 

Digital marketing efforts: paid search, mobile, e-mail, banner marketing, affiliates and search engine optimization; 

&#8226; 

National and local print and broadcast advertising; 

&#8226; 

Social media marketing; 

&#8226; 

Editorial content; 

&#8226; 

Public relations; and 

&#8226; 

Charitable giving and outreach programs. 

Over the last few years, we expanded our digital marketing efforts for our brands. We made significant investments in paid search with major online search platforms, appeared on banner ads on various high-traffic websites and enhanced our online experiences through mobile optimization. We continue to optimize our marketing expenditures to parallel the shifts in customer traffic and consumers' consumption of media and content. 

Social media marketing is another strategy by which we can actively engage with current and prospective customers by offering them unique content including sneak peeks into new collections, style advice, exclusive video, customer service and other special promotions. We believe that there is significant opportunity to innovate and grow our social media marketing platform through organic and paid efforts across social platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube and Pinterest. 

Lastly, we place great value on customer outreach programs in the communities we serve. As part of these outreach programs, we encourage our managers and sales associates to become involved in community projects. We believe that these programs, in addition to helping build and support community and charitable activities, are also effective marketing vehicles in providing introductions to new customers. 

Information Technology 

We are committed to having information systems that enable us to obtain, analyze and act upon information on a timely basis and to maintain effective financial and operational controls. This effort includes testing of new products and applications so that we are able to take advantage of technological developments to support and enhance our processes across all areas of our business. 

During fiscal 2015, we invested in a new Point-of-Sale system, which was implemented across all brands. This new system is an integral part of our enhanced capabilities and will serve to improve the customer experience. 

Merchandise Distribution 

The distribution functions for all brands are handled from our Distribution Center (&#8220;DC&#8221;) in Winder, Georgia. New merchandise is generally received daily at the DC. Imported merchandise is shipped from the country of export by sea, air, truck or rail, as circumstances require. Domestic merchandise is shipped by truck or rail. All merchandise arrives at the DC by truck. After arrival, merchandise is sorted and packaged for shipment to individual stores or is held for future store replenishment or direct shipment to customers. Merchandise is generally pre-ticketed with price and related informational tags at the point of manufacture. 

Our DC has been granted Foreign Trade Zone status from the Department of Commerce and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. This status facilitates international expansion and allows us to move certain merchandise to the DC without paying U.S. Customs duty until the merchandise is shipped to domestic stores or online customers. 

Product Sourcing 

All of our brands purchase a significant percentage of their apparel and accessories from manufacturers in foreign countries. We may take ownership in the foreign country, at a designated point of entry into the United States, or at our DC, depending on the specific terms of the sale. Approximately 23% &#32;of total purchases in fiscal 2015 &#32;were made from one supplier, compared to 24% &#32;with the same supplier in fiscal 2014 . 

Most of our sourcing activities are performed by one shared service group. We believe that this single group, working in concert with our key supply chain partners, will deliver higher quality goods at a lower cost while providing the opportunity to lessen freight costs through consolidation. The decision to centralize our sourcing operations has helped us mitigate the impact of higher sourcing costs. 

For all of our brands, we regularly evaluate where to have our goods manufactured. Beginning in fiscal 2010, in response to decreased capacity and increased cost of labor in China, we began transitioning to suppliers located in other countries. In fiscal 2010, China sources accounted for approximately 63% of our merchandise cost, compared to approximately 54% &#32;for fiscal 2015 . Currently, we believe our product is appropriately distributed across countries of manufacture taking into consideration product quality execution, flexibility and speed at an acceptable cost and level of risk. 

Competition 

The women&#8217;s retail apparel and intimate apparel business is highly competitive and includes local, national and international department stores, specialty stores, boutique stores, catalog companies, and online retailers. We believe that our distinctively designed merchandise offerings and emphasis on customer service distinguish us. 

Trademarks and Service Marks 

We are the owner of certain registered and common law trademarks and service marks (collectively referred to as &#8220;Marks&#8221;). 

Our Marks include, but are not limited to: CHICO&#8217;S, PASSPORT, ZENERGY, SO SLIMMING, WHITE HOUSE BLACK MARKET, WORKKIT, WHBM REWARDS, SOMA, SOMA INTIMATES, VANISHING BACK, VANISHING EDGE, VANISHING TUMMY, OH MY GORGEOUS, PERFECT FORM and LOVE SOMA REWARDS. We have registered or are seeking to register a number of these Marks in the United States, Canada, Mexico and other foreign countries. 

In the opinion of management, our rights in the Marks are important to our business. Accordingly, we intend to maintain our Marks and the related registrations and applications. We are not aware of any claims of infringement or other challenges to our rights to use any registered Marks in the United States. 

Available Information 

Through our investor relations website, www.chicosfas.com, we make available free of charge our Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after those reports are electronically filed with the SEC and are available at www.sec.gov. This website also includes recent press releases, corporate governance information, beneficial ownership reports, institutional presentations, quarterly and institutional conference calls and other quarterly financial data, including historical store square footage.

Any amendments to or waivers from our Code of Ethics are also available on this website. Charters of each of the Audit Committee, Compensation and Benefits Committee, Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and Executive Committee as well as the Corporate Governance Guidelines, Insider Trading Policy, Terms of Commitment to Ethical Sourcing, and Stock Ownership Guidelines are available on this website or upon written request by any shareholder. 

Employees 

As of January 30, 2016 , we employed approximately 22,700 &#32;people, approximately 30% &#32;of whom were full-time employees and the balance of whom were part-time employees. The number of part-time employees fluctuates during peak selling periods. As of the above date, approximately 90% &#32;of our employees worked in our boutique and outlet stores. We have no collective bargaining agreements covering any of our employees, have never experienced any material labor disruption, and are unaware of any efforts or plans to organize our employees. We currently contribute a significant portion of the cost of medical, dental and life and disability insurance coverage for eligible employees. We also offer a qualified 401(k) retirement plan with an employer matching contribution percentage and an employee stock purchase plan to full time employees and to part-time employees working twenty hours or more, as well as a deferred compensation plan to highly compensated employees. All employees are also eligible to receive substantial discounts on our merchandise. We consider the overall relations with our employees to be good.
