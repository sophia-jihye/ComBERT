Business Segments 

NobelClad 

Clad metal plates are typically used in the construction of heavy, corrosion resistant pressure vessels and heat exchangers. Clad metal plates consist of a thin layer of an expensive, corrosion resistant cladder metal, such as titanium or stainless steel, which is metallurgically welded to a less expensive structural backing metal, such as carbon steel. For heavy equipment, clad plates generally provide an economical alternative to building the equipment solely of a corrosion resistant alloy. 

&#160; 

There are three major industrial clad plate manufacturing technologies: Explosion Welding, Hot Rollbonding and Weld Overlay. Explosion welding, the technology utilized by NobelClad, is the most versatile of the clad plate manufacturing methods. Created using a robust cold welding technology, explosion-welded clad products exhibit high bond strength and combine the corrosion resistance and mechanical properties of the cladder material with the structural strength and lower cost of the backer material. The explosion-welded clad process is suitable for joining virtually any combination of common engineering metals. This represents a competitive advantage versus the hot rollbonding and weld overlay processes, which generally can only clad compatible metals such as nickel alloys and stainless steels. 

Explosion-welded clad metal is produced as flat plates or concentric cylinders, which can be further formed and fabricated into a broad range of industrial processing equipment or specialized transition joints. When fabricated properly, the two metals will not come apart, as the bond zone is generally stronger than the parent metals. The dimensional capabilities of the process are broad: cladding metal layers can range from a few thousandths of an inch to several inches in thickness and base metal thickness and lateral dimensions are primarily limited only by the capabilities of the world&#8217;s metal production mills. Explosion welding is used to clad to steel a broad range of metals, including aluminum, titanium, zirconium, nickel alloys and stainless steels. 

&#160; 

Clad Metal End Use Markets 

&#160; 

Explosion-welded clad metal is primarily used in the construction of large industrial processing equipment that is subject to high pressures and temperatures and/or corrosive processes. Explosion welded clad plates also can be cut into transition joints, which are used to facilitate conventional welding of dissimilar metals. The eight broad industrial sectors discussed below comprise 

the bulk of demand for NobelClad&#8217;s products. This demand is driven by the underlying need for both new equipment and facility maintenance in these primary market sectors. 

Oil and Gas: &#32;Oil and gas end use markets include both oil and gas production and petroleum refining. Oil and gas production covers a broad scope of operations related to recovering oil and/or gas for subsequent processing in refineries. Clad metal is used in separators, glycol contactors, piping, heat exchangers and other related equipment. The increase in oil and gas production from deep, hot, and more corrosive fields has increased the demand for clad equipment. Many non-traditional energy production methods are potentially commercially viable for bringing natural gas to the market. Clad is commonly used in these facilities. The primary clad metals for this market are stainless steel and nickel alloys clad to steel, with some use of reactive metals, such as titanium and zirconium. 

Petroleum refining processes frequently are corrosive, hot, and operate at high pressures. Clad metal is extensively used in a broad range of equipment including desulfurization hydrotreaters, coke drums, distillation columns, separators and heat exchangers. In the United States, refinery capacity utilization is high; and adding capacity and reducing costly down-time are a high priority. The increasing reliance upon low quality, high sulfur crude further drives additional demand for new corrosion resistant equipment. Worldwide trends in regulatory control of sulfur emissions in gas, diesel and jet fuel are also increasing the need for clad equipment. Like the upstream oil and gas sector, the clad metals are primarily stainless steel and nickel alloys. 

Chemical and Petrochemical: &#32;Many common products, ranging from plastics to drugs to electronic materials, are produced by chemical processes. Because the production of these items often involves corrosive agents and is conducted under high pressures or temperatures, corrosion resistant equipment is needed. One of the larger applications for clad equipment is in the manufacture of Purified Terephthalic Acid (&#8220;PTA&#8221;), a precursor product for polyester, which is used in everything from carpets to plastic bottles. This market requires extensive use of stainless steel and nickel alloys, but also uses titanium and, to a lesser extent, zirconium and tantalum. 

Alternative Energy: &#32;Some alternative energy technologies involve conditions that necessitate clad metals. Solar panels predominantly incorporate high purity silicon. Processes for manufacturing high purity silicon utilize a broad range of highly corrosion resistant clad alloys. Many geothermal fields are corrosive, requiring high alloy clad separators to clean the hot steam. Cellulosic ethanol technologies may require corrosion resistant metals such as titanium and zirconium. 

Hydrometallurgy: &#32;The processes for production of nickel, gold, and copper involve acids, high pressures, and high temperatures; and titanium-clad plates are used extensively for construction of associated autoclaves and peripheral equipment. 

Aluminum Production: &#32;Aluminum is reduced from its oxide in large electric smelters called potlines. The electric current is carried via aluminum conductors. The electricity must be transmitted into steel components for the high temperature smelting operations. Aluminum cannot be welded to steel conventionally. Explosion-welded aluminum-steel transition joints provide an energy efficient and highly durable solution for making these connections. Modern potlines use a large number of transition joints, which are typically replaced after approximately five years in service. Although aluminum production is the major electrochemical application for NobelClad products, there are a number of other electrochemical applications including production of magnesium, chlorine and chlorate. 

Shipbuilding: &#32;The combined problems of corrosion and top-side weight drive demand for our aluminum-steel transition joints, which serve as the juncture between a ship's upper and lower structures. Top-side weight is often a significant problem with tall ships, including cruise ships, naval vessels, ferries and yachts. Use of aluminum in the upper structure and steel in the lower structure provides stability. Since aluminum cannot be welded directly to steel using traditional welding processes, and since bolted joints between aluminum and steel corrode quickly in seawater, explosion welded transition joints are a common solution. NobelClad's transition joints have been used in the construction of many well-known ships, including the Queen Elizabeth II and modern U.S. Navy aircraft carriers. 

Power Generation: &#32;Fossil fuel and nuclear power generation plants require extensive use of heat exchangers, many of which require corrosion resistant alloys to handle low quality cooling water. Our clad plates are used extensively for heat exchanger tubesheets. The largest clad tubesheets are used in the final low-pressure condensers. For most coastal and brackish water-cooled plants, titanium is the metal of choice, and titanium-clad tubesheets are the low-cost solution for power plant condensers. 

Industrial Refrigeration: &#32;Heat exchangers are a core component of refrigeration systems. When the cooling fluid is seawater, brackish, or even slightly polluted, corrosion resistant metals are necessary. Metal selection can range from stainless steel to copper alloy to titanium. Explosion-welded clad metal is often the low cost solution for making the tubesheets. Applications range from refrigeration chillers on fishing boats to massive air conditioning units for skyscrapers, airports, and deep underground mines. 

Operations 

The NobelClad segment seeks to build on its leadership position in its markets. During the three years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , the NobelClad segment represented approximately 54% , 48% &#32;and 59% &#32;of our consolidated net sales, respectively. The three manufacturing plants and their respective shooting sites in Pennsylvania, Germany and France provide the production capacity to address concurrent projects for NobelClad&#8217;s North American and international customer base. 

&#160; 

The principal product of metal cladding, regardless of the process used, is a metal plate composed of two or more dissimilar metals, usually a corrosion resistant metal, or "cladder," bonded to a steel backing plate. Prior to the explosion-welding process, the materials are inspected, the mating surfaces are ground, and the metal plates are assembled for cladding. The process involves placing a sheet of the cladder over a parallel plate of backer material and then covering the cladder with a layer of specifically formulated explosive powder. A small gap or &#8220;standoff space&#8221; is maintained between the cladder and backer using small metal spacers. The explosion is then initiated on one side of the cladder and travels across the surface of the cladder forcing it down onto the backer. The explosion happens in approximately one-thousandth of a second. The collision conditions cause a thin layer of the mating surfaces, as well as the spacers, to be spalled away in a jet. This action removes oxides and surface contaminants immediately ahead of the collision point. The extreme pressures force the two metal components together, creating a metallurgical bond between them. The explosion-welded clad process produces a strong, ductile, continuous metallurgical weld over the clad surface. After the explosion is completed, the resulting clad plates are flattened and cut, and then undergo testing and inspection to assure conformance with internationally accepted product specifications. 

EXPLOSION-WELDING PROCESS 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Explosion-welded cladding technology is a method for welding metals that cannot be joined using conventional welding processes, such as titanium-steel, aluminum-steel, and aluminum-copper. Explosion welding also can be used to weld compatible metals, such as stainless steels and nickel alloys to steel. The cladding metals are typically titanium, stainless steel, aluminum, copper alloys, nickel alloys, tantalum, and zirconium. The base metals are typically carbon steel, alloy steel, stainless steel and 

aluminum. Although the patents for the explosion-welded cladding process have expired, NobelClad has proprietary knowledge that distinguishes it from its competitors. The entire explosion-welding process involves significant precision in all stages, and any errors can be extremely costly as they often result in the discarding of the expensive raw material metals. NobelClad&#8217;s technological expertise is a significant advantage in preventing costly waste. 

NobelClad&#8217;s metal products are primarily produced for custom projects and conform to requirements set forth in customers&#8217; purchase orders. Upon receipt of an order, NobelClad obtains the component materials from a variety of sources based on quality, availability and cost and then produces the order in one of its three manufacturing plants. Final products are processed to meet contract specific requirements for product configuration and quality/inspection level. 

&#160; 

Suppliers and Raw Materials 

&#160; 

NobelClad's operations involve a range of alloys, steels and other materials, such as stainless steel, copper alloys, nickel alloys, titanium, zirconium, tantalum, aluminum and other metals. NobelClad sources its raw materials from a number of different producers and suppliers. It holds a limited metal inventory and purchases its raw materials based on contract specifications. Under most contracts, any raw material price increases are passed on to NobelClad&#8217;s customers. NobelClad closely monitors the quality of its supplies and inspects the type, dimensions, markings, and certification of all incoming metals to ensure that the materials will satisfy applicable construction codes. NobelClad also manufactures a majority of its own explosives from standard raw materials, thus achieving higher quality and lower cost. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Metal Cladding. NobelClad faces competition from two primary alternative cladding technologies: Hot-Rollbonding and Weld Overlay. Usually the three processes do not compete directly, as each has its own preferential domain of application relating to metal used and thicknesses required. However, due to specific project considerations such as technical specifications, price and delivery time, explosion-welding may have the opportunity to compete successfully against these technologies. Rollbond is only produced by a few steel mills in the world. In this process, the clad metal and base metal are bonded during the hot rolling operation in which the metal slab is converted to plate. Being a high temperature process, hot rollbond is limited to joining similar metals, such as stainless steel and nickel alloys to steel. Rollbond&#8217;s niche is production of large quantities of light to medium gauge clad plates; it is frequently lower cost than explosion clad when total metal thickness is under one to two inches (dependent upon alloy and a number of other factors). Rollbond products are generally suitable for most pressure vessel applications but have lower bond shear strength and may have inferior corrosion resistance. 

The weld overlay process, which is produced by the many vessel fabricators that are often also NobelClad customers, is a slow and labor-intensive process that requires a large amount of floor space for the equipment. In weld overlay cladding, the clad metal layer is deposited on the base metal using arc-welding type processes. Weld overlay is a cost-effective technology for complicated shapes, for field service jobs, and for production of heavy-wall pressure vessel reactors. During overlay welding, the cladding metal and base metal are melted together at their interface. The resulting dilution of the cladding metal chemistry may compromise corrosion performance and limit use in certain applications. Weld metal shrinkage during cooling potentially causes distortion when the base layer is thin; consequently, overlay is rarely the technically preferred solution for construction of new equipment when thicknesses are under three to four inches. As with rollbond, weld overlay is limited to metallurgically similar metals, primarily stainless steels and nickel alloys joined to steel. Weld overlay is typically performed in conventional metal fabrication shops. 

Explosion-Welded Metal Cladding. Competition in the explosion-welded clad metal business is fragmented. NobelClad holds a strong market position in the clad metal industry. It is the leading producer of explosion-welded clad products in North America, and has a strong position in Europe against smaller competitors. NobelClad&#8217;s main competitor in Asia is a division of Asahi Kasei, which has competitive technology and a recognized local brand name. There are several explosion-welded clad producers in Korea and China, most of which have been technically limited and have offered limited exports outside of their domestic markets. A number of additional small explosion-welding competitors operate throughout the world. To remain competitive, NobelClad intends to continue developing and providing technologically advanced manufacturing services, maintaining quality levels, offering flexible delivery schedules, delivering finished products on a reliable basis and competing favorably on the basis of price. 

&#160; 

Customer Profile 

&#160; 

NobelClad&#8217;s products are used in critical applications in a variety of industries, including upstream oil and gas, oil refinery, chemical and petrochemical, hydrometallurgy, aluminum production, shipbuilding, power generation, industrial refrigeration and other similar industries. NobelClad&#8217;s customers in these industries require metal products that can withstand exposure to corrosive 

materials, high temperatures and high pressures. NobelClad&#8217;s customers can be divided into three tiers: the product end users (e.g., operators of chemical processing plants), the engineering contractors that design and construct plants for end users, and the metal fabricators that manufacture the products or equipment that utilize NobelClad&#8217;s metal products. It is typically the fabricator that places the purchase order with NobelClad and pays the corresponding invoice. NobelClad has developed strong relationships over the years with the engineering contractors (relatively large companies) that sometimes act as prescriptor to fabricators. 

&#160; 

Marketing, Sales, Distribution 

&#160; 

NobelClad conducts its selling efforts by marketing its services to potential customers' senior management, direct sales personnel, program managers, and independent sales representatives. Prospective customers in specific industries are identified through networking in the industry, cooperative relationships with suppliers, public relations, customer references, inquiries from technical articles and seminars and trade shows. NobelClad&#8217;s sales office in the United States covers the Americas and East Asia. Its sales offices in Europe cover the full European continent, Africa, the Middle East, India, and Southeast Asia. NobelClad also has sales offices in South Korea and China to address these markets. These sales teams are further supported by local sales offices in the Middle East and India, with contract agents in most other developed countries, including Russia and Brazil. Contract agents typically work under multi-year agreements which are subject to sales performance as well as compliance with NobelClad quality and customer service expectations. Members of the global sales team may be called to work on projects located outside their usual territory. By maintaining relationships with its existing customers, developing new relationship with prospective customers, and educating all its customers as to the technical benefits of NobelClad&#8217;s products, NobelClad endeavors to have its products specified as early as possible in the design process. 

&#160; 

NobelClad&#8217;s sales are generally shipped from its manufacturing locations in the United States, Germany and France. Any shipping costs or duties for which NobelClad is responsible typically will be included in the price paid by the customer. Regardless of where the sale is booked (in Europe or the U.S.), NobelClad will produce it, capacity permitting, at the location closest to the delivery place. In the event that there is a short-term capacity issue, NobelClad produces the order at any of its production sites, prioritizing timing. The various production sites allow NobelClad to meet customer production needs in a timely manner. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

We prepare a formal research and development plan annually. It is implemented at our cladding sites in France, Germany, and the U.S. and is supervised by a Technical Committee that reviews progress quarterly and meets once a year to establish the plan for the following 12 months. The research and development projects concern process support, new products, and special customer-paid projects. 

DynaEnergetics 

DynaEnergetics manufactures, markets, and sells perforating explosives and associated hardware, as well as seismic explosives, for the international oil and gas industry. The oil and gas industry uses perforating products to punch holes in the casing or liner of wells to connect the well to the surrounding reservoir. During the drilling process, steel casing and cement are inserted into the well to isolate and support the wellbore. As part of the well completion process, the perforating guns, which contain a series of specialized shaped charges, are lowered into the well to the desired area of the targeted formation. Once fired, the shaped charges shoot a plasma jet through the casing and cement and into the formation. The resulting channels in the formation allow hydrocarbons to flow into the wellbore. 

DynaEnergetics manufactures and sells the five primary components of a perforating system, which are: 1) carrier tubes and charge tubes, 2) shaped charges, 3) detonating cord, 4) detonators, and 5) control panels. Additionally, DynaEnergetics manufactures and sells a factory-assembled, performance-assured well perforating system known as DynaStage, which incorporates the safety features of our advanced detonator technologies. 

PRIMARY COMPONENTS OF A PERFORATING GUN 

The perforating products manufactured by DynaEnergetics are essential to certain types of modern oil and gas recovery. These products are sold to large, mid-sized, and small oilfield service companies in the U.S., Europe, Canada, South America, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. DynaEnergetics also sells directly to end-users. The market for perforating products, which are used during the well completion process, generally corresponds with oil and gas exploration and production activity. Expanding exploration activity has led to increasingly complex well completion operations, which in turn, has increased the demand for high quality and technically advanced perforating products. 

Operations 

The DynaEnergetics segment seeks to build on its products and technologies, as well as its sales, supply chain and distribution network. During the three years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , the DynaEnergetics segment represented approximately 46% , 52% &#32;and 41% &#32;of our consolidated net sales, respectively. 

DynaEnergetics has been producing detonating cord and &#32; detonators and selling these and seismic explosives systems for decades. Since 1994 significant emphasis has been placed on enhancing its oilfield product offerings by improving existing products and adding new products through research and development, as well as acquisitions. In recent years, various types of detonating cord and detonators have been added as well as bi-directional boosters, a wide range of shaped charges, and corresponding gun systems. 

In recent years, DynaEnergetics has introduced a number of new technologies designed for safe and selective perforating. Our Intrinsically Safe Detonator Systems require a specific electronic code for firing and are immune to induced currents and 

voltages, static electricity and high-frequency irradiation. This eliminates the risk of oilfield accidents from unintentional firing. This safety feature enables concurrent perforating and fracturing processes at drilling sites with multiple wellbores, improving operating efficiencies for our customers. 

With selective technologies the operator can sequentially initiate multiple perforating guns in a single run, resulting in significant time and cost savings. DynaEnergetics&#8217; Selectronic Switches provide high reliability through a microprocessor based switch design. The Selectronic switch and software operate in conjunction with our Intrinsically Safe Detonators, Multitronic Firing Panels and a standard PC to enable up to 12 initiation devices per run. DynaEnergetics&#8217; Mulitronic Firing Panels are installed in our customer&#8217;s service fleet vehicles to control and sequence perforating operations. The control panels and switches provide uninterrupted communication with all detonators in the gun assembly and enable positive indication of gun firing along with selective control. 

Our DynaSelect products combine our Selectronic Switches and Intrinsically Safe Detonator technologies in a one-piece system for improved well site efficiency, reliability, simplicity and service quality. The fully integrated design incorporates advanced software controls and reduces the size of the detonator and switch assembly. DynaSelect reduces by 40% the number of electrical connections required within each perforating gun versus prior detonator models. This improves set-up times and reliability. The DynaSelect switch detonator is controlled by our Multronic IV Firing Panel. This system enables safe and reliable firing of up to 20 guns in a single run and incorporates a signal output function to monitor the movement and position of the tool string. 

Our DynaStage factory assembled perforating system combines preassembled perforating guns with our Multitronic V Firing Panel, Surface Tester, and intrinsically safe integrated switch-detonator. The Multitronic V Firing Panel is highly intuitive and allows the gun string to be safely tested and monitored throughout the pumpdown operation. Additionally, the Multitronic V also supports &#8220;shoot-on-the-fly&#8221; operation through an instant-fire capability. By safely checking perforating guns on the surface, the DynaStage Surface Tester greatly reduces the chance of lost time, mishaps, misruns and misfires due to a system fault. The Surface Tester is fully RP67 compliant and cannot initiate any type of detonator or explosive device. The patent-pending plug-n-go design of the wireless detonator reduces the potential for errors by eliminating the need for wiring and crimping. The fully integrated design of DynaStage allows users to minimizes uncertainty and operational risks, achieving industry-leading perforating performance. 

Our DynaSlot system is designed for well abandonment. During abandonment the wellbore is shut in and permanently sealed so that layers of sedimentary rock, and in particular freshwater aquifers, are pressure isolated. DynaSlot creates complete 360 degree access behind the tubing and casing, which is preferred for plug and abandonment cement squeeze operations. 

DynaEnergetics Tubing Conveyed Perforating, or TCP, systems are customized for individual customer needs and well applications. TCP enables perforating of more complex highly deviated and horizontal wells. These types of wells are being increasingly drilled by the industry. TCP tools also perforate long intervals in a single trip, which significantly improves rig efficiency. Our TCP tool range includes mechanical and hydraulic firing systems, gun releases, under-balancing devices and auxiliary components. Our tools are designed to withstand down hole temperatures of up to 260 degrees Celsius (500 degrees Fahrenheit), for safe and quick assembly at the well site, and to allow unrestricted total system length. 

DynaEnergetics&#8217;s manufacturing facilities are located in Germany, the United States and Russia. During 2013 DynaEnergetics completed a new shaped charge manufacturing facility in Blum, Texas and a perforating gun manufacturing facility in Tyumen, Siberia. The construction of the new shaped charge manufacturing facility in Tyumen, Siberia, was completed in 2015. In the first quarter of 2016, we received all the necessary permits to start production of charges, and the plant is scheduled to be fully operational in the second quarter of 2016. These investments have significantly expanded our global capacity for shaped charge and perforating gun production and improve our delivery and customer service capabilities. 

&#160; 

Suppliers and Raw Materials 

DynaEnergetics' product offering consists of complex components that require numerous high-end inputs. DynaEnergetics utilizes a variety of raw materials for the production of oilfield perforating and seismic products, including high-quality steel tubes, steel and copper, explosives (RDX, HMX, HNS), granulates, plastics and ancillary plastic product components. DynaEnergetics obtains its raw materials primarily from a number of different producers in Germany and other European countries, but also purchases materials from North American, Chinese and other international suppliers. 

Competition 

DynaEnergetics faces competition from independent producers of perforating products and from each of the industry's three largest oil and gas service companies, which produce most of their own shaped charges but also buy other perforating components and specialty products from independent suppliers such as DynaEnergetics. DynaEnergetics competes for sales primarily on customer service, product quality, reliability, safety, performance, price and, in North America, proximity of distribution centers to oilfield drilling activity. 

Customer Profile 

DynaEnergetics' perforating and seismic products are purchased by large, mid-sized and small oilfield service companies working in both onshore and offshore oil and gas fields. Our customers select perforating products based on their ability to address a broad spectrum of factors, including pressures and temperatures in the borehole and geological characteristics of the targeted formation. 

&#160; 

The customers for our oilfield products can be divided into four broad categories: purchasing centers of large service companies, service companies worldwide, oil companies with and without their own service companies, and local resellers. 

Marketing, Sales, Distribution 

DynaEnergetics&#8217; worldwide marketing and sales efforts for its oilfield and seismic products are based in Troisdorf, Germany, with regional sales headquarters in Austin, Texas for the Americas and Tyumen, Siberia for the Commonwealth of Independent States. DynaEnergetics&#8217; sales strategy focuses on direct selling, distribution through licensed distributors and independent sales representatives, the establishment of international distribution centers to better service our customers, and educating current and potential customers about our products and technologies.

DynaEnergetics serves the Americas region through its network of sales and distributions centers in the United States and Canada. 

DynaEnergetics also designs and manufactures custom-ordered perforating products for third-party customers according to their designs and specifications. 

Research and Development 

DynaEnergetics attaches great importance to its research and development capabilities and has devoted substantial resources to its R&#38;D programs. The R&#38;D staff works closely with sales and operations management teams to establish priorities and effectively manage individual projects. Through its ongoing involvement in oil and gas industry trade shows and conferences, DynaEnergetics has increased its profile in the oil and gas industry. An R&#38;D Plan, which focuses on new technology, products, process support and contracted projects, is prepared and reviewed at least annually. 

Corporate History and Recent Developments 

&#160; 

The genesis of the Company was an unincorporated business called &#8220;Explosive Fabricators,&#8221; which was formed in Colorado in 1965. The business was incorporated in Colorado in 1971 under the name &#8220;E. F. Industries, Inc.,&#8221; which was later changed to &#8220;Explosive Fabricators, Inc.&#8221; The Company became publicly traded in 1976. In 1994, it changed its name to &#8220;Dynamic Materials Corporation.&#8221; The Company reincorporated in Delaware in 1997. 

&#160; 

In 1976, the Company became a licensee of Detaclad&#174;, the explosion-welded clad process developed by DuPont in 1959. In 1996, the Company purchased the Detaclad&#174; operating business from Dupont. 

In 2001, the Company acquired substantially all of the stock of Nobelclad Europe SA, a French company (&#8220;Nobelclad France&#8221;). Early in its history, Nobelclad France was a licensee of the Detaclad&#174; technology. The acquisition of Nobelclad France expanded the Company&#8217;s explosive metalworking operations to Europe. 

&#160; 

In 2007, the Company acquired the German company DynaEnergetics GmbH and Co. KG (&#8220;DynaEnergetics&#8221;) and certain affiliates. DynaEnergetics was comprised of two primary businesses: explosive metalworking and oilfield products. This acquisition expanded the Company&#8217;s explosive metalworking operations in Europe and added a complimentary business segment, oilfield products. 

&#160; 

Over the next several years the Company further grew the DynaEnergetics business by acquiring additional related sales and manufacturing companies in Canada and the United States and purchased the outstanding minority-owned interests in its Russian joint ventures. 

&#160; 

In 2013, the Company branded its explosive metalworking operations under the single name NobelClad. The NobelClad segment is comprised of the Company&#8217;s U.S. Clad operations as well as the explosion metalworking assets and operations purchased in the Nobelclad France and DynaEnergetics acquisitions. In 2014, the Company re-branded the oilfield products segment as DynaEnergetics, which is comprised entirely of DynaEnergetics (other than its explosion metalworking operations), its subsidiaries and sister companies. 

In 2014, the Company sold its specialty welding business, AMK Technical Services ("AMK"), which was acquired in 1997 and in recent years contributed approximately 5% of the Company's consolidated annual revenue. Also in 2014, the Company acquired a modern manufacturing and office complex in Liebenscheid, Germany. The facility enhances NobelClad's manufacturing capabilities and serves as a state-of-the-art production and administrative resource for NobelClad's European operations. 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had 424 employees (195 U.S. and 229 non-U.S.), the majority of whom are engaged in manufacturing operations, with the remainder primarily in sales, marketing and administrative functions. Most of our manufacturing employees are not unionized. &#160; &#32;In addition, we use a number of temporary workers at any given time, depending on the workload. 

&#160; 

In the last three years, the Company has experienced two work stoppages, which lasted for three days in November 2014 and eight days in December 2014, at NobelClad's production facility in Rivesaltes, France. The stoppages related to a consolidation program of NobelClad's European explosion welding operations. A restructuring agreement with the labor union at Rivesaltes was reached in January 2015, at which point work was restarted. We currently believe that employee relations are good. 

&#160; 

Insurance 

&#160; 

Our operations expose us to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of a component that has been designed, manufactured, or serviced by us, or the irregularity or failure of products we have processed or distributed. We maintain liability insurance that we believe adequately protects us from potential product liability claims. 

&#160; 

Proprietary Knowledge, Permits and Patents 

&#160; 

Protection of Proprietary Information . We hold patents related to the business of explosive metalworking and metallic processes and also own certain registered trademarks, including Detaclad&#174;, Detacouple&#174;, EFTEK&#174;, ETJ 2000&#174; and NOBELCLAD&#174;. Although the patents for the explosion-welded cladding process have expired, our current product application patents expire on various dates through 2020. Since individual patents relate to specific product applications and not to core technology, we do not believe that such patents are material to our business, and the expiration of any single patent is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our operations. Much of the manufacturing expertise lies in the knowledge of the factors that affect the quality of the finished clad product, including the types of metals to be explosion-welded, the setting of the explosion, the composition of the explosive, and the preparation of the plates to be bonded. We have developed this specialized knowledge over our 40 years of experience in the explosive metalworking business. We are very careful in protecting our proprietary know-how and manufacturing expertise, and we have implemented measures and procedures to ensure that the information remains confidential. We hold various patents and licenses through our DynaEnergetics perforating business, but some of the patents are not yet registered. As with the explosive metalworking business segment, since individual patents relate to specific product applications and not to core technology, we do not believe that such patents are material to our business, and the expiration of any single patent is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our current operations. 

&#160; 

Permits . Explosive metalworking and the production of perforation products involve the use of explosives, making safety a critical factor in our operations. In addition, explosive metalworking and the production of oilfield products are highly regulated industries for which detailed permits are required. These permits require renewal every three or four years, depending on the permit. See Item 1A &#8212; Risk Factors &#8212; Risk Factors Related to the Dynamic Materials Corporation &#8212; We are subject to extensive government regulation and failure to comply could subject us to future liabilities and could adversely affect our ability to conduct or to expand our business &#32;for a more detailed discussion of these permits. 

Foreign and Domestic Operations and Export Sales 

&#160; 

All of our sales are shipped from our manufacturing facilities and distribution centers located in the United States, Germany, France, Canada, Russia and Kazakhstan. The following chart represents our net sales based on the geographic location to where we shipped the product, regardless of the country of the actual end user. NobelClad products are usually shipped to the fabricator before being passed on to the end user.
