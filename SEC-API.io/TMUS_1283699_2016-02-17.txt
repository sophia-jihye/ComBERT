 Item 1. Business 

Business Overview 

We are the Un-carrier&#8482;. Un-satisfied with the status quo. Un-afraid to innovate. T-Mobile is the fastest growing wireless company in the U.S. based on customer growth in 2015. T-Mobile provides wireless communications services, including voice, messaging and data, to over 63 million &#32;customers in the postpaid, prepaid and wholesale markets. The Un-carrier proposition is an approach that seeks to listen to the customer, address their pain points, bring innovation to the industry and improve the wireless experience for all. In practice, this means offering our customers a great service on a nationwide 4G Long-Term Evolution (&#8220;LTE&#8221;) network, offering devices when and how our customers want them, and providing plans that are simple, affordable and without unnecessary restrictions. Going forward, we will continue to listen and respond to our customers, refine and improve the Un-carrier proposition and deliver the best value experience in the industry. 

History 

T-Mobile USA, Inc. (&#8220;T-Mobile USA&#8221;) was formed in 1994 as VoiceStream Wireless PCS (&#8220;VoiceStream&#8221;), a subsidiary of Western Wireless Corporation (&#8220;Western Wireless&#8221;). VoiceStream was spun off from Western Wireless in 1999, acquired by Deutsche Telekom AG (&#8220;Deutsche Telekom&#8221;) in 2001 and renamed T-Mobile USA, Inc. in 2002. 

In 2013, T-Mobile US, Inc. was formed through the business combination between T-Mobile USA and MetroPCS Communications, Inc. (&#8220;MetroPCS&#8221;). The business combination was accounted for as a reverse acquisition with T-Mobile USA as the accounting acquirer. Accordingly, T-Mobile USA&#8217;s historical financial statements became the historical financial statements of the combined company. See Note 2 &#8211; Business Combination with MetroPCS &#32;of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements &#32;included in Part II, Item 8 &#32;of this Form 10-K &#32;for further information regarding the business combination. 

Our common stock traded on the New York Stock Exchange (&#8220;NYSE&#8221;) under the symbol &#8220;TMUS&#8221; from May 1, 2013, and our 5.50% mandatory convertible preferred stock, Series A (&#8220;preferred stock&#8221;) traded on the NYSE under the symbol &#8220;TMUSPRA&#8221; from December 17, 2014, until October 26, 2015. On October 27, 2015, we transferred the listing of our common stock and preferred stock to the NASDAQ Global Select Market of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (&#8220;NASDAQ&#8221;) under the symbols &#8220;TMUS&#8221; and &#8220;TMUSP,&#8221; respectively. 

Business Strategy 

We generate revenue by offering affordable wireless communication services to our postpaid, prepaid and wholesale customers, as well as a wide selection of wireless devices and accessories. Our most significant expenses are related to acquiring and retaining high-quality customers, providing a full range of devices, compensating employees, and operating and expanding our network. We provide service, devices and accessories across our flagship brands, T-Mobile and MetroPCS, through our owned and operated retail stores, third party distributors and our websites (www.T-Mobile.com and www.MetroPCS.com). The information on our websites is not part of this Form 10-K . 

We continue to aggressively pursue our strategy, which includes the following elements: 

Un-carrier Proposition 

We introduced our Un-carrier proposition in 2013 and continue to aggressively address customer pain points with the launch of different phases of the Un-carrier proposition. Un-carrier initiatives have included, but are not limited to, offering the following to qualifying customers: 

&#8226; 

providing customers with affordable rate plans while eliminating annual service contracts; 

&#8226; 

allowing customers easier options to upgrade their eligible devices when they want; 

&#8226; 

reimbursing customers&#8217; early termination fees or remaining phone payments when they switch from other carriers; 

&#8226; 

allowing customers to stream music without it counting against their high speed data allotment; 

&#8226; 

providing Wi-Fi calling and texting for customers with capable smartphones; 

&#8226; 

giving customers the ability to roll-over up to 20 GB of their unused high-speed data automatically each month; 

&#8226; 

providing reduced United States to international calling rates, and providing messaging and data roaming while traveling abroad at no extra charge; 

&#8226; 

extending coverage and calling, as well as 4G LTE data, across the U.S., Mexico and Canada at no extra charge; and 

&#8226; 

providing select video streaming services without it counting against their high speed data allotment on qualifying plans. 

Below is a summary of the phases and updates to our Un-carrier proposition: 

Customer Experience 

The ongoing success of our Un-carrier proposition and continued modernization of the network has strengthened T-Mobile&#8217;s position as a provider of dependable high-speed LTE service. Additionally, we have continued to focus on retaining customers by delivering an improved wireless customer experience. Branded postpaid phone churn improved to 1.39% &#32;in 2015 , compared to 1.58% &#32;in 2014 &#32;and 1.69% &#32;in 2013 . These results reinforce our position as an organization with a strong focus and commitment to providing an outstanding customer experience. 

Aligned Cost Structure 

We continue to pursue a low-cost business operating model to drive cost savings, which can then be reinvested in the business. These cost-reduction programs are on-going as we continue to simplify our business and drive operational efficiencies and cost savings in areas, such as network optimization, customer roaming and customer service. A portion of these savings have been, and will continue to be, reinvested into growth of our business. 

Customers 

T-Mobile provides wireless communication services to three primary categories of customers: branded postpaid, branded prepaid and wholesale. Branded postpaid customers generally include customers that are qualified to pay after using wireless communication services. Branded prepaid customers generally include customers who pay for wireless communication services in advance. Our branded prepaid customers include customers of the T-Mobile, MetroPCS and certain partner brands. Wholesale customers, which include Machine-to-Machine (&#8220;M2M&#8221;) and Mobile Virtual Network Operators (&#8220;MVNO&#8221;), operate on the T-Mobile network, but are managed by wholesale partners. 

We generate the majority of our service revenues by providing wireless communication services to branded postpaid customers. In 2015 , 66% &#32;of our service revenues were generated by providing wireless communication services to branded postpaid customers, compared to 30% &#32;from branded prepaid customers and 4% &#32;from wholesale customers, roaming and other services. Therefore, our ability to acquire and retain branded postpaid customers is important to our business in the generation of service revenues, equipment revenues and other revenues. Our branded postpaid net customer additions remained strong with 4.5 million &#32;in 2015 , compared to 4.9 million &#32;in 2014 &#32;and 2.0 million &#32;in 2013 . Growth in our branded postpaid net customer additions was primarily driven by strong customer response to our Un-carrier initiatives, ongoing improvements to our network and promotions for services and devices. 

Services and Products 

T-Mobile provides wireless communication services through a variety of service plan options. We also offer a wide selection of wireless devices, including smartphones, tablets and other mobile communication devices, which are manufactured by various suppliers. Services, devices and accessories are offered directly to consumers through our owned and operated retail stores, as 

well as through our websites. In addition, we sell devices and accessories to dealers and other third party distributors for resale through independent third-party retail outlets and a variety of third-party websites. 

Service plan options include our Simple Choice plans, which allow customers to subscribe for wireless services separately from the purchase of a handset. We introduced our Simple Choice plans as part of phase 1.0 of our Un-carrier proposition in 2013, which eliminated annual service contracts and simplified the lineup of consumer rate plans to one affordable plan for unlimited voice and messaging services with the option to add data services. Depending on their credit profile, customers are qualified either for postpaid or prepaid service. As part of the ongoing movement towards simplifying the business, we continued to drive the penetration of Simple Choice plans within our customer base. The proportion of branded postpaid customers on Simple Choice plans was 94% &#32;as of December 31, 2015 , up from 89% &#32;as of December 31, 2014 . 

Customers on our Simple Choice plans benefit from reduced monthly service charges and can choose whether to use their own compatible handset on our network, purchase a handset from us or one of our dealers or lease a device through our JUMP On Demand&#8482; program. Depending on their credit profile, qualifying customers who purchase a device from us have the option of financing all or a portion of the purchase price at the time of sale over an installment period using our Equipment Installment Plan (&#8220;EIP&#8221;). In addition, qualifying customers who finance their initial handset device with an EIP can enroll in JUMP! to later upgrade their device. Upon qualifying JUMP! program upgrades, the customers&#8217; remaining EIP balance is settled provided they trade in their used handset at the time of upgrade in good working condition and purchase a new handset from us on a new EIP. 

In 2015, we introduced JUMP! On Demand. With JUMP! On Demand, a low monthly payment covers the cost of leasing a new device and gives customers the freedom to swap it for a new one up to three times in 12 months for no extra fee. Upon device upgrade or at lease end, customers must return or purchase their device. 

Network 

We provide mobile communication services utilizing mid-band spectrum licenses, such as Advanced Wireless Services (&#8220;AWS&#8221;) and Personal Communications Service (&#8220;PCS&#8221;), and low-band spectrum licenses utilizing our 700 MHz A-Block spectrum. We owned an average of 85 &#32;MHz of spectrum across the top 25 markets in the U.S. as of December 31, 2015 . This is compared to an average of 82 &#32;MHz of spectrum across the top 25 markets in the U.S. as of December 31, 2014 . Over the last year, we have entered into various agreements for the acquisition of 700 MHz A-Block, AWS and PCS spectrum licenses. In addition, we intend to opportunistically acquire spectrum licenses in private party transactions and future Federal Communications Commission (&#8220;FCC&#8221;) spectrum license auctions, including the broadcast incentive auction of low-band 600 MHz spectrum licenses scheduled to occur in 2016. 

We have substantially completed the process of upgrading our network to LTE, which provides our customers with the fastest nationwide LTE services. Our LTE network now covers 305 million &#32;people, compared to 265 million &#32;people as of December 31, 2014 . In addition, we are currently in the process of building out our network to utilize our low-band 700 MHz A-Block spectrum licenses, which will boost network reach, improve in-building coverage and extend coverage to more areas. 

We are rapidly deploying both Wideband LTE to add capacity to our LTE Network and Extended Range LTE to enhance coverage and in-building performance. Extended Range LTE, which operates on our low-band 700 MHz A-Block spectrum, currently covers approximately 190 million &#32;people in more than 300 &#32;market areas. 

Our nationwide network covers all major metropolitan areas and approximately 91% &#32;of people in the U.S., excluding roaming coverage. Over the last three years, we have continued to build out our network to concentrate our cell sites where our customers need data most. We had approximately 64,000 &#32;cell sites, including macro sites and certain distributed antenna system (&#8220;DAS&#8221;) network nodes as of December 31, 2015 &#32;compared to approximately 61,000 &#32;cell sites as of December 31, 2014 . 

Below is a map showing our coverage, including LTE, in the U.S.: 

In addition, we have completed the shutdown of the MetroPCS Code Division Multiple Access (&#8220;CDMA&#8221;) network. The migration of customers from the MetroPCS CDMA network onto T-Mobile&#8217;s LTE and Evolved High Speed Packet Access Plus (&#8220;HSPA+&#8221;) network provides faster network performance for MetroPCS customers with compatible handsets. 

Distribution 

We had approximately 80,000 total points of distribution, including approximately 12,000 T-Mobile and MetroPCS branded locations and 68,000 third-party and national retailer locations, as well as distribution through our websites, as of December 31, 2015 . Our distribution density in major metropolitan areas provides customers with the convenience of having retail and service locations close to where they live and work. 

Competition 

The wireless telecommunications industry is highly competitive. We are the third largest provider of postpaid service plans and the largest provider of prepaid service plans in the U.S. as measured by customers. Our competitors include other national carriers, such as AT&#38;T Inc. (&#8220;AT&#38;T&#8221;), Verizon Communications, Inc. (&#8220;Verizon&#8221;) and Sprint Corporation (&#8220;Sprint&#8221;). AT&#38;T and Verizon are significantly larger than us and may enjoy greater resources and scale advantages as compared to us. In addition, our competitors include numerous smaller regional carriers and MVNOs, such as TracFone Wireless, Inc., many of which offer no-contract, prepaid service plans. Competitors also include providers who offer similar communication services, such as voice and messaging, using alternative technologies or services. Competitive factors within the wireless telecommunications industry include pricing, market saturation, service and product offerings, customer experience, network investment and quality, development and deployment of technologies, availability of additional spectrum licenses, and regulatory changes. Some competitors have shown a willingness to use aggressive pricing as a source of differentiation. Taken together, the competitive factors we face continue to put pressure on margins as companies compete to retain the current customer base and continue to add new customers. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we employed approximately 50,000 full-time and part-time employees, including network, retail, administrative and customer support functions, of which approximately 30 employees were covered by a collective bargaining agreement, as of December 31, 2015 . 

Regulation 

&#160; 

The FCC regulates many key aspects of our business, including licensing, construction, the operation and use of our network, modifications of our network, control and ownership of our business, the sale of certain business assets, domestic roaming arrangements and interconnection agreements, pursuant to its authority under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (&#8220;Communications Act&#8221;). The FCC has a number of complex requirements and proceedings that affect our operations and that could increase our costs or diminish our revenues. For example, the FCC has rules regarding provision of 911 and E-911 services, porting telephone numbers, interconnection, roaming, internet openness or net neutrality, and the universal service and Lifeline programs. Many of these and other issues are being considered in ongoing proceedings, and we cannot predict whether or how such actions will affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our ability to provide services and generate revenues could be harmed by adverse regulatory action or changes to existing laws and regulations. In addition, regulation of companies that offer competing services can impact our business indirectly. 

&#160; 

Wireless communications providers must be licensed by the FCC to provide communications services at specified spectrum frequencies within specified geographic areas and must comply with the rules and policies governing the use of the spectrum as adopted by the FCC. The FCC issues each license for a fixed period of time, typically 10 years in the case of cellular, PCS and point-to-point microwave licenses. AWS licenses have an initial term of 15 years, with successive 10-year terms thereafter. While the FCC has generally renewed licenses given to operating companies like us, the FCC has authority to both revoke a license for cause and to deny a license renewal if a renewal is not in the public interest. Furthermore, we could be subject to fines, forfeitures and other penalties for failure to comply with FCC regulations, even if any such non-compliance was unintentional. In extreme cases, penalties can include revocation of our licenses. The loss of any licenses, or any related fines or forfeitures, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

&#160; 

Additionally, Congress&#8217; and the FCC&#8217;s allocation of additional spectrum for broadband commercial mobile radio service (&#8220;CMRS&#8221;), which includes cellular, PCS and specialized mobile radio, could significantly increase competition. We cannot assess the impact that any developments that may occur in the U.S. economy or any future spectrum allocations by the FCC may have on license values. FCC spectrum auctions and other market developments may adversely affect the market value of our licenses in the future. A significant decline in the value of our licenses could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the FCC periodically reviews its policies on how to evaluate a carrier&#8217;s spectrum holdings. A change in these policies could affect spectrum resources and competition among us and other carriers. 

&#160; 

Congress and the FCC have imposed limitations on foreign ownership of CMRS licensees that exceed 20% direct ownership or 25% indirect ownership. The FCC has ruled that higher levels of indirect foreign ownership, even up to 100%, are presumptively consistent with the public interest albeit subject to review. Consistent with that established policy, the FCC has issued a declaratory ruling authorizing up to 100% ownership of our company by Deutsche Telekom. This declaratory ruling, and our licenses, are conditioned on Deutsche Telekom&#8217;s and the Company&#8217;s compliance with a network security agreement with the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Homeland Security. Failure to comply with the terms of this agreement could result in fines, injunctions and other penalties, including potential revocation of our spectrum licenses. 

&#160; 

While the Communications Act generally preempts state and local governments from regulating the entry of, or the rates charged by, wireless communication providers, certain state and local governments regulate other terms and conditions of wireless service, including billing, termination of service arrangements and the imposition of early termination fees, advertising, network outages, the use of handsets while driving, zoning and land use. Further, the FCC and the Federal Aviation Administration regulate the siting, lighting and construction of transmitter towers and antennae. Tower siting and construction are also subject to state and local zoning, as well as federal statutes regarding environmental and historic preservation. The future costs to comply with all relevant regulations are to some extent unknown and regulations could result in higher operating expenses in the future.
