 ITEM 1 &#8212; BUSINESS 

Overview 

EZCORP, Inc. is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Austin, Texas. We are a leading provider of pawn loans in the United States and Mexico with approximately 5,600 team members. 

Our vision is to be the market leader in North America in responsibly and respectfully meeting our customers&#8217; desire for access to cash when they want it. That vision is supported by four key imperatives: 

&#8226; 

Market Leading Customer Satisfaction; 

&#8226; 

Exceptional Staff Engagement; 

&#8226; 

Attractive Shareholder Returns; and 

&#8226; 

Most Efficient Provider of Cash. 

At our pawn stores ( 520 &#32;in the U.S. and 239 &#32;in Mexico), we offer pawn loans, which are non-recourse loans collateralized by tangible property, and we sell merchandise, primarily collateral forfeited from pawn lending operations and used merchandise purchased from customers. 

In addition to our core pawn business in the U.S. and Mexico, we operate 27 &#32;CASHMAX financial services locations in Canada and own 31% &#32;of Cash Converters International Limited (&#8220;Cash Converters International&#8221;), based in Australia, which franchises and operates a worldwide network of nearly 700 &#32;locations that provide financial services and also buy and sell second-hand goods. 

During fiscal 2016, we disposed of our 94% -owned subsidiary, Prestaciones Finmart, S.A.P.I. de C.V., SOFOM, E.N.R. ("Grupo Finmart"), and recast all results of its operations as discontinued operations. During fiscal 2015, we announced and implemented a plan to exit our U.S. Financial Services business (&#8220;USFS&#8221;), ceasing all payday, installment and auto title lending in the U.S and recast all results of USFS&#8217;s operations as discontinued operations. For additional information about our discontinued operations and restructuring plans, see Note 3 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in &#8220;Part II, Item 8 &#8212; Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#8221; 

Revenue and net revenue for fiscal 2016 from continuing operations was comprised of the following:

Pawn Activities 

At our pawn stores, we offer secured loans, which are typically small, non-recourse loans collateralized by tangible personal property. As of September 30, 2016 , we had a closing pawn loan principal balance of $167.3 million . We earn pawn service charge revenue on our pawn loans. In fiscal 2016 , pawn service charges accounted for approximately 36% &#32;of our total revenues and 61% &#32;of our net revenues. 

While allowable service charges vary by state and loan size, our United States pawn loans primarily earn 13% to 25% per month as permitted by applicable law, excluding forfeitures. The total United States pawn loan term generally ranges between 30 and 90 days. Individual loans vary depending on the valuation of each item pawned, but United States pawn loans made typically average approximately $100 to $120. 

In Mexico, pawn loans earn 15% to 21% per month as permitted by applicable law, excluding forfeitures. The Mexico pawn loan primary term is 30 days. Individual loans are made in Mexican pesos and vary depending on the valuation of each item pawned, but Mexico pawn loans typically average approximately 1,000 Mexican pesos, or approximately $56 using the average exchange rate for fiscal 2016 . 

Collateral for our pawn loans consists of tangible personal property, generally jewelry, consumer electronics, power tools, sporting goods and musical instruments. Security for our pawn loans is provided via the estimated resale value of the collateral and the perceived probability of the loan&#8217;s redemption. We generally lend from 40% to 70% of the collateral&#8217;s estimated resale value depending on an evaluation of these factors, and may additionally offer to purchase the product outright. 

If a customer chooses not to repay, renew or extend a loan, the collateral is forfeited and becomes inventory available for sale. We do not record loan losses or charge-offs of pawn loans because the principal amount of an unpaid loan becomes the inventory carrying cost of the forfeited collateral. If the subsequent sale of the forfeited collateral is less than the loan value, this is reflected in gross margin. 

The following table presents our pawn loan redemption rates by segment: &#160;

Our pawn loan redemption rate represents the percentage of loans made that are repaid, renewed or extended at a point in time as opposed to the life of the loan. 

Our ability to offer quality second-hand goods at prices significantly lower than original retail prices attracts value-conscious customers. The gross profit on sales of inventory depends primarily on our assessment of the loan or purchase value at the time the property is either accepted as loan collateral or purchased. As a significant portion of our inventory and sales in the U.S. involve gold and jewelry, our results can be heavily influenced by the market price of gold. 

Customers may purchase a product protection plan that allows them to return or exchange certain general merchandise (non-jewelry) sold through our retail pawn operations within three to six months of purchase. We also offer a jewelry VIP package, which guarantees customers a minimum future pawn loan amount on the item sold, allows them full credit if they trade in the item to purchase a more expensive piece of jewelry, and provides minor repair service on the item sold. Customers may also purchase an item on layaway by paying a minimum layaway deposit of typically 10% to 20% of the item&#8217;s sale price. We hold the item for a 60 to 180-day period, during which the customer is required to pay the balance of the sales price. 

Our inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market. We record a valuation allowance for obsolete or slow-moving inventory based on the type and age of merchandise. We generally establish a higher allowance percentage on general merchandise, as it is more susceptible to obsolescence, and establish a lower allowance percentage on jewelry, as it retains much greater commodity value. The total allowance was 4.2% &#32;of gross inventory as of September 30, 2016 &#32;compared to 5.4% &#32;as of September 30, 2015 &#32;due to the lower levels of aged inventory outstanding at the end of fiscal 2016 . Our reserve for estimated unrealized inventory shrinkage, included in the above allowance, was flat compared to the prior-year at 1.0% of gross inventory as of September 30, 2016 . 

Other 

We also operate financial services stores in Canada under the CASHMAX brand, all located in the Ontario province. These small footprint locations offer payday loan services. 

Operations 

Our pawn operations structure is built to provide the optimum level of support to the store team, providing coaching, mentoring and problem solving to identify opportunities to better serve our customers and position us to be the leader in customer service and satisfaction. 

Our asset protection and compliance departments monitor the inventory system, lending practices, regulatory compliance and compliance with our policies and procedures. We perform full physical audits of active inventory and pawn collateral at each store at least on an annual basis. Cycle counts are completed daily for jewelry and firearms, and targeted high risk inventory categories are cycle counted multiple times annually. We record shrink adjustments for known losses at the conclusion of the annual full physical audit and as estimates during interim periods, and as discovered during cycle counts. Asset protection monitors all shrink adjustments for exceptions. 

Our success is dependent upon our team members&#8217; ability to provide prompt and courteous customer service and to execute our operating procedures and standards. To achieve our long-range personnel goals, we offer a structured career development program for all of our field team members. This program includes computer-based training, formal structured classroom training and supervised on-the-job training. Generally, we expect that store team members, including managers, will meet certain competency criteria prior to hire or promotion and participate in on-going training classes and formal instructional programs. Our career development program develops and advances our employees and provides training for the efficient integration of experienced managers and team members from outside the company. 

Seasonality and Quarterly Results 

Historically, pawn service charges are highest in our fourth fiscal quarter (July through September) due to a higher average loan balance during the summer lending season. Merchandise sales are highest in the first and second fiscal quarters (October through March) due to the holiday season, jewelry sales surrounding Valentine&#8217;s Day and the availability of tax refunds in the United States. 

Growth and Expansion 

We plan to expand the number of locations we operate through opening new (&#8220;de novo&#8221;) locations and through acquisitions. We believe there are growth opportunities with de novo stores in Mexico and pawn store acquisitions in both Mexico and in the U.S. Our ability to add new stores is dependent on several variables, such as the availability of acceptable sites or acquisition candidates, the regulatory environment, local zoning ordinances, access to capital and the availability of qualified personnel. 

For information about our acquisitions, see Note 4 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in &#8220;Part II, Item 8 &#8212; Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#8221; 

Competition 

We encounter significant competition in connection with all of our activities. These competitive conditions may have an impact on our revenues, profitability and ability to expand. We compete with other pawn stores, credit service organizations, banks, credit unions and other financial institutions, such as consumer finance companies. We believe that the primary elements of competition are the quality of customer service and relationship management, convenience, store location and a customer friendly environment. In addition, we believe the ability to compete effectively will be based increasingly on strong general management, regional focus, automated management information systems, access to capital and superior customer service. 

Our competitors for merchandise sales include numerous retail and wholesale stores, such as jewelry stores, discount retail stores, consumer electronics stores, other pawn stores, other resale stores, electronic commerce retailers and auction sites. Competitive factors in our retail operations include the ability to provide the customer with a variety of merchandise at an exceptional value coupled with exceptional customer service and convenient locations. 

The pawn industry in the United States is large and highly fragmented. The industry consists of pawn stores owned primarily by independent operators who own one to three locations, and the industry is relatively mature. We are the second largest of two public operators of pawn stores in the United States. 

The pawn industry in Mexico is also fragmented, but less so than in the United States. The industry consists of pawn stores owned by independent operators and chains, including some not-for-profit organizations. The pawn industry, particularly full-line stores offering general merchandise and jewelry loans and resale, remains in an expansion stage in Mexico. 

Trademarks and Trade Names 

We operate our U.S. pawn stores principally under the names &#8220;EZPAWN&#8221; or &#8220;Value Pawn&#8221; and the Mexico pawn stores under the name &#8220;EMPE&#209;O F&#193;CIL.&#8221; Our financial services stores in Canada operate under the name &#8220;CASHMAX.&#8221; We have registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office the names EZPAWN and EZCORP, among others. We hold a trademark in Mexico for the name &#8220;EMPE&#209;O F&#193;CIL.&#8221; 

Regulation 

Compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations is an integral part of how we manage our business, and we conduct our business in material compliance with all of these rules. The following is a general description of significant regulations affecting our business. For a geographic breakdown of our operating locations, see &#8220;Part I, Item 2 &#8212; Properties.&#8221; 

U.S. Regulations 

Pawn Regulations &#8212; Our pawn stores are regulated by the states in which they are located and, in some cases, by individual municipalities or other local authorities. The applicable statutes, ordinances and regulations vary from location to location and typically impose licensing requirements for pawn stores or individual pawn store employees. Licensing requirements typically relate to financial responsibility and character, and may establish restrictions on where pawn stores can operate. Additional rules regulate various aspects of the day-to-day pawn operations, including the pawn service charges that a pawn store may charge, the maximum amount of a pawn loan, the minimum or maximum term of a pawn loan, the content and format of the pawn ticket and the length of time after a loan default that a pawn store must hold a pawned item before it can be offered for sale. Failure to observe applicable regulations could result in a revocation or suspension of pawn licenses, the imposition of fines or requirements to refund service charges and fees, and other civil or criminal penalties. We must also comply with various federal requirements regarding the disclosure of the annual percentage rate, finance charge, amount financed, total of payments and payment schedule related to each pawn loan transaction. Additional federal regulations applicable to our pawn lending business are described in &#8220;Other Regulations&#8221; below. 

A number of our pawn stores, voluntarily or pursuant to applicable laws, provide periodic (generally daily) reports to local law enforcement agencies. These reports provide local law enforcement with information about the items received from customers (whether through pawn or purchase), including a detailed description of the goods involved and the name and address of the customer. If we accept as collateral or purchase merchandise from a customer and it is determined that our customer was not the rightful owner, the merchandise is subject to recovery by the rightful owner and those losses are included in our shrinkage. Historically, we have not experienced a material number of claims of this nature. 

Some of our pawn stores in the U.S. handle firearms and each of those stores maintains a federal firearms license as required by federal law. The federal Gun Control Act of 1968 and regulations issued by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms also require each pawn store dealing in firearms to maintain a permanent written record of all receipts and dispositions of firearms. In addition, we must comply with the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which requires us to conduct a background check before releasing, selling or otherwise disposing of firearms. 

Other Regulations &#8212; &#32;Our pawn lending activities are subject to other state and federal statutes and regulations, including the following: 

&#8226; 

We are subject to the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and its underlying regulations, as well as various state laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security. Under these regulations, we are required to disclose to our customers our policies and practices relating to the protection and sharing of customers&#8217; nonpublic personal information. These regulations also require us to ensure that our systems are designed to protect the confidentiality of customers&#8217; nonpublic personal information, and many of these regulations dictate certain actions that we must take to notify customers if their personal information is disclosed in an unauthorized manner. We are subject to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which was enacted, in part, to address privacy concerns associated with the sharing of consumers&#8217; financial information and credit history contained in consumer credit reports and limits our ability to share certain consumer report information. We are subject to the Federal Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, which amended the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and requires us to adopt written guidance and procedures for detecting, preventing and mitigating identity theft, and to adopt various policies and procedures (including employee training) that address and aid in detecting and responding to suspicious activity or identify theft &#8220;red flags.&#8221; 

&#8226; 

Under the USA PATRIOT Act, we must maintain an anti-money laundering compliance program that includes the development of internal policies, procedures and controls; the designation of a compliance officer; an ongoing employee training program; and an independent audit function to test the program. 

&#8226; 

We are subject to the Bank Secrecy Act and its underlying regulations, which require us to report and maintain records of certain high-dollar transactions. In addition, federal laws and regulations prohibit us from doing business with terrorists and require us to report certain suspicious transactions to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the Treasury Department (&#8220;FinCen&#8221;). Generally, a transaction is considered to be suspicious if we know, suspect or have reason to suspect that the transaction (a) involves funds derived from illegal activity or is intended to hide or disguise such funds, (b) is designed to evade the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act or (c) appears to serve no legitimate business or lawful purpose. 

&#8226; 

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") was enacted for the purpose of making it unlawful for certain classes of persons and entities to make payments to foreign government officials to assist in obtaining or retaining business. Specifically, the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA prohibit the willful use of mail or any means of instrumentality of interstate commerce corruptly in furtherance of any offer, payment, promise to pay, or authorization of the payment of money or anything of value to any person, while knowing that all or a portion of such money or thing of value will be offered, given or promised, directly or indirectly, to a foreign official to influence the foreign official in his or her official capacity, induce the foreign official to do or omit to do an act in violation of his or her lawful duty, or to secure any improper advantage in order to assist in obtaining or retaining business for or with, or directing business to, any person. 

Mexico Pawn Regulations 

Federal Regulation &#8212; Federal law in Mexico provides for administrative regulation of the pawnshop industry by Procuradur&#237;a Federal del Consumidor (PROFECO), Mexico&#8217;s primary federal consumer protection agency. PROFECO regulates the form and terms of pawn loan contracts (but not interest or service charge rates) and defines certain operating standards and procedures for pawnshops, including retail operations, and establishes registration, disclosure, bonding and reporting requirements. There are significant fines and sanctions, including operating suspensions, for failure to comply with PROFECO&#8217;s rules and regulations. We believe that we comply with the rules and regulations, as currently administered, and believe that when fully implemented, the PROFECO registration requirements should have limited impact on our operations or profitability. 

PROFECO requires that we report certain transactions (or series of transactions) that exceed certain monetary limits. Anti-money laundering regulations restrict the use of cash in certain transactions. Relevant aspects of the law specifically affecting the pawn industry include monthly reporting on &#8220;vulnerable activities,&#8221; which includes certain high-value pawn and precious metal transactions. 

The Federal Personal Information Protection Law requires us to protect our customers&#8217; personal information. Specifically, the law requires us to inform customers if we share customer personal information with third parties and to post (both on-line and in-store) our privacy policy. 

State and Local Regulation &#8212; Our pawn business in Mexico is also subject to regulation at the state and local level through state laws and local zoning and permitting ordinances. For example, some states require permits for pawn stores to operate, certification of employees as trained in the valuation of merchandise, and strict customer identification controls. State and local agencies often have authority to suspend store operations pending resolution of actual or alleged regulatory, licensing and permitting issues. 

General Regulation &#8212; In addition to the above, our pawn business in Mexico is subject to various general business regulations in the areas of tax compliance, customs, consumer protections, money laundering, public safety and employment matters, among others, by various federal, state and local governmental agencies.
