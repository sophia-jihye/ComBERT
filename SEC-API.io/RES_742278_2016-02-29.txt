&#160;

Business Segments

&#160;

RPC&#8217;s service lines have been aggregated into two reportable oil and gas services business segments, Technical Services and Support Services, because of the similarities between the financial performance and approach to managing the service lines within each of the segments, as well as the economic and business conditions impacting their business activity levels.

&#160;

During 2015, less than one percent of RPC&#8217;s consolidated revenues were generated from offshore operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and in the Gulf of Alaska. We also estimate that 70 percent of our 2015 revenues were related to drilling and production activities for oil, and 30 percent were related to drilling and production activities for natural gas.

&#160;

Technical Services include RPC&#8217;s oil and gas service lines that utilize people and equipment to perform value-added completion, production and maintenance services directly to a customer&#8217;s well. The demand for these services is generally influenced by customers&#8217; decisions to invest capital toward initiating production in a new oil or natural gas well, improving production flows in an existing formation, or to address well control issues. This business segment consists primarily of pressure pumping, downhole tools, coiled tubing, snubbing, nitrogen, well control, wireline and fishing. The principal markets for this business segment include the United States, including the southwest, mid-continent, Gulf of Mexico, Rocky Mountain and Appalachian regions, and in selected international markets. Customers include major multi-national and independent oil and gas producers, and selected nationally owned oil companies.

&#160;

Support Services include RPC&#8217;s oil and gas service lines that primarily provide equipment for customer use or services to assist customer operations. The equipment and services include drill pipe and related tools, pipe handling, pipe inspection and storage services, and oilfield training and consulting services. The demand for these services tends to be influenced primarily by customer drilling-related activity levels. The principal markets for this segment include the United States, including the Gulf of Mexico, mid-continent, Rocky Mountain and Appalachian regions and project work in selected international locations in the last three years including primarily Canada, Latin America and the Middle East. Customers primarily include domestic operations of major multi-national and independent oil and gas producers, and selected nationally owned oil companies.

&#160;

Technical Services

&#160;

The following is a description of the primary service lines conducted within the Technical Services business segment:

&#160; 

Pressure Pumping . Pressure pumping services, which accounted for approximately 54 percent of 2015 revenues, 57 percent of 2014 revenues and 55 percent of 2013 revenues are provided to customers throughout Texas, and the Appalachian, mid-continent and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States. We primarily provide these services to customers in order to enhance the initial production of hydrocarbons in formations that have low permeability. Pressure pumping services involve using complex, truck or skid-mounted equipment designed and constructed for each specific pumping service offered. The mobility of this equipment permits pressure pumping services to be performed in varying geographic areas. Principal materials utilized in the pressure pumping business include fracturing proppants, acid and bulk chemical additives. Generally, these items are available from several suppliers, and the Company utilizes more than one supplier for each item. Pressure pumping services offered include:

&#160;

Fracturing &#8212; Fracturing services are performed to stimulate production of oil and natural gas by increasing the permeability of a formation. Fracturing is particularly important in shale formations, which have low permeability, and unconventional completion, because the formation containing hydrocarbons is not concentrated in one area and requires multiple fracturing operations. The fracturing process consists of pumping fluid gel and sometimes nitrogen into a cased well at sufficient pressure to fracture the formation at desired locations and depths. Sand, bauxite or synthetic proppant, which is often suspended in gel, is pumped into the fracture. When the pressure is released at the surface, the fluid gel returns to the well surface, but the proppant remains in the fracture, thus keeping it open so that oil and natural gas can flow through the fracture into the production tubing and ultimately the well surface. In some cases, fracturing is performed in formations with a high amount of carbonate rock by an acid solution pumped under pressure without a proppant or with small amounts of proppant.

&#160;

Acidizing &#8212; Acidizing services are also performed to stimulate production of oil and natural gas, but they are used in wells that have undergone formation damage due to the buildup of various materials that block the formation. Acidizing entails pumping large volumes of specially formulated acids into reservoirs to dissolve barriers and enlarge crevices in the formation, thereby eliminating obstacles to the flow of oil and natural gas. Acidizing services can also enhance production in limestone formations.

&#160; 

Downhole Tools . Thru Tubing Solutions (&#8220;TTS&#8221;) accounted for approximately 18 percent of 2015 revenues, 15 percent of 2014 revenues and 16 percent of 2013 revenues. TTS provides services and proprietary downhole motors, fishing tools and other specialized downhole tools and processes to operators and service companies in drilling and production operations, including casing perforation at the completion stage of an oil or gas well. The services that TTS provides are especially suited for unconventional drilling and completion activities. TTS&#8217; experience providing reliable tool services allows it to work in a pressurized environment with virtually any coiled tubing unit or snubbing unit.

&#160; 

&#160; 3&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Coiled Tubing . Coiled tubing services, which accounted for approximately nine percent of revenues in 2015, 2014 and 2013, involve the injection of coiled tubing into wells to perform various applications and functions for use principally in well-servicing operations and to facilitate completion of horizontal wells. Coiled tubing is a flexible steel pipe with a diameter of less than four inches manufactured in continuous lengths of thousands of feet and wound or coiled around a large reel. It can be inserted through existing production tubing and used to perform workovers without using a larger, more costly workover rig. Principal advantages of employing coiled tubing in a workover operation include: (i) not having to &#8220;shut-in&#8221; the well during such operations, (ii) the ability to reel continuous coiled tubing in and out of a well significantly faster than conventional pipe, (iii) the ability to direct fluids into a wellbore with more precision, and (iv) enhanced access to remote or offshore fields due to the smaller size and mobility of a coiled tubing unit compared to a workover rig. Increasingly, coiled tubing units are also used to support completion activities in directional and horizontal wells. Such completion activities usually require multiple entrances in a wellbore in order to complete multiple fractures in a pressure pumping operation. A coiled tubing unit can accomplish this type of operation because its flexibility allows it to be steered in a direction other than vertical, which is necessary in this type of wellbore. At the same time, the strength of the coiled tubing string allows various types of tools or motors to be conveyed into the well effectively. The uses for coiled tubing in directional and horizontal wells have been enhanced by improved fabrication techniques and higher-diameter coiled tubing which allows coiled tubing units to be used effectively over greater distances, thus allowing them to function in more of the completion activities currently taking place in the U.S. domestic market. There are several manufacturers of flexible steel pipe used in coiled tubing services, and the Company believes that its sources of supply are adequate.

&#160; 

Snubbing . Snubbing (also referred to as hydraulic workover services), which accounted for approximately three percent of revenues in 2015 and 2014 and four percent of revenues in 2013, involves using a hydraulic workover rig that permits an operator to repair damaged casing, production tubing and downhole production equipment in a high-pressure environment. A snubbing unit makes it possible to remove and replace downhole equipment while maintaining pressure on the well. Customers benefit because these operations can be performed without removing the pressure from the well, which stops production and can damage the formation, and because a snubbing rig can perform many applications at a lower cost than other alternatives. Because this service involves a very hazardous process that entails high risk, the snubbing segment of the oil and gas services industry is limited to a relative few operators who have the experience and knowledge required to perform such services safely and efficiently. Increasingly, snubbing units are used for unconventional completions at the outer reaches of long wellbores which cannot be serviced by coiled tubing because coiled tubing has a more limited range than drill pipe conveyed by a snubbing unit.

&#160; 

Nitrogen . Nitrogen accounted for approximately four percent of revenues in 2015, three percent of revenues in 2014 and four percent of revenues in 2013. There are a number of uses for nitrogen, an inert, non-combustible element, in providing services to oilfield customers and industrial users outside of the oilfield. For our oilfield customers, nitrogen can be used to clean drilling and production pipe and displace fluids in various drilling applications. Increasingly, it is used as a displacement medium to increase production in older wells in which production has depleted. It also can be used to create a fire-retardant environment in hazardous blowout situations and as a fracturing medium for our fracturing service line. In addition, nitrogen can be complementary to our snubbing and coiled tubing service lines, because it is a non-corrosive medium and is frequently injected into a well using coiled tubing. Nitrogen is complementary to our pressure pumping service line as well, because foam-based nitrogen stimulation is appropriate in certain sensitive formations in which the fluids used in fracturing or acidizing would damage a customer's well.

&#160;

For non-oilfield industrial users, nitrogen can be used to purge pipelines and create a non-combustible environment. RPC stores and transports nitrogen and has a number of pumping unit configurations that inject nitrogen in its various applications. Some of these pumping units are set up for use on offshore platforms or inland waters. RPC purchases its nitrogen in liquid form from several suppliers and believes that these sources of supply are adequate.

&#160; 

Well Control . Cudd Energy Services specializes in responding to and controlling oil and gas well emergencies, including blowouts and well fires, domestically and internationally. In connection with these services, Cudd Energy Services, along with Patterson Services, has the capacity to supply the equipment, expertise and personnel necessary to restore affected oil and gas wells to production. During the past several years, the Company has responded to numerous well control situations in the domestic U.S. oilfield and in various international locations.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s professional firefighting staff has many years of aggregate industry experience in responding to well fires and blowouts. This team of experts responds to well control situations where hydrocarbons are escaping from a wellbore, regardless of whether a fire has occurred. In the most critical situations, there are explosive fires, the destruction of drilling and production facilities, substantial environmental damage and the loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars per day in well operators&#8217; production revenue. Since these events ordinarily arise from equipment failures or human error, it is impossible to predict accurately the timing or scope of this work. Additionally, less critical events frequently occur in connection with the drilling of new wells in high-pressure reservoirs. In these situations, the Company is called upon to supervise and assist in the well control effort so that drilling operations can resume as promptly as safety permits.

&#160; 

&#160; 4&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Wireline Services . Wireline is classified into two types of services: slick or braided line and electric line. In both, a spooled wire is unwound and lowered into a well, conveying various types of tools or equipment. Slick or braided line services use a non-conductive line primarily for jarring objects into or out of a well, as in fishing or plug-setting operations. Electric line services lower an electrical conductor line into a well allowing the use of electrically-operated tools such as perforators, bridge plugs and logging tools. Wireline services can be an integral part of the plug and abandonment process, near the end of the life cycle of a well.

&#160; 

Fishing . Fishing involves the use of specialized tools and procedures to retrieve lost equipment from a well drilling operation and producing wells. It is a service required by oil and gas operators who have lost equipment in a well. Oil and natural gas production from an affected well typically declines until the lost equipment can be retrieved. In some cases, the Company creates customized tools to perform a fishing operation. The customized tools are maintained by the Company after the particular fishing job for future use if a similar need arises.

&#160;

Support Services

&#160;

The following is a description of the primary service lines conducted within the Support Services business segment:

&#160; 

Rental Tools . Rental tools accounted for approximately four percent of revenues in 2015, 2014 and 2013. The Company rents specialized equipment for use with onshore and offshore oil and gas well drilling, completion and workover activities. The drilling and subsequent operation of oil and gas wells generally require a variety of equipment. The equipment needed is in large part determined by the geological features of the production zone and the size of the well itself. As a result, operators and drilling contractors often find it more economical to supplement their tool and tubular assets with rental items instead of owning a complete set of assets. The Company&#8217;s facilities are strategically located to serve the major staging points for oil and gas activities in Texas, the Gulf of Mexico, mid-continent region, Appalachian region and the Rocky Mountains.

&#160;

Patterson Rental Tools offers a broad range of rental tools including:

&#160;

Blowout Preventors Diverters High Pressure Manifolds and Valves Drill Pipe Hevi-wate Drill Pipe Drill Collars Tubing Handling Tools Production Related Rental Tools Coflexip&#174; Hoses Pumps Wear Knot TM Drill Pipe &#160; 

Oilfield Pipe Inspection Services, Pipe Management and Pipe Storage. Pipe inspection services include Full Body Electromagnetic and Phased Array Ultrasonic inspection of pipe used in oil and gas wells. These services are provided at both the Company&#8217;s inspection facilities and at independent tubular mills in accordance with negotiated sales and/or service contracts. Our customers are major oil companies and steel mills, for which we provide in-house inspection services, inventory management and process control of tubing, casing and drill pipe. Our locations in Channelview, Texas and Morgan City, Louisiana are equipped with large capacity cranes, specially designed forklifts and a computerized inventory system to serve a variety of storage and handling services for both oilfield and non-oilfield customers.

&#160; 

Well Control School . Well Control School provides industry and government accredited training for the oil and gas industry both in the United States and in limited international locations. Well Control School provides training in various formats including conventional classroom training, interactive computer training including training delivered over the internet, and mobile simulator training.

&#160; 

Energy Personnel International . Energy Personnel International provides drilling and production engineers, well site supervisors, project management specialists, and workover and completion specialists on a consulting basis to the oil and gas industry to meet customers&#8217; needs for staff engineering and well site management.

&#160;

&#160;

Industry

&#160; 

United States . RPC provides its services to its domestic customers through a network of facilities strategically located to serve oil and gas drilling and production activities of its customers in Texas, the Gulf of Mexico, the mid-continent, the southwest, the Rocky Mountains and the Appalachian regions. Demand for RPC&#8217;s services in the U.S. tends to be extremely volatile and fluctuates with current and projected price levels of oil and natural gas and activity levels in the oil and gas industry. Customer activity levels are influenced by their decisions about capital investment toward the development and production of oil and gas reserves.

&#160;

&#160; 5&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Due to aging oilfields and lower-cost sources of oil internationally, the drilling rig count in the U.S. has declined by approximately 89 percent from its peak in 1981. However, due to continuously enhanced technology, more wells are drilled during periods of strong industry activity, and these wells are increasingly productive. For these reasons, the domestic production of natural gas rose to record levels in the third quarter of 2015, and domestic production of crude oil in the third quarter of 2015 reached its highest level since the third quarter of 1971. Domestic production of both natural gas and oil began to decline during the third and fourth quarters of 2015, however, due to the decline in domestic drilling and completion activities. Oil and gas industry activity levels have historically been volatile, experiencing multiple cycles, including down cycle troughs in 1986, 1992, 1999 (with April 1999 recording the lowest U.S. drilling rig count in the industry&#8217;s history), 2002 and again in 2009. The rig count during the peak of the most recent cycle occurred at the end of the third quarter of 2014, and began to decline sharply during the fourth quarter of 2014. The rig count continued to decline in 2015 and 2016. Early in 2016, the U.S. domestic drilling rig count had declined by approximately 73 percent from its most recent peak in 2014 and was only five percent higher than the April 1999 record low drilling rig count.

&#160;

The fluctuations in domestic drilling activity since the most recent peak in the third quarter of 2014 are consistent with global supply of and demand for oil, the domestic supply of and demand for natural gas, U.S. domestic storage levels of oil and natural gas, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar on world currency markets, and projected near-term economic growth. During 2015 the average price of natural gas decreased by approximately 39 percent compared to the prior year, but during the first quarter of 2016 stabilized at a price approximately equal to the average price in the fourth quarter of 2015. The average price of oil decreased by approximately 48 percent during 2015 compared to 2014. Early in the first quarter of 2016, the price of oil decreased by approximately 26 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. RPC believes that the decrease in the price of oil during this period has been caused by the actions of the OPEC cartel, increased supply from the domestic U.S. market, weak global demand, the strength of the U.S. dollar on global currency markets and high storage levels of oil. The precipitous decline in the price of oil that has taken place since the third quarter of 2014 has caused a significant decrease in oil-directed drilling activity. During this period the U.S. domestic oil-directed drilling rig count has fallen by approximately 70 percent. In addition to oil and natural gas, the price of natural gas liquids has become a determinant of our customers&#8217; activity levels, since it is produced in many of the shale resource plays which also produce oil, and production of various natural gas liquids has increased to a level comparable to that of natural gas. During 2015 the average price of natural gas liquids decreased by approximately 56 percent compared to 2014, and early in the first quarter of 2016 had declined by approximately 26 percent compared to the average price in 2015. The declines in the prices of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids during 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 to date carry significant negative implications for RPC&#8217;s customer activity levels over the near term.

&#160;

From 2001 to 2009, gas drilling rigs represented over 80 percent of the drilling rig count. In 2010, the percentage of drilling rigs drilling for natural gas began to decline, and by early in the first quarter of 2015 had fallen to approximately 18 percent of total drilling activity. In absolute terms, the natural gas drilling rig count early in the first quarter of 2016 was the lowest natural gas drilling rig count ever recorded. Although the demand for natural gas has remained stable, the price of natural gas has fallen in recent years due to increased domestic reserves, productivity of new wells, and high associated natural gas production from oil-directed wells. The price of natural gas has declined in 2015 and early in the first quarter of 2016, and has fallen to a level not observed since the fourth quarter of 1998. We have observed that these natural gas market dynamics discourage our customers from conducting natural gas-directed drilling activities. In spite of these unfavorable near-term dynamics, the long-term demand outlook for natural gas is still favorable because, unlike oil, foreign imports of natural gas do not compete with domestic production to a meaningful degree, and in the fourth quarter of 2015, the United States began to export natural gas for the first time. We anticipate that oil-directed drilling will continue to represent the majority of the total drilling rig count, in spite of the fact that the price of oil has declined tremendously from the third quarter of 2014 through the first quarter of 2016 to date. Over the long term, we believe that natural gas-directed drilling will increase due to the lack of natural gas production from oil-directed drilling and increased natural gas demand from U.S. exports of natural gas and changes in demand due to increased use of natural gas as a transportation fuel or for other purposes. We continue to believe in the long-term growth opportunities for our business due to the continued high demand for hydrocarbons generally and the growing production of oil in the domestic U.S. market in particular. Furthermore, we note that the techniques used to extract oil and natural gas in the U.S. domestic market increasingly require the types of services that RPC provides to its customers.

&#160;

There are certain types of wells being drilled in the U.S. domestic market for which there is a higher demand for RPC&#8217;s services. Known as either directional or horizontal wells, these wells are more difficult and costly to complete. They have become an increasingly large percentage of the U.S. domestic market, and since the third quarter of 2008, have consistently comprised the majority of U.S. domestic drilling. Because they are drilled through a typically narrow and relatively impermeable formation such as shale, they require additional stimulation when they are completed. Also, many of these formations require high pumping rates of stimulation fluids under high pressures, which in turn require a great deal of pressure pumping horsepower on location to complete the well. Furthermore, since they are not drilled in a straight vertical direction from the Earth&#8217;s surface, they require tools and drilling mechanisms that are flexible, rather than rigid, and can be steered once they are downhole. Specifically, these types of wells require RPC&#8217;s pressure pumping and coiled tubing services, as well as our downhole tools and services.

&#160; 

&#160; 6&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

International. RPC has historically operated in several countries outside of the United States, and international revenues accounted for approximately six percent of RPC&#8217;s consolidated revenues in 2015 and four percent in 2014 and 2013. RPC&#8217;s equipment investments over the last several years have emphasized domestic rather than international expansion because of higher domestic activity levels and expected financial returns. International revenues decreased primarily due to lower customer activity levels in Canada, Australia, Bolivia and Mexico in 2015 partially offset by increased activity in Argentina compared to the prior year. During 2015, RPC provided snubbing, well control and oilfield training services in several countries including Gabon and Australia. We also provided downhole motors and tools in Argentina, Canada, China and Oman, and rental tools in Equatorial Guinea. We continue to focus on the selected development of international opportunities in these and other markets, although we believe that it will continue to be less than ten percent of total revenues in 2016.

&#160;

RPC provides services to its international customers through branch locations or wholly owned foreign subsidiaries. The international market is prone to political uncertainties, including the risk of civil unrest and conflicts. However, due to the significant investment requirement and complexity of international projects, customers&#8217; drilling decisions relating to such projects tend to be evaluated and monitored with a longer-term perspective with regard to oil and natural gas pricing, and therefore have the potential to be more stable than most U.S. domestic operations. Additionally, the international market is dominated by major oil companies and national oil companies which tend to have different objectives and more operating stability than the typical independent oil and gas producer in the U.S. Predicting the timing and duration of contract work is not possible. Refer to Note 12 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our international operations.

&#160;

Growth Strategies

&#160;

RPC&#8217;s primary objective is to generate excellent long-term returns on investment through the effective and conservative management of its invested capital to generate strong cash flow. This objective continues to be pursued through strategic investments and opportunities designed to enhance the long-term value of RPC while improving market share, product offerings and the profitability of existing businesses. Growth strategies are focused on selected customers and markets in which we believe there exist opportunities for higher growth, customer and market penetration, or enhanced returns achieved through consolidations or through providing proprietary value-added products and services. RPC intends to focus on specific market segments in which it believes that it has a competitive advantage and on potential large customers who have a long-term need for our services in markets in which we operate.

&#160;

RPC seeks to expand its service capabilities through a combination of internal growth, acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic alliances. Historically, we have found that we generate higher financial returns from organic growth in service lines and geographical locations in which we have experience. Because of the fragmented nature of the oil and gas services industry, RPC believes a number of acquisition opportunities exist, and we frequently consider such opportunities. We have consummated relatively few acquisitions, however, due to high seller valuation expectations and the risk of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations. As the current industry downturn continues, we believe that many financial investors who have provided capital to smaller oilfield service companies in the past several years are seeking to liquidate their investments. This development, along with continued depressed financial results in our industry, may make valuations for acquisition targets more attractive. We will continue to consider the acquisitions of existing businesses but will also continue to maintain a conservative capital structure, which may limit our ability to consummate large transactions.

&#160;

RPC has a revolving credit facility to fund the purchase of revenue-producing equipment and other working capital requirements. In January 2014, this facility was extended for five years, and in November of 2015, RPC voluntarily reduced the borrowing capacity of the facility. We have pursued this capital source because of the high returns on investment that have been generated by many of our service lines during the previous several years, and because of the low cost and ready availability of debt capital. During 2014, we purchased additional revenue-producing equipment to support high industry activity levels. We took delivery of this equipment during the third and fourth quarters of 2014 and the first and second quarters of 2015. We had no outstanding balance on our credit facility at the end of 2015 due to a decrease in capital expenditures and working capital. Our capital structure is more conservative than that of many of our peers.

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160;

Demand for RPC&#8217;s services and products depends primarily upon the number of oil and natural gas wells being drilled, the depth and drilling conditions of such wells, the number of well completions and the level of production enhancement activity worldwide. RPC&#8217;s principal customers consist of major and independent oil and natural gas producing companies. During 2015, RPC provided oilfield services to several hundred customers. Of these customers, only one, Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) at approximately 23 percent of revenues, accounted for more than 10 percent of revenues. RPC believes that the relationship with this customer is good, but the loss of this customer could have a material adverse effect on Company revenues in the near term.

&#160;

&#160; 7&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Sales are generated by RPC&#8217;s sales force and through referrals from existing customers. Over the past three years we have from time to time entered into agreements, with terms beyond one year, to provide services to certain domestic customers. We monitor closely the financial condition of these customers, their capital expenditure plans, and other indications of their drilling and completion activities. Due to the short lead time between ordering services or equipment and providing services or delivering equipment, there is no significant sales backlog in most of our service lines.

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160;

RPC operates in highly competitive areas of the oilfield services industry. Our products and services are sold in highly competitive markets, and the revenues and earnings generated are affected by changes in prices for our services, fluctuations in the level of customer activity in major markets, general economic conditions and governmental regulation. RPC competes with many large and small oilfield industry competitors, including the largest integrated oilfield services companies. Strong oilfield activity during the past several years and the availability of capital have encouraged several new, smaller companies to seek debt and equity capital and accelerate their growth rates. The presence of these new competitors has increased competitive pricing pressures as domestic oilfield activity moderated during 2013, 2014 and 2015. Although the growth in the overall domestic fleet of revenue-producing equipment has moderated, pricing for our services remains competitive. RPC believes that the principal competitive factors in the market areas that it serves are product availability and quality of our equipment and raw materials used to provide our services, service quality, reputation for safety and technical proficiency, and price.

&#160;

The oil and gas services industry includes a small number of dominant global competitors including, among others, Halliburton Energy Services Group, a division of Halliburton Company, Baker Hughes and Schlumberger Ltd., and a significant number of locally oriented businesses.

&#160;

Facilities/Equipment

&#160;

RPC&#8217;s equipment consists primarily of oil and gas services equipment used either in servicing customer wells or provided on a rental basis for customer use. Substantially all of this equipment is Company owned. RPC purchases oilfield service equipment from a limited number of manufacturers. These manufacturers of our oilfield service equipment may not be able to meet our requests for timely delivery during periods of high demand which may result in delayed deliveries of equipment and higher prices for equipment.

&#160;

RPC both owns and leases regional and district facilities from which its oilfield services are provided to land-based and offshore customers. RPC&#8217;s principal executive offices in Atlanta, Georgia are leased. The Company has two primary administrative buildings, one it leases in The Woodlands, Texas that includes the Company&#8217;s operations, engineering, sales and marketing headquarters, and one it owns in Houma, Louisiana that includes certain administrative functions. RPC believes that its facilities are adequate for its current operations. For additional information with respect to RPC&#8217;s lease commitments, see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

&#160;

Governmental Regulation

&#160;

RPC&#8217;s business is affected by state, federal and foreign laws and other regulations relating to the oil and gas industry, as well as laws and regulations relating to worker safety and environmental protection. RPC cannot predict the level of enforcement of existing laws and regulations or how such laws and regulations may be interpreted by enforcement agencies or court rulings, whether additional laws and regulations will be adopted, or the effect such changes may have on it, its businesses or financial condition.

&#160;

In addition, our customers are affected by laws and regulations relating to the exploration for and production of natural resources such as oil and natural gas. These regulations are subject to change, and new regulations may curtail or eliminate our customers&#8217; activities in certain areas where we currently operate. We cannot determine the extent to which new legislation may impact our customers&#8217; activity levels, and ultimately, the demand for our services.

&#160;

Intellectual Property

&#160;

RPC uses several patented items in its operations, which management believes are important but are not indispensable to RPC&#8217;s success. Although RPC anticipates seeking patent protection when possible, it relies to a greater extent on the technical expertise and know-how of its personnel to maintain its competitive position.

&#160;

Availability of Filings

&#160;

RPC makes available, free of charge, on its website, www.rpc.net, its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports on the same day as they are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
