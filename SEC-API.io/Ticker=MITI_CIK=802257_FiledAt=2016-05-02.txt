 ITEM 1. BUSINESS &#160;

&#160;

Company Overview 

&#160; 

We are a development stage company that intends to acquire a series of businesses which specialize in compounding pharmacy activities, largely direct to consumers, doctors and veterinary professionals.

&#160;

Description of Pharmaceutical Compounding 

Today, the vast majority of medications are mass-produced by pharmaceutical drug companies. They aim to treat a specific medical condition for a large segment of people. Problems can arise when a patient has a medical condition that can&#8217;t be treated by one of these mass-produced products. Pharmaceutical compounding (done in compounding pharmacies) is the creation of a particular pharmaceutical product prescribed by doctors to fit the unique needs of a patient that can&#8217;t be met by commercially available drugs. To do this, compounding pharmacists combine or process appropriate ingredients using various tools. This may be done for medically necessary reasons, such as to change the form of the medication from a solid pill to a liquid, to avoid a non-essential ingredient that the patient is allergic to, or to obtain the exact dose(s) needed or deemed best of particular active pharmaceutical ingredient(s). It may also be done for more optional reasons, such as adding flavors to a medication or otherwise altering taste or texture. Examples of compounded formulations include medications with alternative dosage strengths or unique dosage forms, such as topical creams or gels, suspensions or solutions with more tolerable drug delivery vehicles. Compounding pharmacies (and pharmacists) adhere to standards and regulations set by the U.S. Pharmacopeia, National Association of Boards and State Boards of Pharmacy for quality assurance and accuracy. The compounding pharmacy business has the potential to provide high margins, and allow the pharmacy to specialize is certain solutions for specific maladies, so it can target specific markets efficiently.

&#160;

We intend to focus on the acquisition of compounders who have a) a large client base in the veterinary area, b) a strong set of proprietary compounding solutions, versus non-proprietary &#8220;over-the-counter&#8221; (OTC) medicine sales, and c) where the combination of incremental operations will allow cross selling of a growing line of proprietary compounds into the respective markets of each new market participant acquired.

&#160;

We expect economies of scale from the consolidation of:

&#9679; Materials procurement; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Compounding activities combined into larger, more efficient and higher quality facilities; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Expanded marketing nationwide with an emphasis on densely populated urban areas where an expanded product line may increase the profitability of each individual branch, when compared to pre-acquisition sales, and; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Consolidated administration and personnel functions. &#160;

Corporate History and Recent Developments 

&#160; 

True Nature Holding, Inc., previously known as Trunity Holdings, Inc., became a publicly-traded company through a reverse merger with Brain Tree International, Inc., a Utah corporation (&#8220;BTI&#8221;). BTI was incorporated on July 26, 1983 to specialize in the development of high technology products or applications including, but not limited to, electronics, computerized technology, new technological product fields, and precious metals. Trunity Holdings, Inc. was the parent company of the prior educational business, named Trunity, Inc., which was formed on July 28, 2009 through the acquisition of certain intellectual property by its three founders.

&#160;

On November 6, 2015 Newco4pharmacy, LLC (&#8220;N4P&#8221;), a Georgia limited liability company, was formed for the purpose of executing a business plan for the acquisition and integration of a network of compounding pharmacy businesses.

&#160;

During the fourth quarter of 2015 the Trunity Holdings, Inc. management and Board of Directors decided to implement a change in its business strategy. While it had achieved some modest success in the deployment of its educational software and systems, it had also consumed over $16 million in investments, and had over $4 million in debt, including debentures, trade payables, obligations for accused payroll and other expenses. It did not feel it could continue to operate with the expense associated with a publicly held company, and needed to reduce its expenses dramatically. After consulting with investment bankers, and evaluating alternatives, it announced a restructuring plan aimed at reducing its overhead, eliminating a substantial portion of its debt, and spinning out its educational business into a privately held company.

&#160;

4&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

On December 9, 2015, the Trunity Holdings, Inc. (&#8220;THI&#8221;) management and Board of Directors announced a series of steps aimed at restructuring the business. In the first step THI entered into a Securities Exchange Agreement (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;) with Newco4pharmacy, LLC (N4P). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, THI acquired 100% of the membership interests of N4P, a development stage business aimed at creating a nationwide network of compounding pharmacies. As part of the acquisition, certain assets and the business plan of N4P, including a letter of intent for a potential acquisition were acquired in exchange for newly authorized Series X preferred stock, which was subsequently exchanged on December 31, 2015 for 10,000,000 shares of common stock.

&#160;

Additional steps in the restructuring and recapitalization included a) a conversion of existing debt into equity, b) the conversion of the Series X Preferred stock issued to the members of Newco4pharmacy, LLC into 10,000,000 shares of common stock, a number equal to 85% of the shares outstanding after the recapitalization event, c) a spin out of the legacy educational business into a newly formed private company with the ownership pro-rata with the ownership of the Company as of December 18, 2015, d) a change in the equity structure that included a reverse split of 1 for 101, such that one hundred and one shares immediately before the split, is now one share, with any fractional shares rounded up to the nearest whole number of shares e) modifications to the Articles of Incorporation such that we now have 500,000,000 shares of common stock authorized and 100,000,000 of preferred stock authorized at a par value of $.01, and f) a change in the name to True Nature Holding, Inc. (there was no change in the stock symbol &#8220;TNTY&#8221;).

&#160;

On December 31, 2015, we completed the restructuring and spin-out of the educational business, Trunity, Inc. As a result of these actions, the Company at the time had 11,765,000 shares outstanding and no outstanding preferred stock. Within the ownership of the common stock, 1,765,000 represented 15% is owned by a combination of legacy shareholders and those who converted their debt into stock, including 203,293 shares issued to the Trunity, Inc. (&#8220;Spin-Out&#8221;) for future debt conversions, and to assist in capitalizing the Spin-Out entity at that time. The remaining 85% or 10,000,000 shares is owned by the former members of N4P. Further, all the shareholders of record as of December 18, 2015, received shares in the newly formed entity, Trunity, Inc., a Florida corporation, pro-rated to their ownership percentage as of that date. The former members of N4P did not participate in the allocation of shares in the spin out company. Upon effectiveness of these changes we have a new CUSIP number for the common stock (89786C 106).

&#160;

In conjunction with the restructuring a new privately held Florida &#8220;C&#8221; corporation named Trunity, Inc. was formed. Trunity Inc. now owns all of the stock of the former operating subsidiary of THI, all of the assets related to the educational business. As of December 31, 2015 there were 10,000,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized, of which none outstanding at this time. Of the 10,000,000, a total of 1,437,341 are being held in reserve for future conversions of debts assumed in the spin out, or for other uses as authorized by the Board of Directors of the Spin-Out entity to the best of management&#8217;s knowledge. The remaining shares of this entity are owned 100% by the shareholders of THI as of the record date of December 18, 2015. This entity also owns 253,691 shares of us, which was issued in order to allow the Spin-Out entity to use in debt conversions, and to capitalize the business so that it may increase its potential of success going forward. Its revenues are currently around $400,000 per year, and it intends to continue its mission to expand the user base for its educational software and systems business worldwide.

&#160;

As part of the restructuring and spin-out a substantial amount of the debts of THI, both at the public holding company level, and at the operating subsidiary was converted. Those debt holders who agreed to convert their debt at $.03 per share, pre-split, as of December 18, 2015, the record date, received shares in the Spin-Out entity, along with all other legacy shareholders of THI. There was total debt of over $4.1 million when the effort was begun, and over $2 million was converted for both the holding company and at the operating subsidiary level. A summary of the debt converted at the holding company level is below.

We issued shares in True Nature to the Spin-Out Company in a number equal to that which would have been issued had all debts of the operating subsidiary been converted into equity under the proposed debt conversion plan. This issuance of 203,293 shares were issued to a) satisfy other conversion of debt, or b) for any other general use as approved by the Board of Directors of the Spin-Out entity. It has also set aside 1,150,071 shares of Trunity, Inc. common stock for satisfaction of debts transferred in the spin out, a number equal to that which it would have issued had all debts be converted.

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we completed our restructuring, and are now moving forward with our plans to acquire series of businesses, generally in the compounding pharmacy area, and build a nationwide marketing and sales operation to expand the sales of the businesses it acquires.

&#160;

Acquisition of Compounding Pharmacy Businesses and Financin g 

In November 2015, N4P signed a non-binding letter of intent to acquire a compounding pharmacy business in Florida. That agreement was a part of the assets acquired by us when we acquired N4P in December 2015. During the month of December, while concluding our restructuring and the spin out of the legacy education business, management also took steps to move forward with its acquisition of that pharmacy business, and began discussions with two (2) additional operations in Florida and Georgia.

&#160;

On April 4, 2016 we entered into a non-binding letter of intent to acquire Integrity Compounding Pharmacy in Dunwoody, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta. The agreement calls for purchase consideration approximately equal to 12 months revenue, which is around $1 million. The payment will be split between the issuance of common stock valued at $500,000 a convertible note that may convert into stock at a price not less than $1.25 per share, and a short term note payable. The final allocation of each of these will be determined prior to closing, which is expected to occur in second quarter 2016. Mr. Casey Gaetano, age 29, Founder and CEO, will join the management team of True Nature at closing.

&#160;

We are seeking to build a network of compounding pharmacies with a high content of veterinary business, and high content of cash transactions, versus a model that relies exclusively on insurance reimbursements. We also entered into an investment banking agreement with Dawson James Securities, Inc., a boutique banking business with experience in the healthcare industry. We believe that though this relationship we will be able to fund the Company for at least the first three acquisitions, depending on the cash component of the consideration provided. Although there can be no assurance that any of these acquisitions will be consummated, we expect to complete the first three transactions in the second quarter of 2016, and expect to enter into as many as four (4) additional transactions during 2016, depending on the availability of suitable transactions.

&#160;

Change in Control 

&#160; 

With the issuance of the Series X Preferred stock issued to the members of Newco4pharmany, LLC in consideration of the acquisition in December 2015, there was a change in control . The terms of the Series X Preferred stock gave its holders voting control of 90% of the shares eligible to vote upon issuance. Subsequently, the Series X Preferred was converted into 10,000,000 shares of common stock after giving effect to the reverse split, or 85% of the shares outstanding after the reverse split. As of December 31, 2015, there were 11,765,000 shares outstanding, with 1,176,500 shares held by our legacy shareholders, with the balance held by the former members of N4P. As a result, the former members of N4P control 85% of the voting shares of the Company.

&#160;

6&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Amendment to Certificate of Incorporation 

As a part of our restructuring, the Board approved an amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the &#8220;Certificate Amendment&#8221;), which was further approved with a vote of 90% of the shareholders eligible to vote on this matter. The Certificate Amendment: (i) increased the number of authorized shares of our capital stock to Six Hundred Million (600,000,000), consisting of One Hundred Million (100,000,000) preferred shares, and the number of authorized shares of common stock to Five Hundred Million (500,000,000). Further, we changed our name from Trunity Holdings, Inc. to True Nature Holding, Inc. In addition, the Board approved and submitted to our stockholders a proposal to effect a reverse stock split of all of the outstanding shares of common stock (the &#8220;Reverse Stock Split&#8221;) at an exchange ratio of 1 to 101, such that all holders of 101 shares of common stock would have 1, with any fractional shares rounded up the next full number. These changes were approved by FINRA.

&#160;

Changes in Management and Board of Directors 

In conjunction with the acquisition of N4P, three new members to the Board of Directors were appointed, and to make room in the five (5) person Board, one of our legacy directors, Les Anderton resigned. Also, we changed our management team, with Ms. Nicole Fernandez- resigning as CEO of Trunity Holdings, Inc., and remained as CEO of the operating subsidiary through its spin out into the newly formed private company.

&#160;

Pursuant to the Securities Exchange Agreement, as of December 9, 2015 each of the following former members of the Board remained on the Board of Directors: Richard H. Davis, 58; and Ivan Berkowitz, 68. Pursuant to the Securities Exchange Agreement and as a result of Board action on December 9, 2015, the following individuals were appointed to the Board: Stephen Keaveney, 52, Jeff S. Cosman, 44; and William L. Ross, Ph.D., 70.

&#160;

On December 9, 2015, Stephen Keaveney, who was the Managing Member of N4P became the Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.

&#160;

On January 19, 2016, the Board, and with written approval of 75% of the shareholders eligible to vote on that date, reduced the number of Directors to three (3), and removed Richard Davis and Ivan Berkowitz from the Board. This change was fully contemplated in conjunction with the restructuring in December 2015, and upon completion of the spin out of the existing educational business on December 31, 2015.

&#160;

On April 11, 2016 the Board of Directors elected Mr. James Driscoll, age 54, to the Board of Directors. Mr. Driscoll is currently CEO of Channel Terminals, LLC, a crude oil liquids terminals and refinery based in Houston, TX. Mr. Driscoll is also a member of the Board of Directors at Double Zero Recycling LLC as well as an Advisory Board Member at HealPros LLC, a diabetic retinal imaging business, and Funding University LLC, an early stage online peer to peer lending business targeted on secondary education. Previously he was President of Method Holdings, LLC, from 2011 until late 2013. Between 2006 and 2011 Mr. Driscoll was a Senior Partner with private equity firm 1848 Capital Partners LLC. From 2009 to 2010 he was COO and Executive Vice President of CareDynamix LLC, a healthcare business focused on provision of onsite vaccination services around the US. 

&#160;

In addition, Mr. Driscoll, has over 14 years of experience at various senior positions in the power generation and transportation industries in varied locations around the world. He began his professional career as a trader in New York City. He has an MBA from Harvard University (1991) and a BA in English Literature from Bowdoin College (1984). Mr. Driscoll will receive 100,000 shares of restricted common stock as compensation for his term on the Board, consistent with all prior appointments by us.

&#160;

On April, 2016 Dr. William Ross, age 70, advised us that he desired to resign from the Board of Directors, as he intends to retire from all business activities. After electing Mr. Driscoll, the Board accepted Dr. Ross&#8217;s resignation, and thanks him for his service, and wishes him the best in his retirement. There were no disagreements, or conflicts with the Board and Dr. Ross.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Market Opportunity 

&#160; 

According to an industry report published by IBIS World, dated January 2015 there are over 5,500 compounding pharmaceutical groups in the U.S. with revenue of over $5.6 billion annually and profits exceeding $1.5 billion. Many of them are small, undercapitalized and without an exit strategy as their principals seek to retire and face potential challenges with changes in the regulatory requirements. While we do not currently have any acquisitions under a definitive contract, we have identified a number of prospects and expect to be able to close one, or more, acquisitions within six months. We intend to use equity to finance our initial transactions, and we have identified a number of institutional investors who have expressed interest in our approach. We expect to be able to use a combination of conventional debt, and equity in the Company, to raise the funds necessary to execute on the business plan with our first of two acquisitions during the second quarter of 2016. If we qualify, we would like to list the shares of the Company on the NASDAQ stock exchange, and create a market for the shares so that we can complete additional funding, pay off the debt we use to complete the initial acquisitions, and invest further in the businesses to achieve a greater size and scale.

&#160;

Executive Summary - Our Strategy 

&#160; 

Compounding pharmacies occupy a unique space in the pharmaceutic marketplace. They do not simply &#8220;fill&#8221; prescriptions, but rather has the capability to innovate, &#8220;invent&#8221; new applications of existing OTC medications, and even to reach down into the use of raw materials to compose new solutions. While most focus on medications unique to the needs in their local markets, some of those formulations could be applied regionally, and even nationally, with the right cost and distribution strategy.

&#160;

Our business plan is to enter the Compounding Pharmacy Industry via acquisitions of existing compounding pharmacies consolidating fragmented market. The key elements of our strategy include:

&#160;

a. We intend to grow regionally, building regional distribution centers, expand sales and marketing with an eventual long term objective to create a national presence; b. We intend to acquire multiple libraries of compounding formulations in the process, recognizing that: 

i. &#160; some are tailored for local needs; ii. &#160; some will have regional markets with expanded marketing; iii. &#160; some can become nationally accepted, and further &#8220;productized&#8221; solutions. 

c. In all cases, we intend to drive the costs down when compared to alternatives from &#8220;big pharma&#8221;; &#160;

The human market and the vet market are both large and growing, share many of the same solutions, and are in need of lower cost solutions. We will focus on a balance between legitimate insurance related revenue streams and cash pay business. We prefer businesses with a high content of cash business, and clients in the vet market, in general, but fully expect a mix of those businesses, along with more traditional providers serving humans, and using insurance reimbursement as a payment method.

&#160;

We believe the pharmacy industry, and especially compounding pharmacy, can easily be described as having multiple &#8220;flavors&#8221;. We believe the markets for both people and pets are both underserved:

&#160;

a. Some sell basic OTC medications and provide &#8220;delivery only&#8221;, and most users rely on insurance reimbursement for payment; b. Some are &#8220;value added resellers&#8221;, using OTC recognized medications, then repackaging, or using combinations, to personalize the product for the client. While vet based is a cash business, the human side is largely insurance reliant; c. Some are like &#8220;OEM manufacturers&#8221;, like a generic drug maker, starting with basic, non-productized materials, and creating both standard and fully customized &#8220;novel&#8221; formulations for specific maladies and needs. These are more often cash clients, and this approach is well accepted in the pet area, and becoming more accepted for people as alternatives to OTC, and for cash buyers seeking lower cost; d. We believe a mix of these can serve the need to drive costs down, and allow innovative approaches to improve patient results. &#160;

The pet business is an area of focus. A recent research document, Research from Federal Trade Commission: Pet Medications, May 2015, (which can be found on our web site at: http://truenaturepharma.com/links/) noted the following:

&#160;

a. According to one estimate, in 2014 veterinarians accounted for 58 percent of sales of pet medications, with brick and mortar retailers accounting for 28 percent and Internet/mail order retailers accounting for 13 percent; b. Approximately 65 percent of U.S. households own pets, the most common being dogs and cats, which equates to 79.7 million homes; &#160;

8&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

c. In 2014, Americans spent approximately $58 billion on their pets, including food, supplies, veterinary care, prescription and over the counter medication and other pet services and products. This figure represents tremendous growth since 2001, when comparable expenditures totaled $28.5 billion; d. In 2013, retail sales of prescription and non-prescription medications for dogs and cats was estimated at $7.6 billion. U.S. retail sales of companion animal pet medications are expected to grow to $10.2 billion by 2018, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of circa 5 percent; e. U.S. manufacturer sales of companion animal pet medications have been estimated at $3.7 billion to $4 billion annually. &#160;

Industry Overview 

&#160;

The following information was taken from this report on the Compounding Industry: IBISWorld Industry Report OD5706 Compounding Pharmacies in the U.S., dated January 2015 by Sarah Turk. . A copy of this report is available for download from our web site at: http://truenaturepharma.com/links/.

&#160;

Industry Definition 

This industry includes stores that make and sell compounded medications that are not commercially available. Compounded medications are prescriptions that are prescribed and written by physicians and prepared by pharmacists for individual patients.

&#160; 

Executive Summary 

Despite the Compounding Pharmacies industry experiencing negative media attention from contaminated compounded prescriptions, it has still proved to be a business with a loyal customer base. Compounded medications can assist patients&#8217; compliance with their medication due to offering medication tastes, routes of administration, and medication dosages that were not otherwise commercially available. Moreover, the burgeoning elderly population has stimulated demand for prescriptions, including compounded medications that were customized to address a patient&#8217;s needs. From October to September 2012, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspected approximately 150 compounding pharmacies, with 90.0% of facilities inspected having problems. As a result, some industry operators have exited the industry altogether or have contended with costs related to complying with FDA standards. The industry has benefited from pharmaceutical manufacturers having drug shortages, enabling the industry to access raw materials and supply medication orders to patients and hospitals. As group purchasing organizations (GPOs), which secure supplies for healthcare providers, control about 72.0% of purchases made by hospitals, according to the Healthcare Supply Chain Association, drug shortages have occurred. Due to GPOs using their market share as leverage to secure low-cost contracts with pharmaceutical manufacturers, some drug makers did not have the incentive to manufacture and stock essential drugs.

&#160;

As a result, industry revenue is expected to grow at an annualized rate of 2.4% to $5.6 billion during the five years to 2015, including 7.3% growth in 2015. This growth has been driven by the number of active drug shortages increasing from 328 in 2010 to 361 in 2013, according to the latest data available from the United States Government Accountability Office. Profit is anticipated to rise from 25.7% of industry revenue in 2010 to 26.5% in 2015, due to the prescription shortage and lack of substitutes for industry products enabling the industry to garner higher prices. During the five years to 2020, industry revenue is forecast to grow at an annualized rate of 2.6% to $6.4 billion. As the number of physician visits is expected to rise, more individuals will likely be prescribed medications, which may stimulate demand for compounded pharmaceuticals. Overall, the size of this growth will be contingent on how many patients require medications with alternative dosages and strengths.

&#160;

Key External Drivers 

Number of pets (cats and dogs): In addition to developing drug compounds for humans, compounding pharmacies also create specialized drugs compounded for animals. As the number of pets increases, demand for compounding pharmacies rises, as many pet owners will purchase compounded medications to increase animal compliance with alternative routes of administration.

&#160;

Regulation 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is encouraging large-scale operators to register with the FDA and is increasing federal regulations. As healthcare providers are increasingly purchasing compounded medications from FDA-registered and regulated facilities, many operators will choose to comply with regulations to bolster revenue volumes. Regulation is expected to increase in 2015, which represents a potential threat to the industry.

&#160; 

9&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Current Performance 

During the past five years, the Compounding Pharmacies industry has exhibited growth, thanks to an increase in the number of dispensed prescriptions. As the burgeoning elderly population has dealt with a number of chronic illnesses that require medication, demand for compounded pharmaceuticals has risen. For example, patients have used compounded prescriptions to access medications in alternative dosages, routes of administration, ingredients (due to patient allergies) and flavorings than drugs that were commercially available. Moreover, the shortage or termination of prescriptions from drug manufacturers&#8217; product portfolio has stimulated demand for compounded prescriptions. In the five years to 2015, industry revenue is anticipated to increase at an annualized rate of 2.4% to $5.6 billion, including 7.3% growth in 2015, due to a rise in the number of prescription shortages. For example, according to data from the United States Government Accountability Office, the number of active drug shortages has increased from 328 in 2010 to 361 in 2013 (latest data available), which has benefited some compounding pharmacies because they were able to supply drugs to hospitals and patients that may have otherwise come from another source. Profit is expected to increase from 25.7% of industry revenue in 2010 to 26.5% in 2015, due to the prescription shortage enabling operators to mark up industry product prices.

&#160;

Growing Opportunity 

Nevertheless, the burgeoning elderly population has provided a driver for the industry. The number of adults aged 65 and older is expected to grow at an annualized rate of 3.4% during the five years to 2020. More elderly patients have visited their physician, which has stimulated demand for prescriptions. Because the burgeoning elderly population has required more prescriptions to address their numerous chronic illnesses, demand for compounded pharmaceuticals has grown. For example, as the number of stroke patients rose, so did the prevalence of dysphagia, or a patient&#8217;s inability to swallow. As a result of this trend, demand for compounded medications with alternative routes of administration increased. Additionally, the industry also provides compounded medications for pets. The number of pet owners is expected to grow at an annualized rate of 2.3% during the five years to 2020. Because of this growth, more pet owners will be required to obtain compounded drugs to increase their pet&#8217;s compliance with medications. For example, pet owners may demand compounded drugs to cater to their pets&#8217; individualized needs, such as allergies and complications with the drug&#8217;s route of administration.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160; 

The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive. There are competitors in the United States that are currently selling FDA- approved products that our products would compete with if and when approved by the FDA.

&#160;

In addition to product safety, development and efficacy, other competitive factors in the pharmaceutical market include product quality and price, reputation, service and access to scientific and technical information. It is possible that developments by our competitors will make our products or technologies uncompetitive or obsolete. In addition, the intensely competitive environment of the pain management products requires an ongoing, extensive search for medical and technological innovations and the ability to market products effectively, including the ability to communicate the effectiveness, safety and value of branded products for their intended uses to healthcare professionals in private practice, group practices and managed care organizations. Because we are smaller than our competitors, we may lack the financial and other resources needed to develop, produce, distribute, market and commercialize any of our drug candidates or compete for market share in the pain management sector.

Governmental Regulation 

&#160; 

FDA Regulation and Approval 

Our business is subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations, and administrative practices, including, among others: federal, state and local licensure and registration requirements concerning the operation of pharmacies and the practice of pharmacy; the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA); the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2012 (collectively, the Health Reform Law); statutes and regulations of the FDA, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as regulations promulgated by comparable state agencies concerning the sale, advertisement and promotion of the products we sell. Below are descriptions of some of the various federal and state laws and regulations which may govern or impact our current and planned operations.

&#160;

10&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Our ongoing product development activities are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation at both the federal and state levels. Post development, the manufacture, testing, packaging, labeling, distribution, sales and marketing of our products is also subject to extensive regulation. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1983, as amended, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern or influence the testing, manufacture, safety, packaging, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products. Noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in fines, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production and/or distribution, refusal of the government to approve New Drug Applications, or NDAs, civil sanctions and criminal prosecution.

&#160;

FDA approval is typically required before each dosage form or strength of any new drug can be marketed. Applications for FDA approval must contain information relating to efficacy, safety, toxicity, pharmacokinetics, product formulation, raw material suppliers, stability, manufacturing processes, packaging, labeling, and quality control. The FDA also has the authority to revoke previously granted drug approvals. Product development and approval within this regulatory framework requires a number of years and involves the expenditure of substantial resources.

&#160;

Current FDA standards for approving new pharmaceutical products are more stringent than those that were applied in the past. As a result, labeling revisions, formulation or manufacturing changes and/or product modifications may be necessary. We cannot determine what effect changes in regulations or legal interpretations, when and if promulgated, may have on our business in the future. Changes could, among other things, require expanded or different labeling, the recall or discontinuance of certain products, additional record keeping and expanded documentation of the properties of certain products and scientific substantiation. Such regulatory changes, or new legislation, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The evolving and complex nature of regulatory requirements, the broad authority and discretion of the FDA and the generally high level of regulatory oversight results in a continuing possibility that from time to time, we will be adversely affected by regulatory actions despite ongoing efforts and commitment to achieve and maintain full compliance with all regulatory requirements.

&#160;

Quality Assurance Requirements 

The FDA enforces regulations to ensure that the methods used in, and facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, packing and holding of drugs conform to current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP. The cGMP regulations the FDA enforces are comprehensive and cover all aspects of operations, from receipt of raw materials to finished product distribution, insofar as they bear upon whether drugs meet all the identity, strength, quality, purity and safety characteristics required of them. To assure compliance requires a continuous commitment of time, money and effort in all operational areas. 

&#160;

The FDA conducts pre-approval inspections of facilities engaged in the development, manufacture, processing, packing, testing and holding of the drugs subject to NDAs. If the FDA concludes that the facilities to be used do not meet cGMP, good laboratory practices or good clinical practices requirements, it will not approve the NDA. Corrective actions to remedy the deficiencies must be performed and verified in a subsequent inspection. In addition, manufacturers of both pharmaceutical products and active pharmaceutical ingredients used to formulate the drug also ordinarily undergo a pre-approval inspection, although the inspection can be waived when the manufacturer has had a passing cGMP inspection in the immediate past. Failure of any facility to pass a pre-approval inspection will result in delayed approval and would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

&#160;

The FDA also conducts periodic inspections of facilities to assess their cGMP status. If the FDA were to find serious cGMP non-compliance during such an inspection, it could take regulatory actions that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The FDA could initiate product seizures, request product recalls and seek to enjoin a product&#8217;s manufacture and distribution. In certain circumstances, violations could lead to civil penalties and criminal prosecutions. In addition, if the FDA concludes that a company is not in compliance with cGMP requirements, sanctions may be imposed that include preventing us from receiving the necessary licenses to export its products and classifying the company as an &#8220;unacceptable supplier,&#8221; thereby disqualifying us from selling products to federal agencies. Imported active pharmaceutical ingredients and other components needed to manufacture our products could be rejected by United States Customs.

&#160;

11&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Other FDA Matters 

If there are any modifications to an approved drug, including changes in indication, manufacturing process or labeling or a change in a manufacturing facility, an applicant must notify the FDA, and in many cases, approval for such changes must be submitted to the FDA or other regulatory authority. Additionally, the FDA regulates post-approval promotional labeling and advertising activities to assure that such activities are being conducted in conformity with statutory and regulatory requirements. Failure to adhere to such requirements can result in regulatory actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

&#160;

Pharmacy Regulation 

Our planned target pharmacy acquisitions will be regulated by both individual states and the federal government. Every state has laws and regulations addressing pharmacy operations, including regulations relating specifically to compounding pharmacy operations. These regulations generally include licensing requirements for pharmacists and pharmacies, as well as regulations related to compounding processes, safety protocols, purity, sterility, storage, controlled substances, recordkeeping and regular inspections, among other things. State rules and regulations are updated periodically, generally under the jurisdiction of individual state boards of pharmacy. Failure to comply with the state pharmacy regulations of a particular state could result in a pharmacy being prohibited from operating in that state, financial penalties and/or becoming subject to additional oversight from that state&#8217;s board of pharmacy. In addition, many states are considering imposing, or have already begun to impose, more stringent requirements on compounding pharmacies. If our pharmacy operations become subject to additional licensure requirements, are unable to maintain their required licenses or if states place burdensome restrictions or limitations on pharmacies, our ability to operate in some states could be limited, which may have an adverse impact on our business.

&#160;

Many of the states into which we plan to deliver pharmaceuticals have laws and regulations that require out-of-state pharmacies to register with, or be licensed by, the boards of pharmacy or similar regulatory bodies in those states. These states generally permit the dispensing pharmacy to follow the laws of the state within which the dispensing pharmacy is located. However, various state pharmacy boards have enacted laws and/or adopted rules or regulations directed at restricting or prohibiting the operation of out-of-state pharmacies by, among other things, requiring compliance with all laws of the states into which the out-of-state pharmacy dispenses medications, whether or not those laws conflict with the laws of the state in which the pharmacy is located, or requiring the pharmacist-in-charge to be licensed in that state.

&#160;

Furthermore, under federal law, Section 503A of the Federal Food Drug Cosmetic Act (FDCA) seeks to limit the amount of compounded products that a pharmacy can dispense interstate. The interpretation and enforcement of that provision is dependent on the FDA entering into a standard Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with each state setting forth limits on interstate compounding. The FDA has stated in guidance issued in February 2015 that it will not enforce interstate restrictions until after it publishes a final standard MOU and has made it available to the states for signature for some designated period of time. The FDA has proposed a 180-day period for states to agree to the standard MOU after the final version is presented to states. Until a final MOU is issued and presented to the states to consider whether to sign, the extent of such interstate dispensing restrictions imposed by Section 503A is unknown. If the final standard MOU is not signed by a particular state, then interstate shipments of compounded preparations from a pharmacy located in that state would be limited to quantities not greater than 5% total prescription orders dispensed or distributed by such pharmacy. The current draft standard MOU presented by the FDA in February 2015 would limit interstate shipments of compounded drug units to 30% of all compounded and non-compounded units dispensed or distributed by the pharmacy per month. If the final standard MOU contains a 30% limit on interstate distribution, or if the FDA applies the 5% limit in Section 503A because a state refuses to sign the MOU, then those limitations could have an adverse effect our operations.

&#160;

Certain provisions of the FDCA govern the preparation, handling, storage, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products. The Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013 (DQSA) clarifies and strengthens the federal regulatory framework governing compounding pharmacies. Title 1 of the DQSA, the Compounding Quality Act, modifies provisions of the Section 503A of the FDCA that were found to be unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2002. In general, Section 503A provides that pharmacies are exempt from the provisions of the FDCA requiring compliance with cGMP, labeling with adequate directions for use and FDA approval prior to marketing if the pharmacy complies with certain other requirements. Among other things, to comply with Section 503A, a compounded drug must be compounded by a licensed pharmacist for an identified individual patient on the basis of a valid prescription. Pharmacies may only compound in limited quantities before receipt of a prescription for an individual patient, and Section 503A limits the distribution of compounded drug products outside of the state in which the pharmacy is located, as described in the previous paragraph. 503A also provides certain requirements for compounding from bulk substances and prohibits compounding of products that have been withdrawn from the market for reasons of safety or efficacy and products that are demonstrably difficult to compound.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Confidentiality, Privacy and HIPAA 

Our pharmacy operations will involve the receipt, use and disclosure of confidential medical, pharmacy and other health-related information. The federal privacy regulations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) are designed to protect the medical information of a healthcare patient or health plan enrollee that could be used to identify the individual. Among other things, HIPAA limits certain uses and disclosures of protected health information and requires compliance with federal security regulations regarding the storage, utilization of, access to and transmission of electronic protected health information. In 2009, the Health Information for Economic and Clinical Health Act modified certain provisions of HIPAA to strengthen its privacy and security provisions. The requirements imposed by HIPAA are extensive. In addition, most states have enacted privacy and security laws that protect identifiable patient information that is not health-related. Further, several states have enacted more protective and comprehensive pharmacy-related privacy legislation that not only applies to patient records but also prohibits the transfer or use for commercial purposes of pharmacy data that identifies prescribers. These regulations impose substantial requirements on covered entities and their business associates regarding the storage, utilization of, access to and transmission of personal health and non-health information. Many of these laws apply to our planned business.

&#160;

Medicare and Medicaid Reimbursement 

Medicare is a federally funded program that provides health insurance coverage for qualified persons age 65 or older and for some disabled persons with certain specific conditions. State-funded Medicaid programs provide medical benefits to groups of low-income and disabled individuals, some of whom may have inadequate or no medical insurance. Currently, most of our commercially available formulations are sold in cash transactions and our customers may choose to seek available reimbursement opportunities to the extent that they exist. We are currently in communications with third-party public and private payors regarding potential reimbursement options for certain of our proprietary formulations and we have begun hiring public and private payor billers in anticipation of the potential reimbursement opportunities for certain formulations. However, third-party payors, including Medicare, are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting coverage and the level of reimbursement for new drugs and by refusing, in some cases, to provide coverage for uses of approved products for disease indications for which the FDA has not granted labeling approval. Further, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which amended PPACA (collectively, the Health Reform Law), will result in sweeping changes to the existing U.S. system for the delivery and financing of health care and may have a considerable impact on our business. As a result, we may be unable to satisfy the requirements of Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors and we may never be able to obtain reimbursement from such payors for any of our formulations. To the extent we obtain third-party reimbursement for our compounded formulations, we may become subject to Medicare, Medicaid and other publicly financed health benefit plan regulations prohibiting kickbacks, beneficiary inducement and the submission of false claims.

&#160;

Employees and Consultants 

&#160; 

As of March 31, 2016, we employ one full individual and use two individuals on a consulting basis, who are responsible for financial accounting and investor relations, business and corporate development, research and development management, and general administration. We hire independent contractor labor and consultants on an as needed basis and have entered into consulting arrangements with certain directors in exchange for stock options and/or cash payments.

Impact of JOBS Act 

&#160;

On April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startup Act of 2012 (the &#8220;JOBS Act&#8221;) was enacted into law. Under the JOBS Act, Congress established a new statutorily defined category of registrant referred to as an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; (&#8220;EGC&#8221;) which, among other things, affords such registrants with relief from certain disclosure requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;) for so long as they continue to qualify as an EGC.

&#160;

A registrant qualifies as an EGC if it has total annual gross revenues of less than $1 billion as of the end of its most recent completed fiscal year and has not filed for its initial public offering of common equity securities under the Securities Act of 1933 (the &#8220;Securities Act&#8221;) prior to December 9, 2011. Under this definition, we qualify as an EGC.

&#160;

For so long as we qualify as an EGC: 

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; We will not be required to comply with the auditor attestation over internal control requirements under &#167;404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (&#8220;SOX&#8221;). &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; We may elect to comply with the following scaled-back executive compensation disclosure requirements (&#8220;Reduced Executive Compensation Disclosures&#8221;): (a) EGCs are not required to comply with the annual &#8220;say on pay&#8221; and &#8220;say on golden parachute&#8221; advisory voting requirements and rules promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (&#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;), (b) EGCs are not required to include the disclosures that will be required under future rules to be promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Act as to the relationship between executive compensation and company performance, and the ratio of CEO pay to median employee pay, and (c) EGCs may elect to provide the same level of executive compensation disclosures as required by Smaller Reporting Companies (as defined under Rule 12b-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act and referred to herein as &#8220;SRCs&#8221;), which includes, among other things, the omission of Compensation Disclosure and Analysis discussion, inclusion of fewer tables, and disclosure of compensation for only the CEO and the two next highest paid officers. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; We may elect on a one-time basis not to comply with new or revised accounting principles that apply to public companies, as long as we comply once the rules become applicable for private companies. We are required to make an irrevocable election which will continue for so long as we retain our status as an EGC status. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; We will not be required to comply with any Public Company Accounting Oversight Board rules regarding mandatory audit firm rotation and auditor discussion and analysis should such rules be adopted. &#160;

As an EGC, we are not required to take advantage of all of the benefits made available to us under the JOBS Act described above, but may instead opt-in to certain of those scaled-back disclosures and phased-in requirements as we so desire. However, as discussed above, we are not permitted to selectively opt-in with respect to compliance with new or revised accounting rules or pronouncements. Accordingly, we have irrevocably elected to opt out of compliance with any new or revised accounting principles until any such rules become applicable to private companies.

&#160;

Under the JOBS Act, we will retain our status as an EGC until the earliest of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year during which we have total annual gross revenues of $1,000,000,000 (as may be adjusted under the JOBS Act) or more; (2) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act; (3) the date on which we have, during the previous 3-year period, issued more than $1,000,000,000 in non-convertible debt; or (4) the date on which we are deemed to be a &#8220;large accelerated filer&#8221; under Rule 12b-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

&#160;

14&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

It should be noted that we also currently qualify as a Small Reporting Company (&#8220;SRC&#8221;). As a result, in the event that we are no longer an EGC, we will continue to be exempt from the auditor attestation requirements of SOX and eligible to comply with the Reduced Executive Compensation Disclosures for so long as we qualify as a SRC. We also may elect to provide other scaled-back disclosures applicable to SRCs (not just those relating to Reduced Executive Compensation Disclosures).
