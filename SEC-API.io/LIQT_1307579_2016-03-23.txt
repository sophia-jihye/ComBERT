Ceramic Silicon Carbide Membranes for Liquid Filtration 

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

Under the &#8220;LiqTech&#8221;, &#8220;Cometas&#8221; and &#8220;Provital&#8221; brand names, we manufacture and sell ceramic silicon carbide membranes and systems for liquid filtration using our patented silicon carbide technology (&#8220;SiC Filters&#8221;) that currently focus on hydrocarbon production-derived contaminated water, which we refer to herein as &#8220;produced water&#8221;, removal of heavy metals in mining and energy applications, pre-filtration for reverse osmosis in drinking water and industrial applications. Our SiC Filters have been used in the following applications by our clients: 

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Produced water : Our membranes can be used for the filtration of "produced" water &#8211; a byproduct from oil and gas production. The amount of produced water varies between 0.1 to ten times the amount of oil produced. We have performed testing with many of the major international private and public oil and gas companies. We have been awarded a contract by one of the major international oil and gas companies to provide and service produced water filters on one of its offshore platforms. Two additional commercial installations have been commissioned with the LiqTech membranes. 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#9679; 

Pre-filtration of reverse osmosis drinking water : Prior to passing through reverse osmosis membranes to produce drinking or industrial water from sea or surface water, the sea or surface water must be pre-filtered. We have performed successful tests for the pre-filtration of sea and surface water for this purpose with numerous clients, including Synertech in Serbia, a supplier of drinking water, Arteron in Malaysia, a company producing compact drinking water solutions, Hoimyung Corp in South Korea, a supplier of industrial waste water systems and pretreatment for reverse osmosis. 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#9679; 

Industrial applications : Our membranes have performed successful tests in industrial applications for the removal of a variety of substances such as heavy metal (Energy provider, Germany), specific heavy metals for European mining company, manure (Bioffuel Technology, Denmark), pool and spa water (Provital, Denmark) and raw sugar (Al Khaleej Sugar, UAE). We have supplied membranes to these applications and additional membranes are currently in the tendering phase. 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#9679; 

Producing clean drinking water : The potential for the use of LiqTech SiC membranes in drinking water production is diverse and the benefits are numerous. Some examples include: ground water &#8211; removal of precipitated salts such as iron and manganese; surface water &#8211; removal of organic suspended solids and humic acid; and sea water &#8211; pre-filtration before reverse osmosis. We have entered into a cooperation agreement with the leading pump producer Grundfos to market a newly developed water treatment unit for ground water. 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#9679; 

Waste water treatment : Our membranes can be used to remove suspended solids in waste water treatment. Our membranes have performed successful tests for treating waste water with Imtech (Egypt), RIPE (China) and Asia Pacific Water Technologies (South Korea), and we have sold membranes for several commercial installations. 

&#160; 

Our products are based on the following silicon carbide membrane technologies: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

CoMem is a unique patented membrane technology that utilizes a cross-flow structure to handle high concentrations of suspended solids found in produced water from the oil and chemical industry, wastewater from industrial processes and manure filtration; and 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#9679; 

Aqua Solution integrates a dead-end structural design with cutting-edge membrane technology in a solution specifically designed for applications in pre-treatment for reverse osmosis, wastewater treatment and pool and spa filtration. 

&#160; 

Our filters are manufactured with a silicon carbide ceramic membrane based on a patented technology, and we are not aware of any other company that makes both the substrate (honeycomb) and the membrane (the part which accomplishes the filtering) solely from silicon carbide. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

The advantages of our SiC membranes compared to other pre-filtration systems for reverse osmosis are: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Our SiC membranes offer the same water flow as commonly used sand filters which take up to 400 times more space and have pore sizes at least three times bigger than our SiC membranes, and reduce the number of membrane elements and pressure vessels; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#9679; 

With our SiC membranes, high flow capacities are achieved at very low pressures, which reduces energy costs; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Our SiC membranes reduce water consumption for sand filter backwash; and 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Our SiC membranes eliminate consumption/maintenance of cartridges. 

&#160; 

Our SiC membranes offer consistent removal of oil and suspended solids at high throughput rates regardless of feed conditions. The membranes are ideal for treatment of produced water for discharge, re-injection, pre-reverse osmosis (&#8220;RO&#8221;) as well as polymer flooded streams. We offer on shore and off shore solutions and have extensive experience with produced water streams from fracking, gas condensate, and oil emulsions. We believe our SiC membranes are the best alternative to micro-flotation and walnut shell filters due to their cost savings, reduced installation cost and robustness with reduced downtime. Our chemically inert plug-and-play filter designs are extremely hard and durable materials with high flux (flow) to increase membrane life and reduce downtime for cleaning. SiC membranes are stronger, harder, longer lasting, more temperature resistant, and recover faster than conventional ceramic and polymeric membranes. 

&#160; 

Our flat sheet membranes (&#8220;FSM&#8221;) offer low energy consumption, maximum permeation, innovative rack design, and high flux. These membranes are used in drinking water, pre-RO, and industrial wastewater reuse. The FSM carrier and the selective layer are also made of silicon carbide, which gives the product some unique advantages such as high flux, total chemical resistance (pH 0-14), long life, and the lowest fouling tendency of any polymeric and ceramic membrane material. Our tubular membranes offer robust and high yielding membrane solutions for produced water from the Oil &#38; Gas market, and industrial wastewater to remove suspended solids as well as oil droplets and oil-emulsions from solutions. Our dynamic high flux membrane disks are designed for removal of high suspended solids. The filtration format is outside-in, with internal permeation channels that facilitate removal of the solids. The cross flow effect is generated through the rotation of the discs at high velocities which enables flow cleaning of the filter membrane surface. This principle offers energy savings above 80% compared to conventional cross flow. 

&#160; 

The strategic acquisition of Provital in July 2014 (now LiqTech Systems) is consistent with our long-term growth strategy and strengthens our position in the integrated filtration technologies market. LiqTech Systems was one of the first in the world to develop filtration solutions based on ceramic membranes whose products result in more efficient, longer lasting systems that save water and demand less maintenance for large public pools and wastewater. The filtration systems are equipped with LiqTech Systems&#8217; own Intelligent Control System, which allows for local and/or remote control, monitoring and management of every aspect of the system. The system is easy to use and gives the user full control. The control system logs all necessary data and sends daily e-mails/SMS with all the information to a designated operator if required. We believe that LiqTech Systems&#8217; solves many of the problems present in today&#8217;s pool industry, including excess water consumption, energy, chemical usage, space and maintenance, and cost efficiency. The acquisition of LiqTech Systems has allowed LiqTech Systems to become a fully integrated, one-stop shop for plug and play filtration systems. We believed the combined company would allow LiqTech to significantly accelerate the time to market for LiqTech&#8217;s SiC filters and provide us with immediate credibility in the liquid filtration industry, particularly with our SiC filters. By acquiring LiqTech Systems, we have gained validation in the industry by directly expanding our customer base to include existing reputable customers from LiqTech Systems. We plan to continue the research and development, and marketing efforts of LiqTech Systems&#8217; UVC Hybrid Mercury/LED lighting systems for use in large marine and recreational pools. 

&#160; 

We believe tightening government regulation and increasing industry awareness about the need for high quality injection water will contribute to the implementation of membrane technology, since conventional technologies will not be able to meet these demands. 

&#160; 

For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we received grants from governmental entities of $797,008 and $387,744, respectively. 

&#160; 

For the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, our sales of liquid filters and services were $10,347,010 and $7,532,528, respectively, and accounted for 65% and 58% of our total sales, respectively. &#160; 

&#160; 

Diesel Particulate Filters 

&#160; 

We offer diesel particulate filters (&#8220;DPF&#8221;) for exhaust emission control solutions to the verified retrofit and the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) market through our direct sales force. DPF sales are generally made to distributors specializing in sales to end users. We use a proprietary &#8220;nano washcoat&#8221; to provide catalytic coating for anything from diesel particulate filters to catalytic converters. We have developed a robust silicon carbide diesel particulate filter that is especially useful for vehicles that produce a high soot load, and, if properly maintained, should last as long as the vehicle&#8217;s engine. Our DPFs are ideal for off-road vehicles because of their strength, chemical non-reactive nature, temperature resilience and thermal conductivity. Our DPF products are sold worldwide, under the LiqTech brand name. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Our silicon carbide filters can handle higher soot loads than filters that do not use a silicon carbide membrane, which makes them ideal for situations in which engines infrequently reach high enough temperatures to burn off soot. Examples include: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Garbage trucks; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Port vehicles; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Diesel pickup trucks not carrying a full load; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Off-road construction vehicles that idle for long periods of time; and 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Intra-city vehicles that do not reach highway speeds. 

&#160; 

For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our sales of diesel particulate filters were $5,081,304 and $6,620,625, respectively, and accounted for 32% and 45% of our total sales, respectively. 

&#160; 

Kiln Furniture 

&#160; 

Kiln furniture refers to all items used in a kiln to support ceramics that create additional space to maximize the number of items for each firing. Our high-quality SiC kiln furniture is thinner (allowing more items to be added for each firing), withstands higher heat, lasts longer and reduces the firing time (reducing energy costs) as compared to cordierite, mullite and oxide bonded kiln furniture. 

&#160; 

Although we have produced kiln furniture as a means to maximize the efficiency of our manufacturing process and not as one of our primary products, we intend to phase out this commercial product over time. 

&#160; 

For the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, our kiln furniture revenues were $384,273 and $408,039, respectively, and accounted for 2% and 3% of our total sales, respectively. 

&#160; 

Our Competitive Strengths 

&#160; 

We believe the following strengths position us to increase our revenue and profitability: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Advantages of Silicon Carbide Membranes: Our diesel exhaust and liquid filtration products utilize silicon carbide membranes which have certain qualities that we believe make our products more desirable than those of our competitors. Unlike filtration products that use aluminum oxide, silicon carbide membranes are chemically inert and temperature resistant. Furthermore, silicon carbide membranes exhibit a high degree of hydrophilicity (tendency of a surface to become wet or to absorb water) which results in unique flux (low energy consumption). Silicon carbide is also highly durable, with hardness second to diamonds, making it conducive in a variety of industrial settings. As a result, we believe that such superior properties make our products desirable in both exhaust emissions control products and liquid filtration products. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Complete systems fabrication: &#160; LiqTech provides full fabrication and integration of our membranes into complete systems made from corrosive resistant materials and components. We strive to provide full in-house engineering capabilities in process design, 3D modelling and controls. The entire specification, engineering, fabrication and commission process is driven by our professional staff of highly dedicated engineers and craftsman. We believe that suppling our customers with turnkey solutions built around our silicon carbide membranes is unique in this market. LiqTech is more than a membrane supplier - we see ourselves as a full provider of complete water treatment systems. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Broad Application of LiqTech Membranes: Our membranes can and have been applied in a variety of applications, including the processing of industrial waste water, produced water and pretreatment of drinking water, prefilters for reverse osmosis, oil emulsion separation, bacteria removal for aquaculture, commercial pool treatment solutions &#160; and separating metals from liquids used in industrial processes. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Marketing and Manufacturing in Key Markets and Expanding to Other Market: We have production and sales capacity in North America and Europe. We also sell our products through offices and agents in several key countries such as China, Spain, UK, Germany, Korea, France, Italy and Brazil, and we have established customer relations in more than 25 countries. 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#9679; 

Strong and Experienced Management Team: Our management team has significant experience in the clean technology and filtration industries, driving growth through development of new applications and technologies and cultivating relationships with customers. 

&#160;

Our Strategy 

&#160; 

Our strategy is to create stockholder value by leveraging our competitive and strengths and focusing on the opportunities in the end-markets we serve. Key features of our strategy include: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Enter New Geographic Markets and Expand Existing Markets. We plan to continue to manufacture and sell our products out of Denmark and the United States. We intend to continue to develop our organization in Denmark and the United States and we plan to expand our production facilities in the United States to include manufacturing of systems. We have opened sales offices in France and in Singapore. In addition to utilizing local representatives, we intend to establish sales outlets with technical support in other European nations such as Italy, while expanding our presence in Asia. We intend to work with agents and partners to access such markets. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Continue to Strengthen Position in DPF Market. We believe that we have a strong position in the retrofit market for diesel particulate filter systems. We intend to continue our efforts to maintain our strength in this area. Furthermore, we intend to leverage our experience in the OEM market and expand our presence in the OEM market with new products relating to diesel particulate filter systems. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Continue to Develop and Improve Technologies and Open New End Markets. We intend to continuously develop our ceramic membranes and improve the filtration efficiency for our filtration products. Through continuous development, we intend to find new uses for our products and plan to expand into any new markets that we believe would be appropriate for our Company. One of our key strategies is to develop our membrane applications together with our customers including, for example, the development of the next generation of diesel particulate filters with asymmetric design for the OEM market. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Continue Our Focus on Selling and on Development New Standard Units. We will continue our focus on selling systems based on our unique SIC membranes. We will also combine the ceramic membranes with other technologies to be able to offer our customers a complete solution. We will continue our focus to develop smaller standard systems, like our ground water treatment unit and our residential swimming pool units. These units will be sold through a network of agents and partnerships. 

&#160;

Our Industry 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

We primarily serve two industries - the diesel particle filter market and the liquid filtration system market. Our goal is to position ourselves to expand on and leverage our products and technology and to take advantage of the favorable industry trends that we anticipate. 

&#160; 

Liquid Filtration Market 

&#160; 

Water is essential to life on earth, and clean water shortages are expected to affect two-thirds of the human population by 2025. One-third of the human population is living today with clean water shortcomings and this is expected to increase to two-thirds of the population by 2025 due to the growing population. According to the World Health Organization, approximately 1.6 million children die every year due to unsafe water and the lack of basic sanitation. Due to the growing need for pure water for drinking and industrial purposes, the market for membrane filtration is growing rapidly, with more and larger plants being commissioned all over the world. We also see a general trend worldwide for increasing demand for higher quality re-injection water in connection with unconventional oil and gas production. In addition, we see tightening discharge legislations, increasing water cuts (more water produced per barrel oil) and the introduction of Enhanced Oil Recovery (&#8220;EOR&#8221;) techniques. The tightening of produced water specifications is a problem for conventional technologies. However, LiqTech SiC membranes have been shown to solve these challenges and we believe represent favorable market trends for our business. LiqTech offers packaged systems consisting of ceramic SiC and conventional RO membranes for industrial and municipal customers. As a result, we anticipate that global demand will increase for products such as ours that can be used to provide clean water. The growth is especially pronounced for reverse osmosis membranes. Reverse osmosis membranes are increasingly used for the production of drinking water (desalination of sea water or brackish water), for demineralized water in industrial processes (boiler feed water, microelectronics production), as well as in food processing and pharmaceutical production. In addition, laboratories rely on pure water, for which demineralization is an essential step. According to Pike Research, the annual global investment in desalination is forecasted to reach $16.6 billion by 2016. According to another industry report, the aggregate water volume treated by membranes is expected to grow from 29 billion cubic meters in 2009 to 82 billion cubic meters in 2020. The market for systems that clean up ballast water, used primarily by ships to maintain balance, is forecasted by Frost &#38; Sullivan to increase six fold within the next decade. Ballast water cleaning systems may reach as much as $3.1 billion by 2023, up from $467 million in 2013. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Diesel Particulate Filter Market 

&#160; 

The increase in global regulation of diesel particles is expected to drive growth in the DPF market. California continues to tighten regulation encouraging the use of DPF products and we expect other areas of the United States to begin introducing DPF filters. In Europe, cities in Germany are setting requirements for off-road machinery requirements for DPF filters. According to an industry publication, the global market for new DPF filters manufactured by OEMs is expected to increase from approximately 1.7 million units in 2010 to over 9 million units in 2020. Diesel emissions consist of several toxic gasses and particles: particulate matter (soot), carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons. Soot has been linked to a variety of health problems in humans. Abt Associates, for the Clean Air Task Force, estimates that approximately 21,000 people in the U.S. die prematurely each year from breathing diesel soot, 3,000 of those from lung cancer. Another 27,000 heart attacks, 14,500 hospitalizations and 2.4 million lost work days a year are attributable to diesel particulate matter exposures. In 2010, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) estimated that diesel transport represented 50% of the total ambient air pollution in OECD countries, which equates to over $785 billion in health damages. The Abt Associates report, using EPA science advisory board methodology, estimated that the monetary value of the health damages from diesel-related particulate matter in the U.S. was approximately $139 billion (in 1999 dollars). Reducing diesel emissions will have both health benefits and social benefits to society, along with reduced costs. In response to these health impacts, governments have been implementing legislation to regulate emissions from diesel engines. California implemented the Diesel Risk Reduction Plan, which required the curtailment of diesel particle emissions by 25% by 2010 and a further 15% by 2020. New York City has implemented binding directives for the retrofitting of buses, garbage trucks and construction machines. In the European Union, Directive EC 715/2007 of June 20, 2007 defined particle count limits for certain cars and light utility vehicles. Also, in Europe, low emission zones have been implemented locally, creating a patchwork of regulation. The increase in global regulation of diesel particles is expected to drive growth in the DPF market. According to an industry publication, the global market for new DPF filters manufactured by OEMs is expected to increase from approximately 1.7 million units in 2010 to over 9 million units in 2020. 

&#160; 

The Asian market has shown economic growth and an improved standard of living which has led to increased sales of vehicles in the Asia-Oceania region. At the same time, the pollution in major cities has reached high PM levels. As a result, we believe that the Chinese government will introduce additional regulations, including new emissions standards faster than previously anticipated. We also believe the high pollution levels will result in an increase in the need for retrofitting existing vehicles. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing 

&#160; 

We currently manufacture our products in facilities located in Ballerup, Denmark and White Bear Lake, Minnesota and assemble our systems in LiqTech Systems, located in Hobro in Jutland, Denmark. We have plans to expand our production capacity in both Denmark and Minnesota, primarily through additional investment in equipment relating to our liquid filtration products, when this becomes necessary. 

&#160; 

Raw Materials 

&#160; 

The main raw materials that we use in our manufacturing processes are silicon carbide, platinum and palladium. We purchase these commodities from various sources generally based upon availability and price. There is a limited supply of silicon carbide available to us. As other industries develop products utilizing silicon carbide, we may not be able to obtain adequate supplies of silicon carbide required for the manufacture of our existing and planned future water filtration products. Any increased demand for silicon carbide, platinum or palladium could increase the price we must pay to obtain it and could adversely affect our profitability. However, our management believes that we could obtain satisfactory substitutes for these materials should they become unavailable. 

&#160; 

Sales, Marketing and Distribution &#160; 

&#160; 

Our products are sold primarily to large industrial customers that use our products for gas and liquid filtration. Since the start of the Company the automotive industry has been a focus for us and our single largest market. In 2014, we acquired LiqTech Systems, a Danish systems manufacturing company, which has strengthened our focus on the liquid filtration business . This business is now our largest products group focusing on applications within the pool, drinking water, water reclamation, oil and gas, heavy metal removal and aquaculture markets. 

&#160; 

For the year ended December 31, 2015, our four largest customers accounted for approximately 24%, 15%, 11% and 6%, respectively, of our net sales (approximately 56% in total). For the year ended December 31, 2014, our four largest customers accounted for approximately 10%, 5%, 4% and 3%, respectively, of our net sales (approximately 22% in total). If we are unable to diversify our customer base, our future results will be heavily dependent on these customers. Our dependence on a limited number of customers means that the loss of a major customer or any reduction in orders by a major customer would materially reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations. We expect that sales to relatively few customers will continue to account for a significant percentage of our net sales for the foreseeable future. However, these customers or our other customers may not use our products at current levels in the future, if at all. We have no firm, long-term volume commitments from any of our major customers and we generally enter into individual purchase orders with our customers, in certain cases under master agreements that govern the terms and conditions of the relationship. We have experienced cancellations of orders and fluctuations in order levels from period-to-period and expect that we will continue to experience such cancellations and fluctuations in the future. Customer purchase orders may be cancelled and order volume levels can be changed, cancelled or delayed with limited or no penalties. We may not be able to replace cancelled, delayed or reduced purchase orders with new orders. If any one of these customers reduces their demand for our products, it will have a material adverse effect on our operations. Furthermore, a significant portion of our account receivables is concentrated with these major customers, some of whom have limited working capital resources who may not be able to meet their financial obligations to us. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

We plan to actively market our existing products to new customers as we increase our production capacity. As of March 18, 2016, we had 12 full time salesmen or distribution agents. We promote our products through direct contact to potential customers and by meeting potential customers in trade fairs and exhibitions. 

&#160; 

In certain instances, our products are delivered to the end customer through systems integrators. These systems integrators use our filtration products in larger filtration systems which eventually are installed in products used by the end customer. Due to the regulation surrounding the reasons why many of the end customers use filtration systems, the systems integrators often are required by such end customers to receive approval of their systems, including the components used in such systems, which requires the use of significant time and money. As a result, we believe that certain of the systems integrators that use our products will not replace our filters with competitive products unless there is good reason. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

Our success depends in part upon our ability to obtain, maintain and protect intellectual property rights that cover our silicon carbide product forms, applications and/or manufacturing processes and specifications and the technology or know-how that enable these product forms, applications, processes and specifications, and to avoid and defend against claims that we infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others and to prevent the unauthorized use of our intellectual property. Silicon carbide is a well-known material which was developed over 100 years ago and thus, extensive research, development and publication on this material exists, making it difficult to obtain intellectual property rights to key elements of silicon carbide technology. Accordingly, at least some of the technology used in the manufacture of our re-crystallized silicon carbide products is not protected by patents. Where we consider it appropriate, we seek to protect our proprietary rights by filing United States and foreign patent applications related to technology, inventions and improvements that we consider patentable and important to the development and conduct of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, trademarks, licensing agreements, confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements, business partnerships and continuing technological innovation to safeguard our intellectual property rights and develop and maintain our competitive advantage. 

&#160; 

As of March 18, 2016, we had one issued United States patent that we co-own with a third party, two issued Danish patents, three issued foreign patents (in Germany, China and South Korea) that we co-own with a third party and one pending European patent application which we co-own with a third party. The United States patent that we co-own is generally effective for 20 years from the filing date of the earliest U.S. or international application to which it claims priority. The scope and duration of each of our foreign patents varies in accordance with local law. On July 7, 2014, we obtained a new patent application related to the silicon carbide membrane technology in Denmark. Our patent strategy is generally uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary technology may depend in part upon our success in obtaining patent rights and enforcing those rights once granted or licensed. We do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of any patents. Our issued patents and those that may be issued in the future may be challenged, invalidated, rendered unenforceable or circumvented, which could limit our ability to prevent competitors from marketing similar or related products, or shorten the term of patent protection that we may have for our products, processes and enabling technologies. In addition, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies, duplicate technology developed by us or otherwise possess intellectual property rights that could limit our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business. 

&#160; 

We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. Trade secrets, however, can be difficult to protect. We may not be able to maintain our technology or know-how as trade secrets, and competitors may develop or acquire equally valuable or more valuable technology or know-how related to the manufacture of comparable silicon carbide products. We also seek to protect our confidential and proprietary information, in part, by requiring all employees, consultants and business partners to execute confidentiality and/or nondisclosure agreements upon the commencement of any employment, consulting arrangement or engagement with us. These agreements generally require that all confidential and proprietary information developed by the employee, consultant or business partner, or made known to the employee, consultant or business partner by us, during the course of the relationship with us, be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties. These agreements may be breached and may not provide adequate remedies in the event of breach. To the extent that our employees, consultants or business partners use intellectual property owned by others in their work for and/or with us, disputes could arise as to the rights in related or resulting technologies, know-how or inventions. Moreover, while we also require customers and vendors to execute agreements containing confidentiality and/or nondisclosure provisions, we may not have obtained such agreements from all of our customers and vendors. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors, customers or vendors. Such customers or vendors may also be subject to laws and regulations that require them to disclose information that we would otherwise seek to keep confidential.

&#160; 

We also believe that having distinctive names may be an important factor in marketing our products, and therefore use trademarks to brand some of our products. As of March 18, 2016, we had one trademark registration in the United States (LiqTech NA) and four trademark registrations in the European Union (AQUA SOLUTION, CoMem, CDPX and FUTURE FILTRATION). 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

We do not believe that we are subject to any special governmental regulations affecting our products in the countries in which we have operations, except that in Minnesota, we are required to comply with the Minnesota Air Pollution standards related to the use of our incinerators located in our Minnesota facilities. We are subject to numerous health and safety laws and regulations. In the United States, these laws and regulations include the Federal Occupation Safety and Health Act and comparable state legislation. We are also subject to similar requirements in other countries in which we have extensive operations, including Denmark, where we are subject to various regulations. These regulations are frequently changing, and it is impossible to predict the effect of such laws and regulations on us in the future. We actively seek to maintain a safe, healthy and environmentally friendly workplace for all of our employees and those who work with us. 

&#160; 

Environmental Matters 

&#160; 

We are subject to a broad range of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations which govern, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges and the handling, storage, disposal and release of wastes and hazardous substances. It is our policy to comply with applicable environmental requirements at all of our facilities. We are also subject to laws such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, that may impose liability retroactively and without fault for releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances at on-site or off-site locations. We are subject to similar requirements in Denmark and other European countries. From time to time, we have identified environmental compliance issues at our facilities. To date, compliance with environmental matters has not had a material effect upon the Company&#8217;s capital expenditures or competitive position. 

&#160; 

We believe that, due to the constant focus on the environment and clean air and clean water standards throughout the world, a requirement in the future to adhere to new and more stringent regulations both in the U.S. and abroad is possible as governmental agencies seek to improve standards required for certification of products intended to promote clean air and water. In the event our products fail to meet these ever-changing standards, some or all of our products may become obsolete, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and long-term prospects. 

&#160; 

The nature of our manufacturing operations exposes us to potential claims and liability for environmental damage, personal injury, loss of life and damage to, or destruction of, property. Our manufacturing operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations that govern environmental protection and human health and safety. These laws and regulations have changed frequently in the past and it is reasonable to expect additional and more stringent changes in the future. Our manufacturing operations may not comply with future laws and regulations, and we may be required to make significant unanticipated capital and operating expenditures to bring our operations within compliance with such regulations. If we fail to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations, manufacturing guidelines, and workplace safety requirements, governmental authorities may seek to impose fines and penalties on us or to revoke or deny the issuance or renewal of operating permits, and private parties may seek damages from us. Under such circumstances, we could be required to curtail or cease operations, conduct site remediation or other corrective action, or pay substantial damage claims for which may not have sufficient or any insurance coverage for claims. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

As of March 18, 2016, we had eight (8) full-time employees spending a majority of their working hours on research and development. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we spent $707,844 and $336,065, respectively, on Company-sponsored research and development. 

&#160; 

In 2014, we started the development of a UV LED technology for disinfection of organics in primarily commercial pool and drinking water applications. UV is a known disinfection method, but current technology with mercury lamps has its limitations. With LED technology, it is possible to have instant on/off and thereby apply the correct amount of UV rays for maximum bacteria kill increasing the overall system efficiency. Further, the lifetime of the LED lamps are much higher than mercury lamps and disposal cost at end of life lower and more environmentally friendly. In systems design LED technology provides more flexibility than traditional lamps, which are fixed in length, size and output. We believe that our UV LED development efforts will disrupt the current technology space. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Our products compete with other filters that are made using both ceramic and plastic membranes. Most of our competitors are large industrial companies. However, we believe our patented technology allows us to produce high quality, low cost products that give us an advantage over many of our competitors, many of which have greater financial, technological, manufacturing and personnel resources. We intend to continue to devote resources to improving our products in order to maintain our existing customers and to add new customers.

Employees 

&#160; 

As of March 18, 2016, we had 92 employees, 86 of whom were full-time employees . We had 80 employees at our operations in Denmark, including 8 in research and development, 12 in sales and engineering and 2 in executive management. We also had 12 employees in the United States, one of whom was in executive management; the others were employed in sales, accounting and production. 

&#160; 

Certain labor employees in Denmark are represented by workers&#8217; councils that have collective bargaining agreements. With the exception of said Denmark employees, no other employees are members of a labor union or are represented by workers&#8217; councils that have collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. 

&#160;
