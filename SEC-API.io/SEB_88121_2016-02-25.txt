&#160; 

(i) &#8195; Principal Products and Services 

&#160; 

Pork Division &#8211; Seaboard, through its subsidiary Seaboard Foods LLC, engages in the business of hog production and pork processing in the U.S. Through these operations, Seaboard produces and sells fresh and frozen pork products to further processors, foodservice operators, grocery stores, distributors and retail outlets throughout the U.S. Internationally, Seaboard sells to these same types of customers in Japan, Mexico and numerous other foreign markets. Other further processing companies also purchase Seaboard&#8217;s fresh and frozen pork products in bulk and produce products, such as lunchmeat, ham, bacon, and sausage. Fresh pork, such as loins, tenderloins and ribs are sold to distributors and grocery stores. Seaboard sells some of its fresh products under the brand name Prairie Fresh&#174;. Seaboard&#8217;s hog processing plant is located in Guymon, Oklahoma and generally operates at capacity. Seaboard also has a ham-boning and processing plant in Mexico. Seaboard earns fees, based primarily on the number of head processed, to market substantially all of the products produced by Triumph Foods, LLC (&#8220;Triumph&#8221;) at its pork processing plant located in St. Joseph, Missouri. 

&#160; 

Seaboard&#8217;s hog production operations consist of the breeding and raising of over four million hogs annually primarily at facilities owned by Seaboard or at facilities owned and operated by third parties with whom Seaboard has grower contracts. The hog production operations are located in the Central U.S. As a part of the hog production operations, Seaboard produces specially formulated feed for the hogs at five owned feed mills. The remaining hogs processed are purchased from third-party hog producers, primarily pursuant to purchase contracts. 

&#160; 

Seaboard produces biodiesel at a facility in Guymon, Oklahoma. The biodiesel is produced from pork fat from Seaboard&#8217;s Guymon pork processing plant and from animal fat supplied by non-Seaboard facilities. The biodiesel is sold to third parties. The facility can also produce biodiesel from vegetable oil. Seaboard is able to reduce or stop production when it is not economically feasible to produce based on input costs or the price of biodiesel. 

&#160; 

Seaboard&#8217;s Pork Division has a 50% noncontrolling interest in Daily&#8217;s Premium Meats, LLC (&#8220;Daily&#8217;s&#8221;). Daily&#8217;s produces and markets raw and pre-cooked bacon, ham and sausage under the Daily&#8217;s&#174; brand name primarily for 

&#160;

FORM 10-K 

SEABOARD CORPORATION 

the food service industry and, to a lesser extent, retail markets. Daily&#8217;s has two further processing plants located in Salt Lake City, Utah and Missoula, Montana that generally operate at capacity. &#160; In the second quarter of 2015, Daily&#8217;s began construction on a third further processing plant located in St. Joseph, Missouri. Operations are expected to begin in mid-2016. Seaboard and Triumph each supply raw product to Daily&#8217;s. 

&#160; 

On May 13, 2015, the Pork Division and Triumph agreed to jointly develop and operate a pork processing facility in Sioux City, Iowa. The facility is anticipated to begin operations in mid-2017. As part of the operations, Seaboard agreed to provide a portion of the hogs to be processed at the facility. In February 2016, the Pork Division and a newly formed limited liability partnership that will be consolidated with Seaboard acquired hog inventory and related assets that are expected to increase Seaboard&#8217;s hog production capacity to meet the majority of such hog supply commitment for single shift processing at the new plant. 

&#160;

This division also purchases sugar in bulk from third parties mostly within Argentina for subsequent resale. The sugar products are mostly sold in Argentina, primarily to retailers, soft drink manufacturers, and food manufacturers, with some exports to the U.S. and other South American countries. Seaboard grows a large portion of the sugarcane on the nearly 70,000 acres of land it owns in northern Argentina. The cane is processed at an owned mill, one of the largest in Argentina, with a current processing capacity of approximately 250,000 metric tons of sugar and approximately 15 million gallons of alcohol per year. Also, this division owns a 51 megawatt cogeneration power plant that is fueled by using sugarcane by-products, natural gas and other biomass when available. 

&#160; 

Power Division &#8211; Seaboard, through its subsidiary, Transcontinental Capital Corp. (Bermuda) Ltd., is an independent power producer generating electricity for the local power grid in the Dominican Republic. Seaboard operates one owned floating power generating facility with capacity to generate approximately 108 megawatts of &#160; electricity. The facility is secured on the Ozama River in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. This operation is exempt from U.S. regulations under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1938, as amended. Seaboard is not directly involved in the transmission or distribution of electricity. Seaboard primarily sells on the spot market accessed primarily by wholly government-owned distribution companies or partially government-owned generation companies. This division also has a 29.9% noncontrolling interest in a 300 megawatt electricity generating facility in the Dominican Republic. 

&#160; 

Turkey Segment &#8211; Seaboard has a 50% noncontrolling voting interest in Butterball, LLC (&#8220;Butterball&#8221;).

&#160; 

Other Businesses &#8211; Seaboard processes jalape&#241;o peppers at its plant in Honduras, which are primarily shipped to and sold in the U.S. 

&#160; 

The information required by this item with respect to the amount or percentage of total revenue contributed by any class of similar products or services which account for 10% or more of consolidated revenue in any of the last three fiscal years is set forth in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Seaboard&#8217;s Annual Report to Stockholders, which information is incorporated herein by reference. 

&#160; 

(ii) &#8195; Status of Product or Segment 

&#160; 

On May 13, 2015, the Pork Division agreed to contribute up to $207 million through 2019 to jointly develop and operate a pork processing facility in Sioux City, Iowa with Triumph. The facility is anticipated to begin operations in mid-2017. As part of the operations, Seaboard agreed to provide a portion of the hogs to be processed at the facility. In February 2016, the Pork Division and a newly formed limited liability partnership that will be consolidated with Seaboard paid $148 million to acquire hog inventory and related assets in Iowa and Colorado that is expected to increase Seaboard&#8217;s hog production capacity to meet the majority of such hog supply commitment for single shift processing at the new plant. Seaboard anticipates buying additional hog inventory and related assets during 2016 to fulfill the remaining amount of such hog supply commitment. 

&#160; 

In the second quarter of 2015, Daily&#8217;s began construction on a third further processing plant located in St. Joseph, Missouri. Operations are expected to begin in mid-2016. To date, construction funding has been provided by current operations. 

&#160; 

The Commodity Trading and Milling Division took delivery of two dry bulk vessels built for a total cost of approximately $45 million during 2015. An additional vessel was delivered in January 2016 and the final vessel is expected to be delivered during the first half of 2016 for a total cost of approximately $45 million. Seaboard entered into sales-leaseback transactions for the vessels delivered and anticipates selling and leasing back the &#160; 

&#160;

FORM 10-K 

SEABOARD CORPORATION 

remaining vessel when completed, which would result in Seaboard receiving back the amounts spent to build the vessels. 

&#160; 

Also the Commodity Trading and Milling Division made various investments in affiliates. During the second quarter of 2015, the Commodity Trading and Milling Division invested $10 million in an oilseed crushing business in the Republic of Turkey for a 25% noncontrolling interest, $8 million in a flour milling and pasta business in Botswana for a 49% noncontrolling interest and $10 million in a commodity trading and flour milling business in Uruguay for a 45% noncontrolling interest, all accounted for using the equity method. In addition, this division invested $18 million in a grain trading and poultry business in Morocco for a 12% noncontrolling interest, which is accounted for using the cost method. During the fourth quarter of 2015, Seaboard contributed $13 million in cash, a small amount of other assets, certain employees and rights to sell certain agricultural commodities that Seaboard had previously sold through its subsidiary, PS International, LLC, for a 40% noncontrolling interest in a commodity trading business in Atlanta, Georgia. 

&#160; 

In April 2015, the Power Division invested $10 million in a business operating a 300 megawatt electricity generating facility in the Dominican Republic, increasing Seaboard&#8217;s ownership interest to 29.9%. 

&#160; 

(iii) &#8195; Sources and Availability of Raw Materials 

&#160; 

None of Seaboard&#8217;s businesses utilize material amounts of raw materials that are dependent on purchases from one supplier or a small group of dominant suppliers. However, the Turkey Segment purchases a significant portion of its feed and grain used in the manufacturing of feed for its turkeys in North Carolina from Seaboard&#8217;s 50% partner in Butterball. 

&#160; 

(iv) &#8195; Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises and Concessions 

&#160; 

Seaboard uses the registered trademark of Seaboard&#174;. 

&#160; 

The Pork Division uses registered trademarks relating to its products, including Seaboard Farms&#174;, Prairie Fresh&#174;, A Taste Like No Other&#174;, St. Joe Pork&#174;, High Plains Bioenergy&#174;, Prairie Fresh Prime&#174;, Seaboard Foods&#174;, Cook in Bag&#174;, 67 th Street&#8482; and The Thrill Without The Grill&#174;. The Pork Division&#8217;s non-consolidated affiliate, Daily&#8217;s Premium Meats, LLC, uses the trademarks Daily&#8217;s&#174;, Daily&#8217;s Premium Meats Since 1893&#174;, Buffet Brand&#174; and Del Pueblo&#174;. Seaboard considers the use of these trademarks important to the marketing and promotion of its pork products. 

&#160; 

The Marine Division uses the trade name Seaboard Marine&#174; and Seaboard Solutions&#174; which are both registered trademarks. Seaboard believes there is significant recognition of these trademarks in the industry and by many of its customers. 

&#160; 

Part of the sales within the Sugar Division are made under the Chango&#174; brand in Argentina, where this division operates. Certain local sales prices are affected by government price control, primarily for one kilogram size bags, and sugar import duties imposed by the Argentine government, impacting local volume sold, as well as imported and exported volumes to and from international markets. 

&#160; 

The Turkey Segment uses registered trademarks relating to its products, including Butterball&#174; and Carolina Turkeys&#174;. Seaboard considers the use of these trademarks important to marketing and promotion of its turkey products. 

&#160; 

Patents, trademarks, franchises, licenses and concessions are not material to any of Seaboard&#8217;s other divisions. 

&#160; 

(v) &#8195; Seasonal Business 

&#160; 

The Turkey business is seasonal only on the whole bird side with Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays driving the majority of those sales. Seaboard&#8217;s other divisions are not seasonally dependent to any material extent. 

&#160; 

(vi) &#8195; Practices Relating to Working Capital Items 

&#160; 

There are no unusual industry practices or practices of Seaboard relating to working capital items. 

&#160;

FORM 10-K 

SEABOARD CORPORATION 

&#160; 

(vii) &#8195; Depending on a Single Customer or Few Customers 

&#160; 

Seaboard does not have sales to any one customer equal to 10% or more of consolidated revenues. Historically, the Commodity Trading and Milling Division derives a significant portion of its operating income from sales to a non-consolidated affiliate. The Sugar Division derives approximately 20% of its revenues from one customer. The Power Division sells power in the Dominican Republic on the spot market accessed primarily by three wholly government-owned companies. No other division has sales to a few customers which, if lost, would have a material adverse effect on any such division or on Seaboard taken as a whole. 

&#160; 

(viii) &#8195; Backlog 

&#160; 

Backlog is not material to Seaboard&#8217;s businesses. 

&#160; 

(ix) &#8195; Government Contracts 

&#160; 

No material portion of Seaboard&#8217;s business involves government contracts. 

&#160; 

(x) &#8195; Competitive Conditions 

&#160; 

Competition in Seaboard&#8217;s Pork Division comes from a variety of national, international and regional producers and processors and is based primarily on product quality, customer service and price. According to Successful Farming and Informa Economics , trade publications, Seaboard was ranked number three in pork production (based on sows in production) and number four in processing (based on daily processing capacity) in the U.S. (including Triumph volume) in 2015. 

&#160; 

Seaboard&#8217;s commodity trading business to third parties faces competition from numerous traders around the world in a very competitive environment with low margin percentages on most trades. Most of the grain processing and related businesses face competition from either imported products or other local producers in the same industries. 

&#160; 

Seaboard&#8217;s ocean liner service for cargoes faces competition based on price, reliable sailing frequencies and customer service. Seaboard believes it is among the top five ranking ocean liner services for cargoes in the Caribbean Basin and Central America based on cargo volume. 

&#160; 

Seaboard&#8217;s sugar business owns one of the largest sugar mills in Argentina and faces significant competition for sugar sales in the local Argentine market. Sugar prices in Argentina can fluctuate compared to world markets due to Argentine government price control and protection policies. High sugarcane production volumes in Argentina, in conjunction with low international sugar and alcohol prices, have increased competition in the domestic market. 

&#160; 

Seaboard&#8217;s Power Division is located in the Dominican Republic. Power generated by this division is sold on the spot market or to contract customers at prices based on market conditions and cost-based rates. 

&#160; 

Competition for the Turkey Segment comes from a variety of national and regional producers and processors and is based primarily on product quality, customer service and price. Butterball ranks as one of the nation&#8217;s top three turkey producers (based on live production). 

&#160; 

(xi) &#8195; Research and Development Activities 

&#160; 

Seaboard and its Turkey Segment each conduct research and development activities focused on various aspects of their vertically integrated pork and turkey processing systems, including improving product quality, production processes, animal genetics, nutrition and health. Incremental costs incurred to perform these tests are expensed as incurred and are not material to operating results. 

&#160; 

(xii) &#8195; Environmental Compliance 

&#160; 

Seaboard and its Turkey Segment are subject to numerous Federal, State and local provisions relating to the environment which require the expenditure of funds in the ordinary course of business. Seaboard and its Turkey 

&#160;

FORM 10-K 

SEABOARD CORPORATION 

Segment do not anticipate making expenditures for these purposes, that , in the aggregate would have a material or significant effect on Seaboard&#8217;s financial condition or results of operations. 

&#160; 

(xiii) &#8195; Number of Persons Employed by Registrant 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, Seaboard, excluding non-consolidated affiliates, had 10,772 employees, of whom 5,541 were employed in the U.S. Approximately 2,050 employees in Seaboard&#8217;s Pork Division were covered by collective bargaining agreements as of December 31, 2015. Seaboard considers its employee relations to be satisfactory. 

&#160; 

(d) 

Financial Information about Geographic Areas 

&#160; 

In addition to the narrative disclosure provided below, the financial information relating to export sales required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Seaboard&#8217;s Annual Report to Stockholders. 

&#160; 

Seaboard considers its relations with the governments of the countries in which its foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are located to be satisfactory, but foreign operations in lesser-developed countries are subject to risks of doing business such as potential civil unrests and government instabilities, increasing the exposure to potential expropriation, confiscation, war, insurrection, civil strife and revolution, sales price controls, currency inconvertibility and devaluation, and currency exchange controls. To minimize certain of these risks, Seaboard has insured its investment in an affiliated flour mill in the Democratic Republic of Congo to the extent available and deemed appropriate against certain of these risks with the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, an agency of the U.S. Government. At the date of this report, Seaboard is not aware of any situations which could have a material effect on Seaboard&#8217;s business. 

&#160;
