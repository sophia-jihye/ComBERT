 Item 1. BUSINESS. Overview 

We are a clinical stage specialty pharmaceutical company that has developed a proprietary transdermal microneedle patch system to deliver our proprietary formulations of existing drugs through the skin for the treatment of a variety of indications. Our microneedle patch system offers rapid onset, consistent drug delivery, improved ease of use and room-temperature stability, benefits that we believe often are unavailable using oral formulations or injections. Our microneedle patch system has the potential to deliver numerous medications for a wide variety of indications in commercially attractive markets. By focusing our development efforts on the delivery of established molecules with known safety and efficacy and premium pricing, we plan to reduce our clinical and regulatory risk and development costs and accelerate our time to commercialization. 

Our short-wear-time transdermal patch consists of an array of titanium microneedles that is coated with our proprietary formulation of a previously approved drug and attached to an adhesive patch. When the patch is applied with our hand-held applicator, the microneedles penetrate the skin, resulting in rapid dissolution and absorption of the drug through the capillary bed. We believe our system enables rapid and consistent delivery of the drug, with therapeutic effect typically occurring within 30 minutes or less, and easy and convenient administration. We focus on developing specific formulations of approved drugs to be administered by our microneedle patch system, for indications in which rapid onset, ease of use and stability offer significant therapeutic and practical advantages. We target indications with patient populations that we believe will provide us with an attractive commercial opportunity. Our product candidate is ZP-Triptan, our proprietary formulation of zolmitriptan, one of a class of serotonin receptor agonists known as triptans used for the treatment of migraine. In November 2015, we announced positive results from our Phase 1 clinical trial of our ZP-Triptan patch, which was conducted in healthy human subjects in Australia. The Phase 1 results demonstrated the fast absorption of ZP-Triptan that is a characteristic of our microneedle patch and applicator system, which we believe can potentially translate to fast pain relief. Recent feedback from the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, on ZP-Triptan&#146;s regulatory path has also been encouraging. The agency has indicated that one positive pivotal efficacy study, in addition to the required safety study, would be sufficient for approval of ZP-Triptan for the treatment of migraine. 

In light of these encouraging clinical data and the potential to get to an NDA submission in a relatively short timeframe, we recently made the decision to prioritize our clinical development effort on ZP-Triptan and to suspend further development related to our other product candidates, ZP-PTH and ZP-Glucagon, until such time that we can appropriately fund such development through strategic partnerships or additional financing. While we are considering pursuing clinical development of our ZP-Triptan product candidate to a meaningful milestone, we remain open to opportunities with potential strategic partners to ensure our product candidate will receive the best chance of commercial success. 

In connection with our decision to concentrate the clinical development of ZP-Triptan, we recently announced that we would streamline our organization to ensure that we effectively use our funds for this purpose. We implemented a workforce reduction of 24 employees, representing approximately 38% of our total workforce, which we expect to reduce our expenses by approximately $2.0 million, net of severance costs, for fiscal year 2016. We expect to reinvest the savings from the workforce reduction in our ZP-Triptan clinical development program. 

Our Strategy 

Our goal is to make transdermal drug delivery a standard of care for delivering drugs requiring fast onset. The key elements of our strategy are to: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Pursue indications with high unmet medical need and greater probability of clinical, regulatory and commercial success. We focus on indications in which rapid onset, ease of use and stability offer 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements &#160; particularly important therapeutic and practical advantages that address unmet needs, that have patient populations large enough to provide us with an attractive commercial opportunity, and where there is currently potential premium pricing. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Maintain focus on effective execution of clinical trials. We believe that timely and efficient execution of our clinical development plans has been critical to our success to date. We intend to continue to maintain, as a primary focus of our efforts, excellence in execution of our clinical development plan for ZP-Triptan while effectively managing our available cash resources. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Build a balanced portfolio of proprietary and partnered programs. We have retained world-wide commercial rights to all of our product candidates. For product candidates that are outside of our immediate and core area of interest, or where a partner can contribute specific expertise, we intend to evaluate collaborations with strategic partners to further the clinical and commercial development of such product candidates. We are continuing our internally funded development efforts with respect to ZP-Triptan, while simultaneously pursuing partnering opportunities for it, as well as our ZP-PTH and ZP-Glucagon programs. We also intend to selectively collaborate with third parties with respect to the delivery of their proprietary drugs using our microneedle patch system. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Continue to refine our next generation drug delivery platform. We believe that each of the currently available methods of drug administration has significant disadvantages. Oral and nasal products are typically characterized by relatively slow onset of action, and the use of injectables can cause discomfort. We intend to continue to refine our next generation microneedle patch system through enhanced portability and improved ease of use. 

Our Development Pipeline 

We have tested our microneedle patch system in preclinical and clinical proof of concept studies that demonstrated its technical feasibility with approximately thirty compounds, ranging from small molecules to proteins. Based on our research, we believe that our microneedle patch system can be used to deliver treatments for a wide variety of indications beyond those on which we are currently focused, in which our fast onset, room-temperature stability, and ease of use will fill what we believe is a significant unmet need. 

The following table summarizes the status of our development programs that we are currently seeking to partner: 

&#160;

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements Our Product Candidate Actively in Development 

ZP-Triptan for Migraine 

The focus of our development efforts is on our product candidate ZP-Triptan, our proprietary formulation of zolmitriptan, one of a class of serotonin receptor agonists known as triptans, used for the treatment of migraine. Migraine is a debilitating neurological disease, symptoms of which include moderate to severe headache pain, nausea and vomiting, and abnormal sensitivity to light and sound. Our ZP-Triptan microneedle patch is applied to an individual&#146;s upper arm to deliver zolmitriptan to the body, with the objective of providing rapid onset relief from headache symptoms. 

Large Market and Attractive Treatment Alternative 

According to the Migraine Research Foundation, migraine affects 30 million men, women and children in the United States. Most migraines last between four and 24 hours, but some last as long as three days. According to published studies, 63% of migraine patients experience between one and four migraines per month. According to a 2014 study by Global Data Pharma Point, sales of prescriptions for medications indicated for migraine in the United States were approximately $1.9 billion in 2012. Of this amount, $1.1 billion was for triptans. 

We believe that each of the currently available methods of administering triptans, including oral, nasal spray, subcutaneous injection and iontophorectic transdermal patch (which is a device that delivers medicine through the skin by a low electrical current), has significant disadvantages. Some migraine patients fail to respond consistently to oral triptans, and oral treatments may be ineffectual for patients who are suffering from the nausea or gastric stasis that can be associated with migraine. Oral, nasal and iontophoretic patch triptan products are also characterized by relatively slow onset of action. Nasal sprays may be unpleasant in taste, and use of injectables can cause discomfort. Because ZP-Triptan has demonstrated fast onset in preclinical studies, does not depend on gastrointestinal absorption, and provides easy, administration, we believe it could provide an attractive alternative to currently marketed triptan products for the treatment of migraine. 

Fast Onset Demonstrated 

In migraine, time to maximum drug concentration in blood, or T max , closely correlates to speed of onset of pain relief and has also been shown to be correlated with completeness of pain relief and pain freedom over time. Relief at two hours is the standard endpoint used in migraine studies and represents the percentage of patients reporting a reduction of migraine symptoms from a classification of severe or moderate to mild or none within two hours after taking the medication. 

&#160;

Phase 1 Clinical Trial Results 

In November 2015, we announced positive results from the Phase 1 clinical trial of our ZP-Triptan patch. This Phase 1 clinical trial of ZP-Triptan was conducted in Australia. The objectives of the Phase 1 clinical study were to evaluate the tolerability and pharmacokinetics of the ZP-Triptan patch in healthy volunteers. The crossover study among 20 healthy volunteers tested five doses of ZP-Triptan compared to an oral administration of zolmitriptan and additionally a subcutaneous injection of sumatriptan. ZP-Triptan demonstrated rapid absorption compared to the zolmitriptan tablet. During the first part of the clinical study, the 20 participants were randomized and received the following treatments: a 0.48 mg ZP-Triptan patch, two 0.48 mg ZP-Triptan patches, a 1.9 mg ZP-Triptan patch, a 2.5 mg oral zolmitriptan tablet, and a subcutaneous injection of 6mg of sumatriptan, a common treatment for migraine headaches. During the second and third parts of the study, subjects received higher doses, consisting of two 1.9 mg ZP-Triptan patches and one 3.8 mg ZP-Triptan patch, respectively, for assessment of tolerability and pharmacokinetics. 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements ZP-Triptan patch was well-tolerated and rapid absorption was observed which we believe may translate to fast pain relief for migraine patients. The Phase 1 results demonstrating the fast absorption of ZP-Triptan that is characteristic of Zosano&#146;s microneedle patch and applicator system are illustrated below:

All treatments were well tolerated and no significant safety issues were identified. The results for the sumatriptan injection were similar to those reported in previous studies. 

We believe that the pharmacokinetic and tolerability results in healthy volunteers show that our ZP-Triptan microneedle patch system could provide considerable clinical advantages over zolmitriptan tablets in the treatment of acute migraine. In this Phase 1 pharmacokinetic study, ZP-Triptan demonstrated rapid absorption and reduced metabolism to the active metabolite with the lowered potential for drug-drug interactions and adverse events via a method that does not depend on gastrointestinal absorption or the discomfort of an injection. 

Planned Pivotal Efficacy and Safety Trials 

We plan to submit an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for ZP-Triptan to the FDA in the second quarter of 2016. Thereafter, we plan to sponsor a U.S. study to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of ZP-Triptan, when used for the acute treatment of migraine. 

The first planned study is a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled comparison of three doses of ZP-Triptan (1.0 mg, 1.9 mg, and 3.8 mg) and placebo for the treatment of a single migraine attack. The co-primary endpoints for the study are those defined in the October 2014 FDA Draft Guidance&#151;&#147;Migraine: &#160; Developing Drugs for Acute Treatment &#148;, on pain and most bothersome symptom freedom. Subjects will record their 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements migraine symptoms in a patient diary, prior to treatment, and at varying intervals following treatment, out to 48 hours. Safety will be assessed by adverse events reported and other standard safety measures. 

While we are considering pursuing clinical development of our ZP-Triptan product candidate to a meaningful milestone, we remain open to opportunities with potential strategic partners to ensure our product candidate will receive the best chance of commercial success. 

Our Partnering Product Candidates 

Our clinical trials of product candidates ZP-PTH for the treatment of severe osteoporosis and ZP-Glucagon for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia have also yielded promising clinical data. In light of our decision to prioritize ZP-Triptan, we currently are not devoting substantial resources to further clinical development of ZP-PTH and ZP-Glucagon, and are actively seeking partnering opportunities with them. These product candidates and their clinical progress are described below. 

ZP-PTH for Osteoporosis 

Our product candidate ZP-PTH is our proprietary formulation of teriparatide, a synthetic form of parathyroid hormone, which we refer to as PTH 1-34, or PTH, which regulates serum calcium, to be administered for the treatment of severe osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is a disease primarily affecting post- menopausal women that is characterized by low bone mineral and structural deterioration of bone tissue, which can lead to an increase in bone fractures. According to the World Health Organization and the International Osteoporosis Foundation, a patient has severe osteoporosis when he or she has a T-score &#060; -2.5 (meaning that the patient has a bone mineral density, or BMD, that is two and a one-half standard deviations below the mean BMD of an ethnically matched thirty-year old man or woman, as applicable), plus one or more fragility fractures. 

We believe that the two main types of osteoporosis drugs currently available in the United States, anti- resorptive agents and an anabolic agent, either have shortcomings in efficacy and safety or often times provide patients with a less than optimal treatment administration experience. Our ZP-PTH product candidate is intended to provide a convenient, easy-to-use, room-temperature-stable alternative for osteoporosis patients. We have developed a daily and a weekly dose regimen of ZP-PTH and have successfully completed a Phase 2 clinical trial on Daily ZP-PTH and a Phase 1 clinical trial on Weekly ZP-PTH. 

We completed a Phase 2 clinical trial of Daily ZP-PTH in the United States (in connection with which we submitted an investigational new drug application, or IND, to the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA), Mexico and Argentina in 2008, and we held End-of-Phase 2 meetings with the FDA and similar meetings with European regulatory authorities in 2009. 

In 2013, we completed a Phase 1 clinical trial of our Weekly ZP-PTH in Australia and the study demonstrated pulsatile performance with all six patch doses, which is a significant factor for anabolic efficacy. We had a pre-IND meeting with the FDA in July 2014 and discussed the clinical study design for a planned Phase 2 study. 

We believe that we have made significant progress in the clinical development of our ZP-PTH product candidate. We have retained world-wide commercial rights to both Daily ZP-PTH and Weekly ZP-PTH. We intend to evaluate collaboration with strategic partners to further the clinical and commercial development of Daily ZP-PTH and Weekly ZP-PTH. 

Large Osteoporosis Market with Significant Unmet Needs 

Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by low BMD and structural deterioration of bone tissue, which can lead to an increase in bone fractures. It mainly affects adults age 50 and older. The National Osteoporosis Foundation, or NOF, estimates that approximately nine million adults in the United States have osteoporosis and more than 43 million have low bone mass, placing them at increased risk for osteoporosis and broken bones. In addition, the NOF has estimated that osteoporosis is responsible for more than two million bone fractures in the United States per year resulting in an estimated $19 billion in costs. 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements Two main types of osteoporosis drugs are currently available in the United States: anti-resorptive agents and anabolic agents. Anti-resorptive agents act to prevent bone loss by inhibiting the breakdown of bone, whereas anabolic agents stimulate bone formation to build new, high-quality bone. We believe that existing anti-resorptive therapies have shortcomings in efficacy, tolerability and convenience. In part due to these limitations, anabolic agents are generally used as an alternative to anti-resorptive agents. For example, bisphosphonates, the current standard of care and a type of anti-resorptive agent, do not stimulate new bone growth, and have been associated with infrequent but serious adverse events, such as osteonecrosis of the jaw (a bone disease where the jaw bone begins to weaken and die), atrial fibrillation, and anomalous bone fractures, especially of long bones, resulting from &#147;frozen bone&#148; (a condition that shuts down the body&#146;s natural process of bone breakdown and regeneration). We believe that this limitation on their efficacy and safety concerns related to these serious adverse events which may limit their duration of use, has created demand for bone anabolic agents as an alternative to anti-resorptive agents. 

The only anabolic agent approved in the United States for the treatment of severe osteoporosis is teriparatide, which is marketed by Eli Lilly &#38; Company, or Lilly, as Forteo &#174; , which must be injected daily and is unstable at room temperature. Based on our 2010 osteoporosis market survey, we estimated that in 2010 only 6% of the treated population of severe osteoporosis patients in the United States received prescriptions for Forteo &#174; . Nevertheless, worldwide sales of Forteo &#174; in 2015 were approximately $1.35 billion. We believe there is significant opportunity for a convenient and easy to use alternative for osteoporosis patients. 

Completed Daily ZP-PTH Phase 2 Clinical Development 

In 2008, we completed a Phase 2 clinical trial of Daily ZP-PTH. The objective of the study was to determine the safety and efficacy of our microneedle patch system compared to a placebo patch and a subcutaneous teriparatide 20 &#181;g injection in post-menopausal women with osteoporosis. The Daily ZP-PTH Phase 2 clinical trial demonstrated the fast-on, fast-off pharmacokinetic profile we believe is critical for strong anabolic effect, which we believe contributed to the increases in lumbar spine and hip BMD illustrated in the tables immediately below. 

&#160;

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements In the tables above, the confidence interval, or CI, means a range of values for a variable of the measure of treatment effect, constructed so that this range has a specified probability of including the true value of the variable. P-value, or p, means the level of marginal significance within a statistical hypothesis test, representing the probability of the occurrence of a given event. 

The pharmacokinetic profile for all patch doses showed a faster time to peak concentration and a shorter apparent half-life than the subcutaneous teriparatide 20 &#181;g injection, as illustrated in the following tables: 

In terms of safety, the mean serum calcium for all Daily ZP-PTH doses increased moderately, but remained within the normal range. None of the patients discontinued the trial due to hypercalcemia (which is an elevated level of calcium in the blood) or hypercalciuria (which is an elevated level of calcium in the urine), potentially dangerous conditions with cardiovascular risk. During the six months of therapy, there was no clinically significant, or outside the range of normal, hypercalcemia observed and there were no clinically significant changes in liver functions, renal functions, blood counts or electrocardiograms. Also, no antibodies against PTH were detected nor any skin infection observed in any of the Daily ZP-PTH treatment groups. 

In summary, the Daily ZP-PTH Phase 2 trial demonstrated that transdermal delivery of PTH using our microneedle patch system increased bone density over six months, and demonstrated: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; a faster T MAX , a higher C MAX and a shorter half-life (critical to the efficacy of an anabolic) observed with the Daily ZP-PTH patch versus Forteo. &#174; T MAX is a measure of the time after administration of a drug when it reaches the highest serum concentration. C MAX is a measure of the peak serum concentration achieved after the drug has been administered; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; comparable efficacy compared to Forteo &#174; as measured by both six-month spine BMD and six-month hip BMD, even with lower bioavailability versus Forteo &#174; . Bioavailability is the degree and rate at which an administered dose of unchanged drug is absorbed into the body and reaches the blood. 

Weekly ZP-PTH Phase 1 Clinical Study 

During the fourth quarter of 2013, we commenced a Phase 1 clinical study in healthy post-menopausal women of a single application of one or two Weekly ZP-PTH transdermal patches coated with doses ranging from 60 &#181;g to 160 &#181;g of teriparatide, compared to subcutaneous injections of teriparatide at doses of 20 &#181;g or 57 &#181;g. The design was a single-center, open-label, randomized eight-way crossover study in 32 subjects. Test treatments included single patches of 60 &#181;g, 120 &#181;g, 160 &#181;g doses, two patches of 60 &#181;g (120 &#181;g total PTH), two patches of 90 &#181;g (180 &#181;g total PTH), two patches of 120 &#181;g (240 &#181;g total PTH), and doses of two active injectable comparators: teriparatide 20 &#181;g (Forteo &#174; ) by subcutaneous injection, and teriparatide 57 &#181;g 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements (Teribone&#153;) by subcutaneous injection. The rationale of the patch dose selection was driven by our desire to replicate the demonstrated efficacy of 28 &#181;g and 57 &#181;g subcutaneous injections in studies conducted by Asahi Kasei Pharma Corporation, or Asahi, while adjusting for a higher bio mass index in a Caucasian population. 

As indicated by the chart below, showing mean results, the Phase 1 study demonstrated pulsatile performance with all patch doses, which we believe is a significant factor for anabolic efficacy. 

Zosano Ph1: Assess Pulsatile Delivery and Adequate Bioavailability 

with Patch Doses vs. Injectable (n=32) 

&#160;

The study results also demonstrated: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The bioavailability of our selected patch doses bracketed the subcutaneous doses of 28 &#181;g and 57 &#181;g, which have proven to be efficacious in reducing fractures in Japanese patients. Our patches illustrated high bioavailability, dose proportionality in ascending doses in the single-patch systems, and dose proportionality in ascending doses in the two-patch systems, enabling us the flexibility of dose selection for future clinical studies; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; With all weekly doses on one- or two-patch systems, we achieved the desired pulsatile pharmacokinetic profile which we believe is critical for anabolic efficacy. We observed pulsatile pharmacokinetic profile comparable to that in our Daily ZP-PTH Phase 2 study and in our 2008 005 ZP-PTH study. 

Patch doses were similarly tolerated when compared to Forteo &#174; and Teribone&#153;. The Phase 1 study was conducted in Australia and, as such, was not subject to an IND and was conducted in compliance with applicable Australian regulations. 

We had a pre-IND meeting with the FDA, a meeting required for the filing of an investigational new drug application, or IND, in July 2014 to discuss the clinical study design for our Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies of Weekly ZP-PTH. 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements Demonstrated 36-Month Stability of ZP-PTH Formulation 

The stability of a drug formulation means the extent to which the formulation is able to maintain its physical and chemical properties over time under specified environmental storage conditions. In our internal studies, our Daily ZP-PTH formulation coated on the patch and stored at room temperature in its sealed, nitrogen-filled package retained over 98% of its purity for 12 months and over 97% of its purity after 36 months. By contrast, Forteo &#174; retained less than 87% of its purity after 12 months when stored at room temperature, and less than 95% of its purity after 12 months when under refrigeration (2-8&#176;C). 

Strategic Alliance with Eli Lilly and Company 

In November 2014, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Eli Lilly and Company, or Lilly, to develop a formulation of ZP-PTH to be administered daily using our microneedle patch system for the treatment of osteoporosis. Under the terms of the agreement, we granted to Lilly an exclusive, worldwide license to commercialize any ZP-PTH product using our microneedle patch system. We were responsible, at our own expense, for developing Daily ZP-PTH, including clinical, regulatory and manufacturing scale-up activities. Lilly would be responsible, pending successful clinical study outcomes and regulatory approval, for commercialization of our Daily ZP-PTH product. We had the right to terminate the agreement at any time prior to regulatory approval of Daily ZP-PTH in the United States or Japan if we determined that a critical success factor under the agreement was commercially or scientifically unreasonable to achieve and we discontinued development of Daily ZP-PTH. 

In September 2015, we terminated the collaboration agreement in accordance with the terms following our determination that it was commercially unreasonable to pursue one of the critical success factors under the agreement, relating to the required timing of worldwide regulatory approval of Daily ZP-PTH by 2019. 

As a result of the termination of the agreement, the exclusive, worldwide license that we granted to Lilly terminated and reverted to us, and we will no longer be eligible to receive any milestone or other payments from Lilly. If, prior to August 19, 2019, we decide to resume development of Daily ZP-PTH, then we will be required to notify Lilly and offer to reinstate the collaboration agreement on the same terms or on other mutually agreeable terms. 

We also entered into a common stock purchase agreement with Lilly in November 2014 pursuant to which Lilly has purchased $15 million worth of our common stock in a private placement concurrent with the closing of our initial public offering of shares of our common stock, at a price per share equal to the initial public offering price. On January 30, 2015, concurrent with the closing of our initial public offering, we issued and sold 1,363,636 shares of our common stock to Lilly and received net proceeds of $14.5 million pursuant to the common stock purchase agreement. As of December 31, 2015, Lilly beneficially owned more than ten percent of our outstanding common stock. 

ZP-Glucagon for Severe Hypoglycemia 

Our product candidate ZP-Glucagon is our proprietary formulation of glucagon, a hormone that raises blood glucose levels, intended for the emergency rescue of patients suffering from life-threatening, severe hypoglycemia. Severe hypoglycemia is a complication of diabetes treatment, often caused by insulin overdose, characterized by a very low level of blood glucose that can lead to loss of consciousness, seizure, coma and death. Timely treatment is critical, and may need to be administered to an incapacitated patient in a life- threatening situation by a third party who lacks medical training. We believe that ZP-Glucagon delivered using our microneedle patch system will offer patients and caregivers a simple device providing rapid onset and enhanced ease of use, as well as extended room temperature stability, compared with the two glucagon products currently marketed in the United States. 

In January 2014 we completed a Phase 1 trial that demonstrated faster onset, a higher bioavailability and lower variability (which is the range of the data points from the trial showing the measure of the treatment&#146;s 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements effect in relation to the mean of the data points) with ZP-Glucagon treatments compared to glucagon injection. The Phase 1 trial was conducted in Australia and, as such, was not subject to an IND and was conducted in compliance with applicable Australian regulations. 

In October 2015 we announced positive Phase 2 clinical trial results on our ZP-Glucagon patch program for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia. The objective of our Phase 2 clinical trial in Australia was to evaluate the performance of our ZP-Glucagon patch in Type 1 diabetic patients at 0.5 milligram, or mg, and 1.0 mg doses, with induction of hypoglycemia, in comparison to comparable doses of glucagon administered by intramuscular injection. Both ZP-Glucagon patch doses normalized blood sugar in 100 percent of the subjects. Both patch doses had rapid onset of action and time to glucose response was similar among the two modes of administration. All treatments were well tolerated and no new safety issues were identified. 

We believe that we have made significant progress in the clinical development of our ZP-Glucagon product candidate and intend to evaluate strategic opportunities with a corporate partner to further its clinical and commercial development. 

Underserved Severe Hypoglycemia Market 

Severe hypoglycemia is a life-threatening potential complication of diabetes treatment, for which timely treatment is critical. The current standard of care in a severe hypoglycemic event is administration of glucagon by injection or infusion. The treatment is typically provided by a third party, caregiver or a bystander, as the patient is typically unable to self-administer the drug. Despite the risks involved with hypoglycemia, many insulin-dependent patients do not carry glucagon rescue kits. 

There are 21 million diagnosed diabetes patients in the United States, of whom 26% are insulin-dependent. Insulin-dependent patients have on average 1.2 severe hypoglycemic events per year. There are currently two glucagon products marketed in the United States: Glucagon Emergency Kit by Lilly and GlucaGen &#174; by Novo Nordisk. Based on a market survey of the hypoglycemia market commissioned by us in 2013, we estimate that in 2012, sales of these products exceeded $120 million in the United States with units sold at an average wholesale price of $188 per unit, and that the injectable glucagon market is growing at approximately 15% year- over-year, largely driven by ongoing price increases. 

The two glucagon products currently marketed in the United States for severe hypoglycemia are both injectables. Due to its chemical constitution, the glucagon molecule is inherently unstable, and both commercially available products require a multi-step reconstitution process prior to use. Reconstitution and injection are typically administered by a third party who may lack medical training. 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements We believe that ZP-Glucagon delivered using our microneedle patch system will offer patients and caregivers the benefit of a simple, easy-to-use device with rapid onset, room temperature stability and enhanced portability, benefits that we believe will encourage patients to carry our product as a glucagon rescue kit. 

&#160;

&#160; We expect our finished product to be a single-use, disposable, pre-loaded microneedle patch system. We have designed our product to be intuitive and to be administered with a simple &#147;press-and-apply&#148; action without requiring any cumbersome reconstitution. We intend to introduce a Generation 1 product consisting of our existing 3 cm2 patch and a single use applicator. 

The practical advantages afforded by the room-temperature stability of our microneedle patch system, eliminating the need for reconstitution and allowing for immediate administration, may be as important as the therapeutic benefits of rapid onset. We believe that our formulation of ZP-Glucagon, which we have demonstrated is stable for at least six months, will enable us to market ZP-Glucagon as a ready-to-use product. In our most recent stability studies with the formulations of glucagon that we plan to use in our future clinical trials (Formulation C and Formulation D), the formulations demonstrated purity levels in excess of 99% after six months at 40&#176;C, or in excess of 100&#176;F, a temperature significantly higher than room temperature, and consistent with the ambient temperatures that might be encountered in a warm climate by a patient carrying the product in a pocket or purse. 

Completed Phase 1 Clinical Trial 

In January 2014, we completed a Phase 1 trial of ZP-Glucagon designed to assess relative bioavailability with our microneedle patch system on a 3cm2 patch compared to GlucaGen &#174; administered by intramuscular injection. We compared subjects across multiple application sites with two formulations (formulation C and formulation D) in a single-center, open-label, randomized five-way crossover study using 0.5 mg on both the ZP- Glucagon patch and GlucaGen &#174; . The study included 20 healthy volunteer subjects. 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements We achieved a faster onset and a higher bioavailability with each of the ZP-Glucagon treatments vs. the Glucagon intramuscular injection. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data are shown in the graphs below.

Completed Phase 2 Clinical Trial 

In October 2015, we completed a Phase 2 clinical trial in Australia to evaluate the performance of our ZP-Glucagon product candidate in Type 1 diabetic patients at 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg doses, with induction of hypoglycemia, in comparison to comparable doses of glucagon administered by intramuscular injection, or IM. 

The Phase 2 clinical trial investigated the safety and efficacy of ZP-Glucagon in the treatment of insulin- induced hypoglycemia in diabetic patients (as opposed to healthy volunteers, as used in our Phase 1 clinical trial). Based on the higher bioavailability results from our Phase 1 clinical trial, it is possible that we could have a therapeutic patch dose with a coated amount less than 1 mg. Therefore, in our Phase 2 trial, we were testing both a single patch dose of 0.5 mg and two patches of 0.5 mg (total dose of 1.0 mg) compared to 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg of intramuscular injection. 

Our Phase 2 clinical trial was a four-way crossover study with 16 diabetic patients, each of whom was administered the following four doses: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; One patch of ZP-Glucagon 0.5 mg applied on the upper arm; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Two patches of ZP-Glucagon 0.5 mg applied on the upper arm; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Intramuscular injections of 1.0 mg commercial glucagon; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Intramuscular injections of 0.5 mg commercial glucagon. 

The primary endpoints in this study were as follows: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Time to increase in blood glucose concentration from baseline by 50 mg/dl; 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements &#160; &#149; &#160; Blood glucose concentration change from baseline 15 minutes after treatment administration; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Maximal change from baseline in blood glucose concentration; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Incidence of adverse events. 

In October 2015 we announced positive Phase 2 clinical trial results on our ZP-Glucagon patch program for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia when all of our primary endpoints have been met. Our Phase 2 clinical trial results showed: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Both of our 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg ZP-Glucagon patch doses normalized blood sugar in 100 percent of the study subjects; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Both 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg ZP-Glucagon patch doses demonstrated rapid onset of action and time to glucose response was similar among the patch and injection modes of administration; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Maximal plasma concentrations of glucagon for the patch treatments were higher than those of the IM injections. The time to reach the maximum concentration was faster with the patches (7.7 and 10.2 minutes) compared to the IM injections (14.6 and 16.6 minutes); and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; All treatments were well tolerated and no new safety issues were identified. 

GLP-1 for Type 2 Diabetes 

In July 2015, we announced that Novo Nordisk A/S, or Novo Nordisk, notified us of its intention to discontinue the collaboration, development and license agreement that we entered into with Novo Nordisk in January 2014 related to development of a transdermal presentation of select Novo Nordisk glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues, to be administered once weekly using our microneedle patch system for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. We were notified that Novo Nordisk&#146;s decision was related to a strategic prioritization of Novo Nordisk&#146;s research portfolio despite continued progress during the collaboration period. Upon the termination of the collaboration agreement, which became effective on October 27, 2015, all 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements technology rights licensed to Novo Nordisk related to the field of GLP-1 products reverted to us. We received a non-refundable upfront payment of $1 million upon entering into the collaboration agreement in January 2014. We will no longer be eligible to receive any milestone or other payments from Novo Nordisk. 

Our Research Programs 

Our internal research and development programs involve generic molecules with demonstrated safety and efficacy and a low clinical and regulatory risk relative to new chemical entities, or NCEs. We believe that these programs will have a shorter development time and lower cost to commercialization than typical NCEs. In selecting our development candidates we consider the therapeutic advantage of rapid onset, the size of the market, the level of competition and the potential selling price. 

Our microneedle patch system consists of a 3 to 6 cm 2 array of titanium microneedles approximately 200-350 microns long, coated with a hydrophilic formulation of the relevant drug, and attached to an adhesive patch. The maximum amount of active drug that can be coated on a patch&#146;s microneedle array depends on the active molecule of the drug formulation, the weight of the excipients in the drug formulation, and the coatable surface area of the microneedle array. For example, we use patches with 2 cm 2 , 3 cm 2 and 6 cm 2 microneedle arrays, and, based on our testing, we believe that the maximum amount of zolmitriptan that can be coated on a patch with a 6 cm 2 microneedle array is approximately 3.5 mg. The patch is applied with a hand-held applicator that presses the microneedles into the skin to a uniform depth in each application, close to the capillary bed, allowing for rapid and consistent dissolution and absorption of the drug coating, yet short of the nerve endings in the skin. The typical patch wear time is thirty minutes or less, avoiding skin irritation. 

Our drug formulations are dry, hydrophilic formulations and the final packaging contains a desiccant and is purged with nitrogen to remove any traces of moisture and oxygen. These features help provide extended product stability and longer shelf life at room temperature than conventional liquid formulations. We have demonstrated an initial six-month shelf life at up to 40 degrees Celsius for our ZP-Glucagon product candidate. 

We have tested our microneedle patch system in preclinical and clinical proof of concept studies that demonstrated its technical feasibility with approximately thirty (30) compounds, ranging from small molecules to proteins. Based on this research, we believe that our microneedle patch system can be used to deliver treatments for a wide variety of indications beyond those on which are currently focused, in which our fast onset, room-temperature stability, and ease of use will fill a significant unmet need. 

We intend, independently or through strategic collaborations with others, to explore other potential applications of our microneedle patch system. We anticipate that our internal development programs will focus on delivery of generic drugs, and that we will collaborate with third parties with respect to delivery of their proprietary drugs. 

Competition 

Competition for our product candidates 

The development and commercialization of new products to treat severe osteoporosis, severe hypoglycemia and migraine is highly competitive, and there will be considerable competition from major pharmaceutical, biotechnology and specialty pharmaceutical companies. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources than we do. In addition, many of these companies have longer operating histories and more experience than us in preclinical and clinical development, manufacturing, regulatory and global commercialization. 

Companies marketing products that treat migraine that may compete with our ZP-Triptan product candidate include Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc., Zogenix, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, AstraZeneca plc and Allergan, Inc. Companies marketing or developing products that treat severe osteoporosis that may compete with our ZP-PTH product candidate include Amgen, Inc., Lilly and Radius Health, Inc. Companies marketing products that treat severe hypoglycemia that may compete with our ZP-Glucagon product candidate include Novo Nordisk and Lilly. 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements Competition in drug delivery platforms 

In addition to competition from major pharmaceutical, biotechnology and specialty pharmaceutical companies that develop and market products that compete against those that we develop, we face additional competition from companies that may develop and license drug delivery platforms similar to ours (including transdermal microneedle patches), and from alternative formulations and methods of delivery of the drugs on which we have focused, including oral formulations, nasal sprays, transdermal patches, intramuscular and subcutaneous injection and infusion. Such companies include, but are not limited to, 3M Company, Corium International, Inc. and Pantec Biosolutions AG. 

Research and Development 

As of December 31, 2015 , our research and development organization consisted of 56 employees, located in our headquarters in Fremont, California. Our research and development organization was reduced to 27 employees after the workforce reduction initiative implemented on March 24, 2016. Our research and development staff is focused primarily on development of our ZP-Triptan product candidate. They have broad knowledge and skills in a range of disciplines applicable to formulation of drugs and the design and manufacture of our microneedle patch system. Our research and development group has particular expertise in two areas critical to our success: developing drug formulations that can be delivered using our microneedle patch system and optimizing the system to deliver those drugs. 

The goals of our research and development efforts are to identify and develop drugs that can be delivered using our microneedle patch system and optimize the system to deliver those drugs. In the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we incurred $20.4 million and $11.0 million, respectively, of research and development expense. See Part II&#150;Item 7&#150;&#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#148; of this report for additional detail regarding our research and development activities. 

We operate a current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, compliant manufacturing facility in Fremont, California, and believe we have adequate manufacturing capabilities and capacity to produce our microneedle patch system for preclinical and Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials of all of our product candidates and pivotal Phase 3 trials of most of our product candidates. In order to expand our manufacturing capabilities for large scale production, we are exploring both internal and outsourced manufacturing and supply alternatives. We purchase various components or intermediates of our microneedle patch system from third-party vendors, including the metal foil and formed micro-arrays, active pharmaceutical ingredients and excipients, inner ring, adhesive backing, ring and backing assembly, outer ring and primary and secondary packing components. All of these components and intermediaries are available from multiple sources. We also outsource the manufacturing of our applicators. 

The manufacturing process for our microneedle patch system consists of two primary operations: (1) the formation of the microneedle array, involving etching of titanium foil and subsequent hydro-forming; and (2) application of the drug formulation to the microneedle array. 

Once a microneedle array is completed, we attach it to an inner ring housing the adhesive backing layer, which we purchase from a third party manufacturer. This is performed at our facility using a semi-automatic assembly process. We apply the drug formulation to the microneedle array by a contact process whereby the titanium needles are dipped in a liquid drug formulation until the specified amount of drug is applied to the microneedle array. We then attach an outer ring to the assembly using a mechanical press fit on the same equipment used for coating the microneedle array. The outer ring is made from a polymer material, which is readily available from multiple suppliers. We then insert the patch assembly into the primary packaging, which is purged with nitrogen for longer shelf life. We perform substantially all product testing in-house. 

We intend to explore alliances with contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to expand our manufacturing capacity as we believe this will be critical to support the late-stage development, launch and commercial production of our product candidates. 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements Intellectual Property 

We regard our technology as proprietary. Our strategy is to rely on a combination of patent, trade secret and trademark laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, and to rely on license and confidentiality agreements to further protect our proprietary technology and brand. The laws of some countries in which our products are licensed may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. 

As of December 31, 2015, we held exclusive licenses to or owned 26 United States patents and six United States patent applications, as well as numerous foreign counterpart patents and patent applications (including two Patent Cooperation Treaty patent applications), covering key features of our microneedle patch system, such as formulation, coating, array design, patch anchoring, patch application, delivery, manufacturing and packaging. 

We license all of these patents and patent applications, other than an issued patent for Glucagon formulation and new applicator design application described below, from ALZA Corporation, or ALZA, on an exclusive basis for all countries. These patents and patent applications are foundational and apply generally to each of our product candidates and their related applicators. Under the terms of the license agreement with ALZA, we are responsible for all development and development costs related to our transdermal microneedle patch system. We are also responsible for commercializing our transdermal microneedle patch system, including preparing and paying for all related regulatory filings. We are obligated to pay ALZA royalties in the low to mid-single digits on sales by us of products that would otherwise infringe one of the licensed patents or that is developed by us based on certain ALZA know-how or inventions, and to pay ALZA amounts equal to the greater of royalties in the low to mid- single digits on sales by our sublicensees of such products or a percentage in the mid-teens to low twenties of royalties received by us on sales by our sublicensees of such products. We are also obligated to pay ALZA a percentage of non-royalty revenue that we receive from our sublicensees based on sales of such products. The license agreement will terminate upon the expiration of our obligations to make the royalty and other payments described above to ALZA. Additionally, we may terminate the agreement at any time for convenience upon prior written notice to ALZA, and either party may terminate the agreement upon a material breach of the agreement by the other party. 

We have filed two United States patent applications and two Patent Cooperation Treaty patent applications covering our single-use applicator and formulation of ZP-Glucagon. The ZP-Glucagon patent was issued in November 2015 with an expiration date of 2034. 

The last of our issued technology platform patents will expire in 2027. We believe that the long life of our patent portfolio may make collaborating with us particularly attractive for third parties seeking to extend the lifecycle of profitable drugs nearing the expiration of their patent protection. 

We rely on trade secrets to protect substantial portions of our technology. We generally seek to protect these trade secrets by entering into non-disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions with our employees, consultants and customers, and have restricted access to our manufacturing facilities and other technology. 

Government Regulation and Product Approval 

United States&#151;FDA Process 

The research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution and marketing, among other things, of our products are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and its implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending new drug applications, or NDAs, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions and/or criminal prosecution. We expect each of our 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements product candidates will be subject to review by the FDA as a drug/device combination product under NDA standards. Medical products containing a combination of new drugs, biological products or medical devices are regulated as &#147;combination products&#148; in the United States. A combination product generally is defined as a product comprised of components from two or more regulatory categories (e.g., drug/device, device/biologic, drug/biologic). Each component of a combination product is subject to the requirements established by the FDA for that type of component, whether a new drug, biologic or device. In order to facilitate pre-market review of combination products, the FDA designates one of its centers to have primary jurisdiction for the pre-market review and regulation of the overall product based upon a determination by the FDA of the primary mode of action of the combination product. The determination whether a product is a combination product or two separate products is made by the FDA on a case-by-case basis. We have discussed our development strategy with the FDA on our ZP-Triptan program. We have had ongoing discussions with the FDA on ZP-Glucagon. 

Drug Approval Process 

None of our product candidates may be marketed in the United States until the product has received FDA approval. The steps to be completed before a drug may be marketed in the United States include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA&#146;s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials in the U.S. may begin and must be updated annually; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each indication to the FDA&#146;s satisfaction; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; submission to the FDA of an NDA; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with cGMP regulations; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; FDA review and approval of the NDA. 

Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials in the U.S. may begin. An IND will automatically become effective thirty days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions about issues such as the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. We submitted an IND to the FDA in connection with our Phase 2 trial of Daily ZP-PTH in 2008, but we have not submitted an IND to the FDA for ZP-Glucagon. We are planning to submit an IND on ZP-Triptan in connection with our planned Phase 2 efficacy study in 2016. We cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trial to begin. 

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials necessary for product approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. The study protocol and informed consent information for study subjects in clinical trials must also be approved by an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, for each institution where the trials will be conducted, and each IRB must monitor the study until completion. Study subjects must sign an informed consent form before participating in a clinical trial. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive good clinical practice, or GCP, regulations and regulations for informed consent and privacy of individually identifiable information. 

Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and of the clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including information on the manufacture and 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements composition of the drug, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Section 505(b)(1) and Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA are the provisions governing the type of NDAs that may be submitted under the FDCA. Section 505(b)(1) is the traditional pathway for new chemical entities when no other new drug containing the same active pharmaceutical ingredient or active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance, has been approved by the FDA. As an alternate pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations of previously approved products, a company may file a Section 505(b)(2) NDA. Section 505(b)(2) permits the submission of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The FDA reviews any NDA submitted to ensure that it is sufficiently complete for substantive review before the FDA accepts the NDA for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept the NDA for filing. Even if the NDA is filed, companies cannot be sure that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. The FDA may also refer the application to an appropriate advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of the advisory committee, but it typically follows such recommendations. 

The FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, or may condition the approval of an NDA on other changes to the proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct post-marketing testing or clinical trials and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. Further, the FDA may place conditions on approvals including the requirement for a REMS to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA requires a REMS, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following the initial marketing of the product. 

Before approving an NDA, the FDA usually will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the manufacturing is in compliance with cGMP regulations. If the NDA and the manufacturing facilities are deemed acceptable by the FDA, it may issue an approval letter, or in some cases, an approvable letter followed by an approval letter. Both letters usually contain a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA. When and if those conditions have been met to the FDA&#146;s satisfaction, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the drug&#146;s safety or efficacy, or impose other conditions. Approval may also be contingent on approved risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, or REMS, that limits the labeling, distribution or promotion of a drug product. Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market. 

After approval, certain changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, making certain manufacturing changes or making certain additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Before a company can market products for additional indications, it must obtain additional approvals from the FDA. Obtaining approval for a new indication generally requires that additional clinical trials be conducted. A company cannot be sure that any additional approval for new indications for any product candidate will be approved on a timely basis, or at all. 

Post-Approval Requirements 

Often times, even after a drug has been approved by the FDA for sale, the FDA may require that certain post-approval requirements be satisfied, including the conduct of additional clinical trials. If such post-approval conditions are not satisfied, the FDA may withdraw its approval of the drug. In addition, holders of an approved 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements NDA are required to (i) report certain adverse reactions to the FDA, (ii) comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for their products, and (iii) continue to have quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP regulations after approval. The FDA periodically inspects the sponsor&#146;s records related to safety reporting and/or manufacturing facilities. This latter effort includes assessment of ongoing compliance with cGMP regulations. We have used and intend to continue to use third- party manufacturers to produce active pharmaceutical ingredients, API, for our products in clinical and commercial quantities, and future FDA inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, including withdrawal of the product from the market. 

Hatch-Waxman Act 

As part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA was enacted, otherwise known as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit the applicant to rely upon certain preclinical or clinical studies conducted for an approved product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. 

To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, which is referred to as the Reference Listed Drug, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any listed patents in the FDA&#146;s Orange Book publication that relate to the Reference Listed Drug. Specifically, the applicant must certify for all listed patents one of the following certifications: (i) the required patent information has not been filed by the original applicant; (ii) the listed patent already has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of the new product. 

If a Paragraph I or II certification is filed, the FDA may make approval of the application effective immediately upon completion of its review. If a Paragraph III certification is filed, the approval may be made effective on the patent expiration date specified in the application, although a tentative approval may be issued before that time. If an application contains a Paragraph IV certification, a series of events will be triggered, the outcome of which will determine the effective date of approval of the 505(b)(2) application. The Section 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the Referenced Listed Drug has expired. 

A certification that the new product will not infringe the Reference Listed Drug&#146;s listed patents or that such patents are invalid is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders for the Reference Listed Drug once the applicant&#146;s NDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a legal challenge to the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of their receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the Section 505(b)(2) NDA by imposing a 30 month automatic statutory injunction, which may be shortened by the court in a pending patent case if either party fails to reasonably cooperate in expediting the case. The 30 month stay terminates if a court issues a final order determining that the patent is invalid, unenforceable or not infringed. Alternatively, if the listed patent holder does not file a patent infringement lawsuit within the required 45-day period, the applicant&#146;s NDA will not be subject to the 30-month stay. 

The Hatch-Waxman Act provides five years of data exclusivity for new chemical entities which prevents the FDA from accepting ANDAs and 505(b)(2) applications containing the protected active ingredient. The Hatch- Waxman Act also provides three years of exclusivity for applications containing the results of new clinical

Pricing and Reimbursement 

In the United States and internationally, sales of products that we market in the future, and our ability to generate revenues on such sales, are dependent, in significant part, on the availability and level of reimbursement from third-party payors such as state and federal governments, managed care providers and private insurance plans. Private insurers, such as health maintenance organizations and managed care providers, have implemented cost-cutting and reimbursement initiatives and likely will continue to do so in the future. These include establishing formularies that govern the drugs and biologics that will be offered and also the out-of-pocket obligations of member patients for such products. In addition, particularly in the United States and increasingly in other countries, we are required to provide discounts and pay rebates to state and federal governments and agencies in connection with purchases of our products that are reimbursed by such entities. We have consciously selected compounds for development that offer therapeutic benefit based on fast onset of action and receive a high reimbursement per unit for the currently marketed injectable form. We intend to commercialize our products at prices competitive to those of the currently marketed injectables, thereby securing support of the payors. 

There is no legislation at the EU level governing the pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products in the EU. As a result, the competent authorities of each of the EU Member States have adopted individual strategies regulating the pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products in their territory. These strategies often vary widely in nature, scope and application. However, a major element that they have in common is an increased move towards reduction in the reimbursement price of medicinal products, a reduction in the number and type of products selected for reimbursement and an increased preference for generic products over innovative products. These efforts have mostly been executed through these countries&#146; existing price-control methodologies. The government of the United Kingdom, while continuing for now to utilize its established Pharmaceutical Pricing Reimbursement Scheme approach, has announced its intentions to phasing in, by 2014, a new value-based pricing approach, at least for new product introductions. Under this approach, in a complete departure from established methodologies, reimbursement levels of each drug will be explicitly based on an assessment of value, looking at the benefits for the patient, unmet need, therapeutic innovation, and benefit to society as a whole. It is increasingly common in many EU Member States for Marketing Authorization Holders to be required to demonstrate the pharmaco-economic superiority of their products as compared to products already subject to assessment and reimbursement in specific countries. In order for drugs to be evaluated positively under such criteria, pharmaceutical companies may need to re-examine, and consider altering, a number of traditional functions relating to the selection, study, and management of drugs, whether currently marketed, under development, or being evaluated as candidates for research and/or development. All such cost containment efforts by the payors in US and overseas are likely to support our competitive pricing model. 

Other Governmental Regulations, Healthcare Laws and Environmental Matters 

The FDA regulates all advertising and promotion activities for products under its jurisdiction both prior to and after approval. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA. Physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the drug&#146;s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties, and often reflect a physician&#146;s belief that the off-label use is the best treatment for the patients. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments, but FDA regulations do impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers&#146; communications regarding off-label uses. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements may subject a company to adverse publicity, enforcement action by the FDA, corrective advertising, consent decrees and the full range of civil and criminal penalties available to the FDA. 

Although we currently do not have any products on the market, we may be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions

Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations, many of which may become more applicable to us if our product candidates are approved and we begin commercialization. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. 

If we establish international operations, we will be subject to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, which prohibits corporations and individuals from paying, offering to pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. We also may be implicated under the FCPA for activities by our partners, collaborators, contract research organizations, vendors or other agents. 

Our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other laws and regulations. Various laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the purchase, storage, movement, import and export and use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances used in connection with our research work are or may be applicable to our activities. Certain agreements entered into by us involving exclusive license rights or acquisitions may be subject to national or supranational antitrust regulatory control, the effect of which cannot be predicted. The extent of government regulation, which might result from future legislation or administrative action, cannot accurately be predicted.
