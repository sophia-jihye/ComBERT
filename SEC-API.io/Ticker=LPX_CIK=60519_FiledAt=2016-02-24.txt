 ITEM 1. Business 

General 

Our company, founded in 1973 and headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee, is a leading manufacturer of building products. As of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 4,800 &#32;employees. We currently own 21 modern, strategically located facilities in the U.S. and Canada, two facilities in Chile and one facility in Brazil. We also operate facilities through a joint venture, for which we are the exclusive provider of product distribution for North America. Our focus is on delivering innovative, high-quality commodity and specialty building products to retail, wholesale, home building and industrial customers. We utilize various tools, such as an enterprise resource planning system and Lean Six Sigma, to improve operational efficiency and productivity. Our products are used primarily in new home construction, repair and remodeling and outdoor structures. 

Business Segments 

We operate in four segments: North America Oriented Strand Board (OSB); Siding; Engineered Wood Products (EWP); and South America. In general, our business results are affected by the level of housing starts; the level of home repairs; changes in industry capacity; changes in the prices we pay for raw materials and energy and changes in foreign exchange rates (primarily the Canadian dollar, Chilean Peso and Brazilian Real). 

OSB 

Our OSB segment manufactures and distributes OSB structural panel products. 

OSB is an innovative, affordable and environmentally friendly product made from wood strands arranged in layers and bonded with resin. OSB serves many of the same uses as plywood, including roof decking, sidewall sheathing and floor underlayment, but can be produced at a significantly lower cost. It is estimated for 2015 &#32;that OSB accounted for approximately 64% &#32;of the structural panel consumption in North America with plywood accounting for the remainder. We estimate that the overall North American structural panel market (based upon 2015 &#32;housing starts) was 31.2 billion &#32;square feet with the OSB market comprising an estimated 19.9 billion &#32;square feet of this market. Based upon our production in 2015 &#32;of 4.2 billion &#32;square feet (including OSB produced in our siding segment), we estimate that we account for 21% &#32;of the North American OSB market and 13% &#32;of the overall North American structural panel market. We believe we are a leading producer of OSB in North America and are positioned to compete in all geographic markets. 

Siding 

Our siding offerings fall into two categories: SmartSide &#174; &#32;siding products and related accessories; and CanExel siding and accessories and other related products. Our SmartSide &#174; &#32;products consist of a full line of wood-based sidings, trim, soffit and fascia. These products have quality and performance characteristics similar to solid wood at more attractive prices due to lower raw material and production costs. Our CanExel siding and accessory product offerings include a number of pre-finished lap and trim products in a variety of patterns and textures. These products are used in new construction, repair and remodeling and outdoor structures such as sheds. 

Additionally, minor amounts of commodity OSB are produced and sold in this segment. 

Engineered Wood Products 

Our Engineered Wood Products (EWP) segment manufactures and distributes laminated veneer lumber (LVL), I-Joists, laminated strand lumber (LSL) and other related products. This segment also includes the sale of I-Joist produced by our joint venture with Resolute Forest Products and LVL sold under a contract manufacturing arrangement. We believe that in North America we are one of the top three producers (including our joint venture production) of I-Joists, LVL and LSL. A plywood mill associated with our LVL operations in British Columbia and minor amounts of commodity OSB are also included in this segment. 

We believe that our engineered I-joists, which are used primarily in residential and commercial flooring and roofing systems and other structural applications, are stronger, lighter and straighter than conventional lumber joists. 

&#32;2 

Our LVL and LSL are high-grade, value-added structural products used in applications where extra strength and quality is required, such as headers and beams. 

South America 

Our South American segment manufactures and distributes OSB and siding products in South America and certain export markets. This segment also distributes and sells related products to augment the transition to wood frame construction. We believe we are the only producer of OSB in South America. 

Other Products 

Our other products category includes our remaining timber and timberlands, and other minor products, services and closed operations. Prior to disposition during 2013, this category also included our interest in a joint venture that produced cellulose insulation. 

Sales, Marketing and Distribution 

Our sales and marketing efforts are primarily focused on traditional two-step distribution, professional building products dealers, home centers, third-party wholesale buying groups and other retailers. The wholesale distribution channel includes a variety of specialized and broad-line wholesale distributors and dealers focused primarily on the supply of products for use by professional builders and contractors. The retail distribution channel includes large retail chains catering to the do-it-yourself (DIY) and repair and remodeling markets as well as smaller independent retailers. 

Customers 

We seek to maintain a broad customer base and a balanced approach to national distribution through both wholesale and retail channels. In 2015 , our top ten customers accounted for approximately 45% &#32;of our sales. Because a significant portion of our sales are from OSB, a commodity product sold primarily on the basis of price and availability, we are not dependent on any one customer. Our principal customers include the following: 

&#8226; 

Wholesale distribution companies, which supply building materials to retailers on a regional, state or local basis; 

&#8226; 

Two-step distributors, who provide building materials to smaller retailers, contractors and others; 

&#8226; 

Building materials professional dealers, that specialize in sales to professional builders, remodeling firms and trade contractors that are involved in residential home construction and light commercial building; 

&#8226; 

Retail home centers, that provide access to consumer markets with a broad selection of home improvement materials and increasingly serve professional builders, remodelers and trade contractors; and 

&#8226; 

Shed producers, who design, construct and distribute prefabricated residential and light commercial structures, including fully manufactured, modular and panelized structures, for consumer and professional markets. 

Seasonality 

Our business is subject to seasonal variances, with demand for many of our products tending to be greater during the building season, which generally occurs in the second and third quarters in North America and the fourth and first quarters in South America. From time to time, we engage in promotional activities designed to stimulate demand for our products, such as reducing our selling prices and providing extended payment terms, particularly at times when demand is otherwise relatively soft. We do this in an effort to better balance our inventory levels with demand, manage the logistics of our product shipments, allow our production facilities to run efficiently, be competitive, and/or obtain initial orders from customers. 

&#32;3 

Competitors / Competition 

The building products industry is highly competitive. We compete internationally with several thousand forest and building products firms, ranging from very large, fully integrated firms to smaller enterprises that may manufacture only one or a few items. We also compete less directly with firms that manufacture substitutes for wood building products. Some competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do that could, in some instances, give them a competitive advantage over us. 

In terms of our commodity OSB, we compete based upon price, quality and availability of products. In terms of our specialty products, including EWP, siding and various value added OSB products, we compete based upon price, quality, and availability of products as well as performance features offered. 

Raw Materials 

Wood fiber is the primary raw material used in most of our operations, and the primary source of wood fiber is timber. The primary end-markets for timber harvested in the U.S. are manufacturers who supply: (1) the housing market, where it is used in the construction of new housing and the repair and remodeling of existing housing; (2) the pulp and paper market; (3) commercial and industrial markets; (4) export markets; and (5) emerging biomass energy production markets. The supply of timber is limited by the availability of timberlands and access to the fiber. The availability of timberlands, in turn, is limited by several factors, including forest management policies, alternate uses of land, and loss to urban or suburban real estate development. 

In Canada, we harvest enough timber annually under long-term harvest rights with various Canadian governments and other third parties to support our Canadian production facilities. 

We purchase approximately 81% &#32;of our wood fiber requirements on the open market, through either private cutting contracts or purchased wood arrangements. Our remaining wood fiber requirements ( 19% ) are fulfilled through government contracts, principally in Canada. Because wood fiber is subject to commodity pricing, the cost of various types of timber that we purchase in the market has at times fluctuated greatly due to weather, governmental, economic or other industry conditions. However, our mills are generally in close proximity to large and diverse supplies of timber and have the ability to procure wood fiber at competitive prices. 

In addition to wood fiber, we use significant quantities of various resins in our manufacturing processes. Resin product costs are influenced by changes in the prices of raw materials used to produce resin, primarily petroleum products and energy, as well as competing demand for resin products. Currently, we purchase the majority of our resin from three major suppliers and believe our relationships with those suppliers are good. However, there can be no assurance that pricing or availability of resins will not be impacted based upon competing demand. 

While a large portion of our energy requirements are met at our plants through the energy produced from the conversion of wood waste, we also purchase substantial amounts of energy in our operations, primarily electricity and natural gas. Energy prices have experienced significant volatility in recent years, particularly in deregulated markets. We attempt to mitigate our exposure to energy price changes through the selective use of long-term supply agreements. 

Environmental Compliance 

Our operations are subject to many environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, the discharge of pollutants and other emissions on or into land, water and air, the disposal of hazardous substances or other contaminants, the remediation of contamination and the restoration and reforestation of timberlands. In addition, certain environmental laws and regulations impose liability and responsibility on present and former owners, operators or users of facilities and sites for contamination at such facilities and sites without regard to causation or knowledge of contamination. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations can significantly increase the costs of our operations. In some cases, plant closures can result in more onerous compliance requirements becoming applicable to a facility or a site. Violations of environmental laws and regulations can 

&#32;4 

subject us to additional costs and expenses, including defense costs and expenses and civil and criminal penalties. We cannot assure you that the environmental laws and regulations to which we are subject will not become more stringent, or be more stringently implemented or enforced, in the future. 

Our policy is to comply fully with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. We devote significant management attention to achieving full compliance. In addition, from time to time, we undertake construction projects for environmental control equipment or incur other environmental costs that extend an asset&#8217;s useful life, improve its efficiency or improve the marketability of certain properties. 

Additional information concerning environmental matters is set forth under item 3, Legal Proceedings, and in Note 19 of the Notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report. 

Employees 

We employ approximately 4,800 &#32;people, about 900 &#32;of whom are members of unions, primarily in Canada, Chile and Brazil. We consider our relationship with our employees generally to be good. During 2015, union contracts related to two manufacturing facilities in Canada expired. Subsequent to December 31, 2015, these contracts were renewed. While we do not currently anticipate any work stoppage, there can be no assurance that work stoppages will not occur.
