 Item 1. Business 

Business 

We are a leading global materials company engaged in the manufacture and marketing of synthetic rubber, latex, and plastics, including various specialty and technologically differentiated products. We have leading market positions in many of the markets in which we compete. We believe we have developed these strong market positions due to our technological differentiation, diverse global manufacturing base, long-standing customer relationships, commitment to sustainable solutions and competitive cost positions. We believe that growth in overall consumer spending and construction activity, increased demand in the automotive industry for higher fuel efficiency and lighter-weight materials, and improving living standards in emerging markets will result in growth in the global markets in which we compete. In addition, we believe our increasing business presence in developing regions such as China, Southeast Asia, and Eastern Europe further enhances our prospects. 

We develop synthetic rubber, latex and plastics products that are incorporated into a wide range of our customers&#8217; products throughout the world, including tires and other products for automotive applications, carpet and artificial turf backing, coated paper and packaging board, food packaging, appliances, medical devices, consumer electronics and construction applications, among others. We seek to regularly develop new and improved products and processes, supported by our intellectual property portfolio, designed to enhance our customers&#8217; product offerings. We have long-standing relationships with a diverse base of global customers, many of whom are leaders in their markets and rely on us for formulation, technological differentiation, and compounding expertise to find sustainable solutions for their businesses. Many of our products represent only a small portion of a finished product&#8217;s production costs, but provide critical functionality to the finished product and are often specifically developed to customer specifications. We believe these product traits result in substantial customer loyalty for our products. 

We operate our business in two divisions: Performance Materials and Basic Plastics &#38; Feedstocks. The Performance Materials division includes the following reporting segments: Synthetic Rubber, Latex, and Performance Plastics. The Basic Plastics &#38; Feedstocks division represents a separate segment for financial reporting purposes and includes styrenic polymers, polycarbonate, or PC, and styrene monomer. In addition, the Basic Plastics &#38; Feedstocks division includes the results of our two 50%-owned joint ventures, Americas Styrenics LLC, or Americas Styrenics, and Sumika Styron Polycarbonate Limited, or Sumika Styron Polycarbonate. The following chart provides an overview of this organizational structure: 

We believe that this organizational structure reflects the nature of our Company by grouping together segments with similar strategies, business drivers and operating characteristics. Our two divisions are of similar size in terms of sales, but have different margin profiles, different strategic focus, different value drivers and different operating requirements. By organizing in this way, we believe that we can best manage and operate the Company, focusing on accelerating the growth of our Performance Materials division and improving the profitability of our Basic Plastics &#38; Feedstocks division . 

Our major products include: styrene-butadiene latex, or SB latex, and styrene-acrylate latex, or SA latex, in our Latex segment; solution styrene-butadiene rubber, or SSBR, lithium polybutadiene rubber, or Li-PBR, emulsion styrene- 

&#160;

butadiene rubber, or ESBR, nickel polybutadiene rubber, or Ni-PBR, and neodymium polybutadiene rubber, or Nd-PBR, in our Synthetic Rubber segment; highly engineered compounds and blends products for automotive end markets, as well as consumer electronics, medical, electrical and lighting, which we collectively call consumer essential markets, or CEM, in our Performance Plastics segment; and PC, polystyrene, acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene, or ABS, and styrene-acrylonitrile, or SAN, in our Basic Plastics &#38; Feedstocks segment. 

We have significant manufacturing and production operations around the world, which allows us to serve our global customer base. As of December 31, 2015, our production facilities included 34 manufacturing plants (which included a total of 80 production units) at 26 sites across 14 countries, including joint ventures and contract manufacturers. Our manufacturing locations include sites in high-growth emerging markets such as China and Indonesia. Additionally, as of December 31, 2015, we operated 11 research and development (&#8220;R&#38;D&#8221;) facilities globally, including mini plants, development centers and pilot coaters, which we believe are critical to our global presence and innovation capabilities. 

We are a global business with a diverse geographic revenue mix and significant operations around the world. 

In 2015, we generated net sales of $3,972 million, Adjusted EBITDA of $492.0 million, Adjusted EBITDA excluding inventory revaluation of $550.3 million, and net income of $133.6 million. Additional information regarding Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA excluding inventory revaluation, including a reconciliation of these metrics to net income (loss), is included in Item 7 &#8211; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations . 

Prior to our formation in Luxembourg in 2010, the Styron business was wholly-owned by Dow. On June 17, 2010, we were acquired by investment funds advised or managed by Bain Capital and Dow Europe, which acquired an ownership interest in our parent company and sole shareholder, Bain Capital Everest Manager Holding SCA, which we refer to as our Parent. As of December 31, 2015, Dow Europe held an approximately 6.6% interest in our Parent. We continue to have a significant business relationship with Dow and rely on our agreements with Dow for certain operating 

&#160;

and other services, for the supply of raw materials used in the production of our products and for certain intellectual property rights. See &#8220;&#8212;Our Relationship with Dow.&#8221; 

The following chart summarizes our corporate ownership structure as of December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Our Competitive Strengths 

We believe we have a number of competitive strengths that differentiate us from our competitors, including: 

Leading Positions in Consolidating Markets 

We have leading positions in several of the markets in which we compete, including the #1 position in SSBR in Europe and the #1 position in SB latex globally, and we are a leading global producer of plastics products, including polystyrene and PC. We attribute our strong market positions to our technologically differentiated products, the scale of our global manufacturing base, our long-standing customer relationships and our competitive cost positions. 

The markets in which we compete are also highly consolidated and have continued to experience further consolidation over the last several years through the business combinations of BASF Group and Ciba Specialty Chemicals, Yule Catto &#38; Co. plc and PolymerLatex GmbH (currently known as Synthomer plc), Omnova Solutions Inc. and Eli okem International SAS and the formation of Styrolution Group GmbH. As a result, from 2005 to 2015, over 580 kMT of &#160; production capacity was eliminated in the SB latex markets in North America and Europe, which represented an approximate 30% reduction in production capacity since 2005. In 1990, the top three producers, measured by production capa city, in North America and Europe represented 68% and 49% of estimated regional capacity, respectively. As a result of the capacity rationalizations and consolidations, including those described above, the top three producers in each of North America and Europe represented over 70% of estimated regional production capacity in 2015 . 

Production capacity has also been reduced in several of our markets, including styrenics products. For example, from 2005 to 2015, the polystyrene industry experienced substantial capacity rationalization with more than 1,500 kMT of annual North America and Western Europe polystyrene capacity being eliminated during this time period, representing a reduction of approximately 25% of the 2005 total capacity in those regions. 

Technological Advantage and Product Innovation 

Most of our products are critical inputs that significantly impact the functionality, production costs and quality of our customers&#8217; products. Many of our products are also differentiated by their performance, reliability, customization and value, which are critical factors in our customers&#8217; selection and retention of materials suppliers. For example, our advanced SSBR and Nd-PBR technology is designed to reduce a tire&#8217;s rolling resistance, resulting in better mileage and fuel efficiency and lower carbon dioxide emissions while at the same time improving the tire&#8217;s wet-grip, a measure of braking effectiveness and traction. We believe these are key performance attributes sought by the end user and have become more easily identifiable through the growing adoption of tire labeling requirements by regulatory agencies, including formal adoption by the European Union in late 2012. These attributes also help in meeting European carbon dioxide emissions legislation requirements. Other jurisdictions have adopted or are considering similar legislation, including tire labeling requirements. 

Our lightweight plastics materials also allow automotive companies to reduce weight in vehicles by substituting heavier structural parts with our products and thereby improving fuel efficiency for cars. Higher end automotive interior applications have also benefitted from utilizing our technology which has high aesthetic appeal and excellent scratch resistant characteristics. Energy use is also substantially reduced by using our plastic in lighting and other consumer applications. 

Through our performance latex portfolio, we offer a variety of products designed to meet the needs of multiple applications, including adhesives, building and construction and composites, road, athletic, and automotive surfaces, technical fabrics and technical papers and boards. Our performance latex products are designed to enhance and improve an application&#8217;s mechanical properties, including water, chemical, stain, abrasion or oil resistance, cohesive and adhesive strength, or dimensional stability, flexibility, water impermeability and efflorescence resistance. Using our technological expertise, we typically launch one to two new technologies in our latex segment each year. 

Diverse Global Reach with Strong Presence in Emerging Markets 

As of December 31, 2015, our production facilities included 34 manufacturing plants (which included a total of 80 production units) at 26 sites in 14 countries, inclusive of joint ventures and contract manufacturers. We believe our diverse locations provide us with a competitive advantage in meeting and anticipating the needs of our global and local 

&#160;

customers in both well-established and growing markets. We have a strong presence in Asia, where we supply custom formulated latex products both for established and new paper mills, as well as a variety of engineered polymers, synthetic rubber and other products that are used in a variety of end-markets. 

Long-Standing, Collaborative Customer Relationships 

We have long-standing relationships with many of our customers, helping them to develop and commercialize multiple generations of their products. We have won numerous supplier awards across our segments. We believe we have developed strong relationships through our highly collaborative process, whereby we work with our customers, particularly in high-value segments such as SSBR, specialized plastics and performance latex, to develop products that meet their specific needs. As part of this process, we test our products at customer sites and work with customers to optimize and customize our product offerings. As a result of our close collaboration, we have historically achieved a high success rate of retaining customers. In 2015, we s old to approximately 1,3 50 customers in over 82 countries with no single customer accounting for more than 8.1% of our net sales in 2015. 

Attractive Segments and End-Markets 

We focus on what we believe are the most attractive segments for our customers&#8217; products, or end-markets, where demand is underpinned by global trends supporting long-term volume growth, improving living standards in emerging markets, fuel efficiency and the increasing use of light-weight materials. We serve customers in a diversified mix of end-markets that we believe generally grow when global gross domestic product, or GDP, increases. Certain key regional markets where we have a strong presence are expected to outperform global growth rates. 

We also believe that the relatively modest level of capacity additions that have been announced in the marketplace will contribute to increased demand for our production capacity and products. 

Cost Competitive Assets and Raw Material Sourcing 

We believe that our assets and raw material procurement provides us with a competitive cost position for our products. Our products are produced on a global scale with well maintained, productive and cost efficient assets. Some of our global facilities are positioned near some of our key customers or markets, while other facilities are located strategically near major integrated petrochemical centers or are co-located at large Dow facilities, where we benefit from receiving certain raw materials supplied to our facilities by pipeline. We also benefit from existing long-term supply contracts for raw materials including ethylene, butadiene, and benzene, which help us maintain consistent supply through varying market conditions. 

The presence of some of our facilities on Dow manufacturing sites allows us to leverage Dow&#8217;s existing manufacturing infrastructure in an efficient manner, without the need for us to construct our own infrastructure or provide our own related site services. Dow pipelines directly supply raw materials to our facilities in Terneuzen, The Netherlands and Boehlen, Schkopau, and Stade, all in Germany. We share manufacturing infrastructure with Dow at these locations as well as in Midland, Michigan. At certain of our other facilities, we are able to limit the amount of our outbound freight costs as a result of the proximity of several of our facilities, including Dalton, Georgia, and Hamina, Finland, to key local customers. 

We also seek to leverage our experience with styrene monomer (also referred to as &#8220;styrene&#8221;) to achieve the best possible cost position. We produce styrene in world scale facilities located in Terneuzen, The Netherlands and Boehlen, Germany. These assets have operated consistently in the 1 st or 2 nd quartile for energy and raw material efficiency as compared to other European ethylbenzene styrene monomer units. We also purchase styrene under high volume raw material cost-based contracts leveraging our buying power. 

Experienced Management Team 

Our executive leadership team averages over 25 years of industry experience, including leadership positions within our business units, and significant public company leadership experience at other chemical companies. 

&#160;

Our Growth Strategy 

We believe that there are significant opportunities to grow our business globally and enhance our position as a leading global materials company engaged in the manufacture and marketing of standard, specialty and technologically differentiated emulsion polymers and plastics by executing on the following strategies: 

Continue Product Innovation and Technological Differentiation 

We intend to continue to address our customers&#8217; critical materials needs by utilizing our technological expertise and development capabilities to create specialty grades, new and sustainable products and technologically differentiated formulations. We believe our technological differentiation positions us to participate in attractive, high growth areas of the markets in which we compete. One such area where we believe we have a technological advantage is enhanced SSBR. Enhanced SSBR technology, which includes later generations of SSBR and functionalized SSBR, is used in the latest generation of performance tires. The market for performance tires is expected to grow at a rate that is 2 to 3 times that of the standard tire market. We continue to devote significant R&#38;D resources to improving and furthering our SSBR technology and our polybutadiene rubber technologies (such Nd-PBR and Li-PBR) in order to remain a leader in this market. For example, we have converted our Ni-PBR production capacity at our Schkopau, Germany facility to the production of a more advanced polybutadiene rubber, Nd-PBR, which is a key material in the latest generation of performance tires, and now are in the process of providing initial production batches and customer trials. Our development efforts are currently focused in large part on continuing to improve the fuel efficiency and performance characteristics of automotive tires. 

We are also working with our industry partners, particularly in the automotive, medical devices, lighting and consumer electronics sectors, to develop new advanced plastics with the goal of gaining market share in higher value-added areas of the markets served by our Performance Plastics segment. 

As a global leader in SB latex, we also continue to evaluate opportunities to expand our performance latex business by targeting particular end-markets and chemistries where we believe we have a competitive advantage, such as SB performance latex and styrene acrylics. We believe that performance latex accounts for a substantial portion of the total synthetic latex market, but only accounted for 9% of our Latex segment&#8217;s net sales in 2015, and we believe that we are well positioned to capture a larger share of this performance latex market. 

Strategically Invest in Attractive Segments of the Market 

We plan to make strategic capital investments to extend our leadership in select market segments and meet expected growing demand for our products. Our new SSBR production line in Schkopau, Germany began production on October 1, 2012, adding 50 kMT of new capacity. In addition, we repurchased 25 kMT of SSBR production capacity rights at our Schkopau facility from JSR Corporation Tokyo, Wallisellen Branch, effective March 31, 2014, at a significant discount to the estimated cost to build equivalent new capacity. With these two capacity additions, we have approximately doubled our SSBR production capacity. 

As part of this strategy, we continue to divest from less attractive segments. In September 2015, we announced plans to reduce operational costs in our Latex segment by a $5 million run rate in 2016 and to address declines in the coated paper market. To this end, we closed our Allyn&#8217;s Point latex manufacturing facility in Gales Ferry, Connecticut at the end of 2015. 

Opportunistically Pursue Strategic Acquisitions to Extend Leadership Positions 

We intend to pursue acquisitions and joint ventures that have attractive risk-adjusted returns to extend our leadership positions in what we believe are the more attractive market segments (such as synthetic rubber and performance latex) and geographies for us, including emerging markets. We believe that a long-term trend toward consolidation in our industry will continue, which we expect to create opportunities for us given our scale, broad customer base, and geographic reach. 

Continue to Implement Cost Saving Measures and Focus on Cash Flow Generation 

We have a proven track record of offsetting fixed cost inflation with cost saving actions, and we continue to seek to identify incremental cost saving opportunities. In recent years, we have launched several company-wide initiatives 

&#160;

intended to further reduce our costs and increase our competitiveness. We have reduced our fixed cost base by almost $100 million since 2011 through a number of cost-saving initiatives such as streamlining production and administrative processes and optimizing logistics. We believe that our current cost structure positions us favorably to compete and grow in the current market environment, and we have ongoing corporate cost saving initiatives intended to realize annual cost savings at or above the rate of fixed cost inflation. 

In addition, we continue to focus on cash flow generation through disciplined working capital and capital expenditure management. Following the completion of the SSBR capacity expansion at our Schkopau, Germany facility in 2012, capital expenditures have been reduced from approximately $112 million in 2012 to approximately $55 million in 2013, net of a $6 million and a $19 million government subsidy for SSBR expansion, respectively. Capital expenditures of $99 million in 2014, or only about 2% of sales, included $26 million for the acquisition of 25kMT of SSBR ca pacity from JSR. Additionally, capital expenditures were $109 million in 2015, or only about 2.7% of sales, and included $24 million related to the implementation of a new enterprise risk management system , expected to be completed in 2016, and the migration of certain of our manufacturing plants to a substitute third party process control technology. We believe that our maintenance capital expenditures on our current fixed asset base will be in the range of $30 million to $40 million per year over the next several years, which represents less than 1% of our net sales. 

Expand and Deepen Our Presence in Emerging Markets 

We expect to capitalize on growing demand for our products in emerging markets such as China, Southeast Asia, and Eastern Europe and increase our local market share by expanding our customer base and extending local capabilities in some of these geographies. We believe that improving living standards and growth in GDP across emerging markets are creating increased demand for our products. We have also added an additional 25 kMT, or 33%, of SB latex capacity at our facility in Zhangjiagang, China, which became operational in the third quarter of 2015. We expect to leverage our existing technology and platforms to make additional investments in emerging markets to address expected increases in demand for our SSBR, performance latex and plastics products in those geographies. For example, we have recently committed to expanding our local performance plastics manufacturing capability in China, allowing us to supply ABS to customers locally in the world&#8217;s largest and fastest growing automotive market. We also expect this growth to occur in the end markets that use our products. 

We also expect to leverage our existing technology and platforms to make additional investments in emerging markets to address expected increases in demand for our SSBR, performance latex and plastics products in those geographies with growth prospects.

&#160;

Latex Segment 

Overview 

We are a global leader in SB latex, holding a strong market position across the geographies and applications in which we compete, including the #1 position in SB late x in Europe with approximately 30 % of Europe&#8217;s 898 kMT of SB latex capacity and the #2 position in North America with approximately 3 5 % of its 477 kMT of capacity. We produce SB latex primarily for coated paper used in advertising and magazines, packaging board coatings, carpet and artificial turf backings, as well as a number of performance latex applications. In 2015 approximately 45% of our Latex segment&#8217;s sales were generated in Europe, 2 6 % were generated in the United States, and the majority of the remaining net sales were in Asia. 

We believe that our leading scale and differentiated capabilities in this segment are a competitive advantage that allows us to invest in new formulation capabilities and polymer science. Using our two pilot coating facilities in the United States and Switzerland, we work alongside our customers to develop new products and customer branding. We believe that this capability allows us to capture new business, strengthen our existing customer relationships and broaden our technological expertise. We continue to focus on our lower cost, starch emulsion technologies, which provide customers with similar performance as SB latex but at a cost advantage. We sold a record volume of this technology in 2015 and expect almost 20 % volume growth in 2016 as we expand into additional applications and develop additional product offerings. 

We believe our development and formulation capabilities contribute to our strong position. Further, we believe our growth prospects in latex are enhanced by our expanding capacity in China. Our strategic plans to meet the growing demand for latex in China&#8217;s paper and packaging board industry are ongoing. We believe that certain emerging markets, and in particular China, will contribute a substantial portion of the global growth of the paper and packaging board market segment over the next decade. 

We believe our growth prospects could also be enhanced if the recent trend of industry capacity reduction and consolidation continues. This consolidation trend includes the business combinations of BASF Group and Ciba Specialty Chemicals, Omnova Solutions Inc. and Eliokem International SAS, and Yule Catto &#38; Co plc and PolymerLatex GmbH (currently known as Synthomer plc). We also believe we are well positioned to capture additional share in the performance latex market, which has accounted for a substantial portion of the total synthetic latex market, but only accounted for 9% of our Latex segment&#8217;s net sales in 2015. 

Our strategy focuses on delivering consistent resu lts by continuing to grow our volumes in Asia, in carpet, and in performance latex and to leverage our cost-advantaged position to minimize volume declines from the overall declines in the coated paper market in North America and Europe. &#160; 

Products and End Uses 

We are a global leader in the production and marketing of SB latex for coated paper with the #1 position in SB latex in Europe and the #2 position in North America. For coated paper, we primarily manufacture SB latex, a high-volume product that is widely used as a binder for mineral pigments as it allows high coating speeds, improved smoothness, higher gloss level, opacity and water resistance. Typically, SB latex formulations are engineered in close collaboration with customers, and are tailored specifically to optimize finished product properties and production efficiency, and to minimize mill down time. Since SB latex accounts for, on average, approximately 8% of the total production cost for coated paper but is a critical element of the manufacturing process and provides performance characteristics key to the product&#8217;s end-use, we believe customers view it as a crucial component of their manufacturing process and typically seek high-quality, reliable producers. 

We are also a leading supplier of latex polymers to the carpet and artificial turf industries and offer a diverse range of products for use in residential and commercial broadloom, needlefelt, and woven carpet backings. We produce high solids SB latex, SA latex, vinylidene chloride, and butadiene-methacrylate latex products for the commercial and niche carpet markets. We incorporate vinyl acrylic latex in our formulations for its ignition resistant properties, with the sourcing of vinyl acrylic latex readily available from a number of industry suppliers. SB latex is also used in flooring as an adhesive for carpet and artificial turf fibers. 

We also offer a broad range of performance latex products, including SB latex, SA latex, and vinylidene chloride latex primarily for the adhesive, building and construction as well as the technical textile paper market, and have begun to implement the use of starch and associated new chemistries in paper coatings and carpet backing. 

&#160;

Customers 

We believe our Latex segment is able to differentiate itself by offering customers value-added formulation and product development expertise. Our R&#38;D team and Technical Services and Development, which we refer to as TS&#38;D, team are able to use our two pilot coating facilities in Switzerland and the United States, three paper fabrication and testing labs in China, Switzerland and the United States, three carpet technology centers located near carpet producers in China, the United States and Switzerland, and two product development and process research centers, one each in Germany and the United States, to assist customers in designing new products and enhancing the manufacturing process. Additionally, our global manufacturing capabilities are key in serving customers cost-effectively, as latex is costly to ship over long distances due to its high water content. We believe that our global network of service and manufacturing facilities is highly valued by our customers. 

Many of our major customers rely on our dedicated R&#38;D and TS&#38;D teams to complement their limited in-house resources for formulation and reformulation tests and trials. We seek to capture the value of these services through our pricing strategy. We estimate that approximately half of net sales in this segment relate to contracts that include raw material pass-through clauses. In addition, as paper mills become larger and increasingly sophisticated with higher fixed costs, we believe there is greater demand for custom-formulated latexes. Historically, we have focused on capturing a majority share of new SB latex formulations for startups and major overhauls of existing paper coaters. In carpet applications, our product development expertise also allows us to provide differentiated products to our customers. 

Competition 

Our principal competitors in our Latex segment include BASF Group, Omnova Solutions Inc., Synthomer plc, and Lin Cham Ltd. In our Latex segment, we compete primarily based on our ability to offer differentiated products, the reliability of our products, the quality of our customer service and the length and depth of our relationships. 

Industry Outlook 

Certain changes in industry structure have had a beneficial effect for latex producers, driven by industry capacity reduction and consolidation. From 2005 to 2015 industry capacity in North America and Western Europe contracted approximately 30% due to shut downs and consolidations. Key industry events include the business combinations of BASF Group and Ciba Specialty Chemicals and resulting significant capacity reduction, a capacity rationalization by Dow / Dow Reichhold, Omnova Solutions Inc.&#8217;s rationalization at its Mogadore facility, the exit of The Lubrizol Corporation from the latex business, Omnova Solutions Inc.&#8217;s acquisition of Eliokem International SAS, and Yule Catto &#38; Co. plc&#8217;s acquisition of PolymerLatex GmbH (currently known as Synthomer plc). 

We also expect recent declines in the demand for coated paper to slow in the developed markets, particularly in Europe, and such declines to be partially offset by growth in emerging markets such as China, as improving living standards generate increased demand for coated paper end products, as well as growth in non-coated paper applications in all regions. Chinese consumption of styrene-butadiene latexes to paper and packaging board markets is expected to grow by an average of over 4% annually through 2020. Declines in the demand for coated paper resulted in efforts by us to rationalize our capacity by closing our Allyn&#8217;s Point latex manufacturing facility in Gales Ferry, Connecticut at the end of 2015. 

In addition, several historical developments that appeared to have an unfavorable impact at first, including the emergence of substitutes for SB latex in carpet backing applications in North America, have had less of an impact than initially anticipated due to superior SB latex performance, as many customers that we believe have switched to substitute products have switched back to SB latex due to its superior quality. This trend has been bolstered by increased butadiene availability and decreased butadiene cost in recent years. We also anticipate the housing recovery in the U.S. market will benefit our SB latex business through increased demand for carpet backing applications. We believe that if the recent trends of industry capacity reduction and consolidation and increasing demand in emerging markets continue, this will lead to a favorable production environment.

Synthetic Rubber Segment 

Overview 

We are a significant producer of styrene-butadiene and polybutadiene-based rubber products and we have a leading European market position, providing approximately 70% of Western Europe&#8217;s 240 kMT SSBR capacity available for sale, and in synthetic rubber overall. While substantially all of our sales were generated in Europe in 2015, approximately 19% of these net sales were exported to Asia , 7% to Latin America and 9% to North America. 

We have a broad synthetic rubber technology and product portfolio, focusing on specialty products, such as SSBR Li-PBR, and Nd-PBR, while also producing core products, such as ESBR. Our synthetic rubber products are extensively used in tires, with approximately 83% of our net sales from this segment in 2015 attributable to the tire market. We estimate that three-quarters of these sales relate to replacement tires. We have strong relationships with many of the top global tire manufacturers and believe we have remained a supplier of choice as a result of our broad rubber portfolio and ability to offer technologically differentiated product and product customization capabilities. Other applications for our synthetic rubber products include polymer modification and technical rubber goods. 

Our most advanced rubber technology, SSBR, is a critical material for tires with low rolling resistance, which increases fuel efficiency and improves wet-grip and also leads to better traction and safety characteristics. Our fourth generation functionalized SSBR can improve traction by approximately 45% and rolling resistance by approximately 75% compared to our first generation. We believe our growth prospects are enhanced by increasing demand for high performance tires, which are now more commonly used by automakers as OEM specified tires in their vehicles as a result of regulatory reforms in the EU, Japan and Korea that are aimed at improving fuel efficiency and reducing carbon dioxide emissions. As a result of these and other factors, demand for SSBR is expected to grow substantially faster than global GDP over the next 5 years. 

We remain committed to being a technology leader in providing products to the rapidly growing performance tire market, which is expected to grow at approximately 2 to 3 times the growth rate of the standard tire market. Our strategy in this market focuses on developing and commercializing new performance rubber grades and shifting the mix of products we sell toward more differentiated, higher margin products. Consistent with this strategy, we have doubled our production capacity of SSBR since 2012. This additional capacity enabled us to grow our SSBR sales volumes by 14% in 2015. Within our SSBR product family, our sales volume of enhanced SSBR grew 24% in 2015, and now represents 57% of our total SSBR sales volume, up from 38% in 2012. This mix shift has resulted in Adjusted EBITDA margins improving from 16% in 2012 to 20% in 2015 . 

In addition, we continue to make investments to grow this segment. In 2014 we purchased an additional 25 kMT of SSBR production capacity rights at our Schkopau facility and in 2015 we completed the conversion of our Ni-PBR line to higher margin Nd-PBR and are currently running trial batches. We also continue to focus on remaining a technology leader in SSBR, providing superior tread properties such as wet grip, low rolling resistance, and reduced noise. 

Products and End Uses 

Our Synthetic Rubber segment produces synthetic rubber products used in high-performance tires, impact modifiers and technical rubber products, such as conveyor belts, hoses, seals and gaskets. We participate significantly in the European synthetic rubber industry, where tire producers focus on high-performance and ultra high-performance tires and rely heavily on rubber suppliers to provide their supply of rubber, in contrast to North America where tire manufacturers produce most of their required rubber. 

SSBR . We sell SSBR products for high-performance and ultra high-performance tire applications. We produce both clear and oil extended SSBR through batch polymerization in our three SSBR production lines. We believe these processes provide leading and technologically differentiated solutions to tire manufacturers. 

We believe we are well-positioned to capture additional market share in high-growth, high-performance tire applications and have expanded capacity to meet this anticipated demand. Our new SSBR production line in Schkopau, Germany began production on October 1, 2012, and expanded our SSBR production capacity by 50 kMT. In addition, we repurchased 25 kMT of SSBR production capacity rights at our Schkopau facility from JSR Corporation Tokyo, Wallisellen Branch, effective March 31, 2014, at a significant discount to the estimated cost to build equivalent new capacity. With these two capacity additions, we have approximately doubled our SSBR production capacity for this higher-margin product. 

&#160;

Our synthetic rubber portfolio is anchored by our SSBR technology and further strengthened by our new functionalized SSBR (SSBR engineered to perform specific functions) product offering. Our new product platform is used in the manufacture of high-performance and ultra high-performance tires. In Europe, we expect demand growth for performance tires, which are designed to improve passenger safety, tire longevity and vehicle fuel efficiency, to accelerate due to European legislation that became effective late in 2012. 

During the last six years, we have been working closely with major tire producers around the world to develop multiple new SSBR grades, addressing key marketplace needs for improved tire fuel economy, grip, and abrasion characteristics, which we believe will lead to significant demand growth for our rubber products in Europe and around the world. We expect our synthetic rubber product mix to shift to new more advanced SSBR grades (from approximately 8% of total Synthetic Rubber volume sold in 2011 to 27% in 2015) to meet the expected demand growth. In 2015, SSBR represented approximately 58% of total segment net sales. 

ESBR. Our &#160; ESBR products are used in standard tires, technical goods, and footwear. Our ESBR product portfolio offers tire producers a comprehensive suite of synthetic rubber capabilities. For example, ESBR provides enhanced wet grip to tire treads and strength to the inner liner of tires, allowing the tires to be more easily processed. In 2015, ESBR represented approximately 34% of total segment net sales. 

Ni-PBR and Nd-PBR . Throughout much of 2015, we sold Ni-PBR products for use in standard tires, performance tires, technical goods and footwear. In 2015, Ni-PBR represented approximately 7% of total segment net sales. I n November 2015, we completed the conversion of our Ni-PBR production capacity at our Schkopau, Germany facility to the production of a more advanced, higher margin polybutadiene rubber, Nd-PBR, and are currently running trial batches. Nd- PBR is a key material in the latest generation of performance tires, and will also be sold for use in industrial rubber goods and polymer modification. 

Li-PBR . Our Li-PBR is used primarily for our own internal polymer modification applications. Polymer modification is the use of synthetic rubber to improve the impact resistance quality of plastic products. In 2015, approximately 86% of our Li-PBR products were consumed within our Plastics business unit for high impact polystyrene, or HIPS, and ABS production. We make two grades of Li-PBR exclusively for our polymer modification uses. In addition to impact resistance, Li-PBR provides visual surface gloss. In 2015, Li-PBR represented approximately 1% of total segment net sales. 

Customers 

We maintain deep and long-standing relationships with a large number of multinational customers, including many of the top global tire manufacturers, as well as fast growing Asian tire manufacturers. Our relationships with our top customers, including with our predecessor business operated by Dow prior to the Acquisition, exceed 10 years on average. 

Tire producers are the primary customers for our Synthetic Rubber segment. We believe we have remained a supplier of choice given our broad rubber portfolio, including technologically differentiated grades, and our product customization capabilities. The majority of our Synthetic Rubber segment net sales are based on contracts that generally include terms for at least three different rubber product families. In addition, we estimate that approximately 85% of net sales in this segment relate to contracts that include raw material pass-through clauses. Our R&#38;D and TS&#38;D teams use our broad rubber portfolio to develop differentiated specialty products for customers. Once implemented with a customer, these newly-developed specialty products cannot be easily replaced with a competitor&#8217;s product. As a result, we believe customers are likely to buy from us throughout the life cycle of specific tire models to avoid high switching costs and prevent repetition of the expensive development process. 

Competition 

Our principal competitors in our Synthetic Rubber segment include Asahi Kasei Corporation, JSR Corporation, Lanxess AG, Zeon Corporation, Versalis S.p.A and Synthos S.A. In our Synthetic Rubber segment, we compete primarily based on our ability to offer differentiated products, the reliability of our products, the quality of our customer service and the length and depth of our relationships. 

&#160;

Industry Outlook 

Our Synthetic Rubber segment participates mainly in the European synthetic rubber industry, where tire producers rely on rubber suppliers, in contrast to North America where tire manufacturers produce most of their required rubber. Rubber suppliers typically manufacture more than one grade of rubber as customers typically require different grades of rubber from a single supplier. Performance tires represent an especially attractive market to rubber producers because they provide substantial value to end customers and the market for performance tires is expected to grow at a rate that is 2 to 3 times that of the standard tire market. Tire manufacturers are expected to continually seek improvements in advanced rubber, which optimizes the combination of fuel economy and wet grip in order to meet EU regulations which set minimum requirements and are being phased in through 2020. Other jurisdictions have adopted or are considering similar legislation and are also beginning to adopt the tire labeling requirements that have become mandatory in Europe since late 2012. In late 2014, the United Nation&#8217;s World Forum on Automotive Regulations adopted new internationally harmonized rules, known as Global Technical Regulations (GTR) for passenger car tires applicable in the European Union, China, Canada, India, Japan and Russia. Enhanced SSBR, which includes later generations of SSBR and functionalized SSBR and is used in the new generation of performance tires, is expected to approach 50% of the total SSBR market by 2018. We believe our leadership in the fast growing SSBR segment will position us to perform well relative to the broader industry and anticipate future strong demand from the broader adoption of legislation similar to the EU legislation and the relative performance advantages of our SSBR products. 

We believe that demand for enhanced SSBR will grow at a rate of approximately 11% through 2020, outpacing supply, and resulting in an expected increase in industry utilization rates. This anticipated increase in demand is further evidenced by Goodyear&#8217;s April 2015 announcement that it will build a new plant in Mexico to meet the growing demand for premium tires. This announcement indicated that the new plant will supply 6 million tires per year when it opens in mid-2017, and supplements Goodyear&#8217;s other initiatives to supply more premium tires, including an initiative to convert standard tire production into premium tire production. 

&#160; 

Performance Plastics Segment 

Overview 

We are a producer of highly engineered compounds and blends for automotive end markets, as well as consumer electronics, medical, electrical, and lighting, which we collectively call consumer essential markets (CEM). Our strategy in this segment focuses on developing differentiated compounds and blends in line with key industry trends, such as light-weighting and improved aesthetics in automotive, increased recycled material content and a push toward LED lighting in CEM. 

Our manufacturing facilities are located across Europe, Asia, and North America. We believe that the strategic locations of these facilities combined with close customer collaboration offers us a strategic advantage in serving our customers. More than half of our compounds and blends products are differentiated based on their physical properties, performance and aesthetic advantages. Our history of innovation has contributed to long-standing relationships with customers who are recognized leaders in their respective end-markets. We have established a strong market presence in the global automotive and electronics sector, targeting both component suppliers and final product manufacturers. Our Performance Plastics segment also compounds and blends our PC and ABS plastics into differentiated products for customers within these sectors, as well as into compounds of polypropylene. We have also developed compounds containing post-consumer recycle polymers to respond to what we believe is a growing need for some customers to include recycled content in their products. 

We believe growth in this segment is driven by a number of factors, including consumer preference for lighter weight and impact-resistant products and the development of new consumer electronics, increases in LED lighting applications and continuing growth in medical device applications. Additionally, we believe growth is bolstered by sustainability trends, such as the substitution of lighter-weight plastics for metal in automobiles, as well as more energy efficient, glazing solutions. 

In 2015, approximately 38% of our Performance Plastics segment&#8217;s net sales were generated in Europe, approximately 27% were generated in the U nited States and approximately 22 % were generated in Asia, with the remainder in other geographic regions, including Latin America and Canada. 

In automotive end applications, we aim to maintain and develop sustainable, long-standing relationships with industry leaders, taking advantage of our production capacity on four continents to drive OEM platform design wins. In 

&#160;

2015, we experienced growth in key markets, with a 2% increase in volume outside of Latin America, which experienced declines due to lower consumer confidence and higher interest rates. We continue to focus on our strategic plans to grow this segment through both current technologies and expanded offerings for car exteriors and semi-structural applications. 

In CEM, sales volume for 2015 was up 9% over 2014, driven largely by the consumer electronics industry in Asia and by significant progress during the year with our lighting customers, including materials for LED housings and lenses. 

Products and End Uses 

Our Performance Plastics segment consists of compounds and blends and some specialized ABS grades. We have a significant position in PC/ABS blends, which combine the heat resistance and impact strength of PC with the easy to process qualities and resilience of ABS. We believe our ability to offer technologically differentiated products to meet customer needs sets us apart from our competitors, and with our history as a leading innovator in compounds and blends, we have established ourselves as a leading supplier of PC-based products. 

For the automotive industry, we manufacture PC blends under the PULSE&#8482; brand, and we innovate collaboratively with our customers to develop performance solutions to meet the industry&#8217;s needs, such as removing weight from vehicles. As a result, we are a key supplier of these products to leading automotive companies in North America and Europe, who tend to specify these products on a per car program platform basis, making it difficult to be displaced as a supplier once selected and providing us with relatively stable and predictable cash flows for several years during the production lifecycle. We are also accelerating our development of similar supply capabilities in growing areas such as China. 

For the consumer electronics, electrical and lighting and medical device industries, we manufacture our products under the EMERGE&#8482; brand, among others, and we believe that we have substantial growth opportunities in tablets, notebooks, smart phones and other handheld devices, and electrical and lighting and medical device components. In serving these markets, we leverage our polymer and compound technologies to meet increasingly stringent performance requirements along with the aesthetic and color-matching requirements which are crucial characteristics for the products involved. The result is that we are a leading and long-standing supplier to many well-known brands. 

Customers 

We have a history of innovation in our Performance Plastics segment, and we believe that our focus on differentiated products enhances our growth prospects in this segment. We develop tailored polymer, compound and process solutions for our customers and for end-markets such as consumer electronics, we believe that our ability to work with our customers to quickly and effectively develop product solutions is a key to our success. Our innovation has contributed to long-standing relationships with customers who are recognized leaders in their respective end-markets. We also believe our global facilities are a competitive advantage that allows us to provide customers with consistent grades and position us to strategically serve emerging markets. 

Competition 

Our principal competitors in our Performance Plastics segment are Covestro AG, LG Chem Ltd., Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation, Saudi Basic Industries Corporation, Teijin Limited, Borealis AG, Celanese Corporation, Styrolution Group, and LyondellBasell Industries.

The plastic content in cars is expected to increase at an average rate of approximately 10% per year from 2014 to 2020. We believe these same trends towards lighter weights and higher performance materials will also impact other key end-markets such as medical devices, lighting and consumer electronics, and demand for our differentiated products in these markets is expected to grow at an average rate of approximately 9% per year from 2015 to 2020. 

&#160;

Basic Plastics &#38; Feedstocks Segment 

Overview 

Basic Plastics &#38; Feedstocks consists of styrenic polymers, including polystyrene, ABS, and SAN products, as well as PC and styrene monomer, which includes our internal production and sourcing of styrene. We do not anticipate investing in strategic growth initiatives in this segment in the near term. Rather, our strategy for this segment is focused on operational enhancements, margin improvement, and cash generation. 

Also within this segment, our 50%-owned joint venture, Americas Styrenics, continues to be a leading producer in North America of both styrene and polystyrene. We have received $125 million in cash dividends from Americas Styrenics during the year ended December 31, 2015. The results of Sumika Styron Polycarbonate, our other 50%-owned joint venture, are also included within the results of our Basic Plastics &#38; Feedstocks segment. As of the end of 2015, we have not received cash dividends from Sumika Styron Polycarbonate since the first quarter of 2014. 

We are a leading producer of polystyrene and ABS, where we focus our efforts on differentiated applications such as the liners and encasements of appliances and consumer electronics including smartphones and tablets. Within these applications, we have worked collaboratively with customers to develop more advanced grades of plastics, such as our HIPS and mABS products. For example, we work with appliance manufacturers around the world to develop improved environmental stress crack resistant products and with our constru ction sheet customers on smooth ABS. These products offer superior properties, such as rigidity and colorability, and, in some cases, an improved environmental footprint compared to general purpose polystyrene or emulsion ABS. Our Basic Plastics &#38; Feedstocks segment also serves the packaging and construction end-markets, where we have launched a new general purpose polystyrene product for improved performance in foam insulation applications. Today, we are one of the top 3 polystyrene producers worldwide, providing, either directly or through Americas Styrenics, approximately 20% of Europe&#8217;s polystyrene capacity of 2,192 kMT, approximately 4% of Asia&#8217;s capacity of 7, 921 kMT and approximately 29% of North America&#8217;s capacity of 2,579 kMT. In 2015, we also supplied 17% and 15% of the styrene monomer capacity out of 6,022 kMT and 5,455 kMT in North America and Europe, respectively. 

Within styrene monomer, we believe there is a current and longer term trend towards higher styrene margins, due to demand growth , an aging industry asset base, and limited new capacity expected over the next five years. Global styrene operating rates were 84 % in 2015 and are forecasted to rise to 87% by 2020. These relatively high operating rates can result in periods of elevated margins due to planned or unplanned produ ction outages. For example, approximately 20% of Western European capacity was offline at times during 2015, which, combined with customer restocking in polystyrene derivatives, resulted in increased margins during the year. We believe there is continued potential for periods of elevated, outage-driven styrene margins given that approximately 60% of Western Europe styrene production capacity is greater than 20 years old, and nearly 40% is more than 30 years old. The following chart illust rates historical styrene margins in Western Europe: 

&#160;

The following chart s represent historical styrene, benzene, and ethylene prices, as well as styrene margin, over raw materials, which is calculated by subtracting the costs of benzene and ethylene from the sales price of styrene. &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Source: IHS. Styrene: W. Europe Contract Monthly Market (Delivered W. Europe); Benzene: 50% W. Europe Spot Avg. (CIF NW Europe / Basis ARA) and 50% W. Europe Contract &#8211; Monthly Market (FOB/CIF W. Europe); Ethylene: W. Europe Contract &#8211; Market Pipeline (Delivered W. Europe). Styrene: NE Asia Avg. Spot Posting (CFR China); Benzene: NE Asia Spot Avg. (FOB S. Korea); Ethylene: NE Asia Spot Avg. (CFR NE Asia). Margin: Styrene less 80% Benzene less 30% Ethylene. 

We capture styrene monomer margin through both internally produced and cost-based purchases of styrene. Annually, we produce approximately 600 kilotons of styrene in Western Europe and purchase approximately 300 kilotons of styrene in Asia with cost based economics. With all other inputs remaining equal, a $50 per metric ton change in styrene margins would be expected to impact our annual Adjusted EBITDA by approximately $30 million in Europe and approximately $15 million in Asia. 

We are a producer of PC and PC blends, supplying 3% of polycarbonate capacity of 2, 413 kMT in Asia through our Sumika Styron Polycarbonate joint venture, and 13% of 1,210 kMT in Europe. In late 2014, we exited the contract manufacturing agreement with Dow at their Freeport, Texas facility. Smaller competitors tend to operate on a regional basis. We have developed a global, multi-tiered marketing approach targeting the tiered suppliers, as well as final product producers, which we believe most effectively addresses our customers&#8217; needs. 

We believe our growth prospects in our Basic Plastics &#38; Feedstocks segment are enhanced by periodic trends of industry capacity reduction and consolidation in Europe and North America, such as the 2011 formation of the Styrolution Group GmbH joint venture combining certain INEOS and BASF Group assets and the prior acquisition of INEOS Nova by INEOS, as well as INEOS&#8217; most recent asset rationalizations in styrene monomer and polystyrene and Styrolution&#8217;s recent announcements to close polystyrene plants in the United States and Sweden. We also have a 50% interest in Americas Styrenics LLC, our joint venture with Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, which operates in the North American and Latin American markets and has benefitted from recent positive trends in those markets. We expect further consolidation in certain regions of Asia with numerous producers and low asset utilization, which we believe will create opportunities for us, given our scale and geographic reach. We believe our growth prospects are further enhanced by our established manufacturing footprint in the high economic growth regions of Asia and our focus on attractive end-markets where improving living standards drive demand for growing appliances, building and construction, and consumer electronics markets. 

During the second quarter of 2014, the Company announced a planned restructuring within its Basic Plastics &#38; Feedstocks segment to exit the commodity market for polycarbonate in North America and to terminate existing arrangements with Dow regarding manufacturing services for the Company at Dow&#8217;s Freeport, Texas facility. The Company also entered into a new long-term supply contract with a third party to supply polycarbonate in North 

&#160;

America. These revised arrangements became operational in the fourth quarter of 2014. In addition, the Company has executed revised supply contracts for certain raw materials that are processed at its polycarbonate manufacturing facility in Stade, Germany, which took effect beginning January 1, 2015. These revised agreements facilitated improvements in our results of operations for our Basic Plastics &#38; Feedstocks segment during 2015. 

Our PC business has benefitted and will continue to benefit from higher global utilization rates. Large capacity additions in 2011 and 2012 by SABIC and other producers decreased industry operating rates to 74% in 2013. However, continued demand growth, coupled with capacity expansion delays and capacity reductions, have increased global utilization rates to greater than 80%. This resulted in significantly higher PC margins in 2015. We expect these higher margins to occur in the future as demand growth is expected to exceed that of supply. A $100 per metric ton change in polycarbonate margins would be expected to result in approximately a $15 million change in our annual Adjusted EBITDA. 

In 2015, approximately 66% of sales from our Basic Plastics &#38; Feedstocks segment were generated in Europe and an additional 28% of sales were generated in Asia. 

Products and End Uses 

Polystyrene . We are a leading producer of polystyrene and focus on sales to injection molding and thermoforming customers. Our product offerings include a variety of general purpose polystyrenes, or GPPS, and HIPS, which is polystyrene that has been modified with polybutadiene rubber to increase its impact resistant properties. These products provide customers with performance and aesthetics at a low cost across applications, including appliances, packaging, including food packaging and food service disposables, consumer electronics and building and construction materials. 

We believe our STYRON&#8482; brand is one of the longest established brands in the industry and is widely recognized in the global marketplace. We believe our R&#38;D efforts have resulted in valuable, differentiated solutions for our customers. For instance, during the early 2000s, we developed an innovative STYRON A-TECH&#8482; family of resins that is an advanced polystyrene product allowing customers to balance key properties such as toughness, gloss, stiffness, flow and cost, and provide combinations of properties that were previously not available with standard HIPS. We believe that over the past decade, this product family has become the industry standard for this application. 

Acrylonitrile-Butadiene-Styrene (ABS) . We believe we are a leading producer of ABS in Europe and are one of the few producers with a presence in North America. We produce mABS, a variation of ABS that has lower conversion and capital costs compared to the more common emulsion ABS, or eABS, process, marketed under the MAGNUM&#8482; brand. mABS has similar properties to eABS but has greater colorability, thermal stability and lower gloss. mABS products can be manufactured to stricter specifications because it is produced in a continuous process as opposed to the batch process used in eABS. mABS also has environmental benefits such as waste reduction and higher yields. In addition to our own mABS production capacity, we also license our proprietary mABS technology to other producers. 

Primary end uses for our ABS products include automotive and construction sheet. We maintain a significant share of ABS sales into these markets, which we believe is driven by the differentiating attributes of our mABS products, our reputation as a knowledgeable supplier, our broad product mix and our customer collaboration and design capabilities. 

Automotive manufacturers have developed innovative solutions in order to meet increasing fuel standards, such as the lightweighting of vehicles. Consequentially, manufacturers have been replacing heavier materials with durable yet lighter materials, such as mABS and polypropylene compounds. We expect this trend to continue, and we believe that our technological capabilities in our Basic Plastics &#38; Feedstocks segment together with our compounding and blending expertise will help generate future growth opportunities. 

Styrene-Acrylonitrile . SAN is composed of styrene and acrylonitrile, which together provide clarity, stiffness, enhanced ability to be processed, mechanical strength, barrier properties, chemical resistance and heat resistance. 

SAN is used mainly in appliances, consumer goods and construction sheets, due to its low-cost, clarity and chemical resistance properties. Within our Basic Plastics &#38; Feedstocks segment, we manufacture SAN under the TYRIL&#8482; brand name for use in housewares, appliances, automotive, construction sheets, battery cases and lighting applications. In addition, TYRIL&#8482; is suitable for self-coloring which adds value in many of these uses. 

Polycarbonate . PC has high levels of clarity, impact resistance and temperature resistance. PC can be used in its neat form (prior to any compounding or blending) for markets such as construction sheet, optical media and LED 

&#160;

lighting. Additionally, PC can be compounded or blended with other polymers, such as ABS, which imparts specific performance attributes tailored to the product&#8217;s end-use. 

Our products for glazing and construction sheets are marketed under the CALIBRE&#8482; brand name and offer customers a combination of clarity, heat resistance and impact performance. Glazing and construction sheet represents our largest PC application, and is a key growth focus for us. Key end-markets include the construction industry, with additional opportunities for growth with compounded products in the medical device space, consumer electronics and other applications such as smart meter casings that require plastics with enhanced weatherability, ignition resistance and impact performance. 

Customers 

Our customer centric model focuses on understanding customers&#8217; needs and developing tailored solutions that create value for both parties. For durable applications, we focus our TS&#38;D, R&#38;D and marketing teams on product design engineering initiatives for developing and specifying plastics in the next generation of construction applications, appliances, automotive, and consumer electronics. In non-durable applications, we focus on innovative products that provide clear cost advantages to our customers, serving customers with our cost-advantaged technology and operating excellence. We have leveraged industry-leading product development and technology capabilities to develop long-standing customer relationships with many of our customers, including a number who have purchased from us, including our predecessor business operated by Dow prior to the Acquisition, for more than 20 years. We believe that our global presence is an advantage, allowing us to provide customers with consistent product grades and positioning us to strategically serve growth economies. 

Competition 

Our principal competitors in our Basic Plastics &#38; Feedstocks segment are Styrolution Group GmbH, Versalis S.p.A., Total S.p.A., Covestro AG, LG Chem Ltd., Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation, Formosa Plastics Corporation, Saudi Basic Industries Corporation, &#160; Shanghai SECCO Petrochemical Company Limited, and Chi Mei Corporation. In our Basic Plastics &#38; Feedstocks segment, we compete primarily based on our ability to offer differentiated products, the reliability of our products, the quality of our customer service and the length and depth of our relationships. 

Industry Outlook 

From 2005 to 2015, the polystyrene industry experienced substantial capacity rationalizations by major producers such as BASF Group, INEOS Nova, and others. More than 1,500 kMT of annual North American and Western European polystyrene capacity was eliminated during this time period, representing a reduction of approximately 30% of the 2005 total capacity in those regions. Consistent with the broader industry, we participated in these rationalizations by electing to shut down some of our less cost effective European assets and concentrating production at our most competitive facilities. 

In addition to improving profitability through cost rationalizations, the polystyrene industry has also benefited from a number of consolidating activities. A number of our larger competitors have enhanced their platforms via acquisitions and joint ventures, such as the 2011 formation of the Styrolution joint venture combining certain INEOS and BASF Group assets and the prior acquisition of INEOS Nova by INEOS. Global utilization rates are expected to steadily improve as the reduced production capacity serves growing demand in end-markets. 

The ABS and styrenics markets have also experienced a number of capacity rationalizations since 2006. These rationalizations, combined with improved end-market demand, have resulted in a substantial improvement in operating rates since the beginning of the global economic downturn. The rise in global operating rates for styrene monomer are driven by limited, if any, investment in new capacity and continued growth especially in large markets like China. 

These styrene and polystyrene dynamics will also benefit our 50%-owned joint venture, Americas Styrenics. The North America polystyrene market is more consolidated than those in Europe and Asia, and Americas Styrenics has approximately 29% of the capacity in the region, at the top of all producers. Americas Styrenics is focused on optimizing profitability and distributing cash dividends to its parent companies. 

Our PC business has benefitted and will continue to benefit from higher global utilization rates. Large capacity additions in 2011 and 2012 by SABIC and other producers decreased industry operating rates to 74% in 2013. However, 

&#160;

continued demand growth, coupled with capacity expansion delays and capacity reductions, have increased global utilization rates to greater than 80%. This resulted in significantly higher PC margins in 2015. We expect these higher margins to occur in the future as demand growth is expected to exceed supply. 

Our Relationship with Dow 

In conjunction with the Acquisition and subsequently, we entered into certain agreements with Dow, including the Second Amended and Restated Master Outsourcing Services Agreement, which was modified on June 1, 2013 (&#8220;SAR MOSA&#8221;), the Amended and Restated MOD5 Computerized Process Control Software, Licenses and Services Agreement, with Rofan Services, Inc. which was modified June 1, 2013 (&#8220;AR MOD5 Agreement&#8221;), site and operating services agreements, and supply agreements. 

The SAR MOSA provides for ongoing worldwide services from Dow, in areas such as information technology, enterprise resource planning, finance, environmental health and safety, training, customer service, marketing and sales support, supply chain and certain sourcing and transactional procurement services. The term of this agreement runs through December 2020 and which automatically renews for two year periods unless either party provides six months&#8217; notice of non-renewal to the other party. The services provided pursuant to the SAR MOSA generally are priced per function, and we have the ability to terminate the services or any portion thereof, for convenience any time after June 1, 2015, subject to payment of termination charges. Services which are &#8220;highly integrated&#8221; follow a different process for evaluation and termination. In addition, either party may terminate for cause, which includes a bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding by the other party, for material breach which is not cured, or by Dow in the event of our failure to pay for the services thereunder. In the event of a change of control, as defined in the agreement, Dow has the right to terminate the SAR MOSA. 

Under the AR MOD5 Agreement, Dow provides worldwide process control technology, including hardware, software licenses and support services, and related enterprise resource planning services. The AR MOD5 Agreement, with a term through December 2020, may be terminated by either party for cause, which includes a bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding by the other party, for material breach which is not cured by us if we no longer wish to receive maintenance and support for any licensed software; or by Dow if we use the licensed software for any purposes other than Company business. Dow may terminate the maintenance and support terms at any time if we fail to make payments when due and the default is not corrected within 30 days from notice, or upon two years written notice us, if Dow has made the decision not to support the software systems, provided that Dow will use commercially reasonable efforts to assist us in locating and transitioning to an alternate service provider. We have started to move our plants off the AR MOD5 process control technology through a strategic external relationship with ABB Ltd. and have successfully completed five plant conversions to date. We continue to work through our established schedule for plant conversions off of the AR MOD5 process control technology, which we expect to be completed in 2020. 

In addition, we entered into various site services agreements with Dow, which were modified as of June 1, 2013, (the &#8220;Amendment Date&#8221;) where at Dow owned sites, Dow provides site services to Company. Conversely, we entered into similar agreements with Dow in June 2010, where at Company owned sites, we provide such services to Dow. These agreements cover general services that are provided at specific facilities co-located with Dow, rather than organization-wide services, and include utilities, site administration, environmental health and safety, site maintenance and supply chain. In certain circumstances, the parties may adjust certain prices and volumes. These agreements generally have 25-year terms from the Amendment Date, with options to renew. These agreements may be terminated at any time by agreement of the parties, or, by either party, for cause, including a bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding by the other party, or under certain circumstances for a material breach which is not cured. In addition, we may terminate for convenience any services that Dow has agreed to provide to us that are identified in any site services agreement as &#8220;terminable&#8221; with 12 months prior notice to Dow, dependent upon whether the service is highly integrated into Dow operations. Highly integrated services are agreed to be nonterminable. With respect to &#8220;nonterminable&#8221; services that Dow has agreed to provide to us, such as electricity and steam, we generally cannot terminate such services prior to the termination date unless we experience a production unit shut down for which we provide Dow with 15-months prior notice, or upon payment of a shutdown fee. Upon expiration or termination, we would be obligated to pay a monthly fee to Dow, which obligation extends for a period of 45 (in the case of expiration) to 60 months (in the case of termination) following the respective event of each site services agreement. The agreements under which Dow receives services from us may be terminated under the same circumstances and conditions. 

&#160;

For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 201 3 , we incurred a total of $ 244.8 million, $285.2 million, and $306.2 million in expenses under the SAR MOSA, AR MOD5 Agreement, and site services agreements (which include utilities) , including $ 194.1 million , $233.7 million, and $235.1 million, respectively, for both the variable and fixed cost components of the site service agreements and $ 50.7 million, $51.5 million, $71.1 million, respectively, covering all other agreements. 

In addition, upon Acquisition, we entered into two contract manufacturing agreements pursuant to which Dow operates and maintains one of its facilities to produce polycarbonate products for us in Freeport, Texas, and we operate and maintain our SAN facility in Midland, Michigan to produce products for Dow, each for an initial term of up to 25 years from the Acquisition date. These agreements generally have 25-year terms, with automatic renewals for five-year terms unless one party gives notice at least 18 months prior to the end of the period. We may terminate any operational service under the agreements in the event that we experience a production unit shutdown, with 15-months prior notice to Dow, and Dow may terminate the supply of operational services to us in the event of Dow&#8217;s permanent cessation of the operation, also with 15-months prior notice. Furthermore, the agreements may be terminated by mutual agreement between the parties, by either party on notice that the other party fails to cure non-performance or if the other party is in material breach of a material obligation under the agreement within certain parameters, or because of either party&#8217;s insolvency. 

During the second quarter of 2014, the Company announced a restructuring within its Basic Plastics &#38; Feedstocks segment to exit the commodity market for polycarbonate in North America and to terminate existing arrangements with Dow regarding manufacturing services for the Company at Dow&#8217;s Freeport, Texas facility (the &#8220;Freeport facility&#8221;). The Company also entered into a new long-term supply contract with a third party to supply polycarbonate in North America. These revised arrangements became operational in the fourth quarter of 2014. Production at the Freeport facility ceased as of September 30, 2014, and decommissioning and demolition began thereafter, with completion in the first quarter of 2015. The Company incurred $7 million in expenses reimbursing Dow for its decommissioning and demolition of this facility. In addition, the Company executed revised supply contracts for certain raw materials that were processed at its polycarbonate manufacturing facility in Stade, Germany, which took effect January 1, 2015. These revised agreements facilitated improvements in future results of operations for the Basic Plastics &#38; Feedstocks segment. 

We have also entered into certain license agreements pursuant to which we have obtained exclusive licenses to use certain of Dow&#8217;s intellectual property in connection with the Styron business as it was conducted by Dow and non-exclusive licenses to use certain Dow intellectual property, other than patents, with respect to products outside of the Styron business as it was conducted by Dow prior to the Acquisition, subject to certain limitations. While our license rights are sufficient to allow us to operate our current business, new growth opportunities in latex and, to a lesser extent, plastics involving new products may fall outside of our license rights with Dow. Therefore, our ability to develop new products may be adversely impacted by intellectual property rights that have been retained by Dow. 

We have entered into long-term supply agreements whereby Dow supplies ethylene, benzene, butadiene, Bisphenol A, or BPA, and other raw materials amounting to approximately 29% of our raw materials (based on aggregate purchase price). The ethylene, benzene and butadiene agreements are each for an initial term of up to 10 years from the closing date of the Acquisition. Our BPA supply agreement with Dow expires in December 2019. These agreements do not contain any specific termination provisions and pricing is generally based on certain standard industry markers with appropriate volume discounts some of which can be negotiated from time to time. 

For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, purchases and other charges from Dow and its affiliated companies (excluding the SAR MOSA, AR MOD5 Agreement, and site services agreements) were approximately $ 999.4 million, $1,910.8 million, and $2,030.3 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, sales to Dow and its affiliated companies were approximately $ 227.0 million , $343.8 million, and $294.7 million, respectively. 

We continue to leverage Dow&#8217;s scale and operational capabilities by procuring certain raw materials, utilities, site services, and other information technology and business services from Dow. In connection with the Acquisition, we entered into several agreements with Dow relating to the provision of certain products and services and other operational arrangements. Dow provides significant operating and other services , and certain raw materials used in the production of our products, under agreements that are important to our business. The failure of Dow to perform their obligations, or the termination of these agreements, could adversely affect our operations. See Item 1A&#8212; Risk Factors . 

&#160;

Joint Venture Option Agreement 

In connection with the Acquisition in 2010, certain of our affiliates entered into the Latex JV Option Agreement with Dow, pursuant to which Dow was granted an irrevocable option to purchase 50% of the issued and outstanding interests in a joint venture to be formed by Dow and our affiliates with respect to the SB latex business in Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, Eastern Europe, Russia and India. On May 30, 2014, our affiliates entered into an agreement with Dow to terminate the Latex JV Option Agreement, Dow&#8217;s previous exercise of their option rights, and all other obligations thereunder, in exchange for a termination payment of $32.5 million. This termination payment was made on May 30, 2014, and the termination of the Latex JV Option Agreement became effective as of such date. 

Our Joint Ventures 

To supplement our business segments, we entered into two strategic joint ventures in order to gain access to local markets, minimize costs and accelerate growth in areas we believe have significant business potential. 

Americas Styrenics 

Launched in 2008, Americas Styrenics is a 50% / 50% joint venture between us and Chevron Phillips Chemical Company. Under the terms of the joint venture agreement, Americas Styrenics has the exclusive rights to manufacture and sell polystyrene in North America and South America, and produces a range of HIPS and GPPS products. We believe the venture has capitalized on the strong relationships and technology leadership of its parent companies to maintain a strong industry presence and pursue developing opportunities. Americas Styrenics has benefitted from industry consolidation and the cyclical recovery in the North American styrenics market. 

Sumika Styron Polycarbonate 

Sumika Styron Polycarbonate is a 50% / 50% venture with Sumitomo Chemical of Japan. Sumika Styron Polycarbonate has exclusive rights in Japan to manufacture and sell a range of our PC products and facilitates our access to the Japanese PC market. Sumika Styron Polycarbonate&#8217;s facility is located in an integrated and efficient manufacturing site, and uses Dow technology and production processes. 

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials 

Our raw materials group is responsible for the ongoing sourcing and procurement of raw materials for each of our business segments. The professionals leading this group have extensive experience in the petrochemical industry buying, selling, and swapping commodity raw materials. Our raw materials group seeks to implement the most efficient and reliable raw material strategy for our business segments, including maintaining a balance between contracted and spot purchases. We also produce raw materials for use by our businesses, such as styrene monomer. While Dow provides a significant portion of our raw materials to us pursuant to supply agreements, including ethylene, benzene, butadiene and BPA, we have developed a comprehensive strategy for obtaining additional sources of supply where needed. Our agreements with Dow range from 1- to 10-year terms with, in some cases, an automatic 2-year renewal. Minimum and maximum monthly contract quantities were established based on historical consumption rates, and our pricing terms are based on commodity indices in the relevant geography. We obtained approximately 31% of our raw materials from Dow in 2015 (based on aggregate purchase price). 

The prices of key raw materials that we purchase, including benzene, ethylene, styrene, butadiene and BPA, are volatile and can fluctuate significantly from time to time. The predominant drivers of this volatility are the prices of crude oil and natural gas as well as the impact of market imbalances in supply and demand from time to time. We have supply contracts in place to help maintain our supply of raw materials at competitive market prices. 

Styrene 

In addition to purchasing styrene through long-term strategic contracts and spot market purchases, we produce styrene internally from purchased ethylene and benzene at our own manufacturing sites. These sources provided 40 %, 19 %, and 41 %, respectively, of our supply in 2015. With this mix of purchased and produced styrene, we seek to 

&#160;

optimize our overall costs of securing styrene through efficient logistics, manufacturing economics and market dynamics. 

We believe the low steam-to-oil ratios (&#8220;S/O&#8221;) of our styrene production plants make them highly energy efficient as compared to other players in our industry. This technology also uses proprietary catalyst technology that supports operation in low S/O conditions and enables long runs between turnarounds. In addition, the styrene production process leverages in-house computational fluid dynamic and reaction models to predict catalyst activity over time, at varying operating conditions, to optimize run rates. 

Benzene and Ethylene 

Benzene and ethylene are two commodity petrochemicals that represent the majority of the raw materials needed for styrene production. In 2015, Dow supplied us with approximately 9 6 % of our benzene requirements and 100% of our ethylene requirements through 10-year contracts that commenced in 2010 and include automatic 2-year renewal provisions. The volume of benzene that we purchase from Dow may vary quarterly based on our needs at the time. Our operations that use benzene and ethylene are connected to Dow&#8217;s cracker operations where these raw materials are produced by a supply pipeline that facilitates the efficient delivery of our raw material requirements. We monitor these materials and how changes in their costs impact the styrene supply chain and its downstream derivatives. Our pricing formulae with Dow are based on well-known indices for the region and generally include large buyer discounts. 

Butadiene 

Butadiene is an important raw material for the Synthetic Rubber and Latex segments. Dow is our largest supplier for this material in Europe where we purchase directly from Dow&#8217;s existing butadiene extraction facilities pursuant to the terms of a 10-year contract that commenced in 2010 and includes an automatic 2-year renewal term. Other supply sources in Europe include major producers with contract terms of up to five years at competitive market prices. Supply to North America and Asia are exclusively from other major third party producers via supply contracts. As a large purchaser of butadiene, we believe we can continue to secure the raw material reliably at competitive prices. 

&#160; 

Bisphenol A 

BPA is the major raw material associated with PC production. This raw material is produced by a subsidiary of Olin Corporation and is supplied via pipeline to us through a supply contract in Europe that has an initial term expiring in December 2019. We source BPA for our North American operations and Asian joint ventures from other market participants. We no longer have a need for BPA in North America as of 2015. 

Manufacturing 

Our Latex segment had 30 production units that are strategically located throughout the world. We believe these facilities have industry leading quality tracking. 

We manufacture all synthetic rubber products at one integrated site at Schkopau, Germany. We believe that our synthetic rubber plant compares favorably to average benchmarks across key cost metrics and is one of the more cost-efficient synthetic rubber production sites in Europe. 

Our Performance Plastics segment operates on a global basis with compounding operations in Stade, Germany; Terneuzen, The Netherlands; and Hsinchu, Taiwan. We also have strategic compounding agreements in Asia, North America and Europe. 

We operate our Basic Plastics &#38; Feedstocks segment on a global basis, including plants in China, our integrated Schkopau, Germany site, and our PC site in Stade, Germany, in close proximity to faster growing regions. We believe that our polystyrene plants compare favorably to benchmarks across key cost metrics. Additionally, we believe our joint venture with Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LP, Americas Styrenics, is well-positioned to serve North America and emerging opportunities in South America. We manufacture SAN for Dow under an agreement in our Midland, Michigan facility. We also believe our strategic joint ventu re with Sumitomo Chemical of Japan, Sumika Styron Polycarbonate, enables us to gain access to an expanded range of geographies and customers. 

&#160;

Technology 

Our R&#38;D and TS&#38;D activities across our segments focus on identifying needs in our customers&#8217; end-markets. As part of our customer-centric model, our R&#38;D/TS&#38;D organization interfaces with our sales and marketing teams and directly with customers to determine their product requirements in light of trends in their industries and market segments. This information is used to select R&#38;D/TS&#38;D projects that are value-enhancing for both our customers and us. Our R&#38;D/TS&#38;D activities and capabilities include: 

&#183; 

formulation knowledge, which enables accelerated new product development; 

&#183; 

internal capabilities, such as latex pilot coaters and plastics mini plants; 

&#183; 

functionalization technology, which is a key capability in our synthetic rubber products to enable us to continue to develop new grades for tire products; 

&#183; 

compounding expertise, which comprises knowledge of the compounding process coupled with formulation knowledge and facilitates our ability to develop new compounds and blends to meet evolving needs in various businesses; and 

&#183; 

providing a broad product portfolio with innovative solutions to meet customer needs. 

Our R&#38;D facilities support our technological capabilities. In addition to our two SB latex pilot coaters and our product development centers, our Plastics and Emulsion Polymers business units operate &#8220;mini plants&#8221; in Stade and Schkopau, Germany. These mini plants are used to make samples of experimental products for testing, which we believe is a critical step in our new product development process. 

R&#38;D and TS&#38;D costs are included in expenses as incurred. Our R&#38;D and TS&#38;D costs were $51.9 million, $53.4 million, and $49.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. 

Sales and Marketing 

We have a customer-centric business model that has helped us to develop strong relationships with many customers. Including periods prior to the Acquisition when our predecessor business was operated by Dow, we have an average length of key customer relationships exceeding 20 years. Our application development, R&#38;D, TS&#38;D, marketing and sales functions work together to define the customers&#8217; needs and develop technologically differentiated solutions that create value for both the customer and us and result in greater customer intimacy. This can be seen most clearly in competitive applications such as coated paper and packaging board, automotive, consumer electronics, and glazing and construction sheet. 

Our sales and marketing teams play a key role in realizing this strategy around technologically differentiated solutions. Our sales and marketing initiatives include: 

&#183; 

Developing a solution-centric approach to sales versus a product-centric approach. Our sales and marketing teams understand the trends in the industries and applications served by us, and this is critical to identifying changing customer requirements and providing differentiated value-added products. 

&#183; 

Coordinating account teams effectively to develop and implement customer solutions. We often include sales-people and TS&#38;D engineers in customer activities. Where appropriate, we involve our engineers to develop new applications and respond to fast moving market trends. 

&#183; 

Understanding the value chain and effectively deploying our resources across this chain. In some of our end-markets, our immediate customers may be distributors or manufacturers, rather than the original equipment manufacturers. In these instances, our sales and marketing teams may employ a multi-channel marketing approach, developing relationships with the key decision makers across the value chain to develop differentiated, value-added products. For example, our automotive business markets its products: (1) through distributors, (2) directly to a broad range of small, medium and large parts suppliers, and (3) directly to the auto manufacturers themselves. 

Our sales and marketing professionals are primarily located at our facilities or at virtual offices within their respective geographies. We have approximately 127 professionals working in sales and marketing around the world, along with approximately 71 customer service professionals and we sell our products to customers in over 82 countries. 

&#160;

We primarily market our products through our direct sales force. All of our direct sales are made by our employees in the regions closest to the given customer. Historically, we have focused the majority of our direct sales efforts on large customers and relied on large distributors for sales to smaller accounts. In addition to the key initiatives outlined above, we intend to increase the amount of customers we serve directly. 

Information Systems 

We use Dow&#8217;s Enterprise Resource Planning (&#8220;ERP&#8221;) software systems to support our operations worldwide. We have the right to use Dow&#8217;s ERP software applications and infrastructure under the terms of the SAR MOSA and its related functional statements of work. The SAR MOSA has a current term that expires on December 31, 2020. Under the terms of the SAR MOSA, Dow extends its work processes and the supporting applications and infrastructure for us to use. Under the SAR MOSA, Dow&#8217;s work process expertise centers provide the knowledge-base and documentation required for our personnel to follow work process steps and procedures. 

We also use Dow&#8217;s global data/voice network and server infrastructure for desktop computing, email, file sharing, intranet and internet website access, mainframe and midrange computer access and voice communications. Business software applications are included in the work processes supported under the SAR MOSA. These applications complement a number of our other global ERP applications to provide us with the equivalent of a modern ERP landscape. We use the various ERP applications to manage our day-to-day business processes and relationships with customers and suppliers. In 2015, we embarked on a joint project with Dow to upgrade our legacy ERP environment to the latest version of SAP over the next two years. 

Our manufacturing plants use Dow-developed proprietary process control/process automation technology under the AR MOD5 Agreement. We are licensed to use this technology and receive support and spare parts through the expiration of the current term of the agreement on December 31, 2020. While we are not permitted to use this automation technology for new plants or to substantially expand existing plants, we can use other technology solutions for those situations. We are migrating our manufacturing plants off of the AR MOD5 technology to a substitute third-party process control technology from ABB Ltd, a leading supplier of advanced process control systems. For more information on the AR MOD5 Agreement, see &#8212;&#8220;Our Relationship with Dow&#8221;. 

Intellectual Property 

We evaluate on a case-by-case basis how best to utilize patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property in order to protect our products and our critical investments in research and development, manufacturing and marketing. We focus on securing and maintaining patents for certain inventions, while maintaining other inventions as trade secrets, derived from our customer-centric business model, in an effort to maximize the value of our product portfolio and manufacturing capabilities. Our policy is to seek appropriate protection for significant product and process developments in the major markets where the relevant products are manufactured or sold. Patents may cover products, processes, intermediate products and product uses. Patents extend for varying periods in accordance with the date of patent application filing and the legal life of patents in the various countries. The protection afforded, which may also vary from country to country, depends upon the type of subject matter covered by the patent and the scope of the claims of the patent. 

In most industrial countries, patent protection may be available for new substances and formulations, as well as for unique applications and production processes. However, given the geographical scope of our business and our continued growth strategy, there are regions of the world in which we do business or may do business in the future where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce. We maintain strict information security policies and procedures wherever we do business. These information security policies and procedures include data encryption, controls over the disclosure and safekeeping of confidential information, as well as employee awareness training. Moreover, we monitor our competitors&#8217; products and, if circumstances were to dictate that we do so, we would vigorously challenge the actions of others that conflict with our patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights. 

The technologies we utilize in some of our business lines have been in use for many years (e.g., SB latex and ABS) and a number of our patents relating to such technologies have expired or will expire in within the next several years. As patents expire, or are allowed to lapse, the products and processes described and claimed in those patents become generally available for use by the public. We believe that the expiration of any single patent or family of patents 

&#160;

that is scheduled to expire in the next 3 years would not materially adversely affect our business or financial results. We believe that our trade secrets relating to manufacturing and other processes used in connection with products to which expiring patents relate will continue to provide us with a competitive advantage after the expiration of these patents. 

We use trademarks as a means of differentiating our products. We protect our trademarks against infringement where we deem appropriate. In the first quarter of 2015, we completed a rebranding process to change our operating name and legal entities from &#8220;Styron&#8221; to &#8220;Trinseo.&#8221; In support of this rebranding process, we have successfully registered the TRINSEO &#8482; trademark in over 90 countries and have other trademark applications pending. 

Dow has either transferred to us or granted perpetual, royalty-free licenses to us to use Dow&#8217;s intellectual property that was used by Dow to operate the Styron business prior to the Acquisition. These intellectual property includes certain processes, compositions and apparatus used in the manufacture of our products. In addition to our license rights to use Dow&#8217;s intellectual property related to the Styron business, we have obtained licenses to use Dow&#8217;s intellectual property to the extent necessary to perform our obligations under the contracts transferred to us in the Acquisition and to use such intellectual property (other than patents) for products outside of the Styron business as it was conducted by Dow prior to the Acquisition, subject to certain limitations. While we believe our license rights with respect to Dow&#8217;s intellectual property are sufficient to allow us to operate our current business, new growth opportunities in latex and, to a lesser extent, plastics involving new products may fall outside of our license rights with Dow. Therefore, our ability to develop new products may be impacted by intellectual property rights that have not been licensed to us by Dow. We have the right, with Dow&#8217;s cooperation, to directly enforce the patents that are exclusively licensed to us by Dow where infringement is primarily within the scope of our business but nothing obligates Dow to enforce against third parties the intellectual property rights of Dow that are licensed to us on a non-exclusive basis or where the infringement is primarily outside the scope of our business. 

Since our formation on June 17, 2010, we have focused our product innovation on the Performance Materials division, including the Synthetic Rubber, Latex and Performance Plastics segments. The intellectual property that we have created since we were a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dow is largely in these segments and covers areas such as material formulations, material process technologies and various end-use industrial applications. 

Environmental and Other Regulations 

Obtaining, producing and distributing many of our products involve the use, storage, transportation and disposal of toxic and hazardous materials. We are subject to extensive, evolving and increasingly stringent national and local environmental laws and regulations, which address, among other things, the following: 

&#183; 

emissions to the air; 

&#183; 

discharges to soils and surface and subsurface waters; 

&#183; 

other releases into the environment; 

&#183; 

prevention, remediation or abatement of releases of hazardous materials into the indoor or outdoor environment; 

&#183; 

generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials; 

&#183; 

maintenance of safe conditions in the workplace; 

&#183; 

registration and evaluation of chemicals; 

&#183; 

production, handling, labeling or use of chemicals used or produced by us; and 

&#183; 

stewardship of products after manufacture. 

Some of our products are also subject to food contact regulations. 

We maintain policies and procedures to monitor and control environmental, health and safety risks, and to monitor compliance with applicable state, national, and international environmental, health and safety requirements. In 2015, we issued a Supplier Code of Conduct, which includes our expectations for our suppliers to comply with applicable laws and regulations and encourages them to adhere to the highest principles of environmental responsibility. We have a strong environmental, health and safety organization. Our environmental, health and safety compliance and management programs benefit from access to certain of Dow&#8217;s programs. We are also committed to the American Chemistry Council Responsible Care &#174; Guiding Principles for our global facilities and received third party certification of our Responsible Care &#174; Management System in 2013. We have a staff of professionals who are responsible for environmental health, 

&#160;

safety and product regulatory compliance. Additionally, we have services agreements with Dow to provide environmental, health and safety services for certain of our facilities. We have implemented a corporate audit program for all of our facilities. However, we cannot provide assurance that we will at all times be in full compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. We expect that stringent environmental regulations will continue to be imposed on us and our industry in general. 

In 2011, the National Toxicology Program, or NTP, classified styrene as &#8220;reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen&#8221;. The classification, confirmed by the National Academy of Sciences, did not take into consideration recent occupational studies of long-term exposures to styrene monomer, which have found no link between styrene and cancer or other serious conditions in humans. The classification did not change how our products are regulated or handled by our customers. Styrene monomer is considered to have low toxicity and is not classified as a carcinogen or mutagen in the EU Nations. We have not seen a significant shift in customer demand away from styrenics products due to this NTP classification. We believe that there are no simple substitutes for our products that can deliver the same performance, quality, safety and cost effectiveness as the current set of products our customers buy from us. Nevertheless, in March 2015, the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, or OHEA, published a notice of intent to list styrene monomer as &#8220;known to the state to cause cancer&#8221; in humans. A decision on the listing is not anticipated in the near term. 

There has been controversy for a number of years regarding the safety of BPA. A 2012 French ban on food packaging containing BPA was challenged with limited success, although legal proceedings related to this matter still continue. In January 2013, the California OHEA provided notice of proposed rulemaking to adopt a Proposition 65 Maximum Allowable Dose Level of 290 micrograms per day for exposures to BPA based upon authoritative bodies listing mechanism &#8220;as known to cause reproductive toxicity.&#8221; One of our trade associations, the American Chemistry Council, filed a lawsuit seeking to enjoin the listing, which was ultimately denied and an appeal is pending. In May 2015, the California OHEA listed BPA as a reproductive toxicant under its expert body listing mechanism, which will go into effect later this year, unless an appeal is filed. However, even if the listings stand, the levels of BPA in our products are well below this Maximum Allowable Dose Level, and we do not expect this listing will have a material impact on our products or manufacturing operations. Additionally, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has reaffirmed its view, based on its most recent safety assessment, that BPA is safe at the current levels occurring in foods. Also, in January 2015, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) issued its long-awaited scientific opinion on the safety of BPA for consumers. EFSA&#8217;s expert Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Process Aids (CEF) had decided that the publication of new scientific research on BPA in recent years called for a re-evaluation of the chemical. In summary, EFSA concluded &#8220;No consumer health risk from Bisphenol A exposure.&#8221; EFSA&#8217;s comprehensive assessment considered all age groups and examined food and other potential exposure sources. 

We have actively responded through direct communication to our customers and employees to address perceptions and concerns regarding the safety and environmental impact of our products. Our industry trade associations, the Styrene Information and Research Center and the American Chemistry Council, as well as many of our customers are also active through political advocacy, media relations, legal action, and scientific and regulatory activities. 

Similarly, we remain active in our trade associations, which are engaged to respond to potential health concerns involving BPA, Styrene and other chemicals used in our manufacturing processes. 

Sustainability and Climate Change 

Our July 2015 Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility Report, which is available on our website, provides our most recent sustainability highlights for our products, performance and operations. The report also profiles how our products help our customers improve their own sustainability in areas such as LED lighting, green tires, building insulation, smart meters, life-saving medical devices, and lighter weight vehicles. Also in this report, we noted that 4% of the Company&#8217;s global electricity consumption is derived from renewable energy sources, and that, overall, the Company has reduced its energy use by 2% from the prior year. 

Chemical Registration 

The goal of the U.S. Toxic Substances Control Act (&#8220;TSCA&#8221;) is to prevent unreasonable risks of injury to health or the environment associated with the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of chemical substances. Under the TSCA, the Environmental Protection Agency has established reporting, record-keeping, testing 

&#160;

and control-related requirements for new and existing chemicals. During the past several years, efforts have been underway to reform the TSCA and various legislative initiatives have been introduced most recently the Safe Chemicals Act of 2013 and the Chemical Safety Improvement Act. We actively monitor the progress of these and other legislative developments, and anticipate TSCA reforms this year. 

Registration, Evaluation, and Authorization of Chemicals (&#8220;REACH&#8221;) is the regulatory system for chemicals management in the EU. It requires EU manufacturers and importers to disclose information on the properties of their substances that meet certain volume or toxicological criteria and register the information in a central database to be maintained by the European Chemicals Agency. We have completed the REACH requirements for registration of high-volume and high-hazard substances that we manufacture in or import into Europe and we are currently on track to complete the remaining implementation requirements by the deadline in 2018. Other jurisdictions have enacted legislation similar to REACH, including China, Japan and Korea. We do not expect that the costs to comply with REACH and similar requirements will be material to our operations and consolidated financial position. We currently do not expect to need to register additional chemicals under REACH until 2018, at which time we will be required to register our low volume chemicals. 

Environmental Proceedings 

Prior to our separation from Dow, the EPA conducted a multimedia investigation at Dow&#8217;s Midland, Michigan sites, including the ABS site that we now operate. The investigation uncovered a number of alleged violations, including of the Clean Air Act&#8217;s leak detection and repair program (&#8220;LDAR&#8221;). LDAR requires chemical and petroleum companies to control fugitive (i.e., non-point source) emissions of hazardous air pollutants that occur from valves, pumps, flanges, connectors and other piping components. We, Dow and the United States executed a consent decree, which was approved by the District Court in Michigan in 2011. The decree provides that Dow will implement an enhanced LDAR program at our ABS facility over a five year period, which is intended to further reduce fugitive emissions at the ABS facility. We are not a defendant in the action, but under the decree, we or any future owner of the affected equipment will be responsible for performing an enhanced LDAR program at the ABS facility should Dow fail to perform. Dow&#8217;s failure to perform would subject it to significant stipulated penalties. An implementation agreement has been negotiated between us and Dow, which provides that Dow will bear the costs of the enhanced LDAR program. 

Environmental Remediation 

Environmental laws and regulations require mitigation or remediation of the effects of the disposal or release of chemical substances. Under some of these regulations, as the current owner or operator of a property, we could be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances on or under the property, without regard to whether we knew of or caused the contamination, and regardless of whether the practices that resulted in the contamination were permitted at the time they occurred. At our Allyn&#8217;s Point, Connecticut property we lease a portion of the property to our joint venture, Americas Styrenics, for its operations, which includes a regulated hazardous waste boiler. Potential liabilities resulting from our owner status are addressed through financial assurance mechanisms and other agreements. Many of our production sites have an extended history of industrial use, and it is impossible to predict precisely what effect these laws and regulations will have on us in the future. Soil and groundwater contamination has occurred at some of the sites, and might occur or be discovered at other sites. Subject to certain monetary and temporal limitations, Dow is obligated to indemnify and hold us harmless with respect to releases of hazardous material that existed at our sites prior to our separation from Dow in June 2010. However, we cannot be certain that Dow will fully honor the indemnity or that the indemnity will be sufficient to satisfy all claims that we may incur. In addition, we face the risk that future claims might fall outside of the scope of the indemnity, particularly if we experience a release of hazardous materials that occurs in the future or at any time after our separation from Dow. Except for minor monitoring activities that we are performing in Livorno, Italy pursuant to an agreement with Dow, we do not currently have any material obligations to perform environmental remediation on our properties, and any active remedial projects on our properties are being performed by Dow pursuant to its indemnification obligations or for any Superfund sites. 

Environmental Programs 

We have comprehensive environmental, health and safety compliance, auditing and management programs in place to assist in our compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and with internal policies and procedures, as appropriate. We use Dow&#8217;s environmental health and safety programs, including a management system, as a cornerstone 

&#160;

of our programs and have contracts in place with Dow for the use of their environmental, health and safety expertise. Each facility has developed and implemented specific critical occupational health, safety, environmental, security and loss control programs. We participate in the chemical industry&#8217;s Responsible Care &#174; initiative and have implemented a number of environmental and quality management systems at our facilities. In addition to Responsible Care &#174; Management System certification, the majority of our sites have received ISO 14001 environmental management system certifications. Additionally, our German facilities have received ISO 50001 energy management system certifications. 

We have a Board of Directors&#8217; Committee on Environmental Health and Safety and Public Policy. We also have implemented an environmental, health and safety (&#8220;EH&#38;S&#8221;) organizational structure with executive committee level leadership and dedicated environmental experts. We have an EH&#38;S leader at each of our manufacturing sites who is responsible for environmental, health and safety matters at that site. We also have corporate, regional and facility EH&#38;S leaders, as well as a Product Stewardship Organization that manages day-to-day EH&#38;S issues related to our products and customers. Our Process Safety Organization is dedicated to reducing and eliminating process safety incidents. 

Facility Security 

We recognize the importance of security and safety to our employees and the community. Physical security measures have been combined with process safety measures (including the use of technology), and emergency response preparedness into integrated security plans. We have conducted vulnerability assessments at our operating facilities in the U.S. and high priority sites worldwide and identified and implemented appropriate measures to protect these facilities from physical and cyber-attacks. Effort and resources in assessing security vulnerabilities and taking steps to reinforce security at our manufacturing facilities will continue to be required to comply with U.S. Department of Homeland Security (&#8220;DHS&#8221;) and other requirements . 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 2,270 employees worldwide. Nearly 83% of our personnel are located at the various manufacturing sites, research and development, pilot coating, paper fabrication and testing and technology centers. The remaining employees are located at operating centers, virtual locations or geographically dispersed marketing and sales locations. Our Midland, Michigan site is the only U.S. facility with union representation for its approximately 55 hourly operations personnel, and employees at certain of our locations are represented by work councils. We consider relations with our personnel and the various labor organizations to be good. There have been no labor strikes or work stoppages in these locations in recent history.
