 Item 1. Business 

Overview 

Oasis Petroleum Inc. (together with our consolidated subsidiaries, the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221;) was originally formed in 2007 and was incorporated pursuant to the laws of the State of Delaware in 2010. We are an independent exploration and production company focused on the acquisition and development of unconventional oil and natural gas resources in the North Dakota and Montana regions of the Williston Basin. Oasis Petroleum North America LLC (&#8220;OPNA&#8221;) conducts our exploration and production activities and owns our proved and unproved oil and natural gas properties. We also operate a well services business through Oasis Well Services LLC (&#8220;OWS&#8221;) and a midstream services business through Oasis Midstream Services LLC (&#8220;OMS&#8221;). 

As of December 31, 2015 , we have accumulated 484,745 net leasehold acres in the Williston Basin, of which approximately 91% &#32;is held by production. We are currently exploiting significant resource potential from the Bakken and Three Forks formations, which are present across a substantial portion of our acreage. We believe the location, size and concentration of our acreage create an opportunity for us to achieve cost, recovery and production efficiencies through the development of our project inventory. Our management team has a proven track record in identifying, acquiring and executing large, repeatable development drilling programs, which we refer to as &#8220;resource conversion&#8221; opportunities, and has substantial Williston Basin experience. 

In 2015 , we completed and placed on production 80 gross operated wells in the Williston Basin and had average daily production of 50,477 &#32;Boe per day. As of December 31, 2015 , we had 1,095 &#32;gross ( 595.5 &#32;net) producing wells in the Bakken and Three Forks formations. DeGolyer and MacNaughton, our independent reserve engineers, estimated our net proved reserves to be 218.2 MMBoe as of December 31, 2015 , of which 68% &#32;were classified as proved developed and of which 85% &#32;were oil. 

Our business strategy 

Our goal is to enhance value by investing capital to build reserves, production and cash flows at attractive rates of return through the following strategies: 

&#8226; 

Efficiently develop our Williston Basin leasehold position. We are developing our acreage position to maximize the value of our resource potential, while maintaining flexibility to preserve future value when oil prices are low. During 2014, when the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate crude oil index price (&#8220;WTI&#8221;) averaged $92.07 per barrel throughout the year, we completed and brought on production 195 gross (147.4 net) operated Bakken and Three Forks wells in the Williston Basin. During 2015 , when WTI averaged $48.75 per barrel, we completed and brought on production 80 &#32;gross ( 62.4 &#32;net) operated Bakken and Three Forks wells. As of December 31, 2015 , we had 85 &#32;gross operated wells waiting on completion in the Bakken and Three Forks formations. Our 2016 &#32;capital plan, which was finalized when WTI for 2016 was projected to average approximately $35.00 &#32;per barrel, contemplates operating two &#32;rigs and completing and placing on production approximately 46 &#32;gross ( 28.6 &#32;net) operated wells. We have the ability to increase or decrease the number of wells drilled and the number of wells completed during 2016 &#32;based on market conditions and program results. 

&#8226; 

Enhance returns by focusing on operational and cost efficiencies. Our management team is focused on continuous improvement of our operations and has significant experience in successfully operating cost-efficient development programs. We believe the magnitude and concentration of our acreage within the Williston Basin, particularly in the core of the play, has and will continue to provide us with the opportunity to capture economies of scale, including the ability to drill multiple wells from a single drilling pad into multiple formations, utilizing centralized production and oil, gas and water fluid handling facilities and infrastructure, and reducing the time and cost of rig mobilization. In addition, we expect OWS and OMS to continue to provide operational synergies going forward compared to third party providers. 

&#8226; 

Adopt and employ leading drilling and completion techniques. Our team is focused on enhancing our drilling and completion techniques to maximize overall well economics. We have significantly reduced the number of days that it takes to drill wells, and we believe completion techniques have significantly evolved over the last several years, resulting in increased initial production rates and recoverable hydrocarbons per well. High intensity completion techniques continue to deliver production performance greater than prior completion techniques. We continuously evaluate our internal drilling and completion results and monitor the results of other operators to improve our operating practices. This continued evolution may enhance our initial production rates, increase ultimate recovery factors, lower well capital costs and improve rates of return on invested capital. 

&#8226; 

Maintain financial flexibility. Based on current market conditions, we have a strong liquidity position. In February 2016, we completed a public equity offering of 39,100,000 &#32;shares, raising $182.9 million &#32;of net proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes and to fund a portion of our 2016 capital expenditures. We have no near-term debt maturities, 

and, in April 2015, we amended our revolving credit facility to extend its maturity date from April 2018 to April 2020, provided that our 7.25% senior unsecured notes due 2019 are retired or refinanced 90 days prior to their maturity. In October 2015, we successfully completed consent solicitations respecting amendments to the indentures governing certain of our senior unsecured notes, which amendments allow us to incur secured credit facilities indebtedness up to the amount of our borrowing base at the time of the incurrence, but not to exceed $1,525.0 million. In February 2016, our spring borrowing base redetermination was completed, resulting in a borrowing base decrease from $1,525.0 million to $1,150.0 million. As of December 31, 2015 , we had $138.0 million &#32;of borrowings and $5.2 million &#32;of outstanding letters of credit under our revolving credit facility and $1,199.4 million &#32;of pro forma liquidity available, including adjustments for the new borrowing base and the net proceeds from our public equity offering in February 2016. Our liquidity position, along with internally generated cash flows from operations and settlements from our derivative contracts in 2016, will provide continued financial flexibility as we actively manage the pace of development on our acreage position in the Williston Basin. We also currently believe we have access to the public and private capital markets, and we intend to maintain a balanced capital structure by prudently raising proceeds from future offerings as additional capital needs arise. We are also continuing to evaluate options to monetize certain assets in our portfolio, which could result in increased liquidity and lower leverage. 

&#8226; 

Pursue strategic acquisitions with significant resource potential. As opportunities arise, we intend to identify and acquire additional acreage and producing assets in the Williston Basin to supplement our existing operations. Going forward, we may selectively target additional basins that would allow us to employ our resource conversion strategy on large undeveloped acreage positions similar to what we have accumulated in the Williston Basin. 

Our competitive strengths 

We have a number of competitive strengths that we believe will help us to successfully execute our business strategies: 

&#8226; 

Substantial leasehold position in one of North America&#8217;s leading unconventional oil-resource plays. We believe our acreage is one of the largest concentrated leasehold positions that is prospective in the Bakken and Three Forks formations. As of December 31, 2015 , substantially all of our 484,745 &#32;net leasehold acres in the Williston Basin were highly prospective in the Bakken and Three Forks formations, and 85% &#32;of our 218.2 MMBoe estimated net proved reserves in this area were comprised of oil. In addition, we have 442,292 &#32;net acres held by production as of December 31, 2015 . In 2015, we increased per well capital efficiency through our focused development efforts in our core acreage and improved operational efficiency, coupled with lower service costs from third-party vendors and OWS. In 2016 , we will continue to concentrate our drilling and completion activities in our core acreage, which is located in the deepest part of the Williston Basin. 

&#8226; 

Large, multi-year project inventory. We believe we have a large inventory of potential drilling locations that we have not yet drilled, a majority of which are operated by us. We plan to slow the pace of completions again in 2016 &#32;to 46 gross ( 28.6 net) operated wells in the Williston Basin in order to maintain financial flexibility and preserve the value of our inventory. 

&#8226; 

Management team with proven operating and acquisition skills. Our senior management team has extensive expertise in the oil and gas industry. Our senior technical team has an average of more than 25 years of industry experience, including experience in multiple North American resource plays as well as experience in international basins. We believe our management and technical team is one of our principal competitive strengths relative to our industry peers due to our team&#8217;s proven track record in identification, acquisition and execution of resource conversion opportunities. In addition, our technical team possesses substantial expertise in horizontal drilling techniques and managing and acquiring large development programs. 

&#8226; 

Incentivized management team. In 2015 , an average of 57% of our executive officers&#8217; overall compensation was in long-term equity-based incentive awards, and such officers owned 2.5% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2015 . We believe our executive officers&#8217; ownership interest in us provides them with significant incentives to grow the value of our business for the benefit of all stakeholders. 

&#8226; 

Operating control over the majority of our portfolio. In order to maintain better control over our asset portfolio, we have established a leasehold position comprised primarily of properties that we expect to operate. As of December 31, 2015 , 97% &#32;of our estimated net proved reserves were attributable to properties that we expect to operate, and our average working interest in our 2016 &#32;operated completion plan is expected to be 66% . Approximately 92% &#32;of our 2016 &#32;drilling and completion capital expenditure budget is related to operated wells. Controlling operations will allow us to dictate the pace of development and better manage the costs, type and timing of exploration and development activities. We believe that maintaining operational control over the majority of our acreage will allow us to better pursue our strategies of enhancing returns through operational and cost efficiencies and maximizing hydrocarbon recovery through continuous improvement of drilling and completion techniques. We are also better able to control infrastructure 

investment to drive down operating costs, optimize oil price realizations and increase the monetization of gas production. 

Our operations 

Estimated net proved reserves 

The table below summarizes our estimated net proved reserves and related PV-10 at December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;based on reports prepared by DeGolyer and MacNaughton, our independent reserve engineers. In preparing its reports, DeGolyer and MacNaughton evaluated 100% of the reserves and discounted values at December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) applicable to companies involved in oil and natural gas producing activities. Our estimated net proved reserves and related future net revenues, PV-10 and Standardized Measure do not include probable or possible reserves and were determined using the preceding twelve months&#8217; unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month index prices for oil and natural gas, which were held constant throughout the life of the properties. The unweighted arithmetic average first-day-of-the-month prices for the prior twelve months were $50.16 /Bbl for oil and $2.63 /MMBtu for natural gas, $95.28/Bbl for oil and $4.35/MMBtu for natural gas and $96.96/Bbl for oil and $3.66/MMBtu for natural gas for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. These prices were adjusted by lease for quality, transportation fees, geographical differentials, marketing bonuses or deductions and other factors affecting the price received at the wellhead. The information in the following table does not give any effect to or reflect our commodity derivatives. Future operating costs, production taxes and capital costs were based on current costs as of each year-end. For a definition of proved reserves under the SEC rules, please see the &#8220;Glossary of oil and natural gas terms&#8221; included at the end of this report. For more information regarding our independent reserve engineers, please see &#8220;Independent petroleum engineers&#8221; below.

(1) 

PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure and generally differs from Standardized Measure, the most directly comparable financial measure under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;), because it does not include the effect of income taxes on discounted future net cash flows. Neither PV-10 nor Standardized Measure represents an estimate of the fair market value of our oil and natural gas reserves. The oil and gas industry uses PV-10 as a measure to compare the relative size and value of proved reserves held by companies without regard to the specific tax characteristics of such entities. See &#8220;Reconciliation of PV-10 to Standardized Measure&#8221; below. 

(2) 

Standardized Measure represents the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and natural gas reserves, less estimated future development, production, plugging and abandonment costs and income tax expenses, discounted at 10% per annum to reflect timing of future cash flows. 

Estimated net proved reserves at December 31, 2015 &#32;were 218.2 MMBoe, a 20% &#32;decrease from estimated net proved reserves of 272.1 MMBoe at December 31, 2014 &#32;primarily due to revisions related to lower commodity prices, partially offset by our 2015 &#32;drilling program and well completions as well as lower estimated future operating and capital costs. Our proved developed reserves increased 1.3 MMBoe, or 1% , to 147.6 MMBoe for the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;from 146.3 MMBoe for the year ended December 31, 2014 , primarily due to our 2015 &#32;drilling program, including the completion of 80 &#32;gross ( 62.4 &#32;net) operated wells, partially offset by production and higher abandonment rates resulting from lower commodity price assumptions. Our proved undeveloped reserves decreased to 70.7 MMBoe for the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;from 125.7 MMBoe for the year ended December 31, 2014 &#32;due to increases from our 2015 &#32;drilling program offset by the removal of proved undeveloped reserves that are not economic at the lower oil price or are no longer aligned with our anticipated five-year drilling plan. 

Estimated net proved reserves at December 31, 2014 were 272.1 MMBoe, a 19% increase from estimated net proved reserves of 227.9 MMBoe at December 31, 2013 primarily as a result of our 2014 drilling program and well completions, partially offset by the sale of certain non-operated properties in and around our Sanish position (the &#8220;Sanish Divestiture&#8221;) during the year ended December 31, 2014. Our proved developed reserves increased 24.2 MMBoe, or 20%, to 146.3 MMBoe for the year ended December 31, 2014 from 122.1 MMBoe for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to our 2014 drilling program, including the completion of 195 gross (147.4 net) operated wells. Our proved undeveloped reserves increased to 125.7 MMBoe for the year ended December 31, 2014 from 105.8 MMBoe for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to our 2014 drilling program and changes to align our proved undeveloped reserves with our anticipated five-year drilling plan. 

Reconciliation of PV-10 to Standardized Measure 

PV-10 is derived from the Standardized Measure of discounted future net cash flows, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. PV-10 is a computation of the Standardized Measure of discounted future net cash flows on a pre-tax basis. PV-10 is equal to the Standardized Measure of discounted future net cash flows at the applicable date, before deducting future income taxes, discounted at 10%. We believe that the presentation of PV-10 is relevant and useful to investors because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our estimated net proved reserves prior to taking into account future corporate income taxes, and it is a useful measure for evaluating the relative monetary significance of our oil and natural gas properties. Further, investors may utilize the measure as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our reserves to other companies. We use this measure when assessing the potential return on investment related to our oil and natural gas properties. PV-10, however, is not a substitute for the Standardized Measure of discounted future net cash flows. Our PV-10 measure and the Standardized Measure of discounted future net cash flows do not purport to represent the fair value of our oil and natural gas reserves. 

The following table provides a reconciliation of PV-10 to the Standardized Measure of discounted future net cash flows at December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 :

The PV-10 of our estimated net proved reserves at December 31, 2015 &#32;was $2,022.7 million , a 63% &#32;decrease from PV-10 of &#32; $5,481.4 million &#32;at December 31, 2014 . This decrease was primarily due to lower commodity price assumptions and a decrease in reserves, partially offset by a reduction in future development costs year over year. 

Estimated future net revenues 

Future net revenues represent projected revenues from the sale of our estimated net proved reserves (excluding derivative contracts) net of production and development costs (including operating expenses and production taxes). The following table sets forth the estimated future net revenues from proved reserves, the present value of those net revenues (PV-10) and the expected benchmark prices used in projecting net revenues at December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 :

(1) 

Our estimated net proved reserves and related future net revenues, PV-10 and Standardized Measure were determined using index prices for oil and natural gas, without giving effect to derivative transactions, and were held constant throughout the life of the properties. The unweighted arithmetic average first-day-of-the-month prices for the prior twelve months were $50.16 /Bbl for oil and $2.63 /MMBtu for natural gas, $95.28/Bbl for oil and $4.35/MMBtu for natural gas and $96.96/Bbl for oil and $3.66/MMBtu for natural gas for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. These prices were adjusted by lease for quality, transportation fees, geographical differentials, marketing bonuses or deductions and other factors affecting the price received at the wellhead. Future operating costs, production taxes and capital costs were based on current costs as of each year-end. 

There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating reserves and related information, and different reservoir engineers often arrive at different estimates for the same properties. There can be no assurance that our estimated net proved reserves will be produced within the periods indicated or that prices and costs will remain constant. As of February 8, 2016 , the spot crude oil price was $29.71 &#32;per barrel, a 20% &#32;decrease since December 31, 2015 &#32;and a 39% &#32;decrease as compared to an average WTI of $48.75 per barrel during the year ended December 31, 2015 . A further extended period of low prices for oil could result in a significant decrease in our estimated net proved reserves and related future net revenues, PV-10 and Standardized Measure in the future. Please see &#8220;Reserves sensitivity&#8221; below. 

Proved undeveloped reserves 

At December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 70.7 &#32;MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves as compared to 125.7 &#32;MMBoe at December 31, 2014 . 

The following table summarizes the changes in our proved undeveloped reserves during 2015 &#32;(in MBoe):

Conversion to proved developed reserves

At December 31, 2015 

70,656 

During 2015 , we spent a total of $242.4 million &#32;related to the development of proved undeveloped reserves, $105.7 million &#32;of which was spent on proved undeveloped reserves that represent wells in progress at year-end. The remaining $136.7 million &#32;resulted in the conversion of 10,419 &#32;MBoe of proved undeveloped reserves, or 8% &#32;of our proved undeveloped reserves balance at the beginning of 2015 , to proved developed reserves. Our proved undeveloped reserves converted to proved developed reserves during 2015 amounted to 20% of our proved undeveloped reserves balance at the beginning of 2015 of 125,743 &#32;MBoe less our net negative revisions of previous estimates during 2015 of 72,563 &#32;MBoe. We added 26,278 &#32;MBoe of proved undeveloped reserves in the Williston Basin as a result of our 2015 &#32;operated and non-operated drilling program and anticipated five-year drilling plan. We participated in 121 gross ( 64.3 &#32;net) wells that were completed and brought on production during 2015 . In addition, we purchased 1,617 &#32;MBoe of proved undeveloped reserves as a result of acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2015 . In 2015 , our net negative revision of 72,563 &#32;MBoe, or 58% &#32;of our December 31, 2014 &#32;proved undeveloped reserves balance, is primarily due to the removal of proved undeveloped reserves that are not economic at the lower oil price or are no longer aligned with our anticipated five-year drilling plan. This resulted in 259 &#32;gross ( 190.8 &#32;net) proved undeveloped locations with 71,945 &#32;MBoe of reserves being removed from the December 31, 2015 &#32;estimated net proved 

reserves balance, most significantly, removing proved undeveloped reserves outside of our core acreage within the Williston Basin that were uneconomic as of December 31, 2015 &#32;due to the lower oil price. 

We expect to develop all of our proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2015 &#32;within five years after the initial year booked. The future development of such proved undeveloped reserves is dependent on future commodity prices, costs and economic assumptions that align with our internal forecasts as well as access to liquidity sources, such as capital markets, our revolving credit facility and derivative contracts. All proved undeveloped locations are located on properties where the leases are held by existing production or continuous drilling operations. Approximately 30% of our proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2015 are attributable to wells that have been drilled but not yet completed, and 100% of our undrilled reserves are within our core acreage in the Williston Basin. 

Reserves sensitivity 

Our estimated net proved reserves at December 31, 2015 &#32;were prepared using SEC pricing for crude oil of $50.16 &#32;per barrel and natural gas of $2.63 &#32;per MMBtu. The current forward curve for commodity prices is significantly lower compared to year-end 2015 SEC pricing; therefore, the following sensitivity table is provided to illustrate the estimated impact on our estimated proved reserves, PV-10 and Standardized Measure. In addition to different price assumptions, the sensitivity case below includes assumed capital and expense reductions we expect to realize at lower commodity prices. The reduction in proved developed reserves is attributable to reaching the economic limit sooner. The reduction in proved undeveloped reserves is a result of well locations no longer meeting our investment criteria as well as reaching the economic limit sooner. 

This sensitivity case is only to demonstrate the impact that a lower price and cost environment may have on estimated proved reserves, PV-10 and Standardized Measure. There is no assurance that these prices or assumed cost savings will actually be achieved.

Our estimated net proved reserves, PV-10 and Standardized Measure were determined using prices for oil and natural gas, without giving effect to derivative transactions, which were held constant throughout the life of the properties. The actual reserve estimates at December 31, 2015 &#32;were prepared using SEC pricing, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average first-day-of-the-month prices for the prior twelve months, which was $50.16 /Bbl for oil and $2.63 /MMBtu for natural gas for the year ended December 31, 2015 . The sensitivity case prices represent potential SEC pricing based on different pricing assumptions, which are in line with our budget and recent forward commodity prices for 2016. In both the actual and the sensitivity case, the prices were adjusted by lease for quality, transportation fees, geographical differentials, marketing bonuses or deductions and other factors affecting the price received at the wellhead. 

Independent petroleum engineers 

Our estimated net proved reserves and related future net revenues and PV-10 at December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;are based on reports prepared by DeGolyer and MacNaughton, our independent reserve engineers, by the use of appropriate geologic, petroleum engineering and evaluation principles and techniques that are in accordance with practices generally recognized by the petroleum industry as presented in the publication of the Society of Petroleum Engineers entitled Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information (Revision as of February 19, 2007) &#32;and definitions and 

current guidelines established by the SEC. DeGolyer and MacNaughton is a Delaware corporation with offices in Dallas, Houston, Calgary, Moscow and Algiers. The firm&#8217;s more than 100 professionals include engineers, geologists, geophysicists, petrophysicists and economists engaged in the appraisal of oil and gas properties, evaluation of hydrocarbon and other mineral prospects, basin evaluations, comprehensive field studies and equity studies related to the domestic and international energy industry. DeGolyer and MacNaughton has provided such services for over 75 years. The Senior Vice President at DeGolyer and MacNaughton primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the reserve estimates is a Registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas with over 30 years of experience in oil and gas reservoir studies and reserve evaluations. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering from The University of Texas at Austin in 1984, and he is a member of the International Society of Petroleum Engineers and the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers.

Technology used to establish proved reserves 

In accordance with rules and regulations of the SEC applicable to companies involved in oil and natural gas producing activities, proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. The term &#8220;reasonable certainty&#8221; means deterministically, the quantities of oil and/or natural gas are much more likely to be achieved than not, and probabilistically, there should be at least a 90% probability of recovering volumes equal to or exceeding the estimate. Reasonable certainty can be established using techniques that have been proved effective by actual production from projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by using reliable technology. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that has been field tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. 

Estimates of reserves were prepared by the use of appropriate geologic, petroleum engineering, and evaluation principles and techniques that are in accordance with practices generally recognized by the petroleum industry as presented in the publication of the Society of Petroleum Engineers entitled Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information (Revision as of February 19, 2007) . The method or combination of methods used in the analysis of each reservoir was tempered by experience with similar reservoirs, stage of development, quality and completeness of basic data, and production history. 

Based on the current stage of field development, production performance, the development plans provided by us to DeGolyer and MacNaughton and the analyses of areas offsetting existing wells with test or production data, reserves were classified as proved. 

For depletion-type reservoirs or those whose performance disclosed a reliable decline in producing-rate trends or other diagnostic characteristics, reserves were estimated by the application of appropriate decline curves or other performance relationships. In the analyses of production decline curves, reserves were estimated only to the limits of economic production. 

Undeveloped reserves were estimated for locations adjacent to existing wells and are based on consideration of lateral length, completion and production profiles compared by appropriate target reservoir. In certain cases, when the previously named methods could not be used, reserves were estimated by analogy with similar wells or reservoirs for which more complete data was available. 

Internal controls over reserves estimation process 

We employ DeGolyer and MacNaughton as the independent reserves evaluator for 100% of our reserves base. We maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals who work closely with the independent reserve engineers to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of data furnished for the reserves estimation process. Brett Newton, Senior Vice President of Asset Management and Chief Engineer, is the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing our reserves evaluation process. He has over 25 years of industry experience with positions of increasing responsibility in engineering and management. He holds both a Bachelor of Science degree and Master of Science degree in petroleum engineering. Mr. Newton reports directly to our President and Chief Operating Officer. 

Throughout each fiscal year, our technical team meets with the independent reserve engineers to review properties and discuss evaluation methods and assumptions used in the proved reserves estimates, in accordance with our prescribed internal control procedures. Our internal controls over the reserves estimation process include verification of input data into our reserves evaluation software as well as management review, such as, but not limited to the following: 

&#8226; 

Comparison of historical expenses from the lease operating statements and workover authorizations for expenditure to the operating costs input in our reserves database; 

&#8226; 

Review of working interests and net revenue interests in our reserves database against our well ownership system; 

&#8226; 

Review of historical realized prices and differentials from index prices as compared to the differentials used in our reserves database; 

&#8226; 

Review of updated capital costs prepared by our operations team; 

&#8226; 

Review of internal reserve estimates by well and by area by our internal reservoir engineers; 

&#8226; 

Discussion of material reserve variances among our internal reservoir engineers and our Senior Vice President of Asset Management and Chief Engineer; 

&#8226; 

Review of a preliminary copy of the reserve report by our President and Chief Operating Officer with our internal technical staff; and 

&#8226; 

Review of our reserves estimation process by our Audit Committee on an annual basis. 

Production, revenues and price history 

We produce and market oil and natural gas, which are commodities. The price that we receive for the oil and natural gas we produce is largely a function of market supply and demand. Demand is impacted by general economic conditions, weather and other seasonal conditions, including hurricanes and tropical storms. Over or under supply of oil or natural gas can result in substantial price volatility. Oil supply in the United States has grown dramatically over the past few years, and this has contributed to the current global oversupply of crude oil, which has caused a sharp decline in oil prices since mid-2014. In 2015, oil inventories continued to build as global oil supply continued to outpace demand. As of February 8, 2016 , the spot crude oil price was $29.71 &#32;per barrel, a 20% &#32;decrease since December 31, 2015 &#32;and a 39% &#32;decrease as compared to an average WTI of $48.75 per barrel during the year ended December 31, 2015 . Historically, commodity prices have been volatile, and we expect that volatility to continue in the future. Further declines in oil and natural gas prices, extended low oil and natural gas prices or poor drilling results could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, quantities of oil and natural gas reserves that may be economically produced and our ability to access capital markets. Please see &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212;Risks related to the oil and natural gas industry and our business&#8212;Further declines, or extended current low commodity prices, in oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments.&#8221; 

The following table sets forth information regarding our oil and natural gas production, realized prices and production costs for the periods indicated. For additional information on price calculations, please see information set forth in &#8220;Item 7.

115.1 

In 2013, we focused on delineation and appraisal of the Bakken and Three Forks formations, resulting in substantially all of our acreage being delineated as of December 31, 2013. In 2014, we focused on full field development. In 2015, we continued in full field development mode with a focus on improving capital efficiency and completing more wells using high-intensity completion techniques. We also continued to participate in a number of wells on a non-operated basis. 

We did not drill any dry hole wells in 2015 , 2014 &#32;or 2013 . 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had three operated rigs running, 2 &#32;gross ( 0.4 &#32;net) operated wells drilling, as one rig was in the process of moving to the next well, and an inventory of 85 &#32;gross operated wells waiting on completion. We expect to continue to focus on drilling with two &#32;operated rigs in the Bakken and Three Forks formations within our core acreage in 2016 . 

Capital expenditure budget 

In 2015 , we spent $610.0 million &#32;on capital expenditures, which represented a 61% decrease from the $1,572.6 million spent during 2014 . This decrease was due to reduced drilling and completion activity as a result of lower commodity prices in 2015 coupled with lower well costs as a result of both improved operational efficiency and lower service costs, partially offset by higher capital expenditures for OMS, primarily related to the natural gas processing plant we are constructing in the Wild Basin area of our core acreage in North Dakota. See &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Liquidity and capital resources&#8212;Cash flows used in investing activities.&#8221; 

We have decreased our planned 2016 &#32;capital expenditures as compared to 2015 &#32;as a result of the current lower commodity prices. Our total 2016 &#32;capital expenditure budget is $400 million , which includes $237 million &#32;for exploration and production (&#8220;E&#38;P&#8221;) capital expenditures and $163 million &#32;for non-E&#38;P capital expenditures, including OMS, OWS, capitalized interest and administrative capital. We plan to complete approximately 46 gross ( 28.6 &#32;net) operated wells and participate in 0.6 &#32;net non-operated wells that are expected to be completed and brought on production in 2016 . Our planned E&#38;P capital expenditures include $200 million &#32;of drilling and completion (including production-related equipment) capital expenditures for operated and 

non-operated wells (including expected savings from services provided by OWS and OMS) and $37 million &#32;of other E&#38;P capital expenditures. Our planned non-E&#38;P capital expenditures include $140 million &#32;of midstream capital to continue to develop the natural gas processing plant and other infrastructure in Wild Basin and $23 million &#32;of other non-E&#38;P capital expenditures. 

While we have budgeted $400 million &#32;for these purposes, the ultimate amount of capital we will expend may fluctuate materially based on market conditions, our ability to secure external funding for our Wild Basin project and the success of our drilling results as the year progresses. Additionally, if we acquire additional acreage, our capital expenditures may be higher than budgeted. See &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Liquidity and capital resources.&#8221; 

Description of properties 

Our operations are focused in the North Dakota and Montana areas of the Williston Basin. While we have interests in a substantial number of wells in the Williston Basin that target several different zones, our development activities are currently concentrated in the Bakken and Three Forks formations. Our management team originally targeted the Williston Basin because of its oil-prone nature, multiple producing horizons, substantial resource potential and management&#8217;s previous professional history in the basin. The Williston Basin also generally has established infrastructure and access to materials and services. 

The entire Williston Basin is spread across North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana and parts of southern Canada. The basin produces oil and natural gas from numerous producing horizons including, but not limited to, the Bakken, Three Forks, Madison and Red River formations. A report issued by the United States Geological Survey in April 2008 classified these formations as the largest continuous oil accumulation ever assessed by it in the contiguous United States. The Williston Basin has recently been one of the most actively drilled unconventional oil resource plays in the United States, reaching over 200 rigs drilling in the basin in 2014, although the active rig count decreased throughout 2015 due to low oil prices and fell to fewer than 50 rigs drilling in the basin in early 2016. Most rigs that are running in the Williston Basin are focused on drilling areas with the highest estimated ultimate recoveries that have attractive economics even in depressed oil price environments. Our development activity is focused in the deepest part of the Williston Basin, which we call the core. 

The Devonian-age Bakken formation is found within the Williston Basin underlying portions of North Dakota and Montana and is comprised of three lithologic members including the upper shale, middle Bakken and lower shale. The formation ranges up to 150 feet thick. The upper and lower shales are highly organic, thermally mature and over pressured and can act as both a source and reservoir for the oil. The middle Bakken, which varies in composition from a silty dolomite to shaley limestone or sand, also serves as a reservoir and is a critical component for commercial production. Generally, the Bakken formation is found at vertical depths of 8,500 to 11,500 feet. Based on our geologic interpretation of the Bakken formation, the evolution of completion techniques, our own drilling results and publicly available drilling results for other operators in the basin, we believe that a substantial portion of our Williston Basin acreage is prospective in the Bakken formation. 

The Three Forks formation, generally found immediately under the Bakken formation, has also proven to contain productive reservoir rock. The Three Forks formation typically consists of interbedded dolomites and shale with local development of a discontinuous sandy member at the top, known as Sanish sand. The Three Forks formation is an unconventional carbonate play. Based on our geologic interpretation of the Three Forks formation, the evolution of completion techniques, our own drilling results and publicly available drilling results for other operators in the basin, we believe that much of our Williston Basin acreage is prospective in the Three Forks formation. 

Our total leasehold position in the Williston Basin as of December 31, 2015 &#32;consisted of 484,745 net acres. Our estimated net proved reserves in the Williston Basin were 218.2 MMBoe at December 31, 2015 . Of our estimated net proved reserves in the Williston Basin, approximately 147.6 MMBoe were proved developed reserves, which are comprised of a combination of wells drilled to conventional reservoirs, Bakken and Three Forks wells drilled with older completion techniques, and to a much larger extent, Bakken and Three Forks wells drilled with completion techniques similar to those we currently employ. Of our estimated net proved reserves, 70.7 MMBoe were proved undeveloped reserves, all of which consisted of Bakken and Three Forks wells to be drilled with more recent completion techniques, although our proved undeveloped reserves do not incorporate the impact of high intensity completion techniques. As of December 31, 2015 , we had a total of 689.2 net operated and non-operated producing wells and 658.8 &#32;net operated producing wells in the Williston Basin. We had average daily production of 50,477 &#32;net Boe per day for the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;in the Williston Basin. During 2015 , our Bakken and Three Forks wells produced a daily average of 49,788 &#32;net Boe per day with 595.5 net producing wells on December 31, 2015 . Accordingly, our 595.5 net Bakken and Three Forks wells were responsible for 99% &#32;of our average daily production during 2015 . As of December 31, 2015 , our working interest for all producing wells averaged 56% &#32;and in the wells we operate was approximately 79% . As of December 31, 2015 , we had 117 gross ( 63.8 &#32;net) wells in the process of being drilled or completed in the Williston Basin, which includes 2 &#32;gross operated wells drilling, 85 &#32;gross operated wells waiting on completion and 30 

gross non-operated wells drilling or completing. We participated in 121 gross ( 64.3 &#32;net) wells that were completed and brought on production during 2015 . 

Marketing, transportation and major customers 

The Williston Basin crude oil rail and pipeline transportation and refining infrastructure has grown substantially in recent years, largely in response to drilling activity in the Bakken and Three Forks formations. In December 2015 , oil production in North Dakota was approximately 1,152,000 barrels per day. According to the North Dakota Pipeline Authority website&#8217;s data last updated January 15, 2016 , there was approximately 827,000 barrels per day of crude oil pipeline transportation capacity and approximately 1,490,000 barrels per day of specifically dedicated rail loading capacity in the Williston Basin as of December 31, 2015 . In 2015 , we continued to sell a significant amount of our crude oil production through gathering systems connected to multiple pipeline and rail facilities. These gathering systems, which typically originate at the wellhead, reduce the need to transport barrels by truck from the wellhead. As of December 31, 2015 , we were flowing over 80% &#32;of our gross operated oil production through these gathering systems. 

Crude oil produced and sold in the Williston Basin has historically sold at a discount to WTI due to transportation costs and takeaway capacity. In the past, there have been periods when this discount has substantially increased due to the production of oil in the area increasing to a point that it temporarily surpasses the available pipeline transportation, rail transportation and refining capacity in the area. Expansions of both rail and pipeline facilities have reduced the prior constraint on oil transportation out of the Williston Basin and improved netback pricing received at the lease. In 2015, our price differentials relative to WTI strengthened as new pipelines opened to eastern Canada and U.S. markets and transportation on rail gradually declined. In the first quarter of 2015, as WTI declined, our price differentials increased as a percentage of WTI to a 16% discount but decreased in terms of the dollar per barrel discount to WTI to an average of $7.85 per barrel of oil. In the second quarter of 2015, as WTI improved, our price differentials decreased to approximately 10% as a percentage of WTI and continued to decrease in terms of the dollar per barrel discount to WTI to an average of $5.90 per barrel of oil. In the second half of 2015, while WTI fell again, our price differentials strengthened, decreasing to less than $5.00 per barrel of oil and remaining at approximately 10% as a percentage of WTI. Our market optionality on the crude oil gathering systems allows us to shift volumes between pipeline and rail markets in order to optimize price realizations. For a discussion of the potential risks to our business that could result from transportation and refining infrastructure constraints in the Williston Basin, please see &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212;Risks related to the oil and natural gas industry and our business&#8212;Insufficient transportation or refining capacity in the Williston Basin could cause significant fluctuations in our realized oil and natural gas prices.&#8221; 

We principally sell our oil and natural gas production to refiners, marketers and other purchasers that have access to nearby pipeline and rail facilities. Our marketing of oil and natural gas can be affected by factors beyond our control, the effects of which cannot be accurately predicted. For a description of some of these factors, please see &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212;Risks related to the oil and natural gas industry and our business&#8212;Market conditions or operational impediments may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks related to the oil and natural gas industry and our business&#8212;Insufficient transportation or refining capacity in the Williston Basin could cause significant fluctuations in our realized oil and natural gas prices.&#8221; At the end of 2015, the U.S. government lifted the long-standing ban on crude oil exports. While we believe this could have a positive impact on the long-term value of Bakken crude oil, current market conditions are not expected to result in sizeable quantities of U.S. crude oil being exported out of the country. 

In an effort to improve price realizations from the sale of our oil and natural gas, we manage our commodities marketing activities in-house, which enables us to market and sell our oil and natural gas to a broader array of potential purchasers. As of December 31, 2015 , we sold a substantial majority of our oil and condensate through bulk sales at delivery points on crude oil gathering systems or directly at the wellhead to a variety of purchasers at prevailing market prices under short-term contracts that normally provide for us to receive a market-based price, which incorporates regional differentials that include, but are not limited to, transportation costs and adjustments for product quality. We also entered into various short-term sales contracts for a portion of our portfolio at fixed differentials. Due to the availability of other markets and pipeline connections, we do not believe that the loss of any single oil or natural gas customer would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows. 

For the year ended December 31, 2015 , sales to Shell Trading (US) Company accounted for approximately 10% of our total sales. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, sales to Musket Corporation accounted for approximately 13% and 11% of our total sales, respectively. No other purchasers accounted for more than 10% of our total oil and natural gas sales for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 . We believe that the loss of any of these purchasers would not have a material adverse effect on our operations, as there are a number of alternative crude oil and natural gas purchasers in the Williston Basin. 

Since most of our oil and natural gas production is sold under market-based or spot market contracts, the revenues generated by our operations are highly dependent upon the prices of and demand for oil and natural gas. The price we receive for our oil and natural gas production depends upon numerous factors beyond our control, including but not limited to seasonality, weather, competition, availability of transportation and gathering capabilities, worldwide and regional economic conditions, global and domestic oil supply, foreign imports, political conditions in other oil-producing and natural gas-producing regions, the actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, and domestic government regulation, legislation and policies. Please see &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212;Risks related to the oil and natural gas industry and our business&#8212;Further declines, or extended current low commodity prices, in oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments.&#8221; Furthermore, a decrease in the price of oil and natural gas could have an adverse effect on the carrying value of our estimated proved reserves and on our revenues, profitability and cash flows. Please see &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212;Risks related to the oil and natural gas industry and our business&#8212;If oil and natural gas prices remain at their current level for an extended period of time or continue to decline, we may be required to take write-downs of the carrying values of our oil and natural gas properties.&#8221; 

Market, economic, transportation and regulatory factors may in the future materially affect our ability to market our oil or natural gas production. Please see &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212;Risks related to the oil and natural gas industry and our business&#8212;Market conditions or operational impediments may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production.&#8221; 

Competition 

The oil and natural gas industry is worldwide and highly competitive in all phases. We encounter competition from other oil and natural gas companies in all areas of operation, including the acquisition of leasing options on oil and natural gas properties to the exploration and development of those properties. Our competitors include major integrated oil and natural gas companies, numerous independent oil and natural gas companies, individuals and drilling and income programs. Many of our competitors are large, well established companies that have substantially larger operating staffs and greater capital resources than we do. Such companies may be able to pay more for lease options on oil and natural gas properties and exploratory locations and to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and locations than our financial or human resources permit. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will depend upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. Please see &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212;Risks related to the oil and natural gas industry and our business&#8212;Competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, making it more difficult for us to acquire properties, market oil and natural gas and secure trained personnel.&#8221; 

Title to properties 

As is customary in the oil and gas industry, we initially conduct a preliminary review of the title to our properties on which we do not have proved reserves. Prior to the commencement of drilling operations on those properties, we conduct a thorough title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant title defects. To the extent title opinions or other investigations reflect title defects on those properties, we are typically responsible for curing any title defects at our expense. We generally will not commence drilling operations on a property until we have cured any material title defects on such property. We have obtained title opinions on substantially all of our producing properties and believe that we have satisfactory title to our producing properties in accordance with general industry standards. Prior to completing an acquisition of producing oil and natural gas leases, we perform title reviews on the most significant leases and, depending on the materiality of the properties, we may obtain a title opinion or review previously obtained title opinions. Our oil and natural gas properties are subject to customary royalty and other interests, liens to secure borrowings under our revolving credit facility, liens for current taxes and other burdens, which we believe do not materially interfere with the use or affect our carrying value of the properties. Please see &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212;Risks related to the oil and natural gas industry and our business&#8212;We may incur losses as a result of title defects in the properties in which we invest.&#8221; 

Seasonality 

Winter weather conditions and lease stipulations can limit or temporarily halt our drilling, completion and producing activities and other oil and natural gas operations. These constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay or temporarily halt our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs. Such seasonal anomalies can also pose challenges for meeting our well drilling objectives and may increase competition for equipment, supplies and personnel during the spring and summer months, which could lead to shortages and increase costs or delay or temporarily halt our operations. 

Regulation of the oil and natural gas industry 

Our operations are substantially affected by federal, state and local laws and regulations. In particular, oil and natural gas production and related operations are, or have been, subject to price controls, taxes and numerous other laws and regulations. All of the jurisdictions in which we own or operate properties for oil and natural gas production have statutory provisions regulating the exploration for and production of oil and natural gas, including provisions related to permits for the drilling of wells, bonding requirements to drill or operate wells, the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process and the abandonment of wells. Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations. These include regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the number of wells which may be drilled in an area, and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas wells, as well as regulations that generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability or fair apportionment of production from fields and individual wells. 

Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability. Although we believe we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and that continued substantial compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations, such laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted. Additionally, currently unforeseen environmental incidents may occur or past non-compliance with environmental laws or regulations may be discovered. Therefore, we are unable to predict the future costs or impact of compliance. Additional proposals and proceedings that affect the oil and natural gas industry are regularly considered by Congress, the states, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (&#8220;FERC&#8221;) and the courts. We cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective. 

Regulation of transportation of oil 

Sales of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices. Nevertheless, Congress could reenact price controls in the future. 

Our sales of crude oil are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. The transportation of oil by common carrier pipelines is also subject to rate and access regulation. The FERC regulates interstate oil pipeline transportation rates under the Interstate Commerce Act. In general, interstate oil pipeline rates must be cost-based, although settlement rates agreed to by all shippers are permitted and market-based rates may be permitted in certain circumstances. Effective January 1, 1995, the FERC implemented regulations establishing an indexing system (based on inflation) for transportation rates for oil pipelines that allows a pipeline to increase its rates annually up to a prescribed ceiling, without making a cost of service filing. Every five years, the FERC reviews the appropriateness of the index level in relation to changes in industry costs. Most recently, on December 16, 2010, the FERC established a new price index for the five-year period beginning July 1, 2011. 

Intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates, varies from state to state. Insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers, we believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors who are similarly situated. 

Further, interstate and intrastate common carrier oil pipelines must provide service on a non-discriminatory basis. Under this open access standard, common carriers must offer service to all similarly situated shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates. When oil pipelines operate at full capacity, access is generally governed by prorationing provisions set forth in the pipelines&#8217; published tariffs. Accordingly, we believe that access to oil pipeline transportation services generally will be available to us to the same extent as to our similarly situated competitors. 

We sell a significant amount of our crude oil production through gathering systems connected to rail facilities. Several derailments of freight trains, including the events in July 2013 in Lac M&#233;gantic, have led federal and state regulators to examine whether the hazardous nature of crude oil from the Bakken shale is being assessed properly prior to its shipment. In particular, there are concerns that the testing and ensuing designations of the crude oil on the shipping documentation do not in all cases accurately capture the flammability of the Bakken crude oil. On January 2, 2014, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (&#8220;PHMSA&#8221;) released a Safety Alert alerting regulators, emergency responders, transporters and shippers that crude oil from the Bakken Shale may have flammability characteristics that are different from other forms of crude oil and that it was vital that all shipments of crude oil be tested and properly characterized on all shipping documentation. The Safety Alert also notified the regulated community that PHMSA and the Federal Railroad Administration have launched &#8220;Operation Classification,&#8221; which is an ongoing enforcement initiative that involves unannounced inspections on crude oil shipments to test the contents of the shipments in order to ensure that they are properly characterized. In August 2014, the U.S. Department of Transportation released a report finding that, based on the results of Operation Classification from August 2013 

to May 2014, Bakken crude oil tends to be more volatile and flammable than other crude oils, and thus poses an increased risk for a significant accident. 

In addition, these events have also spurred efforts to improve the safety of tank cars that are used in transporting crude oil by rail. Since 2011, all new railroad tank cars that have been built to transport crude oil or other petroleum type fluids (e.g., ethanol) have been built to more stringent safety standards. In May 2015, PHMSA adopted a final rule that, among other things, imposes a new and enhanced tank car design standard for certain tank cars carrying crude oil and ethanol, a phase out by as early as January 2018 for older DOT-111 tank cars that are not retrofitted, and a classification and testing program for unrefined petroleum based products, including crude oil. The rule also includes new operational requirements such as routing analyses, speed restrictions and enhanced braking controls. Safety improvements or updates to existing tank cars that are imposed under the May 2015 PHMSA final rule could drive up the cost of transport and lead to shortages in availability of tank cars. We do not currently own or operate rail transportation facilities or rail cars; however, we cannot assure that costs incurred by the railroad industry to comply with these enhanced standards resulting from PHMSA&#8217;s final rule will not increase our costs of doing business or limit our ability to transport and sell our crude oil at favorable prices, the consequences of which could be material to our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, we believe that any such consequences would not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors who are similarly situated. 

Efforts are likewise underway in Canada to assess and address risks from the transport of crude oil by rail. Shortly after the Lac M&#233;gantic tragedy, Transport Canada issued a series of emergency directives aimed at certain practices that were identified immediately after the accident. Likewise, Transport Canada is assessing the compensation and liability scheme for shipments by rail so that sufficient funds are available to compensate victims and respond to the incident without making taxpayers fund any aspect of those efforts. Transport Canada has also issued recent legal requirements that align with the U.S. May 2015 PHMSA final rule in many respects. In January 2014, the Canadian Transportation Safety Board made several recommendations to Transport Canada regarding tank car safety, routing of freight trains and the capabilities of emergency responders. In April 2014, Transport Canada issued a protective order prohibiting oil shippers from using 5,000 of the DOT-111 tank cars and imposing a phase out for tank cars that do not meet certain safety requirements by as early as May 2017. Transport Canada also imposed a 50 mile-per-hour speed limit on trains carrying hazardous materials and required all crude oil shipments in Canada to have an emergency response plan. 

We believe we are in substantial compliance with applicable hazardous materials transportation requirements related to our operations. We do not believe that compliance with federal, state or local hazardous materials transportation regulations will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. However, future events, such as changes in existing laws (including changes in the interpretation of existing laws), the promulgation of new laws and regulations, including any voluntary measures introduced by the rail industry, that result in new requirements for the design, construction or operation of tank cars used to transport crude oil, or the development or discovery of new facts or conditions could increase our costs of doing business and limit our ability to transport and sell our crude oil at favorable prices, the consequences of which could be material to our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, we believe that any such consequences would not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors who are similarly situated. 

Regulation of transportation and sales of natural gas 

Historically, the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce has been regulated by the FERC under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (&#8220;NGA&#8221;), the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (&#8220;NGPA&#8221;) and regulations issued under those statutes. In the past, the federal government has regulated the prices at which natural gas could be sold. While sales by producers of natural gas can currently be made at market prices, Congress could reenact price controls in the future. Deregulation of wellhead natural gas sales began with the enactment of the NGPA and culminated in adoption of the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act which removed all price controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas effective January 1, 1993. 

FERC regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates, and terms and conditions of service, which affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas. Since 1985, the FERC has endeavored to make natural gas transportation more accessible to natural gas buyers and sellers on an open and non-discriminatory basis. The FERC has stated that open access policies are necessary to improve the competitive structure of the interstate natural gas pipeline industry and to create a regulatory framework that will put natural gas sellers into more direct contractual relations with natural gas buyers by, among other things, unbundling the sale of natural gas from the sale of transportation and storage services. Beginning in 1992, the FERC issued a series of orders, beginning with Order No. 636, to implement its open access policies. As a result, the interstate pipelines&#8217; traditional role of providing the sale and transportation of natural gas as a single service has been eliminated and replaced by a structure under which pipelines provide transportation and storage service on an open access basis to others who buy and sell natural gas. Although the FERC&#8217;s orders do not directly regulate natural gas producers, they are intended to foster increased competition within all phases of the natural gas industry. 

In 2000, the FERC issued Order No. 637 and subsequent orders, which imposed a number of additional reforms designed to enhance competition in natural gas markets. Among other things, Order No. 637 revised the FERC&#8217;s pricing policy by waiving price ceilings for short-term released capacity for a two-year experimental period, and effected changes in FERC regulations relating to scheduling procedures, capacity segmentation, penalties, rights of first refusal and information reporting. The natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated. Therefore, we cannot provide any assurance that the less stringent regulatory approach recently established by the FERC under Order No. 637 will continue. However, we do not believe that any action taken will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way it affects other natural gas producers. 

The price at which we sell natural gas is not currently subject to federal rate regulation and, for the most part, is not subject to state regulation. However, with regard to our physical sales of energy commodities, we are required to observe anti-market manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by the FERC and/or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (&#8220;CFTC&#8221;) and the Federal Trade Commission (&#8220;FTC&#8221;). Please see below the discussion of &#8220;Other federal laws and regulations affecting our industry&#8212;Energy Policy Act of 2005.&#8221; Should we violate the anti-market manipulation laws and regulations, we could also be subject to related third party damage claims by, among others, sellers, royalty owners and taxing authorities. In addition, pursuant to Order No. 704, some of our operations may be required to annually report to FERC on May 1 of each year for the previous calendar year. Order No. 704 requires certain natural gas market participants to report information regarding their reporting of transactions to price index publishers and their blanket sales certificate status, as well as certain information regarding their wholesale, physical natural gas transactions for the previous calendar year depending on the volume of natural gas transacted. Please see below the discussion of &#8220;Other federal laws and regulations affecting our industry&#8212;FERC market transparency rules.&#8221; 

Gathering services, which occur upstream of FERC jurisdictional transmission services, are regulated by the states onshore and in state waters. Although the FERC has set forth a general test for determining whether facilities perform a non-jurisdictional gathering function or a jurisdictional transmission function, the FERC&#8217;s determinations as to the classification of facilities is done on a case by case basis. State regulation of natural gas gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory take requirements. Although such regulation has not generally been affirmatively applied by state agencies, natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny in the future. 

Intrastate natural gas transportation and facilities are also subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies, and certain transportation services provided by intrastate pipelines are also regulated by FERC. The basis for intrastate regulation of natural gas transportation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate natural gas pipeline rates and services varies from state to state. Insofar as such regulation within a particular state will generally affect all intrastate natural gas shippers within the state on a comparable basis, we believe that the regulation of similarly situated intrastate natural gas transportation in any states in which we operate and ship natural gas on an intrastate basis will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors. Like the regulation of interstate transportation rates, the regulation of intrastate transportation rates affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas. 

Regulation of production 

The production of oil and natural gas is subject to regulation under a wide range of local, state and federal statutes, rules, orders and regulations. Federal, state and local statutes and regulations require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. We own and operate properties in North Dakota and Montana, which have regulations governing conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of maximum allowable rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, the regulation of well spacing, and plugging and abandonment of wells. The effect of these regulations is to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill, although we can apply for exceptions to such regulations or to have reductions in well spacing. Moreover, both states impose a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids within their jurisdictions. 

The failure to comply with these rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. Our competitors in the oil and natural gas industry are subject to the same regulatory requirements and restrictions that affect our operations. 

Other federal laws and regulations affecting our industry 

Energy Policy Act of 2005. On August 8, 2005, President Bush signed into law the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (&#8220;EPAct 2005&#8221;). EPAct 2005 is a comprehensive compilation of tax incentives, authorized appropriations for grants and guaranteed loans and significant changes to the statutory policy that affects all segments of the energy industry. Among other matters, EPAct 2005 amends the NGA to add an anti-manipulation provision which makes it unlawful for any entity to engage in prohibited behavior to be prescribed by FERC, and furthermore provides FERC with additional civil penalty authority. EPAct 2005 provides the 

FERC with the power to assess civil penalties of up to $1 million per day for violations of the NGA and increases the FERC&#8217;s civil penalty authority under the NGPA from $5,000 per violation per day to $1 million per violation per day. The civil penalty provisions are applicable to entities that engage in the sale of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce. On January 19, 2006, FERC issued Order No. 670, a rule implementing the anti-manipulation provision of EPAct 2005, and subsequently denied rehearing. The rule makes it unlawful for any entity, directly or indirectly, in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, to (1) use or employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud; (2) make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading; or (3) engage in any act, practice or course of business that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person. The new anti-manipulation rules do not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non-jurisdictional sales or gathering, but do apply to activities of gas pipelines and storage companies that provide interstate services, such as Section 311 service, as well as otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted &#8220;in connection with&#8221; gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction, which now includes the annual reporting requirements under Order No. 704, as described below. The anti-manipulation rules and enhanced civil penalty authority reflect an expansion of FERC&#8217;s NGA enforcement authority. Should we fail to comply with all applicable FERC administered statutes, rules, regulations and orders, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines. 

FERC market transparency rules. On December 26, 2007, FERC issued a final rule on the annual natural gas transaction reporting requirements, as amended by subsequent orders on rehearing, or Order No. 704. Under Order No. 704, wholesale buyers and sellers of more than 2.2 million MMBtu of physical natural gas in the previous calendar year, including interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines, natural gas gatherers, natural gas processors, natural gas marketers and natural gas producers, are required to report, on May 1 of each year, aggregate volumes of natural gas purchased or sold at wholesale in the prior calendar year to the extent such transactions utilize, contribute to or may contribute to the formation of price indices. It is the responsibility of the reporting entity to determine which individual transactions should be reported based on the guidance of Order No. 704. Order No. 704 also requires market participants to indicate whether they report prices to any index publishers and, if so, whether their reporting complies with FERC&#8217;s policy statement on price reporting. 

Effective November 4, 2009, pursuant to the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the FTC issued a rule prohibiting market manipulation in the petroleum industry. The FTC rule prohibits any person, directly or indirectly, in connection with the purchase or sale of crude oil, gasoline or petroleum distillates at wholesale from: (a) knowingly engaging in any act, practice or course of business, including the making of any untrue statement of material fact, that operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person; or (b) intentionally failing to state a material fact that under the circumstances renders a statement made by such person misleading, provided that such omission distorts or is likely to distort market conditions for any such product. A violation of this rule may result in civil penalties of up to $1 million per day per violation, in addition to any applicable penalty under the Federal Trade Commission Act. 

North Dakota Industrial Commission oil and gas rule changes. &#32;The North Dakota Industrial Commission (&#8220;NDIC&#8221;) has adopted more stringent rule changes to its existing oil and gas regulations. The rules became effective on April 1, 2012 and, among other things, impose relatively higher bonding amounts for the drilling of wells, severely restrict the discharge and storage of production wastes such as produced water, drilling mud, waste oil and other wastes in earthen pits, implement more stringent hydraulic fracturing requirements and require the provision of public disclosure on the national website, FracFocus.org, regarding chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. Compliance with these recent rule changes by oil and natural gas exploration and production operators in general and us in particular increased our well costs from 2012 to 2015 , and we expect to continue to incur these increased costs in order to remain in compliance. 

In 2014, the NDIC adopted an order intended to reduce natural gas flaring, which order was subsequently modified in late 2015. Please see below the discussion of &#8220;Environmental protection and natural gas flaring initiatives.&#8221; In addition, on December 9, 2014, the NDIC adopted new conditioning standards to improve the safety of Bakken crude oil for transport. The rule became effective April 1, 2015 and sets operating standards for conditioning equipment to properly separate production fluids. The rule includes parameters for temperatures and pressures for production equipment. The rule also addresses limits to vapor pressure of produced crude oil. 

Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are pending before Congress, FERC and the courts. We cannot predict the ultimate impact of these or the above regulatory changes to our natural gas operations. We do not believe that we would be affected by any such action materially differently than similarly situated competitors. 

Environmental and occupational health and safety regulation 

Our exploration, development and production operations are subject to stringent federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations governing occupational health and safety, the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations may, among other things, require the acquisition of permits to conduct 

exploration, drilling and production operations; govern the amounts and types of substances that may be released into the environment; limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities in environmentally-sensitive areas such as wetlands, wilderness areas or areas inhabited by endangered species; require investigatory and remedial actions to mitigate pollution conditions; impose obligations to reclaim and abandon well sites and pits; and impose specific criteria addressing worker protection. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory, remedial and corrective action obligations, the occurrence of delays in the development of projects and the issuance of orders enjoining some or all of our operations in affected areas. These laws and regulations may also restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise be possible. The regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability. 

The trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment, and thus, any changes in federal or state environmental laws and regulations or reinterpretation of applicable enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly well construction, drilling, water management or completion activities, or waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position. We may be unable to pass on such increased compliance costs to our customers. Moreover, accidental releases or spills may occur in the course of our operations, and we cannot assure you that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including any third-party claims for damage to property, natural resources or persons. While we believe that we are in substantial compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with current requirements would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, there is no assurance that we will be able to remain in compliance in the future with such existing or any new laws and regulations or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. 

The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental and occupational health and safety laws, as amended from time to time, to which our business operations are subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or financial position. 

Hazardous substances and wastes 

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (&#8220;CERCLA&#8221;), also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a &#8220;hazardous substance&#8221; into the environment. These classes of persons include current and prior owners or operators of the site where the release occurred and entities that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances released at the site. Under CERCLA, these &#8220;responsible persons&#8221; may be subject to joint and several, strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;) and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other pollutants into the environment. We generate materials in the course of our operations that may be regulated as hazardous substances. 

We are also subject to the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (&#8220;RCRA&#8221;) and comparable state statutes. RCRA imposes strict requirements on the generation, storage, treatment, transportation, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes. Under the authority of the EPA, most states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. RCRA currently exempts certain drilling fluids, produced waters and other wastes associated with exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas from regulation as hazardous wastes. These wastes, instead, are regulated under RCRA&#8217;s less stringent nonhazardous waste provisions, state laws or other federal laws. However, it is possible that certain oil and natural gas exploration, development and production wastes now classified as nonhazardous wastes could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. For example, in August 2015, several non-governmental organizations filed notice of intent to sue the EPA under RCRA for, among other things, the agency&#8217;s alleged failure to reconsider whether such exclusion should continue to apply. Repeal or modification of this RCRA exclusion or similar exemptions under state law could increase the amount of hazardous waste we are required to manage and dispose of and could cause us to incur increased operating costs, which could have a significant impact on us as well as the oil and natural gas industry in general. In the course of our operations, we generate ordinary industrial wastes, such as paint wastes, waste solvents and waste oils that may be regulated as hazardous wastes. 

We currently own or lease, and have in the past owned or leased, properties that have been used for numerous years to explore and produce oil and natural gas. Although we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at 

the time, petroleum hydrocarbons, hazardous substances and wastes may have been released on, under or from the properties owned or leased by us or on, under or from, other locations where these petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes have been taken for recycling or disposal. In addition, certain of these properties have been operated by the third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of petroleum hydrocarbons, hazardous substances and wastes were not under our control. These properties and the substances disposed or released thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater) and to perform remedial plugging or pit closure operations to prevent future contamination. 

Air emissions 

The federal Clean Air Act (&#8220;CAA&#8221;) and comparable state laws and regulations restrict the emission of various air pollutants from many sources through air emissions standards, construction and operating permitting programs, and the imposition of other monitoring and reporting requirements. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions of certain pollutants. Obtaining permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. Over the next several years, we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or other air emissions-related issues. For example, in October 2015, the EPA issued a final rule under the CAA, lowering the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (&#8220;NAAQS&#8221;) for ground-level ozone to 70 parts per billion under both the primary and secondary standards to provide requisite protection of public health and welfare, respectively. We review new rules such as this one to assess their impact on our operations. Compliance with this final rule or any other new legal requirements could, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of our equipment, result in longer permitting timelines, and significantly increase our capital expenditures and operating costs, which could adversely impact our business. 

Environmental protection and natural gas flaring initiatives 

We attempt to conduct our operations in a manner that protects the health, safety and welfare of the public, our employees and the environment. We are focused on the reduction of air emissions produced from our operations, particularly with respect to flaring of natural gas from our operated well sites. The rapid growth of crude oil production in North Dakota in recent years, coupled with a historical lack of natural gas gathering infrastructure in the state, has led to efforts to reduce flaring of natural gas produced in association with crude oil production. We recognize the environmental and financial risks associated with natural gas flaring, and we seek to manage these risks on an ongoing basis and reduce flaring from our operated well sites. 

We believe that one of the leading causes of natural gas flaring from the Bakken and Three Forks formations is the inability of operators to promptly connect their wells to natural gas processing and gathering infrastructure due to external factors out of the control of the operator, such as, for example, the granting of right-of-way access by land owners, investment from third parties in the development of gas gathering systems and processing facilities, and the development and adoption of regulations. However, we have allocated significant resources to connect our Bakken and Three Forks wells to natural gas infrastructure in a timely manner to reduce our flared volumes. We have exceeded a goal that we voluntarily set in 2014 to maintain well connections for an average of 90% of our operated Bakken and Three Forks wells, by having approximately 98% and 97% of our operated Bakken and Three Forks wells connected to gathering systems as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We believe that achieving this goal helps us to minimize our flared volumes of natural gas. 

On July 1, 2014, the NDIC adopted Order No. 24665 (the &#8220;July 2014 Order&#8221;), pursuant to which the agency adopted legally enforceable &#8220;gas capture percentage goals&#8221; targeting the capture of 74% of natural gas produced in the state by October 1, 2014, 77% of such gas by January 1, 2015, 85% of such gas by January 1, 2016 and 90% of such gas by October 1, 2020. Modification of the July 2014 Order was announced by the NDIC in the fourth quarter of 2015, resulting in the existing January 1, 2015 gas capture rate of 77% being extended to April 1, 2016 and updated gas capture rates of 80% by April 1, 2016, 85% by November 1, 2016, 88% by November 1, 2018 and 91% by November 1, 2020. The July 2014 Order established an enforcement mechanism for policy recommendations that were previously adopted by the NDIC in March 2014. Those recommendations required all exploration and production operators applying for new drilling permits in the state after June 1, 2014 to develop Gas Capture Plans that provide measures for reducing the amount of natural gas flared by those operators so as to be consistent with the agency&#8217;s gas capture percentage goals. In particular, the July 2014 Order provided that after an initial 90-day period, wells must meet or exceed the NDIC&#8217;s gas capture percentage goals on a per-well, per-field, county or statewide basis. Failure to comply with the gas capture percentage goals will result in an operator having to restrict its production to 200 barrels of oil per day if at least 60% of the monthly volume of associated natural gas produced from the well is captured, or 100 barrels of oil per day if less than 60% of such monthly volume of natural gas is captured. As of December 31, 2015 , we were capturing approximately 91% of our natural gas production in North Dakota. While we were in compliance with these 

requirements as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and expect to remain in compliance in the future, there is no assurance that we will be able to remain in compliance in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operation results. 

Climate change 

The EPA has determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases (&#8220;GHG&#8221;) present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are contributing to warming of the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere and other climatic changes. In response to this determination, the EPA adopted regulations under existing provisions of the CAA that establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration (&#8220;PSD&#8221;) construction and Title V operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources that already are potential major sources of certain principal, or criteria, pollutant emissions. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their GHG emissions also will be required to meet &#8220;best available control technology&#8221; standards, which typically will be established by the states. These EPA rules could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified facilities. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified sources in the United States on an annual basis, including, among others, oil and natural gas production facilities, which include certain of our operations. We are monitoring GHG emissions from our operations in accordance with the GHG emissions reporting rule and believe that our monitoring activities are in substantial compliance with applicable reporting obligations. 

While from time to time Congress has considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce GHG emissions at the federal level in recent years. In the absence of such federal climate legislation, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions by means of cap and trade programs that typically require major sources of GHG emissions to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs. If Congress undertakes comprehensive tax reform in the coming year, it is possible that such reform may include a carbon tax, which could impose additional direct costs on operations and reduce demand for refined products. The adoption of any new legislation or regulations that requires reporting of GHGs or otherwise restricts emissions of GHGs from our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations or could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce. For example, in August 2015, the EPA announced proposed rules, expected to be finalized in 2016, that would establish new controls for methane emissions from certain new, modified or reconstructed equipment and processes in the oil and natural gas source category, including production activities, as part of an overall effort to reduce methane emissions by up to 45% in 2025. On an international level, the United States is one of almost 200 nations that agreed in December 2015 to an international climate change agreement in Paris, France that calls for countries to set their own GHG emissions targets and be transparent about the measures each country will use to achieve its GHG emissions targets. It is not possible at this time to predict how new methane restrictions would impact the our business or how or when the United States might impose restrictions on GHGs as a result of the international agreement agreed to in Paris. 

Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events; if any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our exploration and production operations. 

Water discharges 

The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the &#8220;Clean Water Act&#8221;) and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into state waters and waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or the analogous state agency. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements under federal law require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. The Clean Water Act also prohibits the discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters, including wetlands, unless authorized by permit. The EPA released a final rule in May 2015 that attempted to clarify federal jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act over waters of the United States, but a number of legal challenges to this rule are pending, and implementation of the rule has been stayed nationwide. To the extent this rule expands the scope of the Clean Water Act&#8217;s jurisdiction, drilling programs could incur increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas. 

The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (&#8220;OPA&#8221;) amends the Clean Water Act, and sets minimum standards for prevention, containment and cleanup of oil spills. The OPA applies to vessels, offshore facilities and onshore facilities, including exploration and 

production facilities that may affect waters of the United States. Under the OPA, responsible parties including owners and operators of onshore facilities may be held strictly liable for oil cleanup costs and natural resource damages as well as a variety of public and private damages that may result from oil spills. The OPA also requires owners or operators of certain onshore facilities to prepare Facility Response Plans for responding to a worst-case discharge of oil into waters of the United States. 

Operations associated with our production and development activities generate drilling muds, produced waters and other waste streams, some of which may be disposed of by means of injection into underground wells situated in non-producing subsurface formations. The NDIC rule changes effective in 2012 severely restrict the discharge and storage of production wastes including produced water in earthen pits, which increases the likelihood that injection wells are used to dispose of appropriate waste streams. These injection wells are regulated by the federal Safe Drinking Water Act and analogous state laws. The underground injection well program under the Safe Drinking Water Act requires permits from the EPA or analogous state agency for disposal wells that we operate, establishes minimum standards for injection well operations and restricts the types and quantities of fluids that may be injected. Any leakage from the subsurface portions of the injection wells may cause degradation of freshwater, potentially resulting in cancellation of operations of a well, imposition of fines and penalties from governmental agencies, incurrence of expenditures for remediation of affected resources and imposition of liability by landowners or other parties claiming damages for alternative water supplies, property damages and personal injuries. Moreover, any changes in the laws or regulations or the inability to obtain permits for new injection wells in the future may affect our ability to dispose of produced waters and ultimately increase the cost of our operations, which costs could be significant. Furthermore, in response to recent seismic events near underground injection wells used for the disposal of oil and gas-related wastewaters, federal and some state agencies have begun investigating whether such wells have caused increased seismic activity, and some states have shut down or imposed moratoria on the use of such injection wells. If new regulatory initiatives are implemented that restrict or prohibit the use of underground injection wells in areas where we rely upon the use of such wells in our operations, our costs to operate may significantly increase and our ability to continue production may be delayed or limited, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. 

Hydraulic fracturing activities 

Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from unconventional formations, including shales. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into targeted subsurface formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. We routinely use hydraulic fracturing techniques in many of our drilling and completion programs. The process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions, but several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, the EPA issued CAA final regulations in 2012 and proposed additional CAA regulations in August 2015 governing performance standards for the oil and natural gas industry; proposed in April 2015 effluent limitations guidelines that waste water from shale natural gas extraction operations must meet before discharging to a treatment plant; and issued in 2014 a prepublication of its Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding Toxic Substances Control Act reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. Also, the federal Bureau of Land Management (&#8220;BLM&#8221;) published a final rule in March 2015 that establishes new or more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands but, in September 2015, the U.S. District Court of Wyoming issued a preliminary injunction barring implementation of this rule, which order the BLM could appeal and is being separately appealed by certain environmental groups. 

From time to time Congress has considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. In addition, some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. States could elect to prohibit hydraulic fracturing altogether, following the lead of the State of New York in 2015. Local government also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. Nevertheless, if new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells. 

In addition, certain governmental reviews are underway that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. The White House Council on Environmental Quality is coordinating an administration-wide review of hydraulic fracturing practices. Also, the EPA released its draft report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources in June 2015, which report concluded that hydraulic fracturing activities have not led to widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water sources in the United States, although there are above and below ground mechanisms by which hydraulic fracturing activities have the potential to impact drinking water sources. However, in January 2016, the EPA&#8217;s Science Advisory Board provided its comments on the draft study, indicating its concern that the EPA&#8217;s conclusion of no widespread, systemic impacts 

on drinking water sources arising from fracturing activities did not reflect the uncertainties and data limitations associated with such impacts, as described in the body of the draft report. The final version of this EPA report remains pending and is expected to be completed in 2016. Such EPA final report, when issued, as well as any future studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing. 

Please see &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212;We may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our operations. Additionally, we may not be insured for, or our insurance may be inadequate to protect us against, these risks.&#8221; 

Endangered Species Act considerations 

The federal Endangered Species Act (&#8220;ESA&#8221;) may restrict exploration, development and production activities that may affect endangered and threatened species or their habitats. The ESA provides broad protection for species of fish, wildlife and plants that are listed as threatened or endangered in the United States and prohibits the taking of endangered species. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Federal agencies are required to ensure that any action authorized, funded or carried out by them is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or modify their critical habitats. Some of our facilities may be located in areas that are designated as habitat for endangered or threatened species. If endangered or threatened species are located in areas of the underlying properties where we wish to conduct seismic surveys, development activities or abandonment operations, such work could be prohibited or delayed or expensive mitigation may be required. Moreover, as a result of a settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is required to make a determination on a listing of numerous species as endangered or threatened under the ESA by no later than completion of the agency&#8217;s 2017 fiscal year. The designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where underlying property operations are conducted could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in delays or limitations on our exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce reserves. 

Operations on federal lands 

Performance of oil and gas exploration and production activities on federal lands, including Indian lands and lands administered by the federal BLM are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act (&#8220;NEPA&#8221;). NEPA requires federal agencies, including the BLM and the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs, to evaluate major agency actions, such as the issuance of permits that have the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will prepare an environmental assessment that assesses the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed environmental impact statement that may be made available for public review and comment. Depending on any mitigation strategies recommended in such environmental assessments or environmental impact statements, we could incur added costs, which could be substantial, and be subject to delays or limitations in the scope of oil and natural gas projects. Authorizations under NEPA are also subject to protest, appeal or litigation, any or all of which may delay or halt our exploration and production activities. 

Employee health and safety 

We are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (&#8220;OSHA&#8221;) and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we employed 535 people. Our future success will depend partially on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements and have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages. We consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory. From time to time we utilize the services of independent contractors to perform various field and other services. 

Offices 

As of December 31, 2015 , we leased 111,628 square feet of office space in Houston, Texas at 1001 Fannin Street, where our principal offices are located. The lease for our Houston office expires in September 2020. We also own field offices in the North Dakota communities of Williston, Powers Lake and Alexander.
