 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160;

Overview 

&#160;

We are an oil and natural gas exploration and production company. Our properties are located in North Dakota and Montana. Our corporate strategy is the acquisition, exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas properties, primarily in the Bakken and Three Forks trends in North Dakota and Montana. As of December 31, 2015, we had proven oil and gas reserves of 2.3 million barrels of oil equivalents, owned interest in 349 gross (10.95 net) producing oil and gas wells, and controlled the rights to mineral leases covering approximately 8,100 net acres for prospective drilling to the Bakken and/or Three Forks formations. The following table provides a summary of important information regarding our assets:

&#160;

During 2015 commodity prices for crude oil, natural gas and Natural gas liquids (&#8220;NGLs&#8221;) experienced sharp declines, and this downward trend has accelerated further into the first quarter of 2016, with crude oil prices reaching a twelve-year low in February 2016.

&#160;

Looking forward, we are in the midst of satisfying the conditions to close on a restructuring transaction with our secured lenders that is described below in &#8220;Recent Developments.&#8221; We expect to complete such transaction in April or May of 2016. Following such transaction, our focus will be on managing the oil and gas assets in which we will continue to have an indirect minority interest. In addition, we will continue to pursue distressed asset acquisitions in the Bakken and/or Three Forks formation that may be acquired with capital from our secured lenders as part of the restructuring terms, existing joint venture partners or other capital providers.

&#160;

Effective April 2, 2012, we changed our name to Black Ridge Oil &#38; Gas, Inc. Our common stock is traded on the OTCQB under the trading symbol &#8220;ANFC.&#8221;

Recent Developments 

&#160;

On March 29, 2016, the Company entered into an Asset Contribution Agreement with Black Ridge Holding Company, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (&#8220;BRHC&#8221;) which was recently formed by the Company to contribute and assign to BRHC, all of the Company's (i) oil and gas assets (including working capital and tangible and intangible assets) (the &#8220;Assets&#8221;), (ii) outstanding balances under that certain Credit Agreement between the Company, as borrower, and Cadence Bank, N.A. (&#8220;Cadence&#8221;), as lender (the &#8220;Cadence Credit Facility&#8221;) and the outstanding balances under that certain Credit Agreement between the Company, as borrower, and the several banks and other financial institutions or entities from time to time parties thereto (the &#8220;Chambers&#8221;), and Chambers, as administrative agent (the &#8220;Chambers Credit Facility&#8221;) and (iii) all current liabilities related to the Assets, in exchange for 5% of the issued and outstanding Class A Units (the &#8220;Class A Units&#8221;) in BRHC (the &#8220;Asset Contribution&#8221;). On March 29, 2016, affiliates of Chambers Energy Management, LP (&#8220;Chambers&#8221;) (specifically, Chambers Energy Capital II, LP and CEC II TE, LLC (collectively, the &#8220;Chambers Affiliates&#8221;)) entered into a Debt Contribution Agreement between BRHC and the Chambers Affiliates, pursuant to which BRHC will issue a number of Class A Units representing 95% of the Class A Units of BRHC to the Chambers Affiliates in exchange for the release of BRHC's obligations under the Chambers Credit Facility (the &#8220;Satisfaction of Debt&#8221; and, together with the Asset Contribution, the &#8220;BRHC Transaction&#8221;). Concurrent with the Satisfaction of Debt, each warrant originally issued with the Chambers Credit Facility shall be automatically retired and cancelled. The closing of the BRHC Transaction is subject to the Company obtaining the approval of stockholders holding a majority of its outstanding capital stock and to the Company having assigned the Cadence Credit Agreement to BRHC with Cadence&#8217;s consent, and BRHC and Cadence entering into any applicable amendment agreements related to such assignment and waiver of financial covenant ratio compliance for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 and quarter ending March 31, 2016. The Company is currently in the process of preparing to satisfy both conditions.

&#160;

The terms of the Class A Units of BRHC will be set forth in the limited liability company agreement of BRHC (the &#8220;LLC Agreement&#8221;), which will be effective upon the closing of the BRHC Transaction. All distributions by BRHC of cash or other property, and whether upon liquidation or otherwise, will be made as follows:

&#160;

&#183; First, 100% to the Class A Members, pro rata, until each Class A Member has received distributions in aggregate totaling the then Class A Preference, which is an amount equal to a 10.0% internal rate of return on the invested capital amount. &#183; Second, 90% to the Class A Members, pro rata, and 10% to the Class B Members, pro rata, until such time as the aggregate distributions to Chambers equals 250% of the capital contribution of its Class A Units. &#183; Third, 80% to the Class A Members, pro rata, and 20% to the Class B Members, pro rata. &#160; BRHC will be managed by the BRHC Board, which will be responsible for the conduct of the day-to-day business of BRHC and the management, oversight and disposition of the assets of BRHC. The initial BRHC Board will be comprised of three managers, consisting of two managers appointed by Chambers and one member from the Company.

&#160;

In addition, under the LLC Agreement, Chambers will commit to contribute up to $30 million cash (the &#8220;Chambers Investment Commitment&#8221;) to BRHC in exchange for Class A Units. At Closing, Chambers shall fund $10 million (the &#8220;Initial Chambers Investment&#8221;) of the Chambers Investment Commitment, the proceeds of which shall be used to reduce outstanding amounts owed by BRHC to Cadence under the Cadence Credit Facility and for general corporate purposes. The remaining $20 million (the &#8220;Subsequent Chambers Investment&#8221;), subject to certain conditions, may be called from time to time during the Investment Period by the board of managers of BRHC (the &#8220;BRHC Board&#8221;). The Initial Chambers Investment and any Subsequent Chambers Investment shall serve to proportionately reduce the Company's Class A Units percentage ownership in BRHC. The investment period shall be the lesser of three years or such time as the entire Chambers Investment Commitment has been called by the BRHC Board (the &#8220;Investment Period&#8221;). Any portion of Chambers Investment Commitment not called by the BRHC Board prior to the expiration of the Investment Period will be cancelled. In no event will Chambers be required to make a capital contribution in an amount in excess of its undrawn commitment.

&#160;

The Company will be granted 1,000,000 Class B Units in BRHC at the Closing of the BRHC Transaction. At the discretion of the BRHC&#8217;s Board of Managers, the Company may be granted additional Class B Units in BRHC, and in turn, the Company may transfer such Class B Units to certain members of the Company's management. Subject to certain conditions, the Class B Units will entitle the holders to participate in any future distributions of BRHC after distributions equal to the capital contributions and preferred return have been made to the holders of Class A Units of BRHC.

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

At the closing of the BRHC transaction, the Company will enter into a Management Services Agreement with BRHC. Under the Management Services Agreement, the Company will provide services to BRHC with respect to the business operations of BRHC, including but not limited to locating, investigating and analyzing potential non-operator oil and gas projects and day-to-day operations related to such projects. The Company will be paid a fee under the Management Services Agreement intended to cover the costs of providing such services and will be reimbursed for certain third party expenses. The term of the Management Services Agreement commences on the closing of the BRHC Transaction and continues indefinitely, unless terminated. The Management Services Agreement will provide termination provisions upon reasonable notice for both the BRHC and the Company as well as upon a change of control, provided that if the Management Services Agreement is terminated before January 1, 2017 that BRHC shall pay the Company a termination fee equal to the amount that would have been paid if the Management Services Agreement was in place until January 1, 2017.

&#160;

The summaries of the LLC Agreement, Management Services Agreement, Asset Contribution Agreement, and Debt Contribution Agreement in this Form 10-K do not purport to be complete and are qualified by reference to the LLC Agreement, Management Services Agreement, Asset Contribution Agreement, and Debt Contribution Agreement which will be filed as exhibits to the Company's Information Statement filed on Form Schedule 14C which will be filed as soon as practical by the Company.

&#160;

Other Developments 

&#160;

Potential Reverse Stock Split 

&#160;

Our Board approved resolutions authorizing the Company to implement a reverse stock split of the Company&#8217;s outstanding shares of Common Stock at a ratio of up to 1:10 and any related amendment to the Company&#8217;s certificate of incorporation. Our stockholders have also approved the amendment by written consent.

&#160;

Our Board of Directors or a committee of the Board of Directors has the authority to decide whether to implement a reverse stock split and the exact amount of the split within the foregoing range, if it is to be implemented. If the reverse split is implemented, the number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock would be reduced in accordance with the exchange ratio selected by the Board of Directors or a committee thereof. The total number of authorized shares of Common Stock will be reduced proportionately as a result of the reverse stock split and the total number of shares of authorized preferred stock will remain unchanged at 20,000,000 shares.

&#160;

We believe that a reverse split would, among other things, (i) better enable the Company to obtain a listing on a national securities exchange, (ii) facilitate higher levels of institutional stock ownership, where investment policies generally prohibit investments in lower-priced securities and (iii) better enable the Company to raise funds to finance its planned operations. There can be no assurance however that we will be able to obtain a listing on a national securities exchange even if we implement the reverse stock split.

AS OF THE DATE OF THIS FILING, OUR BOARD HAS NOT TAKEN ANY ACTION TO MAKE THE POTENTIAL REVERSE STOCK SPLIT EFFECTIVE. 

&#160;

Business 

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s focus is the acquisition, exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas properties, primarily in the Bakken and Three Forks trends in North Dakota and Montana. As of February 29, 2016, we controlled approximately 7,400 net acres in the Williston Basin. In addition, as of February 29, 2016, the Company owned working interests in 376 gross wells representing 11.15 net wells that are preparing to drill, drilling, awaiting completion, completing or producing.

&#160;

We believe we create value through selectively targeting acquisition of acreage positions with attractive returns on the capital employed by evaluating, amongst other factors, reserve potential, operator performance, anticipated well costs and anticipated operating expenses.

&#160;

With the experience and connections of our personnel in the Williston Basin region, we believe that we are able to create value through opportunistic acreage acquisitions. We believe our business model enhances our ability to identify and acquire high value acreage in the Bakken and Three Forks trends. Because we purchase minority interests in multiple drilling units, we are able to diversify our risk across numerous wells. We believe that our prospective success revolves around our ability to acquire mineral leases and participate in drilling activities by virtue of our ownership of such rights and through our experience and the relationships we have developed in the Williston Basin.

&#160;

As a non-operating working interest partner, we participate in drilling activities primarily on a heads-up basis. Before a well is spud, an operator is required to offer all mineral lease owners in the designated well spacing unit the right to participate in the drilling and production of the well. Drilling costs and revenues from oil and gas sales are split pro-rata based on acreage ownership in the designated drilling unit. We rely on our operator partners to identify specific drilling sites, permit, and engage in the drilling process. As a non-operator we are focused on maintaining a low overhead structure.

&#160;

Our proven oil and gas reserves were 2.3 million barrel of oil equivalents (Boe&#8217;s) as of December 31, 2015 and 5.4 million Boe&#8217;s as of December 31, 2014.

&#160;

Production Methods 

&#160;

We primarily engage in crude oil and natural gas exploration and production by participating on a pro-rata basis with operators in wells drilled and completed in spacing units that include our acreage under lease. We are generally a minority working interest owner in our wells. We typically depend on drilling partners to propose, permit and engage the drilling of wells. Prior to commencing drilling, our partners are required to provide all owners of mineral interests within the designated spacing unit the opportunity to participate in the drilling costs and revenues of the well to the extent of their pro-rata share of such interest within the spacing unit. Going forward as we manage the oil and gas assets for BRHC and for other joint venture partners, we will assess each drilling opportunity on a case-by-case basis. We will participate in wells that we expect to meet BRHC&#8217;s and any other of our other joint venture partners&#8217; return thresholds based upon our estimates of ultimate recoverable crude oil and natural gas, anticipated crude oil and natural gas pricing and other factors.

&#160;

We do not manage our commodities marketing activities internally, but our operating partners generally market and sell crude oil and natural gas produced from wells in which we have an interest. Our operating partners coordinate the transportation of our crude oil production from our wells to appropriate distribution points pursuant to arrangements that such partners negotiate and maintain with various parties purchasing the production. We understand that our partners generally sell our production to a variety of purchasers at prevailing market prices under separately negotiated short-term contracts. The price at which production is sold generally is tied to the spot market for crude oil. Williston Basin Light Sweet Crude from the Bakken source rock is generally 41-42 API crude oil and is readily accepted into the pipeline infrastructure.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The crude oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive, and we compete with numerous other crude oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. Most of these companies have substantially greater resources than we have. Our competitors not only explore for and produce crude oil and natural gas, but many also conduct midstream and refining operations and market petroleum products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. These additional operations may enable them to pay more for exploratory prospects and productive crude oil and natural gas properties than us. They also may have more resources to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit.

&#160;

Our larger or integrated competitors may have the resources to absorb the burden of existing and changing federal, state, and local laws and regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position. Our ability to discover reserves and acquire additional properties in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment. In addition, we may be at a disadvantage in acquiring crude oil and natural gas properties and bidding for exploratory prospects because we have fewer financial and human resources than other companies in our industry.

&#160;

Marketing and Customers 

&#160;

The market for crude oil and natural gas depends on factors beyond our control, including the extent of domestic production and imports of crude oil and natural gas, the proximity and capacity of natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities, demand for crude oil and natural gas, the marketing of competitive fuels and the effects of state and federal regulation. The crude oil and natural gas industry also competes with other industries in supplying the energy and fuel requirements of industrial, commercial and individual consumers.

&#160;

Our crude oil production is expected to be sold at prices tied to the spot crude oil markets. Our natural gas production is expected to be sold under short-term contracts and priced based on first of the month index prices or on daily spot market prices. We rely on our operating partners to market and sell our production. Our operating partners include a variety of exploration and production companies, from large publicly-traded companies to small, privately-owned companies.

&#160;

Principal Agreements Affecting Our Ordinary Business 

&#160;

We do not own any physical real estate, but, instead, our acreage is comprised of leasehold interests subject to the terms of lease agreements that provide our company the right to drill and maintain wells in specific geographic areas. All lease arrangements that comprise our acreage positions are established using industry-standard terms that have been established and used in the crude oil and natural gas industry in North Dakota. Most of our leases are acquired from other parties that obtained the original leasehold interest prior to our acquisition of the leasehold interest.

&#160;

In general, our lease agreements stipulate three to five year terms including extension options. Bonuses and royalty rates are negotiated on a case-by-case basis consistent with industry standard pricing. Once a well is drilled, or production is established, depending on the lease terms, the acreage in a well&#8217;s drilling unit is considered &#8220;held by production,&#8221; meaning the lease on that particular acreage continues as long as oil or gas is being produced. Generally, other locations within the drilling unit created for a well may also be drilled at any time with no time limit as long as the lease is held by production. In the event a lease is not developed prior to lease expiration, the Company completes an economic evaluation of the expiring lease and makes a strategic decision to exercise an available option, attempt to extend the lease, or allow it to expire. As a result of these evaluations and taking into consideration other acquisition opportunities available to the Company, we expect a portion of our leases will expire prior to being held by production. The Company had leases encompassing 1,866 net acres expire in 2015 and leases encompassing 4,202 net acres expire in 2014. We estimate that leases encompassing approximately 1,114 net acres will expire in 2016. All of the costs associated with the lease expirations in 2015 and the leases we estimate will expire in 2016 have been transferred to the full cost pool and were subject to depletion in 2015.

&#160;

&#160;

Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters 

&#160;

Our operations are subject to various rules, regulations and limitations impacting the crude oil and natural gas exploration and production industry as a whole.

&#160;

Regulation of Crude Oil and Natural Gas Production 

&#160;

Our crude oil and natural gas exploration, production and related operations, when developed, are subject to extensive rules and regulations promulgated by federal, state, tribal and local authorities and agencies. For example, North Dakota and Montana require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations, and impose other requirements relating to the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas. Such states may also have statutes or regulations addressing conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of crude oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of maximum rates of production from wells, and the regulation of spacing, plugging and abandonment of such wells. Failure to comply with any such rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on the crude oil and natural gas industry will most likely increase our cost of doing business and may affect our profitability. Although we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, because such rules and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted, we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws. Significant expenditures may be required to comply with governmental laws and regulations and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

&#160;

Environmental Matters 

&#160;

Our operations and properties are subject to extensive and changing federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including the generation, storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment, and relating to safety and health. The recent trend in environmental legislation and regulation generally is toward stricter standards, and this trend will likely continue. These laws and regulations may:

&#160;

&#183; require the acquisition of a permit or other authorization before construction or drilling commences and for certain other activities; &#183; limit or prohibit construction, drilling and other activities on certain lands lying within wilderness and other protected areas; and &#183; impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from its operations. &#160;

The permits required for our operations may be subject to revocation, modification and renewal by issuing authorities. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce their regulations, and violations are subject to fines and injunctions. In the opinion of management, we are in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations, and have no material commitments for capital expenditures to comply with existing environmental requirements. Nevertheless, changes in existing environmental laws and regulations or in interpretations of them could have a significant impact on our company, as well as the crude oil and natural gas industry in general.

&#160;

The Comprehensive Environmental, Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (&#8220;CERCLA&#8221;) and comparable state statutes impose strict, joint and several liability on owners and operators of sites and on persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of &#8220;hazardous substances&#8221; found at such sites. It is not uncommon for the neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. The Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (&#8220;RCRA&#8221;) and comparable state statutes govern the disposal of &#8220;solid waste&#8221; and &#8220;hazardous waste&#8221;, and authorize the imposition of substantial fines and penalties for noncompliance. Although CERCLA currently excludes petroleum from its definition of &#8220;hazardous substance,&#8221; state laws affecting our operations may impose clean-up liability relating to petroleum and petroleum related products. In addition, although RCRA classifies certain crude oil field wastes as &#8220;non-hazardous,&#8221; such exploration and production wastes could be reclassified as hazardous wastes thereby making such wastes subject to more stringent handling and disposal requirements.

&#160;

The Endangered Species Act (&#8220;ESA&#8221;) seeks to ensure that activities do not jeopardize endangered or threatened animal, fish and plant species, nor destroy or modify the critical habitat of such species. Under ESA, exploration and production operations, as well as actions by federal agencies, may not significantly impair or jeopardize the species or its habitat. ESA provides for criminal penalties for willful violations of the Act. Other statutes that provide protection to animal and plant species and that may apply to our operations include, but are not necessarily limited to, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, the Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the National Historic Preservation Act. Although we believe that our operations will be in substantial compliance with such statutes, any change in these statutes or any reclassification of a species as endangered could subject our company to significant expenses or could force our company to discontinue certain operations.

&#160;

On April 17, 2012, the EPA finalized rules establishing new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations. The EPA&#8217;s rule package includes New Source Performance Standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds (&#8220;VOCs&#8221;) and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and processing activities. On August 5, 2013, the EPA issued final updates to its 2012 VOC performance standards for storage tanks. The rules establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from compressors, dehydrators, storage tanks and other production equipment. In addition, the rules revise leak detection requirements for natural gas processing plants. These rules may require a number of modifications to the operations of our third-party operating partners, including the installation of new equipment to control emissions from compressors. On January 15, 2015, the EPA announced that it will initiate a rulemaking to set standards for methane and VOC emissions from new and modified oil and gas production sources and natural gas-processing and transmission sources. Although we cannot predict the cost to comply with these new requirements at this point, compliance with these new rules could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, and could adversely impact our business . 

&#160;

These new regulations and proposals and any other new regulations requiring the installation of more sophisticated pollution control equipment could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

&#160;

The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, or the Clean Water Act (the &#8220;CWA&#8221;), imposes restrictions and controls on the discharge of produced waters and other pollutants into navigable waters. Permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into state and federal waters and to conduct construction activities in waters and wetlands. The CWA and certain state regulations prohibit the discharge of produced water, sand, drilling fluids, drill cuttings, sediment and certain other substances related to the oil and gas industry into certain coastal and offshore waters without an individual or general National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System discharge permit. In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. Some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions. Costs may be associated with the treatment of wastewater and/or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans. The CWA and comparable state statutes provide for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for unauthorized discharges of oil and other pollutants and impose liability on parties responsible for those discharges, for the costs of cleaning up any environmental damage caused by the release and for natural resource damages resulting from the release.

&#160;

The underground injection of oil and natural gas wastes are regulated by the Underground Injection Control program authorized by the Safe Drinking Water Act. The primary objective of injection well operating requirements is to ensure the mechanical integrity of the injection apparatus and to prevent migration of fluids from the injection zone into underground sources of drinking water. Substantially all of the oil and natural gas production in which we have interest is developed from unconventional sources that require hydraulic fracturing as part of the completion process. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into the formation to stimulate gas production. Legislation to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of &#8220;underground injection&#8221; and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, as well as legislative proposals to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process, were proposed in recent sessions of Congress. The U.S. Congress continues to consider legislation to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to subject hydraulic fracturing operations to regulation under the Act&#8217;s Underground Injection Control Program to require disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process.

&#160;

Scrutiny of hydraulic fracturing activities continues in other ways. The federal government is currently undertaking several studies of the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing. Several states, including Montana and North Dakota, where our properties are located, have also proposed or adopted legislative or regulatory restrictions on hydraulic fracturing. A number of municipalities in other states, including Colorado and Texas, have banned hydraulic fracturing. New York State&#8217;s ban on hydraulic fracturing was recently upheld by the Courts. We cannot predict whether any other legislation will ever be enacted and if so, what its provisions would be if additional levels of regulation and permits were required through the adoption of new laws and regulations at the federal or state level, which could lead to delays, increased operating costs and process prohibitions that would materially adversely affect our revenue and results of operations. 

&#160;

The National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, establishes a national environmental policy and goals for the protection, maintenance and enhancement of the environment and provides a process for implementing these goals within federal agencies. A major federal agency action having the potential to significantly impact the environment requires review under NEPA. Many of the activities of our third-party operating partners are covered under categorical exclusions which results in a shorter NEPA review process. The Council on Environmental Quality has announced an intention to reinvigorate NEPA reviews and on March 12, 2012, issued final guidance that may result in longer review processes that could lead to delays and increased costs that could materially adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.

Climate Change 

&#160;

Significant studies and research have been devoted to climate change and global warming, and climate change has developed into a major political issue in the United States and globally. Certain research suggests that greenhouse gas emissions contribute to climate change and pose a threat to the environment. Recent scientific research and political debate has focused in part on carbon dioxide and methane incidental to crude oil and natural gas exploration and production.

&#160;

In the United States, legislative and regulatory initiatives are underway to limit greenhouse gas (&#8220;GHG&#8221;) emissions. The U.S. Congress has considered legislation that would control GHG emissions through a &#8220;cap and trade&#8221; program and several states have already implemented programs to reduce GHG emissions. The U.S. Supreme Court determined that GHG emissions fall within the federal Clean Air Act, or the CAA, definition of an &#8220;air pollutant.&#8221; In response the EPA promulgated an endangerment finding paving the way for regulation of GHG emissions under the CAA. In 2010, the EPA issued a final rule, known as the &#8220;Tailoring Rule,&#8221; that makes certain large stationary sources and modification projects subject to permitting requirements for greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. On June 23, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA , held that the EPA&#8217;s &#8220;Tailoring Rule&#8221; was invalid, but held that if a source was subject to Prevention of Significant Deterioration (&#8220;PSD&#8221;) or Title V based on emissions of conventional pollutants like sulfur dioxide, particulates, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, ozone or lead, then the EPA could also require the source to control GHG emissions and the source would have to install Best Available Control Technology to do so. As a result, a source no longer is required to meet PSD and Title V permitting requirements based solely on its GHG emissions, but may still have to control GHG emissions if it is an otherwise regulated source. On February 23, 2014, Colorado became the first state in the nation to adopt rules to control methane emissions from oil and gas facilities. Subsequently, the Obama administration has approved rules that would require controls on methane emissions from certain oil and gas facilities. To the extent our third party operating partners are required to further control methane emissions, such controls could impact our business.

In addition, in September 2009, the EPA issued a final rule requiring the reporting of GHGs from specified large GHG emission sources in the United States beginning in 2011 for emissions in 2010. On November 30, 2010, the EPA published a final rule expanding its existing GHG emissions reporting to include onshore and offshore oil and natural gas systems beginning in 2012. Our third party operating partners are required to report their greenhouse gas emissions under these rules. Because regulation of GHG emissions is relatively new, further regulatory, legislative and judicial developments are likely to occur. Such developments may affect how these GHG initiatives will impact us. Moreover, while the U.S. Supreme Court held in its June 2011 decision American Electric Power Co. v. Connecticut that, with respect to claims concerning GHG emissions, the federal common law of nuisance was displaced by the federal Clean Air Act, the Court left open the question of whether tort claims against sources of GHG emissions alleging property damage may proceed under state common law. There thus remains some litigation risk for such claims. Due to the uncertainties surrounding the regulation of and other risks associated with GHG emissions, we cannot predict the financial impact of related developments on us.

Legislation or regulations that may be adopted to address climate change could also affect the markets for our products by making our products more or less desirable than competing sources of energy. To the extent that our products are competing with higher greenhouse gas emitting energy sources, our products would become more desirable in the market with more stringent limitations on greenhouse gas emissions. To the extent that our products are competing with lower greenhouse gas emitting energy sources such as solar and wind, our products would become less desirable in the market with more stringent limitations on greenhouse gas emissions. We cannot predict with any certainty at this time how these possibilities may affect our operations.

The majority of scientific studies on climate change suggest that stronger storms may occur in the future in the areas where we operate, although the scientific studies are not unanimous. Although operators may take steps to mitigate physical risks from storms, no assurance can be given that future storms will not have a material adverse effect on our business.

Employees 

&#160;

We currently have 8 full time employees. We may hire additional technical or administrative personnel as appropriate. However, we do not expect a significant change in the number of full time employees over the next 12 months based upon our currently-projected business plan. We are using and will continue to use the services of independent consultants and contractors to perform various professional services. We believe that this use of third-party service providers enhances our ability to contain general and administrative expenses. 

&#160;

Office Locations 

&#160;

Our executive offices are located at 10275 Wayzata Boulevard, Suite 100, Minnetonka, Minnesota 55305. Our office space consists of approximately 2,813 square feet leased pursuant to a month to month lease agreement that commenced on May 1, 2012 and was amended on November 15, 2013. The company that owns the building in which we are located is a company wholly owned by our chairman of the board of directors.

Financial Information about Segments and Geographic Areas 

&#160;

We have not segregated our operations into geographic areas given the fact that all of our production activities occur within the Williston Basin in North Dakota and Montana.
