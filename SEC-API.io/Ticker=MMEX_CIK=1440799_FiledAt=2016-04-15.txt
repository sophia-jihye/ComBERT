Company History 

&#160;

MMEX Resources Corporation (the Company or "MMEX") was formed in the State of Nevada on May 19, 2005 as Inkie Entertainment Group, Inc., for the purpose of engaging in the production, distribution and marketing of filmed entertainment products. On January 15, 2008, the Company changed its name to Quantum Information, Inc. In January 2009, the Company announced that it would transition out of the filmed entertainment products business and into the coal business. As part of that transition, on January 14, 2009, the Company sold all of its assets in exchange for the surrender to the Company of 4,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock, and the assumption of all of the Company's liabilities. The Company also changed its name to MGMT Energy, Inc. on February 5, 2009 to Management Energy, Inc. on May 28, 2009 to better reflect the Company's business focus. On September 23, 2010, the Company, through a reverse merger, acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Maple Carpenter Creek Holdings, Inc., ("MCCH") a Delaware Corporation, organized on October 15, 2009 as a holding Company with an 80% interest in Maple Carpenter Creek, LLC ("MCC"), which in turn owned a 95% interest in the subsidiary, Carpenter Creek, LLC ("CC"), and at the time of the merger, owned a 98.12% interest in Armadillo Holdings Group Corp. ("AHGC"), which in turn owned an 80% interest in Armadillo Mining Corp. ("AMC"). As of April 30, 2013, AHGC owned 94.6% of AMC through additional capital contributions. The non-controlling interest of 1.88% in AHGC was subsequently acquired by MCCH on December 21, 2010 in exchange for 313,339 shares of MMEX.On February 22, 2011, the Company amended its articles of incorporation to change the corporate name from Management Energy, Inc. to MMEX Mining Corporation.

On September 21, 2010, MMEX Resources Corporation, Inc entered into a merger agreement with Maple Carpenter Creek Holdings, Inc. ("MCCH"). MCCH is engaged in the development of both thermal and metallurgical coal projects in the U.S. and Colombia. MCCH had the following coal project interests as of the date of closing of the merger:

&#160;

Under the terms of the merger agreement, MCCH merged with a wholly owned subsidiary of MMEX Resources Corporation in exchange for the issuance of 6,500,000 shares of MMEX Resources Corporation common stock to the owners of MCCH, of which 5,000,000 shares were issued on October 8, 2010 and 1,500,000 shares were presented as common stock payable.

Status of Previously Reported Coal Project 

&#160;

Hunza Project: On January 20, 2011, a subsidiary of the Company executed an exclusive option agreement to purchase a 50% interest in C.I. Hunza Coal, Ltd. (Hunza), a Colombian limited liability corporation that holds various mining concessions in the Boyac&#225; Province of east-central Colombia. The coal prospects in the Hunza concessions are mid-volatility metallurgical or coking coal. We commissioned a technical report in accordance with Canadian National Instrument (NI) 43-101 specifications. Based on the report, the in-place coal tonnage estimate for the property is in the range of 45 to 50 million metric tons. The Company is undertaking a drilling program and until the drilling has been performed and the results analyzed, the estimates presented herein cannot be categorized as estimates of a coal resource under the standards of the 43-101 guidelines. 

&#160;

The Hunza Agreement was amended by the parties thereto on each of February 2, 2012 and February 29, 2012. On Mach 9, 2012, our subsidiary Armadillo Mining Corp, Colombia (AMCC), exercised its option pursuant to the Hunza Agreement and acquired a 50% interest in Hunza. As such, and in accordance with the Hunza Agreement, the Corporation made or had previously made the following payments:

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

$5,000,000 to Black Stone Investment S.A. as an arrangement fee;

&#160; &#160;

&#183; 

issuance of a convertible debenture in the principal amount of $1,200,000 to Black Stone Investment S.A as an agreement fee, convertible into Common Shares at the conversion price of US$0.30 per share; and

&#160; &#160;

&#183; 

$2,015,559 to Hunza to be used for exploration and development of the Hunza Project.

&#160;

The Hunza Agreement provides for the payment of $3,000,000 to Hunza upon the earlier of: (i) May 1, 2013; and (ii) 90 calendar days after the delivery of an updated technical report in respect of the work program recommended by the Technical Report to be carried out on the Hunza Project. Failure to pay this amount will immediately result in the reduction of AMCC's interest in Hunza from 50% to 25%. 

&#160;

In 2012, the primary operational activities of Hunza have been initiating the community relations activities in advance of the commencement of the work program to be carried out on the Hunza Project as recommended in the Technical Report. These activities involved working with the local community leaders to understand the needs of the communities in proximity to the Hunza Project. In 2012, Hunza also initiated a transportation and logistics feasibility study for marketing of coal, an update of the initial mine plan and a marketing study for metallurgical coal. With respect to the drilling program, negotiations are underway with the sub-contractor to finalize and to mobilize the drilling operations. Hunza has also engaged a Colombian underground mining operator to develop a complete pre-feasibility and feasibility mining plan for the mine development on the Hunza Project with a Small Scale Mining Plan for extraction of up 240,000 tons per year and a Large Scale Mining Plan providing for the increase in the production to 2,400,000 tons per year over the course of seven years. Additionally, in January and February 2012, Hunza obtained environmental and mining permits allowing for the production of up to 2,400,000 tons per year. 

&#160;

No mining activities have taken place on the Hunza Project since 2012. As of April 30, 2014, due to the fact that the Colombian government has suspended the Hunza Projects mining permits, the Company recorded a 2014 fiscal year impairment charge of $4,006,722 which represents 100% of the Hunza Project's net value after first reducing the assets by the payable of $3,000,000. See further discussion in the footnotes to the financial statements.

&#160;

As of April 13, 2016 the Company assigned AMC to an irrevocable trust (the "Trust"), whose beneficiaries are the existing shareholders of MMEX. AMC thru the Trust controls the Hunza coal interest previously owned by the Company.

&#160;

On October 7, 2014, Mr. William D. Gross, the holder of the MMEX Preferred Shares and certain MMEX notes (the "Instruments"), entered into an assignment agreement to assign the Instruments to Maple Project Finance, LLC ("MPF") and in turn, on October 9, 2014, MPF assigned the Instruments to Maple Structure Holdings, LLC ("MSH"). On May 15, 2015 MSH notified the Company that it would convert the Instruments into common shares at a conversion rate of US$0.01 per share, or otherwise foreclose on the Instruments. The Company has agreed with MSH to covert the outstanding Instruments of US$3,182,877 and the 3 rd Party debt of US$500,000 under a settlement agreement dated as of May 18, 2015 at the rate of US$0.01 per share. On May 18, 2015 the MMEX Board of Director approved these transactions. 

&#160;

On May 19, 2015, a majority of shareholders of the Company approved an amendment to Article 4 of the Company's Articles of Incorporation which was approved by the Company's Board of Directors on May 19, 2015. The Company amended its articles of incorporation on April 6, 2016 to change its corporate name to MMEX Resources Corporation and to increase the authorization of the Company to issue up to 1,010,000,000 shares of capital stock, of which 10,000,000 shares shall be Preferred Stock, $.001 par value ("Preferred Stock"), and 1,000,000,000 shares shall be Common Stock, $.001 par value ("Common Stock"). The Preferred Stock may be issued in one or more classes and series as determined and designated by the Board of Directors of the corporation, each such class and series to have the powers, preferences and rights, and qualifications, limitations and restrictions as shall be stated and as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company. As of April 13, 2016, the issued and outstanding common shares of the Company are 180,432,013 and no preferred shares.

&#160;

On November 10, 2015, the Company converted and transferred the Maple Structure Holdings, LLC shares. As of February 25,2016 the Company has 180,432,013 shares issued with 19,567,987 authorized but unissued.

&#160;

On April 6, 2016, The Company filed with the Nevada Secretary of State to amend its Articles of Incorporation to provide for the issuance of shares and changed its name to MMEX Resources Corporation which was approved on April 6, 2016.

&#160;

Effective as of April 12, 2016 the Board of Directors approved the change of the Company business to the refining, distribution of oil, gas and petroleum products and electric power.

&#160;

As of April 13, 2016 the Company assigned AMC to an irrevocable trust (the "MMEX Trust"), whose beneficiaries are the existing shareholders of MMEX. AMC thru the Trust controls the Hunza coal interest previously owned by the Company. 

&#160;

Oil, Gas ,,Refining, and Electric Power Development Strategy 

&#160;

As MMEX continues to expand its business and implement its business strategy, its current monthly cash flow requirements will exceed its near term cash flow from operations. In order to fund its deveopment costs the Company completed a private placement to qualified investors of US$ 105,000 in cash and services in July, August September of 2015 and April of 2016. The investors were granted warrants to purchase 11,512,171 common shares at an exercise price of $0.0001 per share for a 3 year period from the date of the Company 1 st future round of 3 rd party financing in exchange for the US$105,000 investment. 

&#160;

Notwithstanding this recent private placement, there can be no assurance that the Corporation will be able to generate sufficient cash from operations in future periods to satisfy its capital requirements. Therefore, the Corporation will have to continue to rely on external financing activities, including the sale of equity securities, to satisfy capital requirements for the foreseeable future. Equity financings of the type the Corporation has been required to pursue are dilutive to shareholders and may adversely impact the market price of the Common Shares. However, the Corporation has no commitments for borrowings or additional sales of equity, the precise terms upon which it may be able to attract additional funding is not known at this time, and there can be no assurance that it will be successful in consummating any such future financing transactions on terms satisfactory to MMEX, or at all.
