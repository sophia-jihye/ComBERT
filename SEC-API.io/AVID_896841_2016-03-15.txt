 ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS 

OVERVIEW 

We provide an open, integrated, and comprehensive technology platform, along with applications and services that enable the creation, distribution, and monetization of audio and video content. Specifically, we develop, market, sell, and support software and hardware for digital media content production, management and distribution. Digital media are video, audio or graphic elements in which the image, sound or picture is recorded and stored as digital values, as opposed to analog or tape-based signals. Our products are used in production and post-production facilities; film studios; network, affiliate, independent and cable television stations; recording studios; live-sound performance venues; advertising agencies; government and educational institutions; corporate communication departments; and by independent video and audio creative professionals, as well as aspiring professionals. Projects produced using our products include feature films, television programming, live events, news broadcasts, commercials, music, video and other digital media content. 

Our mission is to create the most powerful and collaborative media network that enables the creation, distribution and monetization of the most inspiring content in the world. Guided by our Avid Everywhere strategic vision, we strive to deliver the industry&#8217;s most open, innovative and comprehensive media platform connecting content creation with collaboration, asset protection, distribution and consumption for the media in the world &#8211; from the most prestigious and award-winning feature films, music recordings, and television shows, to live concerts and news broadcasts. We have been honored over time for our technological innovation with 14 Emmy Awards, one Grammy Award, two Oscars and the first ever America Cinema Editors Technical Excellence Award. Our solutions were used in all 2016 Oscar nominated films for Best Picture, Best Film Editing, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing and Best Original Score. Our audio solutions were also used in all 2016 Grammy nominated recordings for Best Album of The Year, Best Record of the Year and Best Song of the Year. 

RECENT EVENTS 

Restructuring Plan 

In the first quarter of 2016, we commenced restructuring actions that are part of a broad restructuring plan encompassing a series of measures intended to allow us to more efficiently operate in a leaner, and more directed cost structure. These include reductions in our workforce, facilities consolidation, transferring certain business processes to lower cost regions, and reducing other third-party services costs. In connection with this restructuring plan, we expect to incur incremental cash expenditures of approximately $25 million &#32;relating to termination benefits, facility costs, employee overlap expenses and related actions. We anticipate that the restructuring plan will be substantially complete by the end of the second quarter of 2017 and will result in annualized costs savings of appropriately $68 million . 

Financing Agreement with Cerberus Business Finance, LLC 

In connection with the cost efficiency program, on February 26, 2016 (the &#8220;Closing Date&#8221;), we entered into a Financing Agreement (the &#8220;Financing Agreement&#8221;) with Cerberus Business Finance, LLC, as collateral and administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto (the &#8220;Lenders&#8221;). Pursuant to the Financing Agreement, the Lenders agreed to provide us with (a) a term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $100 million &#32;(the &#8220;Term Loan&#8221;) and (b) a revolving credit facility (the &#8220;Credit Facility&#8221;) of up to a maximum of $5 million &#32;in borrowings outstanding at any time. All outstanding loans under the Financing Agreement will become due and payable, on the earlier of February 26, 2021 and the date that is 30 days prior to June 15, 2020, the scheduled maturity date of our outstanding 2.00% &#32;convertible senior notes due 2020. We borrowed the full amount of the Term Loan, or $100 million , as of the Closing Date, but did not borrow any amount under the Credit Facility as of the Closing Date. Proceeds from the term loan will be used to replace our existing $35 million &#32;revolving credit facility, finance the Company&#8217;s efficiency program and other initiatives, and provide operating flexibility throughout the remainder of the transformation in this period of heightened market volatility. We estimate that after paying for both debt issuance costs and the efficiency program, the new financing will provide approximately $70 million of available liquidity, about half of which replaces the existing revolving credit facility with the remainder providing incremental liquidity to strengthen the Company&#8217;s balance sheet. 

Concurrently with the entry into the Financing Agreement, on February 26, 2016, we terminated our existing Credit Agreement, dated June 22, 2015, with KeyBank National Association, as Administrative Agent and the other lender parties thereto, and repaid all outstanding borrowings under such agreement. There were no penalties paid by us in connection with this termination. 

For a more detailed description of the restructuring plan and the Financing Agreement, see Note P, Restructuring Costs and Accruals, and Note R, Long Term Debt and Credit Agreement, to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 

CORPORATE STRATEGY 

Technology has enabled almost every aspect of how we live to become increasingly digitized, and acceleration of digitization is having a tremendous impact on the media industry and altering the industry value chain. Today&#8217;s consumers are empowered to create and consume content on-demand-anywhere, anytime. Organizations are under pressure to connect and automate the entire creation-to-consumption workflow. This consumerization has increased the cost and complexity of monetizing assets, which in turn leads to demand for new platforms for distribution and consumption. Organizations need to rely on partners with the strategic understanding and technological expertise to help navigate the challenges they are facing. We believe we are uniquely positioned as a proven and trusted leader to effectively help our customers in the media industry navigate through this period of unprecedented changes. 

Our strategy is built on three pillars, Avid Everywhere, The Avid Advantage and the Avid Customer Association (&#8220;ACA&#8221;). Avid Everywhere is our strategic vision for connecting creative professionals and media organizations with their audiences in a more powerful, efficient, collaborative, and profitable way. Central to the Avid Everywhere vision is the Avid MediaCentral Platform, an open, extensible, and customizable foundation that streamlines and simplifies workflows by tightly integrating all Avid or third party products and services that run on top of it. The platform provides secure and protected access, which enables the creation and delivery of content faster and easier through a set of modular application suites that together represent an open, integrated, and flexible media production and distribution environment for the media industry. The Avid Advantage complements Avid Everywhere by offering a new standard in service, support and education to enable our customers to derive more efficiency from their Avid investment. Finally, the ACA is an association of dedicated media community visionaries, thought leaders and users designed to provide essential strategic leadership to the media industry, facilitate collaboration between Avid and key industry leaders and visionaries, and deepen relationships between our customers and us. 

Another key element of our strategy is our transition to a subscription or recurring revenue based model. In 2014 we began offering subscription based licensing options for some of our products and solutions. These licensing options offer choice in pricing and deployment to suit our customers&#8217; needs and are expected to increase recurring revenue on a longer term basis. However, during our transition to a recurring revenue model, we expect that our revenue, deferred revenue, and cash flow from operations will be adversely affected as an increasing portion of our total revenue is recognized ratably rather than up front, and as new product offerings are sold at a wider variety of price points. 

As a complement to our core strategy, we continue to review and implement programs throughout the Company to reduce costs, increase operational efficiencies, align talent and enhance our business, including in connection with the restructuring plan announced in February 2016, as described in more detail in &#8220;Recent Events&#8221; as part of which we are realigning our employee base to better serve our customers&#8217; needs. We expect these initiatives will be complete in mid-2017. 

We have organized our existing hardware and software products and introduced new solutions in four suites, all built upon the MediaCentral Platform. These four suites encompass both audio and video products and solutions and are summarized below: 

&#8226; 

Artist Suite encompasses all of our products and tools used to create content, including video editing solutions, digital audio workstations (DAW), music notation software, control surfaces and live sound systems. Products and tools in the Artist Suite can be deployed on premise, cloud-enabled, or through a hybrid approach. Users can collaborate to access, edit, and share the same media; and collaborate with others as if they were all in the same facility. 

&#8226; 

Media Suite &#32;includes all of our tools and services used to manage, protect, distribute, and monetize media, including solutions for newsroom management, asset management, and multiplatform distribution. We are also expanding the Media Suite to include metadata tagging, protection and encryption, and analytics. 

&#8226; 

Studio Suite &#32;comprises of in-studio tools for on-air program and viewership enhancement, including 3D real-time graphics, replay servers and sports enhancements. 

&#8226; 

Storage Suite refers to all of our products and tools used to capture, store, and deliver media, including online storage, nearline storage, and ingest/playout servers. These products and tools work in close concert with the Media Suite&#8217;s tagging and asset management.

Video Products and Solutions 

Professional Video Creative Tools 

We offer a range of software and hardware video-editing tools for the professional. Our award-winning Media Composer product line is used to edit video content, including television programming, commercials and films, while our NewsCutter option and iNews systems are designed for the fast-paced world of news production. Our Avid Symphony option is used during the &#8220;online&#8221; or &#8220;finishing&#8221; stage of post-production, during which the final program is assembled in high resolution with finished graphics, visual effects, color grading and audio tracks. Our Media Composer | Cloud solution enables broadcast news professionals to acquire, access, edit and finish stories anytime, from everywhere. Leveraging a cloud-based architecture, this solution gives contributors the ability to craft stories where they are happening and speed them to air while maintaining connectivity with the newsroom operation. In 2014, we released Media Composer version 8 with subscription offerings and updates, and with resolution flexibility and independence, which allows users to manage and edit high-resolution media content with ease. These new versions are designed to extend the production capabilities of these solutions and demonstrates our continuing commitment to provide tools that allow for improved creativity and productivity of the professional editor, delivered in a way most attractive to the user. In April 2015, we introduced the Avid Artist | DNxIO, a hardware interface designed to accelerate high-resolution video production. When combined with the industry&#8217;s preeminent Media Composer video editing software, the Avid Artist | DNxIO delivers best-in-class high-res video ingest, editing, monitoring, and output, giving video professionals the flexible, open, and integrated creative tools they need to efficiently create the highest-quality media. Further, because it is built on the Avid MediaCentral Platform, Avid Artist | DNxIO is compatible with any Avid Artist Suite solutions and many third-party creative tools.

Media Management Solutions 

Our Avid MediaCentral | UX &#32; web and mobile-based apps extend the capability of our Avid Interplay | MAM and Avid Interplay | Production asset management solutions by providing real-time access to media assets for the on-the-go media professional. Avid Interplay | MAM allows users to focus on managing content and workflows by giving them the tools to connect their media operations and business intelligence, control movement of media between various storage systems, configure metadata, and leverage a service-oriented architecture structure to integrate in-house and third-party applications. In April 2015, we introduced Interplay | MAM 5, enabling organizations both large and small to manage the entire content lifecycle and reduce media operation costs. This release completes the integration of all Media Suite modules into the MediaCentral Platform. Avid Interplay | Production enhances production team collaboration by coordinating the collaborative editorial workflow of team members at each site, many of whom may be working on the same projects at the same time. Avid Interplay | Production also manages the detailed composition of a project and provides the ability to track media, production file formats, and a project&#8217;s history. In June 2015, we acquired Orad Hi-Tech Systems Ltd. (&#8220;Orad&#8221;) and integrated its 3D real-time graphics, video servers and related asset management solutions. The acquisition adds the applications to our Studio Suite which we intend to connect to the Avid MediaCentral Platform. 

Revenues from media management solutions accounted for 7% , 9% &#32;and 8% &#32;of our net revenues in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. 

Video Storage and Server Solutions 

Our Avid ISIS 5500 and ISIS 7500 shared storage systems are real-time, open solutions that bring the power of shared storage to local, regional, national and multinational broadcasters and post-production facilities at competitive prices. Customers can improve allocation of creative resources and support changing project needs with an open shared storage platform that includes the ISIS file system technology on lower cost hardware, support for third-party applications and streamlined administration to create more content more affordably. In April 2014, we introduced ISIS | 2500 as a near-line storage solution with common off-the-shelf storage with an application layer that provides secure storage and allows customers to extend their library of accessible media assets. In April 2015, we introduced ISIS | 1000 shared storage, bringing small production teams the same collaborative power used on larger-scale productions and news broadcasts-customized for their needs, at a price they can afford. Our on-air server solutions include AirSpeed 5000 and AirSpeed 5500, which enable broadcasters to automate the ingest and playout of television and news programming. The AirSpeed 5000 and 5500 video servers work with a wide range of applications to improve workflow and provide cost-efficient ingest and play to air capabilities for broadcasters of any size. 

Revenues from video storage and server solutions accounted for 22% , 25% &#32;and 24% &#32;of our net revenues in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively.

Digital Audio Software and Workstation Solutions 

Our Pro Tools digital audio software and workstation solutions facilitate the audio production process, including music and sound creation, recording, editing, signal processing, integrated surround mixing and mastering, and reference video playback. The Pro Tools platform supports a wide variety of internally developed and third-party software plug-ins and integrated hardware. Pro Tools solutions are offered at a range of price points and are used by professionals and aspiring professionals in music, film, television, radio, game, Internet and other media production environments.

In January 2016, we introduced Pro Tools version 12.5, offering select customers early access to the highly anticipated Avid Cloud Collaboration for Pro Tools. Avid Cloud Collaboration makes it easy for artists and audio professionals to compose, record, edit, and mix projects from any location worldwide. In support of this release, we also announced that the Artist Community, an online community designed to facilitate collaboration, is now open to everyone. 

Our Pro Tools HD family of digital audio workstations, designed to provide high performance, low latency, and great sound quality, provides music production professionals with two powerful solutions, the Pro Tools | HD Native system and the Pro Tools | HDX system.

Our System 5 digital audio console is a large-format, scalable console with power on demand to mix large feature films or album projects. The addition of our EUCON Hybrid option extends the control capabilities of a System 5 console, enabling the user to bring audio tracks from multiple digital audio workstations onto the console surface for mixing. Our Pro Tools | S6 control surface for sound recording, mixing and editing was designed as a state-of-the-art modular solution that 

scales to meet both current and future customer requirements. S6 is designed for audio professionals in demanding production environments, delivering the performance needed to complete projects faster while producing high quality mixes. Our Artist Series control surfaces offer integrated, hands-on control for price-sensitive applications. Compact and portable, all control surfaces in the Artist line feature EUCON, allowing hands-on control of the user&#8217;s applications. 

Our VENUE product family includes console systems for mixing audio for live sound reinforcement for concerts, theater performances and other public address events. We offer a range of VENUE systems designed for large performance settings, such as stadium concerts, as well as medium-sized theaters and houses of worship. VENUE systems allow the direct integration of Pro Tools solutions to create and playback live recordings. The VENUE | SC48 Remote System features the VENUE | SC48 digital console paired with the VENUE Stage 48 remote box, enabling the user to place input/output devices away from the console and closer to the sources, eliminating cable clutter.

Our Sibelius-branded software allows users to create, edit and publish musical scores. Sibelius software is used by composers, arrangers and other music professionals. Student versions are also available to assist in the teaching of music composition and score writing. In 2015 we introduced Sibelius | Cloud Publishing, which allows users to view, play, transpose, print and purchase scores using current web browsers and mobile devices. The newest version of our musical notation software, Sibelius 8.1, helps composers to create beautiful, accurate and easy-to-read scores.

COMPETITION 

Our customer markets are highly competitive and subject to rapid change and declining average selling prices. The competitive landscape is fragmented with a large number of companies providing various types of products and services in different markets and geographic areas. We provide integrated solutions that compete based on total value workflow, features, quality, service and price. Companies with which we compete in some contexts may also act as our partners in other contexts, such as large enterprise customer environments. 

Certain companies that compete with us across some of our products and solutions are listed below by the market in which they compete: 

&#8226; 

Broadcast and Media: The Associated Press Inc., Belden Inc., Bitcentral Inc., Dalet S.A., EVS Corporation, Harmonic Inc., Imagine Communications Corp, Ross Video Limited and Vizrt Ltd., among others. 

&#8226; 

Audio and Video Post and Professional: Ableton AG, Autodesk Inc., Blackmagic Design Pty Ltd, Harman International Industries Inc., Universal Audio Inc. and Yamaha Corporation, among others. 

In addition, we compete across both previously mentioned markets with companies such as Adobe Systems Incorporated, Apple Inc., Editshare LLC, Snell Advanced Media, Sony Corporation and EMC Corporation. 

Some of our principal competitors are substantially larger than we are and have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we have. For a discussion of these and other risks associated with our competitors, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Item 1A of this Form 10-K. 

OPERATIONS 

Sales and Services Channels 

We market and sell our products and solutions through a combination of direct, indirect and digital sales channels. Our direct sales channel consists of internal sales representatives serving select customers and markets. Our indirect sales channels include global networks of independent distributors, value-added resellers, dealers and retailers. Our digital sales channel is represented by the online Avid Marketplace. 

We have significant international operations with offices in 24 countries and the ability to reach over 130 countries through a combination of our direct sales force and resellers. Sales to customers outside the United States accounted for 63% , 64% &#32;and 61% , respectively, of our net revenues in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 . Additional information about the geographic breakdown of our revenues and long-lived assets can be found in Note Q to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. For additional information about risks associated with our international operations, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Item 1A of this Form 10-K. 

We generally ship our products shortly after the receipt of an order. However, a high percentage of our revenues has historically been generated in the third month of each fiscal quarter and concentrated in the latter part of that month. Orders that may exist at the end of a quarter and have not been shipped are not recognized as revenues and are included in revenue backlog. 

Certain orders included in revenue backlog may be reduced, canceled or deferred by our customers. Our revenue backlog, as we define it, consists of firm orders received and includes both (i) orders where the customer has paid in advance of our performance obligations being fulfilled, and (ii) orders for future product deliveries or services that have not yet been invoiced by us. The expected timing of the recognition of revenue backlog into revenue is based on current estimates and could change based on a number of factors, including (i) the timing of delivery of products and services, (ii) customer cancellations or change orders, (iii) changes in the estimated period of time Implied Maintenance Release PCS is provided to customers or (iv) changes in accounting standards or policies. Implied Maintenance Release PCS, as we define it, is the implicit obligation to make such software updates available to customers over a period of time which represents implied post-contract customer support and is deemed to be a deliverable in each arrangement and accounted for as a separate element. As there is no industry standard definition of revenue backlog, our reported revenue backlog may not be comparable with other companies. Additional information on our revenue backlog can be found in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.&#8221; 

We provide customer care services directly through regional in-house and contracted support centers and major-market field service representatives and indirectly through dealers, value-added resellers and authorized third-party service providers. Depending on the solution, customers may choose from a variety of support offerings, including telephone and online technical 

support, on-site assistance, hardware replacement and extended warranty, and software upgrades. In addition to customer care services, we offer a broad array of professional services, including installation, integration, planning and consulting services, and customer training. 

Manufacturing and Suppliers 

Our internal manufacturing operations consist primarily of the testing of subassemblies and components purchased from third parties, the duplication of software, and the configuration, final assembly and testing of board sets, software, related hardware components and complete systems. In addition to our internal manufacturing operations, we rely on a network of contractors around the globe to manufacture many of our products, components and subassemblies. Our products undergo testing and quality assurance at the final assembly stage. We depend on sole-source suppliers for certain key hardware product components and finished goods, including some critical items. Although we have procedures in place to mitigate the risks associated with our sole-sourced suppliers, we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain sole-sourced components or finished goods from alternative suppliers or that we will be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms without a material impact on our results of operations or financial position. For the risks associated with our use of contractors and sole-source vendors, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Item 1A of this Form 10-K. 

Our company-operated manufacturing facilities, primarily for final assembly and testing of certain products, are located in: Kfar Saba, Israel, Dublin, Ireland and Mountain View, California. Our Dublin facility is ISO 14001, Environmental Management System , certified. 

We and our contract manufacturers manufacture our products at a relatively limited number of different facilities located throughout the world, and, in most cases, the manufacturing of each of our products is concentrated in one or a few locations. An interruption in manufacturing capabilities at any of these facilities, as a result of equipment failure or other reasons, could reduce, delay or prevent the production of our products. Because some of our manufacturing or our contract manufacturer&#8217;s operations are located outside of the United States, including in Ireland, China and Thailand, those manufacturing operations are also subject to additional challenges and risks associated with international operations. For these and other risks associated with our manufacturing operations, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Item 1A of this Form 10-K. 

Research and Development 

We are committed to delivering best-in-class digital media content-creation solutions that are designed for the unique needs, skills and sophistication levels of our target customer markets. Having helped establish the digital media technology industry, we are building on a 25+ year heritage of innovation and leadership in developing content-creation solutions. We have research and development, or R&#38;D, operations around the globe. Our R&#38;D efforts are focused on the development of digital media content-creation, distribution, and monetization tools that operate primarily on the Mac, Windows and Linux platforms. Our R&#38;D efforts also include networking and storage initiatives intended to deliver standards-based media transfer and media asset management tools, as well as stand-alone and network-attached media storage systems for workgroups. In addition to our internal R&#38;D efforts, we outsource a significant portion of certain R&#38;D projects to internationally based partners in Kiev, Ukraine and, to a lesser extent, Thailand. Our R&#38;D expenditures for 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;were $95.9 million , $90.4 million &#32;and $95.2 million , respectively, which represented 19% , 17% &#32;and 17% , respectively, of our net revenues. For the risks associated with our use of partners for R&#38;D projects, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Item 1A of this Form 10-K. 

Our company-operated R&#38;D operations are located in: Burlington, Massachusetts; Mountain View, California; Berkeley, California; Santa Cruz, California; Munich, Germany; Kaiserslautern, Germany; Kfar Saba, Israel; Szczecin, Poland; and Montreal, Canada. We also partner with a vendor in Ukraine for outsourced R&#38;D services and a vendor in Thailand for hardware R&#38;D services. We also have been building our own development team in Taiwan. 

Intellectual Property 

We regard our software and hardware as proprietary and protect our proprietary interests under the laws of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as through contractual provisions. 

We have obtained patents and have registered copyrights, trademarks and service marks in the United States and in many foreign countries. At December 31, 2015 , we held 172 U.S. patents, with expiration dates through 2033, and had 24 patent applications pending with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. We have also registered or applied to register various trademarks and service marks in the United States and a number of foreign countries, including Avid, Avid Everywhere, Media Composer, Pro Tools and 

Sibelius. As a technology company, we regard our patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks and trade secrets as being among our most valuable assets, together with the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of our personnel. 

Our software is licensed to end users pursuant to shrink-wrap, embedded, click-through or signed license agreements. Our products generally contain features to guard against unauthorized use. Policing unauthorized use of computer software is difficult, and software piracy is a persistent problem for us, as it is for the software industry in general. Although we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through patents, trademarks, copyrights, licensing arrangements, maintaining certain technology as trade secrets and other measures, we cannot assure you that any patent, trademark, copyright or other intellectual property rights owned by us will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged, that such intellectual property rights will provide competitive advantages to us, or that any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued with the claims, or the scope of the claims, sought by us, if at all. We cannot assure you that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology, duplicate our technology or design around the patents that we own. In addition, effective patent, copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in countries in which we do business or may do business in the future. For these and other risks associated with the protection of our intellectual property, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
