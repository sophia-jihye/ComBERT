 Item 1. &#160; Description of Business . 

&#160; 

The use of the words &#8220;CVD,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221; refers to CVD Equipment Corporation, a New York corporation incorporated on October 13, 1982, and its subsidiaries, except where the context otherwise requires. 

&#160; 

We design and manufacture state-of-the-art equipment and process solutions used to develop and manufacture materials and coatings for research and industrial applications with the focus on enabling tomorrow&#8217;s technologies TM . These coatings are used in numerous fields including but not limited to aerospace, medical, solar, nano and advanced electronic components. We offer a broad range of chemical vapor deposition, gas control and other equipment that is used by our customers to research, design and manufacture these materials or coatings for turbine blades, implants, semiconductors, solar cells, smart glass, carbon nanotubes, nanowires, LEDs, MEMS and other applications. Through our Application Laboratory, we provide process development support and process startup assistance. Our proprietary technology products are generally customized to meet the particular specifications of individual customers and to accelerate the commercialization of their proprietary intellectual property. We also offer standard products that are based on the expertise and know-how we have developed in designing and manufacturing our customized products. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Based on more than 33 years of experience, we use our engineering, manufacturing and process development to transform new applications into leading-edge manufacturing solutions. This enables university, research and industrial scientists at the cutting edge of technology to develop next generation aerospace, medical, solar, nano, LEDs, semiconductors and other electronic components. We also develop and manufacture research and production equipment based on our proprietary designs. We have built a significant library of design expertise, know-how and innovative solutions to assist our customers in developing these intricate processes and to accelerate their commercialization. This library of solutions, along with our vertically integrated manufacturing facilities, allows us to provide superior design, process and manufacturing solutions to our customers on a cost effective basis. 

&#160; 

Our strategy is to target opportunities in the research and development and production equipment market, with a focus on higher-growth applications such as medical, aerospace, solar, smart glass, carbon nanotubes, nanowires, graphene, MEMS and LEDs. To expand our penetration into these growth markets, we have developed a line of proprietary standard products and custom systems. Historically, we manufactured products on a custom one-at-a-time basis to meet an individual customer&#8217;s specific research requirements. Our new proprietary systems leverage the technological expertise that we have developed through designing these custom systems onto a standardized basic core. This core is easily adapted through a broad array of available add-on options to meet the diverse product and budgetary requirements of the research community. By manufacturing the basic core of these systems in higher volumes, we are able to reduce both the cost and delivery time for our systems. These systems, which we market and sell under the EasyTube&#174; product line, are sold to researchers at universities, research laboratories, and startup companies in the United States and throughout the world. 

&#160; 

Sales of our proprietary standard, custom systems and process solutions have been driven by the success of our installed customer base, which includes several Fortune 500 companies. Historically, revenues have grown through sales to existing customers to meet their additional capacity needs or new requirements, as well as to new customers. However, with our proprietary solutions and expanded focus on &#8220;accelerating the commercialization of tomorrow&#8217;s technologies TM &#8221; we have been developing a new customer base in addition to growing with our existing customers. We have generally gained new customers through word of mouth, limited print advertising and trade show attendance. We are now also gaining new customers by their awareness of our company in the marketplace with results from our Application Laboratory, partnerships with startup companies, increased participation in trade shows and expanded internet advertising. 

&#160; 

The core competencies we have developed in equipment and software design, as well as in systems manufacturing and process solutions, are used to engineer our finished products and to accelerate the commercialization path of our customer base. Our proprietary-real-time, software allows for rapid configuration, and provides our customers with powerful tools to understand, optimize and repeatedly control their processes. Our vertically integrated structure allows us to control the manufacturing process, from bringing raw metal and components into our manufacturing facilities to shipping out finished products. These factors significantly reduce cost, improve quality and reduce the time it takes from customer order to shipment of our products. Our Application Laboratory allows selected customers to bring up their process tools in our Application Laboratory and to work together with our scientists and engineers to optimize process performance. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Operating Divisions 

&#160; 

We conduct our operations through two divisions: (1) CVD/First Nano, and (2) Stainless Design Concepts (&#8220;SDC&#8221;). Each division operates with divisional management supported by product development, sales and administration which are managed at the corporate level. 

&#160; 

CVD/First Nano supplies state-of-the-art chemical vapor deposition systems for use in the research, development and manufacturing of aerospace and medical components, semiconductors, LEDs, carbon nanotubes, nanowires, solar cells and a number of other industrial applications. We utilize our expertise in the design and manufacture of chemical vapor deposition systems to work with laboratory scientists to bring state-of-the-art processes from the research laboratory into production, as well as to provide production equipment and process solutions based on our designs. CVD/First Nano also operates our Application Laboratory where our personnel interact effectively with the scientists and engineers of our customer base. CVD/First Nano operates out of our main facility in Central Islip, New York. 

&#160; 

S tainless D esign C oncepts designs and manufactures ultra-high purity gas and chemical delivery control systems for state-of-the-art semiconductor fabrication processes, solar cells, LEDs, carbon nanotubes, nanowires, and a number of industrial applications. Our SDC products are sold on either a stand-alone basis, or together with our CVD/First Nano systems. SDC operates out of a 22,000 square foot facility fitted with Class 10 and Class 100 clean room manufacturing space located in Saugerties, New York. 

&#160; 

Principal Products 

&#160; 

Chemical Vapor Deposition - A process which passes a gaseous compound over a target material surface that is heated to such a degree that the compound decomposes and deposits a desired layer onto substrate material. The process is accomplished by combining appropriate gases in a reaction chamber, of the kind produced by the Company, at elevated temperatures (typically 150-1,800&#176; Celsius). Our chemical vapor deposition systems are complete and include all necessary instrumentation, subsystems and components and include state-of-the-art process control software. We provide both standard and specifically engineered products for particular customer applications. Some of the standard systems we offer are for Silicon, Silicon-Germanium, Silicon Dioxide, Silicon Nitride, Polysilicon, Liquid Phase Epitaxial, Metalorganic Chemical Vapor Deposition, Carbon Nanotubes, Graphene Nanowires, Solar Cell research and Solar material quality control. 

&#160; 

Our chemical vapor deposition systems are available in a variety of models that can be used in laboratory research and production. All models are offered with total system automation, a microprocessor control system by which the user can measure, predict and regulate gas flow, temperature, pressure and chemical reaction rates, thus controlling the process in order to enhance the quality of the materials produced. Our standard microprocessor control system is extremely versatile and capable of supporting the complete product line and most custom system requirements. These chemical vapor deposition systems are typically priced between $80,000 and $1,500,000, but can go significantly higher. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Rapid Thermal Processing (&#8220;RTP&#8221;) - Used to heat semiconductor materials to elevated temperatures of up to 1,000 &#176; Celsius at rapid rates of up to 200&#176; Celsius per second. Our RTP systems are offered for implant activation, oxidation, silicide formation and many other processes. We offer systems that can operate both at atmospheric or reduced pressures. Our RTP systems are priced up to $600,000. 

&#160; 

Annealing and Diffusion Furnaces - Used for diffusion, oxidation, implant anneal, solder reflow, solar cell manufacturing and other processes. The systems are normally operated at atmospheric and/or reduced pressure with gaseous atmospheres related to the process. An optional feature of the system allows for the heating element to be moved away from the process chamber allowing the wafers to rapidly cool or be heated in a controlled environment. Our cascade temperature control system enables more precise control of the wafers. The systems are equipped with an automatic process controller, permitting automatic process sequencing and monitoring with safety alarm provisions. Our annealing and diffusion furnace systems are priced up to $900,000. 

&#160; 

Ultra-high Purity Gas and Liquid Control Systems - Our standard and custom designed gas and liquid control systems, which encompass gas cylinder storage cabinets, custom gas and chemical delivery systems, gas and liquid valve manifold boxes and gas isolation boxes, provide safe storage and handling of pressurized gases and chemicals. Our system design allows for automatic or manual control from both a local and remote location. A customer order often includes multiple systems and can total up to $1,000,000. 

&#160; 

Quartz - ware - We provide standard and custom fabricated quartz-ware used in our equipment and other customer tools. We also provide repair and replacement of existing quartz-ware. 

&#160; 

Markets and Marketing 

&#160; 

Due to the highly technical nature of our products, we believe it is essential to contact customers directly through our sales personnel and through a network of domestic and international independent sales representatives and distributors specializing in the type of equipment we sell. Our primary marketing activities include direct sales contacts, participation in trade shows and our internet websites. We are also focusing our efforts on being in the top listings on many search engines in order to increase the number of &#8220;hits&#8221; to our websites. 

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160; 

We are continuing to work on expanding our product offerings. Many of these products are used in research and in production applications. We sell our products primarily to electronic component manufacturers, institutions involved in electronic component research (such as universities, government and industrial laboratories) and to industries such as aerospace that require specialized coatings. We have both a domestic and international customer base with hundreds of installed systems. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Given the size of some of the systems we sell, revenue from a single customer in any one year can exceed 10.0% of our total sales. In fiscal year 2015 and 2014 one customer represented 49.6% and 50.2% of our annual revenues respectively. Another customer represented 13.7% of our annual revenues for 2015. The loss of current key customers if not replaced by others, may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. 

&#160;

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, approximately 9.0% of our revenues were generated by sales to customers outside the U.S., compared to 20.2% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. 

&#160; 

Warranties 

&#160; 

Warranties on our equipment can range up to twenty-four months from shipment and we pass along any warranties from original manufacturers of components used in our products. We provide service and support for our installed base of equipment with in-house field service personnel. Warranty costs, including those incurred in fiscal years 2015 and 2014, have been historically insignificant and expensed as incurred. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We are subject to intense competition. We are aware of other competitors that offer a substantial number of products and services comparable to ours. Many of our competitors (including customers who may elect to manufacture systems for internal use) have financial, marketing and other resources greater than ours. To date, we believe that each of our two operating divisions has been able to compete favorably in markets that include these competitors, primarily on the basis of know-how, technical performance, quality, delivery and price and aftermarket support. 

&#160; 

CVD/First Nano competes primarily with in-house design and engineering personnel at research and university laboratories with the capacity to design and build their own equipment internally. Due to budgetary and funding constraints, many of these customers are extremely price sensitive. We believe that our systems are among the most advanced available for the targeted market space. 

&#160; 

SDC &#8217;s gas management and chemical delivery control systems are among the most advanced available. We further believe that SDC is differentiated from our competitors through our intimate understanding of how the systems in which our products are incorporated are actually used in field applications. We have gained this understanding as a result of having designed and built complex process gas systems for CVD/First Nano as well as for a number of the world&#8217;s leading semiconductor, solar manufacturers, research laboratories and universities. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Sources of Supply 

&#160; 

Many of the components used in producing our products are purchased from unrelated suppliers. We have OEM status with our suppliers but we are not obligated to purchase a pre-determined quantity. We are not dependent on a principal or major supplier and alternate suppliers are available. Subject to lead times, the components and raw materials we use in manufacturing our products are readily obtainable. 

&#160; 

We have a fully-equipped machine shop that we use to fabricate most of our metal components in-house, including the most complex designed parts of our equipment. Our investment in CNC machines for our machine shop has increased our efficiencies while significantly reducing costs in production. Similarly, our quartz fabrication capability is sufficient to meet our quartz-ware needs. 

&#160; 

Materials procured from the outside and/or manufactured internally undergo a rigorous quality control process to ensure that the parts meet or exceed our requirements and those of our customers. Upon final assembly, all equipment undergoes a final series of complete testing to ensure maximum product performance. 

&#160; 

Backlog 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, our order backlog was approximately $6.1 million compared to approximately $21.1 million at December 31, 2014, a decrease of $15.0 million, or 71.1%. The decrease in backlog is related to a decrease in orders, as we focused our energy on execution of the single largest contract that our company has received in our history. Now that the installation is nearing completion, we are focused on new opportunities with new and existing customers. The timing for completion of the backlog varies depending on the product mix and can be as long as two years. Included in the backlog are all accepted purchase orders with the exception of those that are included in our percentage-of-completion. Order backlog is usually a reasonable management tool to indicate expected revenues and projected profits, however, it does not provide an assurance of future achievement or profits as order cancellations or delays are possible. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

Our success is dependent, in part on our proprietary technology and other proprietary rights. We have historically protected our proprietary information and intellectual property such as design specifications, blueprints, technical processes and employee know-how through the use of non-disclosure agreements. In addition, where we deem appropriate, we file for patent and trademark protection of our proprietary technology and intellectual property that has the potential to be incorporated into our products and can be sold to multiple customers. We also maintain and/or assert rights in certain trademarks relating to certain of our products and product lines, and claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation. 

&#160; 

While patent, copyright and trademark protections for our intellectual property are important to different degrees for our various products and solutions, we believe our future success in highly dynamic markets is most dependent upon the technical competence and creative skills of our personnel and our ability to accelerate the commercialization of next generation intellectual properties. We attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through non-disclosure agreements with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants and other security measures. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

The university research community is at the forefront of nanotechnology research, and we are focused on providing state-of-the-art systems to this market that will help bridge the gap between pioneering research and marketable products. Our Application Laboratory, together with a number of leading universities and startup companies, with whom we partner from time to time, conducts cutting-edge research on the growth of carbon nanotubes, graphene and nanowires as well as on selected solar cell manufacturing processes and smart glass coating processes. The results of this research could have far reaching implications concerning the use and manufacture of carbon nanotubes, graphene and nanowires, solar cell and glass coatings for many markets. Our intention is that together, with these leading universities and start-up companies, we will leverage our collective expertise in this field, which will allow us to capitalize on commercial opportunities in the future. This relationship has thus far produced leading edge results, including what we believe are the tallest carbon nanotube arrays yet developed. 

&#160; 

In 2012 we expanded our laboratory staff and began independently conducting cutting-edge research and product development for CVD Graphene. In 2015, we incurred approximately $1.8 million in research and development expenses of which $605,000 was independent of external customer orders compared to 2014, when we incurred $1.6 million of research and development expenses, $878,000 of which was independent of external customer orders. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local government regulations, such as environmental, labor and export control. We believe that we have obtained all necessary permits to operate our business and that we are in material compliance with all laws and regulations applicable to us. 

&#160; 

We are not aware of any government regulations or requirements necessary for the sale of our products, other than certain approvals or permits which may be required for us to export certain of our products to certain foreign countries. 

&#160; 

Insurance 

&#160; 

Our products are used in our customers&#8217; manufacturing processes which in some cases contain explosive, flammable, corrosive and toxic gases. There are potential exposures to personal injury as well as property damage, particularly if operated without regard to the design limits of the systems and components. Additionally, the end products of some of our customers are used in areas such as aerospace and high tech devices where safety is of great concern. Management reviews its insurance coverage with our insurance agent on an annual basis. We believe we have the types and amounts of insurance coverage that are sufficient for our business. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, we had 192 employees, with all but one being full time personnel. We had 104 people in manufacturing, 38 in engineering (including research and development and efforts related to product improvement) 9 in field service, 9 in sales and marketing and 32 in general management, maintenance and administration.
