 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

We are a fully-integrated healthcare real estate company organized as a corporation in the State of Maryland on March 28, 2014. We own and acquire, or finance, real estate properties that are leased to hospitals, doctors, healthcare systems or other healthcare service providers in Non-Urban markets, which we define as, collectively, suburban areas, exurban areas (areas adjoining metropolitan statistical areas) and micropolitan areas (areas with populations of 10,000 to 50,000 that do not directly border larger urban areas). We conduct our business through a traditional umbrella partnership real estate investment trust, or UPREIT structure in which our properties are owned by our operating partnership, directly or through subsidiaries. We are the sole general partner of our operating partnership, owning 100% &#32;of the operating partnership ("OP") units. 

We completed our initial public offering ("IPO") on May 27, 2015, issuing an aggregate of 7,187,500 shares of common stock and receiving approximately $125.2 million of net proceeds, including shares issued upon exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option. Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, we completed a concurrent private placement of an aggregate of 123,683 shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $2.3 million to certain directors and officers of the Company. Following the completion of our IPO, we began acquiring and investing in real estate properties and, as of December 31, 2015, we had invested $ 143.9 million &#32;in 40 &#32;real estate properties and one &#32;mortgage note located in 18 &#32;states with approximately 789,500 &#32;square feet. The real estate properties were approximately 94.3% &#32;leased at December 31, 2015 with a weighted average remaining lease term of approximately 5.6 years. 

We operate so as to qualify as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, for federal income tax purposes. As a REIT, we are not subject to corporate federal income tax with respect to taxable income distributed to our stockholders. We have also elected one subsidiary to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary ("TRS"), which is subject to federal and state income taxes. 

Competitive Strengths 

We believe our management team's significant healthcare, real estate and public REIT management experience distinguishes us from other REITs and real estate operators, both public and private. Specifically, our Company's competitive strengths include, among others: 

&#8226; 

Strong, Diversified Portfolio. Our focus is on investing in properties where we can develop strategic alliances with financially sound healthcare providers that offer need-based healthcare services in our target markets. Our tenant base includes many nationally recognized healthcare providers (or their affiliates), such as HCA, Fresenius and AmSurg. Our property portfolio has significant diversification with respect to healthcare provider, industry segment, facility type and geography. 

&#8226; 

Attractive and Disciplined Investment Focus. We focus on Non-Urban healthcare facilities in off-market or lightly marketed transactions at purchase prices of approximately $10 million or less. We believe there is significantly less competition from existing REITs and institutional buyers for these Non-Urban assets than for comparable urban assets, thereby increasing the potential for more attractive risk-adjusted returns. In addition, we believe that healthcare-related real estate rents and valuations are less susceptible to changes in the general economy than many other types of commercial real estate due to favorable demographic trends and the need-based rise in healthcare expenditures, even during economic downturns. 

&#8226; 

Extensive Relationships with Healthcare Providers, Intermediaries and Property Owners. We believe that our management team has a strong reputation among, and a deep understanding of the real estate needs of, healthcare providers in our target markets. For example, AmSurg, a nationally recognized leader in the development, management and operation of outpatient surgery centers, has designated us as one of its two 

strategic partners to acquire real estate owned by physicians that are partners in surgery centers AmSurg operates. We believe that this strategic relationship is an example of our ability to meet the needs of healthcare providers by structuring transactions that are mutually advantageous to sellers, our tenants and us. We believe this ability has, and will continue to, lead to strategic acquisition opportunities, which will, in turn, produce attractive risk-adjusted returns. None of our properties to date were acquired pursuant to "calls for offers" or other auction style bidding situations. We believe our relationships provide us with additional off-market or lightly marketed acquisition opportunities, thus providing us the opportunity to continue to purchase assets outside a competitive bidding process. 

&#8226; 

Experienced Management Team. Each of the members of our management team has between 23 and 34 years of healthcare, real estate and/or public REIT management experience. Led by Timothy G. Wallace, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, W. Page Barnes, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Leigh Ann Stach, our Vice President-Financial Reporting and Chief Accounting Officer, our management team has significant experience in acquiring, owning, operating and managing healthcare facilities and providing full service real estate solutions for the healthcare industry. Prior to founding our company, Mr. Wallace was a co-founder and Executive Vice President of Healthcare Realty Trust (NYSE: HR). Between the initial public offering of HR in 1993 and his departure from HR in 2002, Mr. Wallace was integral in helping to grow HR to over $2 billion in assets. Mr. Barnes has held executive positions with acute care and behavioral hospital companies and directed healthcare lending for AmSouth Bank. Ms. Stach has experience in public healthcare REIT accounting and financial reporting. 

&#8226; 

Growth Oriented Capital Structure. &#32;At December 31, 2015, we have $17.0 million &#32;outstanding on our syndicated senior revolving credit facility, or our credit facility, with a 12.2% &#32;debt-to-book capitalization ratio. In the future, in addition to equity and debt issuances, we may also use OP units of our operating partnership as currency to acquire additional properties from owners seeking to defer their potential taxable gain and diversify their holdings. We believe that the borrowing capacity under our credit facility, combined with our ability to use OP units as acquisition currency, provides us with significant financial flexibility to make opportunistic investments and fund future growth. 

&#8226; 

Significant Alignment of Interests. We have structured the compensation of our management team to closely align their interests with the interests of our stockholders. During the initial terms of their respective employment agreements, all of our officers elected to take 100% of their salary, bonus and long-term incentive compensation in the form of restricted stock that is subject to an eight-year cliff-vesting period. We believe that paying our management team with restricted stock that is subject to an eight-year cliff-vesting period effectively aligns the interests of our management team with those of our stockholders, creating significant incentives to maximize returns for our stockholders. In addition, concurrently with the completion of our IPO in May 2015, Mr. Wallace purchased $2,000,000 in shares of our common stock and certain of our officers and directors purchased an aggregate of $350,000 in shares of our common stock in concurrent private placements, in each case at a price per share equal to the price of the shares sold in the IPO, which we believe further aligns management's interests with our stockholders. Finally, we have adopted stock ownership guidelines that will require our officers and directors to continuously own an amount of our common stock based on a multiple of such officer's annual base salary or such director's annual retainer, as applicable. 

Business Objective 

Our principal business objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to our stockholders through a combination of (i) sustainable and increasing rental income and cash flow that generates reliable, increasing dividends and (ii) potential long-term appreciation in the value of our properties and common stock. Our primary strategies to achieve our business objective are to invest in, own and proactively manage a diversified portfolio of healthcare properties, which we believe will drive reliable, increasing rental revenue and cash flow. 

Growth Strategy 

We intend to continue to grow our portfolio of healthcare properties primarily through acquisitions of Non-Urban healthcare facilities that provide stable revenue growth and predictable long-term cash flows. We generally focus on individual acquisition opportunities of $10 million or less in off-market or lightly marketed transactions and do not intend to participate in competitive bidding or auctions of properties. We believe that there are abundant opportunities to acquire attractive healthcare properties in our target markets either from third-party owners of existing healthcare facilities or directly with healthcare providers through sale-leaseback transactions. We believe there is significantly less competition for these Non-Urban assets from existing REITs and institutional buyers than for comparable assets in urban areas, thereby increasing the potential for attractive risk-adjusted returns. Furthermore, we may acquire healthcare properties on a non-cash basis in a tax efficient manner through the issuance of OP units as consideration for the transaction. 

We intend for our investment portfolio to be diversified among healthcare facility type and segments such as ambulatory surgery centers, behavioral facilities, dialysis clinics, medical office buildings, oncology centers, physician clinics, acute care hospitals, assisted living facilities, post-acute care hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, and specialty hospitals, as well as being diverse both geographically and with respect to our tenant base. We seek to invest in properties where we can develop strategic alliances with financially sound healthcare providers that offer need-based healthcare services in our target markets. 

In connection with our review and consideration of healthcare real estate acquisition opportunities, we generally take into account a variety of considerations, including but not limited to: 

&#8226; 

whether the property will be leased to a financially-sound healthcare tenant; 

&#8226; 

the historical performance of the market and its future prospects; 

&#8226; 

property location, with an emphasis on proximity to a population base; 

&#8226; 

demand for healthcare related services and facilities; 

&#8226; 

current and future supply of competing properties; 

&#8226; 

occupancy and rental rates in the market; 

&#8226; 

population density and growth potential; 

&#8226; 

anticipated capital expenditures; 

&#8226; 

anticipated future acquisition opportunities; and 

&#8226; 

existing and potential competition from other healthcare real estate owners and tenants. 

We currently have no intention to invest in companies that provide healthcare services structured to comply with the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007, or RIDEA. 

&#160; 

Portfolio Summary 

See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item. 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for a table that summarizes our portfolio as of December 31, 2015. 

Customer Concentrations 

Our real estate portfolio is leased to a diverse tenant base. For the year ended December 31, 2015, none of our tenants individually accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenues. We have no control over the success or failure of our tenants' businesses and, at any time, any of our tenants may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its financial condition. 

Geographic Concentrations 

Approximately 42.1% of our annualized revenues as of December 31, 2015 was derived from properties located in Kansas (16.9%), Texas (13.9%) and Florida (11.3%). Such geographic concentrations could expose the Company to certain downturns in the economics of those states or other changes in the such states' respective real estate market conditions. Any material change in the current payment programs or regulatory, economic, environmental or competitive conditions in any of these areas could have an effect on our overall business results. In the event of negative economic or other changes in any of these markets, our business, financial condition and results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and the trading price of our common shares may be adversely affected. See each of the discussions under Item 1A, "Risk Factors," under the captions "Adverse economic or other conditions in the geographic markets in which we conduct business could negatively affect our occupancy levels and rental rates and have a material adverse effect on our operating results," and "A large percentage of our properties are located in Kansas, Texas and Florida, and changes in these markets may materially adversely affect us." 

Recent Developments 

In January 2016, the Company acquired two &#32;real estate properties totaling approximately 59,500 &#32;square feet for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $9.5 million , including cash consideration of approximately $9.5 million . Upon acquisition, the properties were 89.4% &#32;leased with lease expiration dates through 2025 . 

In January 2016, the Company funded a $12.5 million &#32;mortgage note secured by a 85,000 &#32;square foot behavioral facility in Illinois which matures on January 31, 2027 . The Company received a loan fee from the transaction totaling $93,750 &#32;which has been deferred and will be recognized into income on a straight-line basis. The mortgage note requires monthly interest only payments to us of 11.0% per annum through January 2017 and has a stated fixed interest rate of 9.5% &#32;per annum thereafter in which monthly principal and interest payments will be due through maturity. The Company has an option to purchase the property through January 13, 2017 for a fixed amount. 

The Company borrowed $21.0 million under our credit facility to fund these acquisitions and mortgage note funding, resulting in $38.0 million outstanding under the Credit Facility at January 31, 2016. 

Tax Status 

&#160; 

We expect to qualify to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our qualification as a REIT will depend upon our ability to meet, on a continuing basis, through actual investment and operating results, various complex requirements under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, relating to, among other things, the sources of our gross income, the composition and values of our assets, our distribution levels and the diversity of ownership of our capital stock. We believe that we are organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification as a REIT under the Code and that our manner of operations will enable us to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income that we distribute currently to our stockholders. Under the Code, REITs are subject to numerous organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that they distribute on an annual basis at least 90% of their REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gains. If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any taxable year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, our income for that year will 

be subject to tax at regular corporate rates, and we would be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which we ceased to qualify as a REIT. Even if we qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may still be subject to state and local taxes on our income and assets and to U.S. federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income. Additionally, any income earned by Community Healthcare Trust Services, Inc., our taxable REIT subsidiary, and any other &#8220;taxable REIT subsidiaries&#8221;, or TRS, that we form or acquire in the future will be fully subject to U.S. federal, state and local corporate income tax. 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

Our healthcare tenants and their operators are subject to extensive federal, state and local government legislation and regulation. Compliance with these regulatory requirements can increase operating costs and, thereby, adversely affect the financial viability of our tenants&#8217; businesses. Our tenants' failure to comply with these laws and regulations could adversely affect their ability to successfully operate our properties, which could negatively impact their ability to satisfy their contractual obligations to us. As a landlord, we intend for all of our business activities and operations to conform in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations, including healthcare laws and regulations. Our leases require the tenants and operators to comply with all applicable laws, including healthcare laws. 

These laws subject tenant healthcare facilities and practices to requirements related to reimbursement, licensing and certification policies, ownership of facilities, addition or expansion of facilities and services, pricing and billing for services, compliance obligations (including those governing the security, use and disclosure of confidential patient information) and fraud and abuse laws. These laws and regulations are wide-ranging and complex, may vary or overlap from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and are subject frequently to change. Healthcare facilities may also be affected by changes in accreditation standards or in the procedures of accrediting agencies that are recognized by governments in the certification process. In addition, expansion (including the addition of new beds or services or the acquisition of medical equipment) and occasionally the discontinuation of services of healthcare facilities are generally subject to state regulatory approval through certificate of need programs. Different tenants may be more or less subject to certain types of regulation, some of which are specific to the type of facility or provider. 

Changes in laws and regulations, reimbursement enforcement activity and regulatory non-compliance by our tenants and operators can all have a significant effect on their operations and financial condition, which in turn may adversely impact us, as detailed below and set forth under Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors,&#8221; under the caption &#8220;The healthcare industry is heavily regulated and new laws or regulations, changes to existing laws or regulations, changes to reimbursement models or structure, loss of licensure or failure to obtain licensure could adversely impact our company and result in the inability of our tenants to make rent payments to us.&#8221; We highlight below several of the more complex laws, however this is an overview, as the complexities of the laws impacting tenants are varied and extensive. 

Physician Ownership Regulations 

Physician ownership of healthcare facilities is generally prohibited by law subject to certain exceptions. The Affordable Care Act placed strict limitations on the availability of certain exceptions to the physician ownership regulations, including previously utilized "rural provider" and "whole hospital" exceptions. These regulations are extensive and complex. Further, various rent arrangements may be subject to federal and state laws and regulations governing illegal rebates and kickbacks where co-investors are physicians or others in a position to refer patients to the facilities. The effect of these laws and regulations is generally to prohibit, through the imposition of criminal and civil penalties (including exclusion from programs such as Medicare and Medicaid), payment arrangements that are construed to include compensation for patient referrals. Additional legislative and regulatory proposals may be enacted or adopted in the future that adversely affect physicians and other healthcare providers that invest in healthcare facilities, regardless of whether there is compensation for referrals, by limiting reimbursement by the Medicare and Medicaid programs of otherwise covered services, requiring disclosures of such interests, or imposing civil monetary and criminal penalties and fines for violations of proscriptions against patient referrals to such facilities. 

Fraud and Abuse Laws 

There are various federal and state laws regarding fraud and abuse by healthcare providers who receive payments from or are in a position to make referrals in connection with the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Our lease arrangements with certain tenants may also be subject to these fraud and abuse laws. We expect that the healthcare industry will continue to face increased regulations and pressure in the areas of fraud, waste and abuse, cost control, healthcare management and provision of services. These laws include, without limitation: 

&#8226; 

the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, the offer, payment, solicitation or acceptance of remuneration, directly or indirectly, in return for referring an individual to a provider of services for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal healthcare program, including the Medicare or Medicaid programs. Courts have interpreted this statute broadly and held that the Anti-kickback Statute is violated if just one purpose of the remuneration is to generate referrals, even if there are other lawful purposes. The Affordable Care Act provides that knowledge of the Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate the statute is not required in order to violate the Anti-Kickback Statute. Violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute is a crime, punishable by criminal fines and penalties, including imprisonment. Violations may also result in civil and administrative sanctions, including civil fines, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, and monetary penalties in amounts treble to the underlying remuneration. Although it is our intention to fully comply with the Anti-Kickback Statue, as well as all other applicable state and federal laws, there can be no assurance regulatory authorities enforcing these laws will determine our financial arrangements or the financial relationships of our tenants comply with the Anti-Kickback Statute or other similar laws. Any violation of the Anti-Kickback Statue by our tenants could result in substantial fines and penalties that may affect their ability to meet the terms of their leases with us and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our business; 

&#8226; 

the federal Physician Self-Referral Prohibition, or Stark Law, prohibits a physician from making a referral to an entity furnishing "designated health services" paid by Medicare or Medicaid if the physician or a member of the physician's immediate family has a financial relationship with that entity. The Stark Law also prohibits entities that provide designated health services from billing the Medicare and Medicaid programs for any items or services that result from a prohibited referral and requires the entities to refund amounts received for items or services provided pursuant to the prohibited referral. Sanctions for violating the Stark Law include denial of payment, civil fines, and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Failure to refund amounts received pursuant to a prohibited referral may also constitute a false claim and result in additional penalties under the False Claims Act. There are exceptions to the self-referral prohibition for many of the customary financial arrangements between physicians and providers. Although our lease agreements require lessees to comply with the Stark Law, we cannot offer assurance that the arrangements entered into by us or by our tenants will be found to be in compliance with the Stark Law or similar state laws. Any violation of the Stark Law or similar state laws by our tenants could result in substantial fines and penalties that may affect their ability to meet the terms of their leases with us and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our business; 

&#8226; 

the federal False Claims Act prohibits knowingly making or presenting any false claim for payment to the federal government. The government may use the False Claims Act to prosecute Medicare and other government program fraud. The False Claims Act defines the term "knowingly" broadly and includes submitting a claim with reckless disregard to its truth or falsity. The False Claims Act contains qui tam , or whistleblower, provisions that allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government. These whistleblowers may collect a portion of the government's recovery. In some cases, whistleblowers and the federal government have taken the position, and some courts have held, that providers who allegedly have violated other statutes, such as the Anti-Kickback Statute and the Stark Law, have thereby submitted false claims under the False Claims Act. The Affordable Care Act clarifies this issue with respect to the Anti-Kickback Statute by providing that submission of claims for services or items 

generated in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute is a per se violation of the False Claims Act. If a defendant is found liable under the False Claims Act, the defendant may be required to pay three times the actual damages sustained by the government, additional civil penalties, and the whistleblower's attorneys' fees. Many states have enacted similar statutes preventing the presentation of a false claim to a state government. We expect more to do so because the Social Security Act provides a financial incentive for states to enact statutes establishing state level liability. Any violation of the False Claims Act by our tenants could result in substantial fines and penalties that may affect their ability to meet the terms of their leases with us and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our business; 

&#8226; 

the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law authorizes the imposition of monetary penalties against an entity that engages in a number of prohibited activities. The penalties vary by the prohibited conduct, but include civil fines and treble damages for the total amount of remuneration claimed. Any violations of the Civil Monetary Penalties Law by our tenants could result in substantial fines and penalties that may affect their ability to meet the terms of their leases with us and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our business; and 

&#8226; 

state anti-kickback, anti-inducement, anti-referral and insurance fraud laws which may be generally similar to, and potentially more expansive than, the federal laws set forth above. The scope of these state laws is broad because they can often apply regardless of the source of payment for care. Little precedent exists for their interpretation or enforcement. These statutes typically provide for criminal and civil penalties, as well as loss of facility licensure. Any violation of such laws by our tenants could result in substantial fines and penalties that may affect their ability to meet the terms of their leases with us and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our business. 

Significant media and public attention has focused in recent years on the healthcare industry. The federal government is dedicated to funding additional federal enforcement activities related to healthcare providers and preventing fraud and abuse. Our tenants will engage in many of routine healthcare operations and other activities that could be the subject of governmental investigations or inquiries. For example, our tenants may have significant Medicare and Medicaid billings, numerous financial arrangements with physicians who are referral sources, and joint venture arrangements involving physician investors. In recent years, Congress has increased the level of funding for fraud and abuse enforcement activities. It is possible that governmental entities could initiate investigations or litigation in the future and that such matters could result in significant costs and penalties, as well as adverse publicity. Governmental agencies and their agents, such as the Medicare Administrative Contractors, fiscal intermediaries and carriers, as well as the Office of Inspector General of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and state Medicaid programs, may conduct audits of our tenants' operations. Private payers may conduct similar post-payment audits, and our tenants may also perform internal audits and monitoring. Depending on the nature of the conduct found in such audits and whether the underlying conduct could be considered systemic, the resolution of these audits could have a material, adverse effect on our portfolio's financial position, results of operations and liquidity. 

Affordable Care Act 

The Affordable Care Act has continued to change how healthcare services are covered, delivered and reimbursed. The Affordable Care Act includes payment reform provisions intended to drive Medicare towards more value-based purchasing which, in turn, increases accountability for healthcare providers for the quality and costs of the healthcare services they provide. While more individuals now carry healthcare coverage as a result of the Affordable Care Act, the full effects of the changes to reimbursement models for both public and commercial coverage continue to evolve. Each kind of healthcare provider tenant has a different and complex set of laws related to reimbursement and reimbursement models, which may affect the tenant's ability to collect revenues and meet the terms of their leases. Such varying reimbursement models and laws impact each kind of provider as well as the healthcare system as a whole. For example, for physicians, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services sets an annual Medicare Sustainable Growth Rate and updates a related physician fee schedule to control spending by Medicare on physician services The implementation of this physician fee schedule can be suspended or adjusted by Congress, as has been done regularly in the past. In addition, for ambulatory service centers, the Affordable Care Act introduced provisions 

that reduce the annual inflation update for payment rates by a "productivity adjustment," which may result in a decrease in Medicare payment rates for the same procedures in a given year compared to the prior year. Other changes brought about by the Affordable Care Act could negatively impact reimbursement for any one of the kind of provider tenants as outlined below. 

The Affordable Care Act also has begun to alter reimbursement from private insurers and managed care organizations. Networks continue to readjust and all providers must ensure adequate market share in their respective areas to remain in the network created by many of the managed care organizations. Under the Affordable Care Act, individuals are required to obtain coverage or pay a penalty resulting in millions of more Americans obtaining coverage, usually through the healthcare exchanges (called the Marketplace) established to provide coverage in each state. It is unclear at this time how the Marketplace coverage will impact each state and locale. 

Licensure and Certificates of Need 

Healthcare providers are subject to other state and federal reporting obligations that are tied to licensure, certification and accreditation requirements. Many of our tenants may require a license or a certificate of need to operate. Failure to obtain or the loss of such license or certificate would be a material event, likely resulting in the inability of the tenant to operate in the leased space, thereby materially impacting the tenant's ability to make rent payments. State and local laws further regulate aspects of the tenants operations and ability to expand. States and local laws vary from state to state and are subject to change. It is impossible to predict the impact of a tenant's ability to continue to provide services and the costs associated with operating in compliance with licensure, accreditation and certificate of need requirements. 

Additional Regulations 

In addition to the federal, state and local laws discussed above, our healthcare tenants and their operators are subject to additional extensive and complex legislative and regulatory obligations. Compliance with these regulatory requirements can increase operating costs and, thereby, adversely affect the financial viability of our tenants' businesses. Furthermore, in connection with the expansion of existing operations and the entry into new markets, healthcare providers may become subject to compliance with additional regulation. Our tenants' failure to comply with these laws and regulations could adversely affect their ability to successfully operate our properties, which could negatively impact their ability to satisfy their contractual obligations to us. Some of these additional laws and regulations include, but are not limited to: 

&#8226; 

requirements to maintain complex written compliance and training programs. Failure to comply with such laws may result in government investigations, whistleblower litigation, additional inspections, review of licensure and other actions which can be costly, thereby impacting on the fiscal strength of the tenant; 

&#8226; 

federal and state legislation and regulations regarding the privacy and security of patient information. In addition to HIPAA privacy, security and breach notification requirements, providers are responsible for compliance with state laws regarding confidentiality and data breach notification; 

&#8226; 

specific licensure and certification requirements for each type of entity, which may also vary by jurisdiction. These requirements may be subject to periodic revision; and 

&#8226; 

a variety of other reporting obligations, many of which include financial penalties for failure to report. For example, most providers are also obligated to report measures as a part of their "Meaningful Use" reporting and certain physicians are required to report as a part of the Physician Quality Reporting System. Failure by eligible providers and eligible hospitals to meet these measures can result in significant reductions of payments from government programs. 

Finally, our tenants are also subject to regulations and laws that are specific to each particular type of healthcare entity. The following entities on which we focus are subject to the additional regulations and laws, some of which are articulated below: 

&#8226; 

Ambulatory surgery centers: &#32;&#32;Ambulatory surgery centers must be certified and approved in order to enter into written agreements with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. An ambulatory surgery center and another entity, such as an adjacent physician's office, are not permitted to mix functions and operations in a common space during concurrent or overlapping hours of operations. Ambulatory surgery centers must be accredited and undergo periodic inspections regarding standards of medical care, equipment and hygiene. In addition, many states require regulatory approval, including certificates of need prior to establishment of an ambulatory surgery center, offering certain services or making expenditures in excess of statutory thresholds for healthcare equipment, facilities or programs. Medicare reimburses ambulatory surgery centers in accordance with a payment system implemented by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services which utilizes the Outpatient Prospective Payment System, or OPPS. Medicare pays ambulatory surgery centers a single payment for covered surgical procedures. The OPPS is set by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services on an annual basis which results in changes to the reimbursement each year for ambulatory surgery centers. Ambulatory surgery centers must also comply with very detailed quality reporting obligations. 

&#8226; 

Behavioral facilities: &#32;&#32;In addition to the federal and state laws regarding the confidentiality and security of patient information, behavioral facilities are required to comply with federal and state laws regarding mental health and substance abuse, including, but not limited to the federal substance abuse confidentiality regulations found at 42 CFR Part 2. The kind of regulatory obligations are generally determined by whether the behavioral facility provides inpatient services, outpatient services or both. Many states require regulatory approval, including certificates of need, before providers can establish certain types of healthcare facilities, offer certain services or make expenditures in excess of statutory thresholds for healthcare equipment, facilities or programs. Behavioral facilities, licensed and reviewed periodically by state healthcare agencies and are subject to extensive federal, state, and local regulatory and inspection requirements. Behavioral facilities must also comply with very detailed quality reporting obligations. 

&#8226; 

Dialysis clinics: &#32;&#32;Dialysis clinics are subject to complex federal and state requirements related to the provision of treatment for end stage renal disease. Dialysis clinics must submit an application to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services to furnish services to Medicare beneficiaries and must be certified by states. Additional statutory and regulatory requirements include furnishing data and information for end stage renal disease program administration and participation in network activities. Dialysis clinics are subject to periodic inspections. Dialysis clinics and their operations are also subject to complex Medicare and Medicaid payment rules and regulations in which dialysis services are generally reimbursed on a bundled payment system basis with certain case-mix adjustments. Dialysis clinics must also comply with very detailed quality reporting obligations. 

&#8226; 

Medical office buildings: &#32;&#32;Medical office buildings are generally not subject to separate licensure requirements, although certain services may be subject to licensure, certificate of need and other regulatory requirements. The success of a medical office building is dependent on a number of factors. Various licenses and permits are required of tenants for narcotics, laboratories, pharmacies, radioactive materials and certain equipment. Tenants are also subject to extensive federal, state and local legislative and regulatory requirements which are dependent upon the kind of providers within the building. In addition, medical and surgical services and practices may be extensively supervised by committees of doctors and may be reviewed by state and local governing boards and quality assurance personnel. 

&#8226; 

Oncology centers: &#32;&#32;Oncology centers and their operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local legislation and regulations and inspection requirements. The service offerings by the oncology center (medical services, surgical services or radiation oncology) will dictate the legal requirements the 

tenant will need to comply with to meet its obligations. Oncology centers must also comply with very detailed quality reporting obligations. 

&#8226; 

Physician clinics: &#32;&#32;Every state imposes licensing requirements on individual physicians and on facilities and services operated by physicians. Many states require regulatory approval, including certificates of need, before establishing certain types of physician-directed clinics, offering certain services or making expenditures in excess of statutory thresholds for health care equipment, facilities or programs. In connection with the expansion of existing operations and the entry into new markets, physician clinics and affiliated practice groups may become subject to compliance with additional regulation. 

&#8226; 

Acute care hospitals: &#32;&#32;Acute care hospitals are licensed and subject to periodic inspections regarding standards of medical care, equipment and hygiene as a condition of licensure. Many states require regulatory approval, including certificates of need, before providers can establish certain types of healthcare facilities, offer certain services or make expenditures in excess of statutory thresholds for healthcare equipment, facilities or programs. Acute care hospitals must also comply with complex state and federal regulations, including the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, or EMTALA, which requires hospitals to stabilize all patients prior to any transfer. Failure to comply with EMTALA or any of the other regulatory obligations may result in investigations and regulatory action. Acute care hospitals are also subject to very detailed quality reporting requirements. 

&#8226; 

Long-term care facilities (including assisted living and skilled nursing facilities): &#32;&#32;Long-term care facilities, including assisted living facilities and skilled nursing facilities, are licensed and reviewed periodically by state healthcare agencies and are subject to extensive federal, state, and local regulatory and inspection requirements. These requirements relate to, among other things, the quality of the nursing care, the qualifications of administration personnel and nursing staff, the condition of the long-term care facility and the adequacy of its equipment, and continuing compliance with laws and regulations relating to the operation of the facilities. Long-term care facilities are also subject to very detailed quality reporting requirements. 

&#8226; 

Specialty hospitals and/or post-acute care hospitals: &#32;&#32;Like acute care hospitals and long term care facilities, specialty hospitals are subject to periodic inspections regarding standards of medical care, equipment and hygiene as a condition of licensure. Many states require regulatory approval, including certificates of need, before providers can establish certain types of healthcare facilities, offer certain services or make expenditures in excess of statutory thresholds for healthcare equipment, facilities or programs. Specialty and post-acute care hospitals are also subject to very detailed quality reporting requirements. 

Environmental Matters 

&#160; 

As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances and also could be liable to third parties as a result of environmental contamination or noncompliance at our properties even if we no longer own such properties. See the discussion under Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors,&#8221; under the caption &#8220;Environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with owning and leasing our properties may affect our results of operations.&#8221; 

Competition 

We compete with many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities for acquisitions of healthcare properties, including national, regional and local operators, acquirers and developers of healthcare-related real estate properties. The competition for healthcare-related real estate properties may significantly increase the price that we must pay for healthcare properties or other assets that we seek to acquire, and our competitors may succeed in acquiring those properties or assets themselves. In addition, our potential acquisition targets may find our competitors to be more attractive because they may have greater resources, may be willing to pay more for the 

properties or may have a more compatible operating philosophy. In particular, larger REITs that target healthcare properties may enjoy significant competitive advantages that result from, among other things, a lower cost of capital, enhanced operating efficiencies, more personnel and market penetration and familiarity with markets. In addition, the number of entities and the amount of funds competing for suitable investment properties may increase. Increased competition would result in increased demand for the same assets and therefore increase prices paid for them. Those higher prices for healthcare properties or other assets may adversely affect our returns from our investments. 

Insurance 

We carry comprehensive liability insurance and property insurance covering our properties. In addition, tenants under long-term single-tenant net leases are required to carry property insurance covering our interest in the buildings. 

Employees 

At December 31, 2015, we employed nine people. The employees are not members of any labor union, and we consider our relations with our employees to be excellent. 

Seasonality 

Our business has not been, and we do not expect it to become subject to, material seasonal fluctuations.
