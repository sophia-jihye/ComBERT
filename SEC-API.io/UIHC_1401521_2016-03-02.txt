 Item 1. Business 

INTRODUCTION 

Company Overview 

United Insurance Holdings Corp. serves as the holding company for United Property &#38; Casualty Insurance Company and its affiliated companies (referred to in this document as we, our, us, the Company or UPC Insurance). We conduct our business principally through the six wholly-owned operating subsidiaries shown below. Collectively, including United Insurance Holdings Corp., we refer to these entities as &#8220;UPC Insurance,&#8221; which is the preferred brand identification we are establishing for our Company. 

UPC Insurance is primarily engaged in the homeowners property and casualty insurance business in the United States. We currently write in Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Louisiana, Massachusetts, New Jersey, North Carolina, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Texas, and we are licensed to write in Alabama, Delaware, Maryland, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New York and Virginia. Our target market currently consists of areas where the perceived threat of natural catastrophe has caused large national insurance carriers to reduce their concentration of policies. In such areas we believe an opportunity exists for UPC Insurance to write profitable business. We manage our risk of catastrophic loss primarily through sophisticated pricing algorithms, avoidance of policy concentration, and the use of a comprehensive catastrophe reinsurance program. UPC Insurance has been operating continuously in Florida since 1999, and has successfully managed its business through various hurricanes, tropical storms, and other weather related events. We believe our record of successful risk management and experience in writing business in catastrophe-exposed areas provides us a competitive advantage as we grow our business in other states facing similar perceived threats. 

We conduct our operations under one business segment.

UNITED INSURANCE HOLDINGS CORP. 

Vision and Goals 

&#160; 

The Company's vision is: " to be the premier provider of property insurance in catastrophe exposed areas ." 

Our mission is to build a sustainable franchise that delivers quality insurance products in select markets in order to produce superior risk-adjusted returns for investors. Our strategy is to grow in our target markets by building a team of insurance professionals that can (i) provide agents and policyholders quality insurance products with world-class service and systems; (ii) raise and manage capital to support business growth; and (iii) build and maintain relationships with external partners. We believe the team of professionals we have assembled has proven its ability to do each of these things, thereby providing us a source of sustainable competitive advantage as we continue to grow our footprint. 

Our emphasis on growing in areas with an ongoing threat of natural catastrophes exposes our company to risk and volatility. We manage the inherent volatility associated with our risk profile in three primary ways: 1) strategically , through geographic and product diversification; 2) financially , through the use of robust reinsurance programs, low financial and operating leverage, and a conservative investment approach; and 3) operationally , by insourcing key insurance functions and establishing strong external distribution partnerships. 

To achieve our goals in 2016, UPC Insurance seeks to: 

&#8226; 

Grow premium base in existing states; 

&#8226; 

Obtain regulatory approval to complete the pending acquisition of Interboro Insurance Company; 

&#8226; 

Begin writing policies in several new states in support of our growth and diversification strategy; 

&#8226; 

Expand our product offerings in states outside Florida; 

&#8226; 

Grow commercial residential property writings; 

&#8226; 

Utilize and add strategic partnerships to expand distribution and service capabilities in all states; 

&#8226; 

Improve the efficiency of our catastrophe reinsurance programs; and 

&#8226; 

Leverage investments in technology and analytics to manage exposure growth and improve profitability. 

Corporate Information 

&#160; 

In 1999, we formed our original holding company, United Insurance Holdings, L.C., a Florida limited liability company, our original insurance affiliate - United Property &#38; Casualty Insurance Company, and our original management affiliate - United Insurance Management, L.C., and conducted operations under that structure until 2004. In 2004, we added our claims adjusting affiliate - Skyway Claims Services, LLC, and continued operations under the new structure until we completed a reverse merger in September 2008 and became a publicly traded corporation. In April 2011, we founded our reinsurance affiliate - UPC Re. In December 2012, in connection with an underwritten public offering of 5,000,000 shares of our common stock, we applied to list our common stock on The NASDAQ Capital Market (NASDAQ). Our application was approved, and our common stock began trading on NASDAQ on December 11, 2012. 

On February 3, 2015, we successfully completed the acquisition of Family Security Holdings, LLC and its two wholly-owned subsidiaries in an all-stock transaction which resulted in the issuance of 503,857 shares of our common stock. 

Our principal executive offices are located at 800 2nd Avenue S, St. Petersburg, FL 33701 and our telephone number at that location is (727) 895-7737. 

Recent Events 

&#160; 

On February 17, 2016, our Board of Directors declared a $0.05 &#32;per share quarterly cash dividend payable on March 18, 2016, to stockholders of record on March 4, 2016. 

During the fourth quarter of 2015, we assumed more than 18,300 homeowners and dwelling fire policies from Citizens Property Insurance Company (Citizens), representing approximately $29,400,000 of annualized premiums. The total amount of assumed premium may be reduced by additional opt outs and cancellations by policyholders. 

&#32;5 

UNITED INSURANCE HOLDINGS CORP. 

On November 17, 2015, we assumed more than 60 commercial residential policies from Citizens, representing approximately $1,478,000 of annualized premiums. The total amount of assumed premium may be reduced by additional opt outs and cancellations by policyholders. 

On September 26, 2015, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Interboro, LLC to acquire Interboro Insurance Company (Interboro), a New York domiciled property and casualty insurer licensed in New York, South Carolina, Alabama, Louisiana, and Washington, D.C. Under the terms of the agreement, we will acquire all of the outstanding common stock of Interboro for $57,000,000. We will pay $48,500,000 in cash at closing and issue an $8,500,000 promissory note to Interboro, LLC, which will mature in 18 months and bear interest at an annual rate of 6%. The purchase price is subject to adjustment if Interboro's GAAP net book value is less than or greater than $40,700,000 as of the closing of the purchase transaction. Upon consummation of this transaction, we will acquire approximately $55,000,000 of homeowners' insurance gross written premiums in New York and South Carolina. All personal automobile and other non-homeowners insurance lines of business will remain with the Seller and its retained insurance subsidiaries. Certain other long-term liabilities such as Interboro's pension and leasehold obligations have also been carved out and will be assumed by the Seller. The transaction is subject to customary conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approval from the New York Department of Financial Services without the imposition of burdensome conditions that would materially reduce the expected benefits of the transaction. We currently expect the transaction will close on or about April 1, 2016. Either party may terminate the Stock Purchase Agreement if the closing shall not have occurred on or before June 26, 2016. 

PRODUCTS AND DISTRIBUTION 

Homeowners policies and related coverage account for the vast majority of the business that we write, but we are diversifying by product as well as geography. We offer the following insurance products: 

At-Risk Offerings: 

&#8226; Homeowners 

&#8226; Dwelling Fire 

&#8226; Renters 

&#8226; Condo Owners 

&#8226; Commercial Residential 

Not At-Risk Offerings: 

&#8226; Federal Flood 

&#8226; Equipment Breakdown 

&#8226; Identity Theft 

In 2015, personal property policies (by which we mean both standard homeowners, dwelling fire, renters and condo owners policies) produced written premium of $543,420,000 and accounted for 95% of our total written premium. In addition to these policies, we write flood policies, which accounted for 3%, and commercial residential policies, which accounted for the remaining 2% of our 2015 written premium. In 2014, personal property, flood and commercial policies accounted for 96%, 3% and 1%, respectively of our written premiums. In 2013, personal property and flood policies accounted for 96% and 4%, respectively of our total written premium. 

On our flood, equipment breakdown and identity theft policies, we earn a commission while retaining no risk of loss, since all such risk is ceded to other private companies and the federal government via the National Flood Insurance Program. Policies we issue under our homeowners programs in the various states where we conduct business provide structure, content and liability coverage. We offer standardized policies for a broad range of exposures, and our policies include coverage options for standard single-family homeowners, renters, and condominium unit owners. 

We have developed a unique and proprietary homeowners product we refer to as "UPC 1.0". This new product uses a granular approach to pricing for catastrophe perils. Our objective is to create specific geographic areas such that within each territory or "catastrophe band" the expected losses are within a specified range of error or approximation from a central estimate. These areas may have millions of data points that help us create distance-to-coast factors that provide a sophisticated market segmentation that is highly correlated to our risk exposure and reinsurance costs. UPC 1.0 has been filed and approved for use in Connecticut, Georgia, Louisiana, New Jersey, South Carolina and Texas and we plan to file it for use in all our states. 

&#32;6 

UNITED INSURANCE HOLDINGS CORP. 

&#32;We currently market and distribute our policies to consumers through over 7,000 independent agencies. United Property &#38; Casualty Insurance Company has been focused on the independent agency distribution channel since its inception, and we believe we have built significant credibility and loyalty with the independent agent community in the states in which we operate. We recruit, train and appoint the full-service insurance agencies that distribute our products. Typically, a full service agency is small to medium in size and represents several insurance companies for both personal and commercial product lines. We depend heavily upon our independent agents to produce new business for us. We compensate our independent agents primarily with fixed-rate commissions that are consistent with market practices. In addition to our relationships with individual agencies, we have important relationships with aggregators of underlying agency demand. The two most significant of these relationships are with Allstate in Florida, which, through its Ivantage program, refers homeowners to United Property &#38; Casualty Insurance Company and other partner companies, and with the Florida Association of Insurance Agents (FAIA), which serves as a conduit between United Property &#38; Casualty Insurance Company and many smaller agencies in Florida with whom we do not have direct appointments. 

Our sales representatives monitor and support our agents and also have the principal responsibility for recruiting and training our new agents. We manage our independent agents through periodic business reviews using established benchmarks and goals for premium volume and profitability.

* The information displayed in the table above is compiled and published by SNL, Inc. as of December 31, 2014 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;based on information filings submitted annually by all licensed insurance companies. The information above 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;is presented on a consolidated or aggregated basis for each insurance company group. The amounts shown in 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;the table above are also on a statutory basis and exclude non-Homeowners lines of business that are included 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;in the Company's total direct written premium for 2014. 

We compete primarily on the basis of product features, the strength of our distribution network, high-quality service to our agents and policyholders, and our reputation for long-term financial stability and commitment. Our long and successful track record writing homeowners insurance in catastrophe-exposed areas has enabled us to develop sophisticated pricing techniques that endeavor to accurately reflect the risk of loss while allowing us to be competitive in our target markets. This pricing segmentation approach allows us to offer products in areas that have a high demand for property insurance yet are under served by the national carriers. 

We price our product at levels that we project will generate an acceptable underwriting profit. We try to be extremely granular in our approach, so that our price can accurately reflect the risk and profitability of each potential customer. In our pricing algorithm, we consider credit scores (where allowable) and historical attritional loss costs for the rating territory in which the customer resides, as well as projected reinsurance costs based on the specific geographic and structural characteristics of the home. In addition to the specific characteristics of the policy being priced, we also evaluate the reinsurance cost of each incremental policy on our portfolio as a whole. In this regard, we seek to optimize our portfolio by diversifying our geographic exposure in order to limit our probable maximum loss, total insured value and average annual loss. We use the output from third-party modeling software to analyze our risk exposures, including wind exposures, by zip code or street address as part of the optimization process. 

&#32;8 

UNITED INSURANCE HOLDINGS CORP. 

We establish underwriting guidelines to provide a uniform approach to our risk selection and to achieve underwriting profitability. Our underwriters review the property inspection report during their risk evaluation and if the policy does not meet our underwriting criteria, we have the right to cancel the policy within 90 days in Florida and within 60 days in other states. 

We strive to provide excellent service to our independent agents and our policyholders. We continue to enhance our web-based systems which allow our agents to prepare and process new policies and policy changes online and deliver policy declarations quickly. We work with a select group of third party vendors to develop, manage and maintain our information technology systems. This allows us to obtain up-to-date technology at a reasonable cost and to achieve economies of scale without incurring significant fixed-overhead expenses. As agent and consumer behaviors evolve we continue to enhance our technology platforms to offer solutions that meet their needs. 

GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS 

United Property &#38; Casualty Insurance Company began operations in Florida in 1999, and has operated continuously there since that time. In 2010, we began writing business outside of Florida and we currently conduct business in eleven states. The table below shows the years in which we began to actively write in each state:

Our insurance affiliates are also licensed to write, but have not commenced writing business in Alabama, Delaware, Maryland, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New York and Virginia. It is a fundamental part of our strategy to diversify our operations outside of Florida and to write in multiple states where the perceived threat of natural catastrophes has caused large national insurance companies to reduce their concentration.

UNITED INSURANCE HOLDINGS CORP. 

RESERVE FOR UNPAID LOSSES 

We generally use the term loss(es) to collectively refer to both loss and loss adjusting expenses. We establish reserves for both reported and unreported unpaid losses that have occurred at or before the balance sheet date for amounts we estimate we will be required to pay in the future. Our policy is to establish these loss reserves after considering all information known to us at each reporting period. At any given point in time, our loss reserve represents our best estimate of the ultimate settlement and administration cost of our insured claims incurred and unpaid. Since the process of estimating loss reserves requires significant judgment due to a number of variables, such as fluctuations in inflation, judicial decisions, legislative changes and changes in claims handling procedures, our ultimate liability will likely differ from these estimates. We revise our reserve for unpaid losses as additional information becomes available, and reflect adjustments, if any, in our earnings in the periods in which we determine the adjustments are necessary. 

Reserves for unpaid losses fall into two categories: case reserves and reserves for claims incurred but not reported. See our APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES section under Item 7 &#32;of this Annual Report for a discussion of these two categories of reserves for unpaid losses and for a discussion of the methods we use to estimate those reserves. 

On an annual basis, our consulting actuary issues a statement of actuarial opinion that documents the actuary&#8217;s evaluation of the adequacy of our unpaid loss obligations under the terms of our policies. We review the analysis underlying the actuary's opinion and compare the projected ultimate losses per the actuary's analysis to our own projection of ultimate losses to ensure that our reserve for unpaid losses recorded at each annual balance sheet date is based upon our analysis of all internal and external factors related to known and unknown claims against us and to ensure our reserve is within guidelines promulgated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). 

We maintain an in-house claims staff that monitors and directs all aspects of our claims process. We assign the fieldwork to our wholly-owned claims subsidiary, or to third-party claims adjusting companies, none of whom have the authority to settle or pay any claims on our behalf. The claims adjusting companies conduct inspections of the damaged property and prepare initial estimates. We review the inspection reports and initial estimates to determine the amounts to be paid to the policyholder in accordance with the terms and conditions of the policy in effect at the time that the policyholder incurs the loss. We maintain strategic relationships with multiple claims adjusting companies that we can engage should we need additional non-catastrophe claims servicing capacity. We believe the combination of our internal resources and relationships with external claims servicing providers provide an adequate level of claims servicing in the event catastrophes affect our policyholders.

LOSS RESERVE DEVELOPMENT 

The table on the next page displays UPC Insurance's loss reserve development, on a GAAP basis, for business written in each year from 2005 through 2015 ; it does not distinguish between catastrophe and attritional losses. The following explanations of the main sections of the table should provide a better understanding of the information displayed: 

Original net liability. &#32;&#32;The original net liability represents the original estimated amount of reserves for unpaid losses recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the years indicated in the column headings, net of reinsured losses. We record reserves related to claims arising in the current year and in all prior years that remained unpaid at the balance sheet date for each of the years indicated, including estimated losses that had been incurred but not reported. 

Net cumulative paid as of. &#32;&#32;This section displays the net cumulative payments we have made for losses, as of the balance sheet date of each succeeding year, related to claims incurred prior to the balance sheet date of the year indicated in the column heading. 

Net liability re-estimated as of. &#32;&#32;This section displays the re-estimated amount of the previously recorded liability based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year. An increase or decrease from the original reserve estimate is caused by a combination of factors, including (i) claims being settled for amounts different than originally estimated, (ii) reserves being increased or decreased for claims remaining open as more information becomes available on those individual claims and (iii) more or fewer claims being reported after the year end than estimated. 

Cumulative redundancy (deficiency) at December 31, 2015 . &#32;&#32;The cumulative redundancy or deficiency results from the comparison of the net liability re-estimated as of the current balance sheet date to the original net liability, and it indicates an overestimation of the original net liability (a redundancy) or an underestimation of the original net liability (a deficiency). 

&#160; 

It is important to note that the table presents a run-off of balance sheet liability for the periods indicated rather than accident or policy loss development for those periods. Therefore, each amount in the table includes the cumulative effects of changes in liability for all prior periods. Conditions and trends that have affected liabilities in the past may not necessarily occur in the future.

Note: &#32;&#32;The cash we received in relation to the commutation of our 2005 contract with the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund (FHCF) caused the decrease in the net cumulative paid amounts beginning in the 2005 column in the table above. The FHCF is a Florida State-sponsored trust fund that provides reimbursement to Florida property insurers for covered hurricane losses. 

* The 2014 original net liability balance includes the reserves acquired from Family Security Insurance Company, Inc. as part of the acquisition that was completed on February 3, 2015. See Note 4 to our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the acquisition of Family Security Insurance Company, Inc. 

The NAIC requires all property and casualty insurers to present current and historical loss information in an alternative format known as Schedule P, Part 2. This summary schedule in United Property &#38; Casualty Insurance Company's and Family Security Insurance Company's statutory filings is designed to measure reserve adequacy by evaluating the inception-to-date loss and defense and cost containment (DCC) expenses incurred by calendar year and accident year and calculating the one and two year development on those expenses reported in prior periods. 

The following table includes United Property &#38; Casualty Insurance Company's and Family Security Insurance Company Inc.'s Schedule P, Part 2 information, but was modified to also include all remaining loss adjustment expenses incurred, known as adjusting and other, as well as backing out loss payments from United Property &#38; Casualty Insurance Company to Skyway Claims Services, LLC that are included in Schedule P, Part 2, but are eliminated in our consolidated GAAP results:

UNITED INSURANCE HOLDINGS CORP. 

REGULATION 

We are subject to extensive regulation in the markets we serve, primarily at the state level. In general, these regulations are designed to protect the interests of insurance policyholders. These rules have a substantial effect on our business and relate to a wide variety of matters, including insurer solvency, reserve adequacy, insurance company licensing and examination, agent and adjuster licensing, policy forms, rate setting, the nature and amount of investments, claims practices, participation in shared markets and guaranty funds, transactions with affiliates, the payment of dividends, underwriting standards, statutory accounting methods, trade practices, and corporate governance. Some of these matters are discussed in more detail below. From time to time, individual states and/or the NAIC propose new regulations and/or legislation that affect us. We can neither predict whether any of these proposals in the various jurisdictions might be adopted, nor what effect, if any, their adoption may have on our results of operations or financial condition. For a discussion of statutory financial information and regulatory contingencies, see Note 12 &#32;to our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements which is incorporated in this Part I, Item 1 by reference. 

Our insurance affiliates provide audited statutory financial statements to the various insurance regulatory authorities. With regard to periodic examinations of an insurance company's affairs, insurance regulatory authorities, in general, defer to the insurance regulatory authority in the state in which an insurer is domiciled; however, insurance regulatory authorities from any state in which we operate may conduct examinations at their discretion. United Property &#38; Casualty Insurance Company is domiciled in Florida and Family Security Insurance Company, Inc. is domiciled in Hawaii. 

Florida state law requires our insurance affiliate to maintain adequate surplus as to policyholders on a statutory basis of accounting such that 90% of written premiums divided by surplus does not exceed the ratio of 10:1 &#32;for gross written premiums or 4.5:1 &#32;for net written premiums. The ratio of gross and net written premium to surplus as of December 31, 2015 , was 3.7:1 &#32;and 2.5:1 , respectively, and United Property &#38; Casualty Insurance Company&#8217;s statutory surplus as regards policyholders of $135,288,000 &#32;exceeded the minimum capital of $5,000,000 required by Florida law. Family Security Insurance Company's statutory surplus as regards policyholders of $15,572,302 also exceeded the minimum capital required by Hawaii law. 

We are subject to various assessments imposed by governmental agencies or certain quasi-governmental entities. While we may be able to recover from policyholders some of the assessments imposed upon us, our payment of the assessments and our recoveries through policy surcharges may not offset each other in the same fiscal period in our financial statements. See Note 2(j) &#32;and Note 12 &#32;in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the assessments that we are currently collecting. 

Limitations on Dividends by Insurance Subsidiaries 

As a holding company with no significant business operations of our own, we rely on payments from our insurance affiliates as one of the principal sources of cash to pay dividends and meet our obligations. Our insurance affiliates are regulated as property and casualty insurance companies and their ability to pay dividends is restricted by Florida and Hawaii law. For additional information regarding those restrictions, see Part II, Item 5 &#32;of this report. 

Risk-Based Capital Requirements 

To enhance the regulation of insurer solvency, the NAIC published risk-based capital (RBC) guidelines for insurance companies designed to assess capital adequacy and to raise the level of protection statutory surplus provides for policyholders. The guidelines measure three major areas of risk facing property and casualty insurers: (i) underwriting risks, which encompass the risk of adverse loss developments and inadequate pricing; (ii) declines in asset values arising from credit risk; and (iii) other business risks. Most states, including Florida and Hawaii, have enacted the NAIC guidelines as statutory requirements, and insurers having less statutory surplus than required will be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action, depending on the level of capital inadequacy. Insurance regulatory authorities could require our insurance subsidiaries to cease operations in the event it fails to maintain the required statutory capital. 

At December 31, 2015 , the RBC ratio for United Property &#38; Casualty Insurance Company and Family Security Insurance Company, Inc. was 419 % and 445 %, respectively. See Note 12 to our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of risk-based capital requirements. 

Insurance Holding Company Regulation 

As a holding company of insurance subsidiaries, we are subject to laws governing insurance holding companies in Florida and Hawaii. These laws, among other things, (i) require us to file periodic information with the insurance regulatory authority, 

&#32;17 

UNITED INSURANCE HOLDINGS CORP. 

including information concerning our capital structure, ownership, financial condition and general business operations, (ii) regulate certain transactions between our affiliates and us, including the amount of dividends and other distributions and the terms of surplus notes and (iii) restrict the ability of any one person to acquire certain levels of our voting securities without prior regulatory approval. Any purchaser of 5% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock could be presumed to have acquired control of us unless the insurance regulatory authority, upon application, determines otherwise. 

Insurance holding company regulations also govern the amount any affiliate of the holding company may charge our insurance affiliates for services (e.g., management fees and commissions). We have a long-term management agreement between United Property &#38; Casualty Insurance Company and United Insurance Management, L.C., which presently provides for monthly management fees. The Florida insurance regulatory authority must approve any changes to this agreement. 

We also have a management agreement between Family Security Insurance Company, Inc. and Family Security Underwriters, LLC, which presently provides for monthly management fees. The Hawaii regulatory authority must approve any changes to this agreement. 

Underwriting and Marketing Restrictions 

During the past several years, various regulatory and legislative bodies have adopted or proposed new laws or regulations to address the cyclical nature of the insurance industry, catastrophic events and insurance capacity and pricing. These regulations (i) created &#8220;market assistance plans&#8221; under which insurers are induced to provide certain coverage; (ii) restrict the ability of insurers to reject insurance coverage applications, to rescind or otherwise cancel certain policies in mid-term, and to terminate agents; (iii) restrict certain policy non-renewals and require advance notice on certain policy non-renewals; and (iv) limit rate increases or decrease rates permitted to be charged. 

Most states also have insurance laws requiring that rate schedules and other information be filed with the insurance regulatory authority, either directly or through a rating organization with which the insurer is affiliated. The insurance regulatory authority may disapprove a rate filing if it finds that the rates are inadequate, excessive or unfairly discriminatory. 

Most states require licensure or insurance regulatory authority approval prior to the marketing of new insurance products. Typically, licensure review is comprehensive and includes a review of a company&#8217;s business plan, solvency, reinsurance, character of its officers and directors, rates, forms and other financial and non-financial aspects of a company. The insurance regulatory authorities may prohibit entry into a new market by not granting a license or by withholding approval. 

FINANCIAL STABILITY RATING 

Financial stability ratings are important to insurance companies in establishing their competitive position and such ratings may impact an insurance company&#8217;s ability to write policies. Demotech maintains a letter-scale financial stability rating system ranging from A** (A double prime) to L (licensed by insurance regulatory authorities); they have assigned our insurance subsidiaries a financial stability rating of A, which is the third highest of six rating levels. According to Demotech, "Regardless of the severity of a general economic downturn or deterioration in the insurance cycle, insurers earning a Financial Stability Rating of A possess Exceptional financial stability related to maintaining surplus as regards policyholders at an acceptable level.&#8221; With a financial stability rating of A, we expect our property insurance policies will be acceptable to the secondary mortgage marketplace and mortgage lenders. This rating is intended to provide an independent opinion of an insurer&#8217;s financial strength and is not an evaluation directed at our investors. At least annually, based on year-to-date results as of the third quarter, Demotech reviews our rating and may revise it upward or downward or revoke it at their sole discretion. 

EMPLOYEES 

As of March 2016 , we have one part time employee, and 119 full time employees, which includes our executive officers. We are neither party to any collective bargaining agreements nor have we experienced any work stoppages or strikes as a result of labor disputes. We believe we have good working relationships with our employees.
