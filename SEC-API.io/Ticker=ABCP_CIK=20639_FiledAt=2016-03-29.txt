Background

In August 1988, the Company acquired Carteret Bancorp Inc., which through its principal wholly owned subsidiary Carteret Savings Bank, FA, was principally engaged in retail and consumer banking, and mortgage banking including mortgage servicing. On December 4, 1992, the Office of Thrift Supervision ("OTS") placed Carteret Savings Bank, FA in receivership under the management of the Resolution Trust Corporation ("RTC") and a new institution, Carteret Federal Savings Bank, was established to assume the assets and certain liabilities of Carteret Savings Bank, FA.

The Company was a plaintiff in a legal proceeding, commenced in 1993, seeking recovery of damages from the United States Government for the loss of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Carteret Savings Bank, F.A. (the "Supervisory Goodwill" legal proceedings). Pursuant to a Settlement Agreement between the Company, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-Receiver ("FDIC-R") and the Department of Justice ("DOJ") on behalf of the United States of America (the "United States"), (the "Settlement Agreement") as approved by the United States Court of Federal Claims (the "Court of Federal Claims"), in October 2012, the United States paid $180,650,000 directly to AmBase (the "Settlement Amount"). As part of the Settlement Agreement in the Company's Supervisory Goodwill legal proceedings, the Company is entitled to a tax gross-up in an amount to be determined if and when any federal taxes should be imposed on the Settlement Amount. In December 2014, the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") completed their review of the examination of the Company's 2012 Federal Income Tax Return with no change to the tax return as filed.
