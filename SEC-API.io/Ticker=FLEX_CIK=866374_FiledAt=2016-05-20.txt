We believe that the combination of our extensive open innovation platform solutions, design and engineering services, advanced supply chain management solutions and services, significant scale and global presence, and industrial campuses in low-cost geographies provide us with a competitive advantage and strong differentiation in the market for designing, manufacturing, and servicing consumer electronics and industrial products for leading multinational and regional OEMs. Through these services and facilities, we offer our OEM customers accelerated design, increased flexibility and responsiveness, improved time to market, and supply chain predictability and real time visibility, which enable them to accelerate product launches, enter new markets, mitigate risks, and improve free cash flow. 

Our business has been subject to seasonality, primarily due to our mobile devices and consumer electronics markets exposure, which are part of our CTG segment, which historically exhibit particular strength generally in the last two quarters of the calendar year in connection with the holiday season. 

We recognized research and development costs primarily related to our design and innovations businesses of $75.5 million , $35.2 million , and $30.0 million &#32;for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 

INDUSTRY OVERVIEW 

Our expertise is in the design, manufacture, and supply services for a broad range of products; as such, the closest definition of our industry is the outsourced Electronics Manufacturing Services ("EMS") industry. EMS has experienced significant change and growth as an increasing number of companies elect to outsource some or all of their design, manufacturing, and after-market services requirements. In recent years, we have seen an increased level of diversification by many companies, primarily in the technology sector. Companies that have historically identified themselves as software providers, internet service providers, or e-commerce retailers are entering the highly competitive and rapidly evolving hardware markets, with products including mobile devices, home entertainment and wearable devices. This trend has resulted in significant changes to the hardware manufacturing and supply chain solutions requirements of such companies. Increasingly complex products require highly customized supply chain solutions, in turn resulting in significant changes to the overall manufacturing and supply chain landscape. The growth of the overall industry for calendar year 2015 &#32;is estimated to have been around 6% . 

We believe the total available market for the EMS industry is poised for continued growth, with current penetration rates estimated to be less than 30% . The intensely competitive nature of the electronics industry, the increasing complexity and sophistication of electronics products, and pressure on OEMs to reduce product costs and shorten product life cycles are all factors that encourage OEMs to utilize supply chain service providers as part of their business and manufacturing strategies. Utilizing global manufacturing and service providers allows OEMs to take advantage of the global design, manufacturing and supply chain management expertise of such providers, and enables OEMs to concentrate on product research, development, marketing, and sales. We believe that OEMs realize a number of important benefits through their strategic relationships with EMS providers, including: 

&#8226; 

Improved efficiency and reduced production costs; 

&#8226; 

Reduced design and development costs and lead time; 

&#8226; 

Accelerated time-to-market and time-to-volume production; 

&#8226; 

Reduced capital investment requirements and fixed costs; 

&#8226; 

Improved inventory management and purchasing power; 

&#8226; 

Access to worldwide design, engineering, manufacturing, and after-market service capabilities; and 

&#8226; 

Ability to focus on core branding and R&#38;D initiatives. 

We believe that growth in the EMS industry will be largely driven by the need for OEMs to respond to rapidly changing markets and technologies, the increasing complexity of supply chains and the continued pressure to be cost competitive. Additionally, we believe that there are significant opportunities for global EMS providers to win additional business from OEMs in markets or industry segments that have yet to substantially utilize such providers.

See "Risk Factors&#8212;We may be adversely affected by shortages of required electronic components." 

Component businesses. We offer the following components product solutions: 

&#8226; 

Rigid and Flexible Printed Circuit Board ("PCB") Fabrication. &#32;Printed circuit boards are composed of laminated materials that provide the interconnection for integrated circuits, passive and other electronic components and thus are at the heart of almost every electrical system. They are formed out of multi-layered epoxy resin and glass cloth systems with very fine traces, spaces, and plated holes (called vias) which interconnect the different layers into an extremely dense circuit network that carries the electrical signals between components. As semiconductor designs become more complex and signal speeds increase, there is an increasing demand for higher density integration on printed circuit boards, requiring higher layer counts, finer lines and spacings, smaller vias (microvias) and base materials with very low electrical loss characteristics. The manufacturing of these complex multilayer interconnect products often requires the use of sophisticated circuit interconnections between layers, and adherence to strict electrical characteristics to maintain consistent transmission speeds and impedances. The global demand for wireless devices and the complexity of wireless products are driving the demand for more flexible printed circuits. Flexible circuit boards facilitate a reduction in the weight of a finished electronic product and allow the designer to use the third dimension in designing new products or product features. Flexible circuits have become a very attractive design alternative for many new and emerging application spaces such as automotive rear light-emitting diode ("LED") lighting, tablet computers, and miniaturized radio frequency identification tags or smart cards. We are an industry leader in high-density interconnect with Every Layer Inter Connect ("ELIC") technology, which is widely used in smart phone designs, and multilayer constructions which are used in advanced routers and switches, telecom equipment, servers, storage, and flexible printed circuit boards and flexible printed circuit board assemblies. Our PCB business (Multek) manufactures printed circuit boards on a low-volume, quick-turn basis, as well as on a high-volume production basis. We provide quick-turn prototype services that allow us to provide small test quantities to meet the 

needs of customers' product development groups in as quickly as 48 hours. Our extensive range of services enables us to respond to our customers' demands for an accelerated transition from prototype to volume production. Multek offers a one-stop solution from design to manufacturing of PCB, flexible circuits and rigid flex circuits and sub-assemblies. We have printed circuit board and flexible circuit fabrication service capabilities in North America and Asia. During fiscal year 2014, we completed the closing of our Multek factories in Germany and Brazil. This drove operational efficiencies, and resulted in an optimization of our system, which will reduce the revenue level required to achieve better margins. Going forward, our PCB capabilities will be centered in Asia and North America. 

&#8226;

We compete against numerous domestic and foreign manufacturing service providers, as well as our current and prospective customers, who evaluate our capabilities in light of their own capabilities and cost structures. We face particular competition from Asian-based competitors, including Taiwanese Original Design Manufacturing ("ODM") suppliers who compete in a variety of our end markets and have a substantial share of global information technology hardware production. 

We compete with different companies depending on the type of service we are providing or the geographic area in which an activity takes place. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the manufacturing services market are quality and range of services, design and technological capabilities; cost; location of facilities; responsiveness and flexibility. We believe we are extremely competitive with regard to all of these factors. 

SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 

Our Corporate Social and Environmental Responsibility ("CSER") management system has several elements, including environmental, health and safety compliance, labor and human rights, ethics, governance, and community engagement. Flex's CSER framework is based upon the principles, policies, and standards prescribed by the Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition ("EICC"), a worldwide association of electronics companies committed to promoting an industry code of conduct for global electronics supply chains to improve working and environmental, health and safety conditions as well as other relevant international standards (e.g., ISO 14001). Flex is a founding member of the EICC. Social responsibility is also an area of increasing regulation, with specific regulations such as the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act, the U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulation on Human Trafficking and the U.K. Modern Slavery Act of 2015, all creating new compliance and disclosure obligations for the Company and for our customers. We operate a number of programs, including compliance audits, 

data collection, training and leadership programs that focus upon driving continuous improvements in social, ethical, and environmental performance throughout all of our global operating units, all in accordance with our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Being a good corporate citizen does not mean we should merely conform to standards. We go beyond required responsibilities by offering a wide range of programs and initiatives to engage both our internal and external communities. At the heart of this endeavor lies our pragmatic goal of positively influencing the lives of people in the communities in which we operate. We intend to continue investing in these global communities through grant-making, financial contributions, volunteer work, direct engagement and donation of resources. 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act"), Section 1502, introduced reporting requirements related to the verification of whether we are directly (or indirectly through suppliers of materials) purchasing the following minerals: columbite-tantalite, also known as coltan (the metal ore from which tantalum is extracted); cassiterite (the metal ore from which tin is extracted); gold; wolframite (the metal ore from which tungsten is extracted); or their derivatives; or any other mineral or its derivatives as determined by the Secretary of State associated with financing conflicts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or an adjoining country. We are working directly with suppliers, industry groups, and customers to comply with the due diligence reporting requirements necessary to comply with this law. See "Risk Factors&#8212;Compliance with government regulations regarding the use of 'conflict minerals' may result in increased costs and risks to us." We have filed Conflict Minerals reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act. 

ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION 

Our operations are regulated under various federal, state, local and international laws governing the environment, including laws governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites. We have implemented processes and procedures to ensure that our operations are in compliance with all applicable environmental regulations. We do not believe that costs of compliance with these laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, operating results, or competitive position. In addition, we are responsible for cleanup of contamination at some of our current and former manufacturing facilities and at some third-party sites. We engage environmental consulting firms to assist us in the evaluation of environmental liabilities associated with our ongoing operations, historical disposal activities and closed sites in order to establish appropriate accruals in our financial statements. We determine the amount of our accruals for environmental matters by analyzing and estimating the probability of occurrence and the reasonable possibility of incurring costs in light of information currently available. The imposition of more stringent standards or requirements under environmental laws or regulations, the results of future testing and analysis undertaken by us at our operating facilities, or a determination that we are potentially responsible for the release of hazardous substances at other sites could result in expenditures in excess of amounts currently estimated to be required for such matters. There can be no assurance that additional environmental matters will not arise in the future or that costs will not be incurred with respect to sites as to which no issue is currently known. 

We are also required to comply with an increasing number of product environmental compliance regulations focused upon the restriction of certain hazardous substances. For example, the electronics industry is subject to the European Union's ("EU") Restrictions on Hazardous Substances ("RoHS") 2011/65/EU, Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment ("WEEE") 2012/19/EU directives, the regulation EC 1907/2006 EU Directive REACH ("Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals"), and China RoHS entitled, Management Methods for Controlling Pollution for Electronic Information Products ("EIPs"). Similar legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions, including the United States. Our business requires close collaboration with our customers and suppliers to mitigate risks of non-compliance. We have developed rigorous compliance programs designed to meet the needs and specifications of our customers as well as the regulations. These programs vary from collecting compliance or material data from our Flex controlled or managed suppliers to full laboratory testing, and we include compliance requirements in our standard supplier contracts. Non-compliance could potentially result in significant costs and/or penalties. RoHS and other similar legislation bans or restricts the use of lead, mercury and certain other specified substances in electronics products and WEEE requires EU importers and/or producers to assume responsibility for the collection, recycling and management of waste electronic products and components. In the case of WEEE, although the compliance responsibility rests primarily with the EU importers and/or producers rather than with EMS companies, OEMs may turn to EMS companies for assistance in meeting their WEEE obligations. Flex continues to monitor developments related to product environmental compliance and is working with our customers and other technical organizations to anticipate and minimize any impacts to our operations. 

EMPLOYEES 

As of March 31, 2016 , our global workforce totaled approximately 200,000 &#32;employees. In certain international locations, our employees are represented by labor unions and by work councils. We have never experienced a significant work stoppage or strike, and we believe that our employee relations are good. 

Our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of key managerial and technical employees. The loss of such personnel could seriously harm our business, results of operations and business prospects. To date, we have not experienced significant difficulties in attracting or retaining such personnel. 

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 

We own or license various United States and foreign patents relating to a variety of technologies. For certain of our proprietary processes, we rely on trade secret protection. We also have registered our corporate name and several other trademarks and service marks that we use in our business in the United States and other countries throughout the world. As of March 31, 2016 &#32;and 2015 , the carrying value of our intellectual property was not material. 

Although we believe that our intellectual property assets and licenses are sufficient for the operation of our business as we currently conduct it, from time to time third parties do assert patent infringement claims against us or our customers. In addition, we provide design and engineering services to our customers and also design and make our own products. As a consequence of these activities, our customers are requiring us to take responsibility for intellectual property to a greater extent than in our manufacturing and assembly businesses. If and when third parties make assertions regarding the ownership or right to use intellectual property, we could be required to either enter into licensing arrangements or to resolve the issue through litigation. Such license rights might not be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, and any such litigation might not be resolved in our favor. Additionally, litigation could be lengthy and costly and could materially harm our financial condition regardless of the outcome. We also could be required to incur substantial costs to redesign a product or re-perform design services.
