 Item 1. Business 

OVERVIEW 

Founded in 1986, Nautilus, Inc. and subsidiaries (collectively, "Nautilus" or the "Company") is a consumer fitness products company headquartered in Vancouver, Washington and incorporated in the State of Washington in January 1993. We are committed to providing innovative, quality solutions to help people achieve their fitness goals through a fit and healthy lifestyle. Our principal business activities include designing, developing, sourcing and marketing high-quality cardio and strength fitness products and related accessories for consumer use, primarily in the United States and Canada, but also in international markets outside North America. Our products are sold under some of the most-recognized brand names in the fitness industry: Nautilus &#174; , Bowflex &#174; , Octane Fitness &#174; , Schwinn &#174; and Universal &#174; . 

We market our products through two distinct distribution channels, Direct and Retail, which we consider to be separate business segments. Our Direct &#32;business offers products directly to consumers through television advertising, catalogs and the Internet. Our Retail &#32;business offers our products through a network of independent companies to reach consumers in both the home use as well as commercial use markets in the United States and internationally. We also derive a portion of our revenue from the licensing of our brands and intellectual property. 

BUSINESS STRATEGY 

We are focused on developing and marketing consumer fitness equipment and related products to help people enjoy healthier lives. Our products are targeted to meet the needs of a broad range of consumers, including fitness enthusiasts and individuals who are seeking the benefits of regular exercise. We have diversified our business by expanding our portfolio of high quality fitness equipment into multiple product lines utilizing our well-recognized brand names. We are focused on consumer markets and specialty and commercial distribution channels, and view the continual innovation of our product offerings as a key aspect of our business strategy. We regularly refresh our existing product lines with new technologies and finishes, and focus significant effort and resources on the development or acquisition of innovative new fitness products for introduction to the marketplace at periodic intervals. 

&#160; 

Our strategies incorporate the individual characteristics of our Direct and Retail businesses. Our Direct business focuses on: (i) the development of, or acquisition of rights to, unique products; (ii) the application of creative, cost-effective ways to communicate the benefits of their use; and (iii) making various payment options available to our customers. We are particularly attentive to Direct business metrics that provide feedback regarding the effectiveness of our media marketing programs and attractiveness of third-party consumer financing programs. 

In our Retail business, we strive to develop long-term relationships with key retailers of sports or fitness equipment. The primary objectives of our Retail business are (i) to offer a selection of products at key price-points; and (ii) to utilize the strength of our brands and long-standing customer relationships to secure more floor space with our Retail customers for our products, as well as support efforts to gain share in multi-user environments. 

Our long-term strategy involves: 

&#8226; 

creatively marketing our equipment, both directly to consumers and through our Retail customers, while leveraging our well-known brand names; 

&#8226; 

enhancing our product lines by designing fitness equipment that meets or exceeds the high expectations of our customers; 

&#8226; 

utilizing our strengths in product engineering to reduce product costs; 

&#8226; 

continuing our investment in research and development activities aimed at acquiring or creating new technologies; 

&#8226; 

increasing our international Retail sales and distribution; and 

&#8226; 

maximizing available royalty revenues from the licensing of our brands and intellectual property. 

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 

On December 31, 2015, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of OF Holdings, Inc., sole parent of Octane Fitness, LLC ("Octane" or "Octane Fitness"), for an aggregate base purchase price of $115.0 million, plus adjustments for working capital and cash on the closing date. The Company funded the acquisition through an $80.0 million term loan and cash on hand. Based in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, Octane is a leader in zero-impact training with a line of fitness equipment focused on Retail specialty and commercial channels. The acquisition of Octane is expected to strengthen and diversify our brand portfolio, broaden our distribution and deepen our talent pool. Octane's business is anticipated to be highly complementary to our existing business from both product and channel perspectives and is expected to create numerous revenue synergies for us. 

PRODUCTS 

We market quality cardiovascular, strength and nutrition fitness products that cover a broad range of price points and features. Our products are designed for home use by individuals with varying exercise needs. From the person who works out occasionally to the serious athlete, we have products that will help them achieve their fitness objectives. 

&#8226; 

Nautilus &#174; &#32;is our corporate umbrella brand and is also used to differentiate certain specialized cardio, treadmills, ellipticals and bike products. 

&#8226; 

Our Bowflex &#174; &#32;brand represents a highly-regarded line of fitness equipment comprised of both cardio and strength products, including the Max Trainer &#174; and TreadClimber &#174; specialized cardio machines, PowerRod &#174; &#32;and Revolution &#174; &#32;home gyms and SelectTech &#174; &#32;dumbbells. 

&#8226; 

Our Octane Fitness &#174; &#32; brand is known for its innovation around low-impact cardio products, including the perfection of the traditional elliptical machine, along with the creation of new categories of exercise, including the xRide &#174; &#32;recumbent elliptical, the LateralX &#174; elliptical, and the Zero Runner &#174; . 

&#8226; 

Our Schwinn &#174; &#32; brand is known for its popular line of exercise bikes, including the Airdyne &#174; , treadmills, and ellipticals. 

&#8226; 

Our Universal &#174; &#32;brand, one of the oldest and most recognized names in the fitness industry, currently offers a line of kettlebell weights and weight benches along with a recently launched cardio line. 

&#160; 

We generally differentiate the product models offered in our Direct and Retail sales channels. Currently, our Max Trainer &#174; &#32;and TreadClimber &#174; &#32;product lines are offered for sale primarily through our Direct sales channel. 

Approximately 82% &#32;of our revenue in 2015 &#32;was derived from sales of consumer cardio products. While we continue to be a leader in the consumer strength product category, we believe the much larger market for cardio products offers us greater opportunity for growth. 

&#160; 

BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION 

We conduct our business in two segments, Direct and Retail. For further information regarding our segments and geographic information, see Note 19, Segment and Enterprise-Wide Information , to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. 

SALES AND MARKETING 

Direct 

In our Direct business, we market and sell our products, principally Bowflex &#174; &#32;cardio and strength products, directly to consumers. While we are, and plan to continue to be, a large direct marketer of strength products in the United States, our advertising emphasis has shifted toward cardio products, especially the Max Trainer &#174; &#32;and TreadClimber &#174; , as cardio products represent the largest component of the fitness equipment market and a majority of our business. Sales of cardio products represented 93% &#32;of our Direct channel revenues in 2015 , compared to 91% &#32;in 2014 &#32;and 84% &#32;in 2013 . 

Our marketing efforts are based on an integrated combination of media and direct consumer contact. In addition to television advertising, which ranges in length from 30 seconds to as long as three minutes, we utilize Internet advertising, product websites, inquiry-response mailings, catalogs and inbound/outbound call centers. Marketing and media effectiveness is measured continuously based on sales inquiries generated, cost-per-lead, conversion rates, return on investment and other performance metrics and we strive to optimize the efficiency of our marketing and media expenditures based on this data. Almost all of our Direct customer orders are received either on our Internet websites or through company-owned and third-party call centers. 

In order to facilitate consumer purchases, we partner with several third party credit providers. Credit approval rates are an important variable in the number of Direct products we sell in a given period. Combined consumer credit approvals by our primary and secondary U.S. third-party financing providers increased to 48% &#32;in 2015 &#32;from 41% &#32;in 2014 &#32;and 36% &#32;in 2013 , which is primarily due to our marketing and media strategies, as well as growing sales of Max Trainer &#174; , which since launch has driven higher credit demographic responders. 

Retail 

In our Retail business, we market and sell a comprehensive line of consumer fitness equipment under the Nautilus &#174; , Octane Fitness &#174; , Schwinn &#174; , Universal &#174; &#32;and Bowflex &#174; &#32;brands. Our products are marketed through a network of retail companies, consisting of sporting goods stores, Internet retailers, large-format and warehouse stores, smaller specialty retailers, independent bike dealers, and multi-user environments. 

We offer programs that provide price discounts to our Retail customers for ordering container-sized shipments or placing orders early enough in the season to allow for more efficient manufacturing by our Asian suppliers. These programs are designed to reduce our shipping and handling costs, with much of the savings being passed on to our customers. In addition, we often offer other types of sales incentives to our Retail customers, including volume discounts and various forms of rebates or allowances, which generally are intended to increase product exposure and availability for consumers, reduce transportation costs, and encourage marketing and promotion of our brands or specific products. 

PRODUCT DESIGN AND INNOVATION 

Innovation is a vital part of our business, and we continue to expand and diversify our product offerings by leveraging our research and development capabilities. We constantly search for new technologies and innovations that will help us grow our business, either through higher sales or increased production efficiencies. To accomplish this objective, we seek out ideas and concepts both within our company and from outside inventors. 

We rely on financial and engineering models to assist us in assessing the potential operational and economic impacts of adopting new technologies and innovations. If we determine that a third-party technology or innovation concept meets certain technical and financial criteria, we may enter into a licensing arrangement to utilize the technology or, in certain circumstances, purchase the technology for our own use. Our product design and engineering teams also invest considerable effort to improve product design and quality. As a consumer-driven company, we invest from time-to-time in qualitative and quantitative consumer research to help us assess new product concepts, optimal features and anticipated consumer adoption. 

Our research and development expenses were $9.9 million , $7.2 million &#32;and $5.6 million &#32;in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively, as we increased our investment in new product development resources and capabilities, including the 2015 openings of our innovation center and retail store at our corporate headquarters. We expect our research and development expenses to increase in 2016 as we continue to supplement our investment in new product development and engineering capabilities. 

SEASONALITY 

We expect our sales from fitness equipment products to vary seasonally. Sales are typically strongest in the first and fourth quarters, followed by the third quarter, and are generally weakest in the second quarter. We believe that, during the spring and summer 

months, consumers tend to be involved in outdoor activities, including outdoor exercise, which impacts sales of indoor fitness equipment. This seasonality can have a significant effect on our inventory levels, working capital needs and resource utilization. 

&#160; 

MERCHANDISE SOURCING 

All of our products are produced by third-party manufacturers, and, in 2015 , all of our manufacturing partners were primarily located in Asia. Although multiple factories bid on and are able to produce most of our products, we typically select one factory to produce any given product. Lead times for inventory purchases from our Asian suppliers, from order placement to receipt of goods, generally range from approximately two to three months, of which transit time represents three-to-four weeks. The length of our lead times requires us to place advance manufacturing orders based on management forecasts of future demand for our products. We attempt to compensate for our long replenishment lead times by maintaining adequate levels of inventory at our warehousing facilities. 

We monitor our suppliers' ability to meet our product needs and we participate in quality assurance activities to reinforce adherence to our quality standards. Our third-party manufacturing contracts are generally of annual or shorter duration, or manufactured products are sourced on the basis of individual purchase orders. Our manufacturing relationships are non-exclusive, and we are permitted to procure our products from other sources at our discretion. None of our manufacturing contracts include production volume or purchase commitments on the part of either party. Our third-party manufacturers are responsible for the sourcing of raw materials and producing parts and finished products to our specifications. 

LOGISTICS 

Our warehousing and distribution facilities are located in Oregon and Ohio. In addition to Company-operated distribution centers, we utilize third-party warehouses and logistics providers to fulfill orders. In our Direct business, we strive to maintain inventory levels that will allow us to ship our products shortly after receiving a customer's order. We use common carriers for substantially all of our merchandise shipments to Direct customers. 

In our Retail business, we manage our inventory levels to accommodate anticipated seasonal changes in demand. Generally, we maintain higher inventory levels at the end of the third and fourth quarters to satisfy relatively higher consumer demand in the fourth and first quarters of each year. Many of our Retail customers place orders well in advance of peak periods of consumer demand to ensure an adequate supply for the anticipated selling season. 

In 2015 &#32;approximately 51% &#32;of our Retail customers' orders were shipped by our contract manufacturers in Asia directly to our Retail customer locations, typically in container loads. The use of such direct shipments allows us to maintain lower levels of inventory in our warehouses, resulting in lower storage, handling, freight, insurance and other costs. We use various commercial truck lines for our merchandise shipments to Retail customers. 

COMPETITION 

The markets for all of our products are highly competitive. We believe the principal competitive factors affecting our business are quality, brand recognition, innovation and pricing. We believe we are well positioned to compete in markets in which we can take advantage of our strong brand names, and that our focus on innovative product design, quality, and performance distinguishes our products from the competition. 

Our products compete directly with those offered by a large number of companies that market consumer fitness equipment and fitness programs. As the use of Internet websites for product sales by traditional retailers has increased, our competitors have become increasingly similar across our Direct and Retail sales channels. 

Our principal competitors include: Fitness Quest , ICON Health &#38; Fitness, Johnson Health Tech, Beach Body, American Telecast, Life Fitness, and Precor. We also compete with marketers of computer-based physical activity products, such as the Nintendo Wii &#174; &#32;and Microsoft Xbox &#174; &#32;Kinect &#174; , and weight management companies, such as Weight Watchers, each of which offers alternative solutions for a fit and healthy lifestyle. 

EMPLOYEES 

As of February 24, 2016, we had approximately 470 employees, substantially all of whom were full-time. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced a material interruption of our operations due to labor disputes. 

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 

Trademarks, patents and other forms of intellectual property are vital to the success of our business and are an essential factor in maintaining our competitive position in the health and fitness industry. 

Trademarks 

We own many trademarks including Nautilus &#174; , Bowflex &#174; , Max Trainer &#174; , TreadClimber &#174; , Power Rod &#174; , Bowflex Revolution &#174; , SelectTech &#174; , Octane Fitness &#174; , LateralX &#174; , xRide &#174; , Zero Runner &#174; , Airdyne &#174; , and Universal &#174; . Nautilus is the exclusive licensee under the Schwinn &#174; &#32;mark for indoor fitness products. We believe that having distinctive trademarks that are readily identifiable by consumers is an important factor in creating a market for our products, maintaining a strong company identity and developing brand loyalty among our customers. In addition, we have granted licenses to certain third-parties to use the Nautilus, Schwinn and TreadClimber trademarks on commercial fitness products, for which we receive royalty income and expanded consumer awareness of our brands. 

Each federally registered trademark is renewable indefinitely if the trademark is still in use at the time of renewal. 

Patents and Designs 

Building our intellectual property portfolio is an important factor in maintaining our competitive position in the health and fitness equipment industry. We have followed a policy of filing applications for U.S. and non-U.S. patents on utility and design inventions that we deem valuable to our business. 

We own or license patents and design registrations covering a variety of technologies, some of which are utilized in our selectorized dumbbells, treadmills, exercise bikes, and elliptical machines. Patent and design protection for these technologies, which are utilized in products sold in both the Direct and Retail segments, extends as far as 2028. 

We maintain a portfolio of patents related to our TreadClimber &#174; &#32;specialized cardio machines, which are sold primarily in our Direct segment. The portfolio includes approximately 25 issued U.S. patents covering various product features and other technologies associated with our TreadClimber &#174; &#32;products and 1 issued U.S. patent and additional pending patents covering various product features of our Max Trainer &#174; &#32;products. Nautilus is also the licensee of patents that cover the Bowflex Revolution &#174; &#32;home gyms. 

A patent covering certain aspects of our TreadClimber &#174; &#32;products expired in 2013. Additional individual U.S. patents covering elements of our TreadClimber &#174; &#32;products have expiration dates ranging from 2021 to 2027. Expiration or invalidity of patents within our TreadClimber &#174; &#32;portfolio could trigger the introduction of similar products by our competitors. Although we view each of the patents within our portfolio as valuable, we do not view any single patent as critical to our success or ability to differentiate our TreadClimber &#174; &#32;products from similar products that may be introduced by competitors in the future. We regularly monitor commercial activity in our industry to guard against potential infringement. We protect our proprietary rights and take prompt, reasonable actions to prevent counterfeit products and other infringement on our intellectual property. 

BACKLOG 

We define our customer order backlog to include firm orders for future shipment to our Retail customers, whether or not subject to cancellation, as well as unfulfilled consumer orders within the Direct segment. 

Backlog as of a given date fluctuates based on specific timing of product shipment within the typical shipment timeframes for each of our segments. Retail orders comprise the larger portion of our order backlog, while Direct orders comprise a smaller portion of our backlog due to shorter fulfillment timeframes. 

Our customer order backlog as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;was approximately $5.0 million &#32;and $21.1 million , respectively. The decrease in the overall backlog as of December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 resulted from delays in 2014 in the receipt of merchandise due to the west coast port slow down and lower inventory position. 

SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS 

In 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , Amazon.com accounted for 11.1% , 11.3% &#32;and 11.2% , respectively, of our net sales. 

ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER REGULATORY MATTERS 

Our operations are subject to various laws and regulations both domestically and abroad. In the United States, federal, state and local regulations impose standards on our workplace and our relationship with the environment. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Occupational Safety and Health Administration and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that may impact our operations. In particular, we are subject to legislation placing restrictions on our generation, emission, treatment, storage and disposal of materials, substances and wastes. Such legislation includes: the Toxic Substances Control Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the Safe Drinking Water Act; and the Comprehensive Environmental Response and the Compensation and Liability Act (also known as Superfund). We are also subject to the requirements of the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Federal Trade Commission, in addition to regulations concerning employee health and safety matters. 

Our operations and certain disposed components of our former Commercial business expose us to claims related to environmental matters. Although compliance with federal, state, local and international environmental legislation has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in the past, there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with such environmental matters in the future.
