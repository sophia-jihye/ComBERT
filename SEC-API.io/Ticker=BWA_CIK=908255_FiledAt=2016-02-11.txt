The Engine Segment's engine timing technology includes VCT with mid position lock, which allows a greater range of camshaft positioning thereby enabling greater control over airflow and the opportunity to improve fuel economy, reduce emissions and improve engine performance compared with conventional VCT systems. VCT with mid position lock made its debut on Subaru's Boxer&#174; 2.0 liter engine and is now on Hyundai's 3.0 to 3.8 liter six-cylinder engines and Ford's 5.0 liter eight-cylinder engine. 

The Engine Segment's emissions and systems products improve emissions performance and fuel economy. Products include electric air pumps and exhaust gas recirculation ("EGR") modules, EGR coolers, EGR tubes and EGR valves for gasoline and diesel applications. 

The Engine Segment's thermal systems products are designed to optimize engine temperatures and minimize parasitic horsepower losses, which improve engine efficiency, fuel economy and emissions performance. Products include viscous fan drives that sense and respond to multiple cooling requirements, polymer fans and coolant pumps. The Engine Segment has been awarded the "standard position" (the OEM-designated preferred supplier of component systems available to the end-customer) at several major global commercial vehicle OEMs. 

The Engine Segment's ignition systems products improve combustion efficiency for both diesel and gasoline engines. Products include glow plugs and instant starting systems that enhance combustion for diesel engines during cold starts, pressure sensor glow plugs that also monitor the combustion process of a diesel engine and advanced ignition technology for gasoline engines. 

On February 28, 2014, the Company acquired 100% &#32;of the equity interests in Gustav Wahler GmbH u. Co. KG and its general partner ("Wahler"). Wahler was a producer of EGR valves, EGR tubes and thermostats, and had operations in Germany, Brazil, the U.S., China and Slovakia. The Wahler acquisition 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#32;&#32;&#32; 

is expected to strengthen the Company's strategic position as a producer of complete EGR systems and create additional market opportunities in both passenger and commercial vehicle applications. 

The Company sold its tire pressure monitoring and spark plug businesses during the fourth quarter of 2011 and third quarter of 2012, respectively. The sale of these businesses will allow the Company to continue to focus on expanding BERU Systems' core products of glow plugs, diesel cold start systems and other gasoline ignition technologies. 

In 2009, the Company announced the purchase of advanced gasoline ignition technology and related intellectual property from Florida-based Etatech, Inc. The high-frequency ignition technology is expected to enable high-performing, lean-burning engines to significantly improve fuel economy and reduce emissions compared with conventional combustion technologies. 

Drivetrain 

The Drivetrain Segment develops and manufactures mechanical products for automatic transmissions and all-wheel drive ("AWD") vehicles and rotating electrical components for light and commercial vehicle OEMs and the aftermarket. Precise controls, better response times and minimal parasitic losses, all of which improve fuel economy and vehicle performance, are the core design features of the Drivetrain Segment's mechanical product portfolio, while meeting the demands of increasing vehicle electric loads, improved fuel efficiency, reduced weight and lowered electrical and mechanical noise are the core design features of its rotating electrical components portfolio. The Drivetrain Segment's mechanical products include friction, mechanical and controls products for automatic transmissions and torque management products for AWD vehicles, and its rotating electrical components include starter motors, alternators and hybrid electric motors. 

Friction and mechanical products for automatic transmissions include dual clutch modules, friction clutch modules, friction and steel plates, transmission bands, torque converter clutches, one-way clutches and torsional vibration dampers. Controls products for automatic transmissions feature electro-hydraulic solenoids for standard and high pressure hydraulic systems, transmission solenoid modules and dual clutch control modules. The Company's 50%-owned joint venture in Japan, NSK-Warner KK ("NSK-Warner"), is a leading producer of friction plates and one-way clutches in Japan and China. 

The Drivetrain Segment has led the globalization of today's dual clutch transmission ("DCT") technology for over 10 years. BorgWarner's award-winning DualTronic&#174; technology enables a conventional, manual gearbox to function as a fully automatic transmission by eliminating the interruption in power flow that occurs when shifting a single clutch manual transmission. The result is a smooth shifting automatic transmission with the fuel efficiency and driving experience of a manual gearbox. 

The Drivetrain Segment established its industry-leading position in 2003 with the production launch of its DualTronic&#174; innovations with VW/Audi, followed by program launches with Ford and BMW. In 2007, the Drivetrain Segment launched its first dual-clutch technology application in a Japanese transmission with Nissan. In 2008, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with China Automobile Development United Investment Company, a company owned by 12 leading Chinese automakers, to produce various DCT modules for the Chinese market. The Company owns 66% of the joint venture. In 2013, the Drivetrain Segment launched its first DCT application in a Chinese transmission with SAIC. The Drivetrain Segment is working on several other DCT programs with OEMs around the world. 

The Drivetrain Segment's torque management products include rear-wheel drive (&#8220;RWD&#8221;)-AWD transfer case systems, FWD-AWD coupling systems and cross-axle coupling systems. The Drivetrain Segment's focus is on developing electronically controlled torque management devices and systems that will benefit fuel economy and vehicle dynamics. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#32;&#32;&#32; 

Transfer cases are installed on RWD based light trucks, SUVs, cross-over utility vehicles, and passenger cars. A transfer case attaches to the transmission and distributes torque to the front and rear axles improving vehicle traction and stability in dynamic driving conditions. There are many variants of the Drivetrain Segment's transfer case technology in the market today, including Torque On-Demand (TOD&#174;), chain-driven, gear-driven, Pre-Emptive, Part-Time, 1-speed and 2-speed transfer cases. The Drivetrain Segment's transfer cases are featured on the Ford F-150 and on the Dodge Ram light-duty and heavy-duty trucks. 

The Drivetrain Segment is involved in the AWD market for FWD based vehicles with couplings that use electronically-controlled clutches to distribute power to the rear wheels as traction is required. The Drivetrain Segment's latest coupling innovation, the Centrifugal Electro-Hydraulic (&#8220;CEH&#8221;) Actuator, which is utilized to engage the clutches in the coupling, produces outstanding vehicle stability and traction while promoting better fuel economy with reduced weight. The CEH Actuator is found in the AWD couplings featured in several current FWD-AWD vehicles including the BMW X1, Range Rover Evoque, Volvo XC90 and VW Tiguan. 

In 2015, the Company acquired Remy International, Inc. (&#8220;Remy&#8221;), a global market leader in the design, manufacture, remanufacture and distribution of rotating electrical components for light and commercial vehicles, OEMs and the aftermarket. Principal products include starter motors, alternators and hybrid electric motors. The Company&#8217;s starter motors and alternators are used in gasoline, diesel, natural gas and alternative fuel engines for light vehicle, commercial vehicle, industrial, construction and agricultural applications. The product technology continues to evolve to meet the demands of increasing vehicle electrical loads, improved fuel efficiency, reduced weight and lowered electrical and mechanical noise. The Company&#8217;s hybrid electric motors are used in both light and commercial vehicles including construction, public transit and agricultural applications. These include both pure electric applications as well as hybrid applications, where the electric motors are combined with traditional gasoline or diesel propulsion systems. While the market for these systems is in early stages of development, BorgWarner&#8217;s technology and capabilities are ideally suited for this growing product category. 

The Company sells new starters, alternators and hybrid electric motors to OEMs globally for factory installation on new vehicles, and remanufactured and new starters and alternators to aftermarket customers and to OEMs for original equipment service. As a leading remanufacturer, BorgWarner obtains used starters and alternators, commonly referred to as cores, then disassembles, cleans, combines them with new subcomponents and reassembles them into saleable, finished products, which are tested to meet OEM requirements. 

In 2011, the Company acquired the Traction Systems division of Haldex Group, a leading provider of innovative AWD products for the global vehicle industry headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden. This acquisition has accelerated BorgWarner's growth in the global AWD market as it continues to shift toward FWD based vehicles. The acquisition adds industry leading AWD technologies for FWD based vehicles, with a strong European customer base, to BorgWarner's portfolio of front- and rear-wheel drive based products and enables BorgWarner to offer global customers a broader range of AWD solutions to meet their vehicle needs.

The Company's automotive products are generally sold directly to OEMs, substantially pursuant to negotiated annual contracts, long-term supply agreements or terms and conditions as may be modified by the parties. Deliveries are subject to periodic authorizations based upon OEM production schedules. The Company typically ships its products directly from its plants to the OEMs. 

Sales and Marketing 

Each of the Company's businesses within its two reporting segments has its own sales function. Account executives for each of our businesses are assigned to serve specific customers for one or more of a businesses' products. Our account executives spend the majority of their time in direct contact with customers' purchasing and engineering employees and are responsible for servicing existing business and for identifying and obtaining new business. Because of their close relationship with customers, account executives are able to identify and meet customers' needs based upon their knowledge of our products' design and manufacturing capabilities. Upon securing a new order, account executives participate in product launch team activities and serve as a key interface with customers. In addition, sales and marketing employees of our Engine and Drivetrain reporting segments often work together to explore cross-development opportunities where appropriate. 

Seasonality 

Our operations are directly related to the automotive industry. Consequently, we may experience seasonal fluctuations to the extent automotive vehicle production slows, such as in the summer months when many customer plants typically close for model year changeovers or vacations. Historically, model changeovers or vacations have generally resulted in lower sales volume in the third quarter. 

Research and Development 

The Company conducts advanced Engine and Drivetrain research at the reporting segment level. This advanced engineering function looks to leverage know-how and expertise across product lines to create new Engine and Drivetrain systems and modules that can be commercialized. This function manages a venture capital fund that was created by the Company as seed money for new innovation and collaboration across businesses. 

In addition, each of the Company's businesses within its two reporting segments has its own research and development (&#8220;R&#38;D&#8221;) organization, including engineers and technicians, engaged in R&#38;D activities at facilities worldwide. The Company also operates testing facilities such as prototype, measurement and calibration, life cycle testing and dynamometer laboratories. 

By working closely with the OEMs and anticipating their future product needs, the Company's R&#38;D personnel conceive, design, develop and manufacture new proprietary automotive components and systems. R&#38;D personnel also work to improve current products and production processes. The Company believes its commitment to R&#38;D will allow it to continue to obtain new orders from its OEM customers. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#32;&#32;&#32; 

The Company's net R&#38;D expenditures are included in selling, general and administrative expenses of the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Customer reimbursements are netted against gross R&#38;D expenditures as they are considered a recovery of cost. Customer reimbursements for prototypes are recorded net of prototype costs based on customer contracts, typically either when the prototype is shipped or when it is accepted by the customer. Customer reimbursements for engineering services are recorded when performance obligations are satisfied in accordance with the contract and accepted by the customer. Financial risks and rewards transfer upon shipment, acceptance of a prototype component by the customer or upon completion of the performance obligation as stated in the respective customer agreement.

The Company uses a variety of raw materials in the production of its automotive products including aluminum, copper, nickel, plastic resins, steel and certain alloy elements. Manufacturing operations for each of the Company's operating segments are dependent upon natural gas, fuel oil and electricity. 

The Company uses a variety of tactics in order to limit the impact of supply shortages and inflationary pressures. The Company's global procurement organization works to accelerate cost reductions, purchases from lower cost regions, rationalize the supply base, mitigate risk and collaborate on its buying activities. In addition, the Company uses long-term contracts, cost sharing arrangements, design changes, customer buy programs and limited financial instruments to help control costs. The Company intends to use similar measures in 2016 and beyond. Refer to Note 10, &#8220;Financial Instruments,&#8221; of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for information related to the Company's hedging activities. 

For 2016, the Company believes that its supplies of raw materials are adequate and available from multiple sources to support its manufacturing requirements.
