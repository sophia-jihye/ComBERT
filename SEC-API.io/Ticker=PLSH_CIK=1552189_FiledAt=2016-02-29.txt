Company Overview 

&#160;

Spiral Energy Tech, Inc. (f/k/a Solid Solar Energy, Inc.) (&#8220;Spiral&#8221;, &#8220;our&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was incorporated on January 18, 2008 in the State of Nevada as a for-profit company. On May 16, 2013, we filed a certificate of amendment to the Company&#8217;s amended and restated articles of incorporation to change our name to &#8220;Spiral Energy Tech., Inc.&#8221; from Solid Solar Energy, Inc. 

&#160;

On October 1, 2014, Spiral entered into a Merger Agreement with Fuse Science, Inc. (&#8220;Fuse&#8221;) and Acquisition Sub. Upon the closing of the Merger, Acquisition Sub merged with and into Spiral, and Spiral, as the surviving entity, became a 51% majority-owned subsidiary of Fuse. As a result of the Merger, among other effects, at the effective time of the Merger, (i) 51% of Spiral&#8217;s shares of common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (calculated on a pro rata basis among the shareholders of Spiral immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger) were automatically cancelled and retired and ceased to exist and certificates previously evidencing any such shares thereafter represented the right to receive an aggregate of 150,000,000 newly issued shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Fuse, or, at the election of any holder of Spiral common stock who, as a result of receiving shares of Fuse common stock in connection with the Merger would hold in excess of 4.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of Fuse common stock, shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Fuse; (ii) 49% of the Spiral shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (calculated on a pro rata basis among the shareholders of Spiral immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger) remained outstanding and (iii) the shares of common stock of Merger Sub, par value $0.0001 per share, held by Fuse immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Fuse, were converted into the right to receive an aggregate of 7,723,892 shares of Spiral, which at the time of the Merger represented 51% of Spiral&#8217;s issued and outstanding common stock. Subsequent to June 30, 2015, Fuse delivered shares of Spiral to third parties as payment for various costs and expenses. As a result of these transfers, as of the date hereof, Fuse holds less than 7.5% of Spiral&#8217;s current outstanding shares. 

&#160;

Our primary focus has been on developing and commercializing our proprietary SkyPorts drone support and Energy Demand Network (&#8220;EDEN&#8221;) technology. This technology seeks to permit a drone to operate predictably many miles outside of a &#8220;home range&#8221; limitation, defined by the drone&#8217;s finite battery power, by allowing for a flight path of numerous stops (or waypoints) at recharging stations along the way, thus extending the limit of the drone&#8217;s useful range. We have filed the following patent applications for technology related to SkyPorts and EDEN technology: US Provisional patent application No. 62/075,317; Drone Recharging Station and Method of Networking; and US Provisional patent application No. 62/145,216; Controlling Autonomous UAV Delivery Based Fleet Services 

&#160;

Also, we have been engaged in developing and commercializing our XTRAX (R) remote monitoring system, designed to measure the production of solar and other renewable energy systems and to enable transmission of the data via the cellular and radio frequency network (and potentially via microwave transmission network or satellite). On April 25, 2013, we purchased the patents and trademarks relating to the XTRAX (R) remote monitoring system from Carbon 612 Corporation and one of its creditors. On May 13, 2013, we entered into an agreement with a patent assertion entity, Endeavor IP, Inc. (&#8220;Endeavor&#8221;) pursuant to which we sold Endeavor the XTRAX (R) patents in exchange for $100,000 cash and shares of Endeavor common stock and obtained a perpetual, royalty-free, irrevocable, non-exclusive and worldwide license to develop, distribute and sell the products and services covered by the patents and to a portion of the revenues generated by patent enforcement activities. Currently, Spiral is not generate revenue from either its SkyPorts or EDEN drone technology or from the XTRAX (R) remote monitoring system. 

&#160;

&#160;

Business Strategy 

&#160;

Our core business strategy is to employ our technology in non-military, commercial drones, targeting the enthusiast and commercial application market sector. We intend to obtain revenues from partnerships and joint ventures with drone manufacturers and being compensated for customization, research and development of our technology. Our principal activities to date have been focused on design, research and development. 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we had no products available for sale. There can be no assurance that our technology will be commercially successful. In addition, we operate in an environment of rapid change in technology and are dependent upon the continued services of our current employees, consultants and subcontractors. 

&#160;

On January 29, 2016, Ezra Green resigned as our CEO and member of our board of directors (the &#8220;Board&#8221;). Concurrently with the resignation of Ezra Green, the Board appointed Elliot Maza, our current Chief Financial Officer, to serve as our new Chief Executive Officer and as a member of the Board. Mr. Maza, with the Board&#8217;s approval, has undertaken a strategic review of the Company&#8217;s operations and has recommended to the Board certain strategic alternatives for optimizing the Company&#8217;s asset portfolio, including divestiture of the current asset portfolio in favor of new lines of business. 

&#160;

Research and Development Costs 

&#160;

We have devoted substantially all of our efforts and resources to developing and commercializing our proprietary SkyPorts drone support and EDEN technology. Due to various uncertainties and risks, it is not possible to accurately predict future spending or time to completion by project or project category. Research and Development costs were $77,344 and $58,320 for the year ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. 

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The Company expects to face competition in its SkyPorts and drone support services. SkySense, Inc.&#8217;s Skysense Charging Pad, described as an indoor-outdoor remote-controlled charging station dock with electric power input that is compatible with a variety of drone platforms, is the only known device seeking to extend the battery range of electric commercial drones. We are not aware of other companies focused on recharge technology and autonomous flight being developed to extend the practical range of commercial drone use. 

&#160;

The Company expects to face competition in its XTRAX technology. Potential competitors include Centrosolar America, Inc.&#8217;s CentroData monitoring system for residential photovoltaic installations, which offers web-based monitoring; Energy, Inc.&#8217;s Power Track product, primarily directed to immediately detect any problem in a photovoltaic installation with immediate automated alerts to minimize downtime; Energy, Inc.&#8217;s DECK Monitoring, a basic residential meter that is focused on system performance; Locus Energy, LLC&#8217;s web-based residential meter that records performance data and stores it on a website for viewing by the homeowner or the homeowner&#8217;s installation contractor; and Energy, Inc.&#8217;s The Energy Detective lines of web-based meters, designed to measure and report the usage of electricity. 

&#160;

Many of the Company&#8217;s competitors are large with established businesses and have substantially greater resources than the Company does. 

&#160;

Government Regulation and Required Approvals 

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s SkyPort drone support technology is subject to regulation by the FAA. Under the present FAA regulations, the Company&#8217;s proposed business is limited to sales to local governments for law enforcement and other purposes. 

&#160;

On February 15, 2015, the FAA issued proposed regulations relating to small drones (under 55 pounds) conducting non-recreational operations. A proposed rule would limit flights to daylight only and visual line of sight operations. This latter limitation would severely hamper the Company&#8217;s proposed business, because it relies upon flying drones well beyond the visual line of sight where the Company&#8217;s technology would charge them to expand their reach. In its proposed release, the FAA asked for public comment and whether the rule should permit operations beyond line of sight and what limitations there should be. The proposed regulations will not apply to government aircraft operations which would continue to operate under exemptions issued by the FAA. 

&#160;

On March 23, 2015, the FAA announced that it has implemented an interim policy to speed up the exemption process for certain commercial operators. The process would allow flights below 200 feet using drones that weigh less than 55 pounds; however, no exemption would be granted unless the drones operated within visual line of sight and then only during daylight. The Company cannot predict what the final FAA regulations will be and how they will impact the Company&#8217;s proposed SkyPort drone support technology business. 

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s proposed XTRAX (R) operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations relating to worker safety, zoning, building and electrical codes, and the use, storage, discharge and disposal of environmentally sensitive materials. The Company believes that compliance with such laws, rules, regulations and requirements does not impose a material impediment on the Company&#8217;s ability to conduct business. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, Mr. Ezra Green, our former Chief Executive Officer, was our sole employee. On January 29, 2016, Ezra Green resigned as our CEO and member of our Board and the Board appointed Elliot Maza, currently our CFO, to serve as our new Chief Executive Officer and as a member of the Board. We do not have a written employment agreement or other formal compensation agreement with Mr. Maza. There are no other employees. 

&#160;

Outsourcing 

&#160;

We outsource our research and development activities. We believe that this outsourcing strategy is the optimal method for developing our products given our current and anticipated financial resources. 

&#160;

Marketing 

&#160;

We do not have an organization for the sales, marketing and distribution of our product candidates. Our core business strategy is to employ our technology in non-military, commercial drones, targeting the enthusiast and commercial application market sector by partnering with drone manufacturers and resellers. We do not intend to manufacture or market any products and do not anticipate a need for any manufacturing, sales, and marketing or distribution capabilities. 

&#160;

Insurance Coverage 

&#160;

We maintain General Liability Insurance.
