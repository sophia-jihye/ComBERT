Business Overview

Overview 

&#160;

Pollex, Inc., formerly Joytoto USA, Inc., formerly BioStem, Inc. (the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; and &#8220;us&#8221;) was incorporated on November 2, 2001, in the State of Nevada, as Web Views Corporation.

&#160;

We are a majority owned subsidiary of Joytoto Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Joytoto Korea&#8221;). We are determined to focus our efforts on our Online Games business by acquiring new game licenses and making such games commercially available in South Korea and the United States.

&#160;

Our principal executive offices are located at 2005 De La Cruz Blvd, Suite 142, Santa Clara, CA 95050. Our telephone number is (408) 350-7340.

&#160;

Products and Services 

&#160;

Our operations are focused on Online Games. We have acquired licenses from various online game developers to use in South Korea. Our Online Games business segment has generated $88,542 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.

&#160;

Our major online game business is The Great Merchant. The online game is operating at its website http://www.thegreatmerchant.com. The website operated in open beta testing on January 2010. The game opened for full commercial service on September 1, 2011. The Great Merchant is a free-to-play MMO (Massively Multiplayer Online) PC game. Players can download the game for free from our website and interact with other players in the game to trade, fight, and explore the game world. The game is set in 14th century Asia with Korea, China, Taiwan, and Japan as the main explorable countries. As a free-to-play game, the Great Merchant offers micro-transactions through PayPal which players can purchase in game currency (GP) to further their character and purchase items to increase their character&#8217;s abilities and in game looks. Additional purchase methods such as credit cards and mobile phone payments will be added in the future.

&#160;

Online Games 

&#160;

The Company operates The Great Merchant under a master leasing agreement with Joytoto Korea. The Great Merchant is an economic based MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game) online at http://www.thegreatmerchant.com. While the game is free to play and there is no cost for users to purchase and connect to the game, the game prompts the user to use micro transactions to purchase in-game points that can be used in the game to further the in-game operations of their own character. Unlike different MMORPGs on the market, the Great Merchant player can advance through the game by trading online items and virtual goods. 

&#160;

The Company entered into license agreements for 15 games for use in South Korea. These agreements allow the Company to release and service these games in South Korea. The Company opened one of these games in South Korea under open beta testing on March 16, 2011. Open Beta testing allows users and players to test the game while not implementing the full revenue generating service of the game. One of the games was recently launched commercially in July 14, 2012. During 2014, the Company decided to no longer utilize its licenses in South Korea and to focus on the Great Merchant and other gaming opportunities in the US. As such, the licenses were written off and an impairment of $70,000 was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2014.

Customer Service 

&#160;

We focus on retention of our current subscribers and believe our ability to establish and maintain long-term relationships with subscribers depends, in part, on the strength of our customer support and service operations. We utilize frequent communication and feedback from our subscribers to continually improve our website and our service. Our subscribers can communicate with our customer service representatives by email, telephone and in-game messages. We are focused on eliminating the need for customer support calls by automating certain self-service features on our website.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Marketing and Advertising 

&#160;

Our sales and marketing efforts are designed to attract visitors to our website and convert and retain them as paying subscribers in a cost effective manner. We will employ a multi-channel customer advertising strategy and market and advertise to potential subscribers through a combination of paid and unpaid sources. We believe that our paid marketing efforts are significantly enhanced by the benefits of word-of-mouth advertising and referrals by existing subscribers. We regularly monitor the effectiveness of our marketing efforts primarily by conducting surveys during our registration process. We use the survey results to actively manage our online and offline media and channel mix in order to improve the efficiency of our marketing expenditures.

&#160;

We are currently pursuing the following customer advertising activities:

&#160;

Online advertising . We will advertise online through search engines, advertising networks and partner websites. We use a pay-per-click spending model on search engines and pay-per-conversion model on our various online advertising, affiliate and partner networks, in order to match our costs with new customer additions.

&#160;

Word-of-mouth referrals . We believe that we have developed a loyal customer base, and new customers frequently indicate they have heard about us from existing customers.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

Our business is extremely competitive, particularly with respect to the online gaming marketplace. In addition, the market for the products we develop is subject to rapid technological change. We intend to compete with numerous online gaming companies, many of which have significantly greater financial, technical, and marketing resources than we do.

&#160;

In general, our products compete with other forms of entertainment for leisure time and discretionary spending of consumers. These other forms of entertainment include movies, television, music, online content and social media. For example, we have experienced significant increased competition from providers of premium casual games for smartphones. More specifically, the market for interactive entertainment products is highly competitive and relatively few products achieve significant market acceptance. We continue to face significant competition with respect to our products, which may also result in price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of market share. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, marketing and product development resources than we do.

&#160;

Current and future competitors may be able to:

&#160;

&#8226; respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer preferences; &#160;

&#8226; gain access to wider distribution channels; &#160;

&#8226; undertake more extensive marketing campaigns; &#160;

&#8226; adopt more aggressive pricing policies; &#160;

&#8226; devote greater resources to securing the rights to valuable licenses; &#160;

&#8226; develop stronger relationships with leading software developers; and &#160;

&#8226; make higher royalty payments; &#160;

Competitive factors such as the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business.

&#160;

Research and Development 

&#160;

We have not expended funds for research and development costs since inception.

&#160;

Distribution 

&#160;

As our game licenses are distributed as free-to-play, there is no need for brick and mortar distribution channels. We will be distributing our games through online marketing channels, digital distribution outlets, PC gaming portals, social media sites to increase our core audience. Usage of online marketing tools such as pay per click and pay per view advertising on online channels and platforms will be used to grow and maintain our current user base.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;
