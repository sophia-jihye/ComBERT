Business 

General 

We are an independent crude oil and natural gas company with properties in the North, South and East regions of the United States. The North region consists of properties north of Kansas and west of the Mississippi River and includes North Dakota Bakken, Montana Bakken, and the Red River units. The South region includes all properties south of Kansas and west of the Mississippi River including various plays in the SCOOP (South Central Oklahoma Oil Province), STACK (Sooner Trend Anadarko Canadian Kingfisher), Northwest Cana and Arkoma Woodford areas of Oklahoma. The East region is comprised of undeveloped leasehold acreage east of the Mississippi River with no current drilling or production operations. 

We were originally formed in 1967 to explore for, develop and produce crude oil and natural gas properties. Through the late 1980s, our activities and growth remained focused primarily in Oklahoma. In the late 1980s, we expanded our activity into the North region, where a substantial portion of our operations is now concentrated due to our successful leasing and drilling activities in the Bakken field. The North region comprised approximately 68% &#32;of our crude oil and natural gas production and approximately 77% &#32;of our crude oil and natural gas revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 . Approximately 58% &#32;of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2015 &#32;are located in the North region. In recent years, we have significantly expanded our activity in our South region resulting from our discovery of the SCOOP play and our increased activity in the Northwest Cana and STACK plays, all of which are located in Oklahoma. Our South region comprised approximately 32% &#32;of our crude oil and natural gas production, 23% &#32;of our crude oil and natural gas revenues, and 42% &#32;of our estimated proved reserves as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 . 

We have focused our operations on the exploration and development of crude oil since the 1980s. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , crude oil accounted for approximately 66% &#32;of our total production and approximately 85% &#32;of our crude oil and natural gas revenues. Crude oil represents approximately 57% &#32;of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2015 . 

We focus our exploration activities in large new or developing crude oil and liquids-rich natural gas plays that provide us the opportunity to acquire undeveloped acreage positions for future drilling operations. We have been successful in targeting large repeatable resource plays where three dimensional seismic, horizontal drilling, geosteering technologies, advanced completion technologies (e.g., fracture stimulation) and enhanced recovery technologies allow us to develop and produce crude oil and natural gas reserves from unconventional formations. As a result of these efforts, we have grown substantially through the drill bit. 

As of December 31, 2015 , our estimated proved reserves were 1,226 &#32;MMBoe, with estimated proved developed reserves of 525 &#32;MMBoe, or 43% &#32;of our total estimated proved reserves. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , we generated crude oil and natural gas revenues of $ 2.6 &#32;billion and operating cash flows of $1.9 billion . For the year ended December 31, 2015 , production averaged 221,715 &#32;Boe per day, a 27% &#32;increase over average production of 174,189 Boe per day for the year ended December 31, 2014 . Average daily production for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 &#32;increased 16% &#32;to 224,936 &#32;Boe per day from 193,456 Boe per day for the quarter ended December 31, 2014 . 

The table below summarizes our total estimated proved reserves, PV-10 and net producing wells as of December 31, 2015 , average daily production for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and the reserve-to-production index in our principal operating areas. The PV-10 values shown below are not intended to represent the fair market value of our crude oil and natural gas properties. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors &#32;and &#8220;Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates&#8221; in Part II, Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition of this report for further discussion of uncertainties inherent in the reserve estimates. &#160;

PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure and generally differs from Standardized Measure, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, because it does not include the effects of income taxes on future net revenues of approximately $1.5 billion . Neither PV-10 nor Standardized Measure represents an estimate of the fair market value of our crude oil and natural gas properties. We and others in the crude oil and natural gas industry use PV-10 as a measure to compare the relative size and value of proved reserves held by companies without regard to the specific income tax characteristics of such entities.

The Annualized Reserve/Production Index is the number of years that estimated proved reserves would last assuming current production continued at the same rate. This index is calculated by dividing annualized fourth quarter 2015 &#32;production into estimated proved reserve volumes as of December 31, 2015 . 

Industry Operating Environment and Outlook 

Crude oil prices remained significantly depressed in 2015 and face continued downward pressure due to domestic and global supply and demand factors. The downward price pressure intensified in late 2015 and early 2016, with crude oil prices dropping below $27 &#32;per barrel in February 2016, a level not seen since 2003. Natural gas prices faced similar downward pressure in 2015, dropping below $1.70 &#32;per MMBtu in December 2015. 

In response to these price declines, and given the uncertainty regarding the timing and magnitude of any price recovery, we have significantly reduced our planned non-acquisition capital spending for 2016 to $920 million , a reduction of 63% &#32;compared to $2.50 billion &#32;of non-acquisition capital spending in 2015. This non-acquisition investment level is designed to target capital expenditures and cash flows being relatively balanced for 2016 at an assumed average West Texas Intermediate benchmark crude oil price of approximately $37 per barrel for the year, with any cash flow deficiencies being funded by borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Our reduced spending is projected to result in a decrease in our 2016 average daily production of approximately 10% &#32;compared to 2015. 

With reduced capital spending planned for 2016, we will be growing our drilled but uncompleted ("DUC") well inventory. Our DUC inventory in North Dakota is expected to increase from 135 gross operated wells at December 31, 2015 to approximately 195 gross operated wells at year-end 2016. Our DUC inventory in Oklahoma is expected to increase from 35 gross operated wells at December 31, 2015 to approximately 50 gross operated wells at year-end 2016. We will continue to monitor our capital spending closely based on actual and projected cash flows and could make additional reductions to our 2016 capital spending should commodity prices decrease further. Conversely, a significant improvement in commodity prices could result in an increase in our capital expenditures. 

In light of the challenges facing our industry, our primary business strategies for 2016 will include: (1) optimizing cash flows through operating efficiencies and cost reductions, (2) high-grading investments based on rates of return and opportunities to convert undeveloped acreage to acreage held by production, and (3) working to balance capital spending with cash flows to 

minimize new borrowings and maintain ample liquidity, as elaborated upon in the subsequent section titled Our Business Strategy . 

See the section below titled Summary of Crude Oil and Natural Gas Properties and Projects &#32;for further discussion of our 2016 plans. Also see Part II, Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#32;for discussion of our 2015 operating results and potential impact on 2016 operating results due to depressed commodity prices. 

Our Business Strategy 

Despite a reduced capital budget for 2016 that is reflective of the current commodity price environment, our business strategy continues to be focused on increasing shareholder value by finding and developing crude oil and natural gas reserves at costs that provide attractive rates of return. The principal elements of this strategy include: 

Growing and sustaining a premier portfolio of assets focused on high rate-of-return projects. &#32;&#32;We hold a portfolio of leasehold acreage and drilling opportunities in certain premier U.S. resource plays with varying exposure to crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids. We pursue opportunities to develop our existing properties as well as explore for new resource plays where significant reserves may be economically developed. Our capital programs are designed to allocate investments to projects that provide opportunities to convert undeveloped acreage to acreage held by production and to maximize hydrocarbon recoveries and rates of return on capital employed. Our operations are primarily focused on the exploration and development of crude oil, but we also allocate capital to liquids-rich natural gas areas that provide attractive rates of return. 

Optimizing cash flows through operating efficiencies, cost reductions, and enhanced completions. We continue to manage through the current commodity price downturn by focusing on improving operating efficiencies and reducing costs. Our key operating areas are characterized by large acreage positions in select unconventional resource plays with multiple stacked geologic formations that provide repeatable drilling opportunities and resource potential. We operate a majority of our wells and leasehold acreage and believe the concentration of our operated assets allows us to leverage our technical expertise and manage the development of our properties to achieve cost reductions through operating efficiencies and economies of scale. 

In 2015, we achieved large efficiency gains in various aspects of our business, including reductions in spud-to-total depth drilling times and average days to drill horizontal laterals, which translated into substantial reductions in drilling costs in our core areas. Our drilling and completion costs for most operated wells declined on average approximately 25% &#32;in 2015 due to operational efficiency gains and lower service costs. In addition to lowering our drilling and completion costs, we also optimize cash flows through the use of enhanced completion technologies. In North Dakota, we are optimizing cash flows through enhanced completions using new hybrid and slickwater designs, which have increased 90-day production rates between 35% and 50% on average. In Oklahoma, we are optimizing cash flows using enhanced completions that target optimum sand and fluid combinations. Initial results from our 2015 activities are encouraging, and we expect most of our 2016 well completions in Oklahoma will use enhanced completion methods. 

Maintaining financial flexibility and a strong balance sheet . Maintaining a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity are key components of our business strategy. For 2016, we will continue our focus on preserving financial flexibility and ample liquidity as we manage the risks facing our industry. Our 2016 capital budget is reflective of decreased commodity prices and has been established based on an expectation of available cash flows, with any cash flow deficiencies expected to be funded by borrowings under our revolving credit facility. As we have done historically to preserve or enhance liquidity we may adjust our capital program throughout the year, divest non-strategic assets, or enter into strategic joint ventures. 

Focusing on organic growth through disciplined capital investments . Although we consider various growth opportunities, including property acquisitions, our primary focus is on organic growth through leasing and drilling in our core areas where we can best exploit our extensive inventory of repeatable drilling opportunities to achieve attractive rates of return. From January 1, 2011 &#32;through December 31, 2015 , our proved reserve additions through organic extensions and discoveries were 1,534 MMBoe compared to 86 MMBoe of proved reserve acquisitions during that same period. 

Our Business Strengths 

We have a number of strengths to help us manage through the current commodity price downturn and execute our business strategy, including the following: 

Large Acreage Inventory . We held approximately 1.19 million &#32;net undeveloped acres and 1.15 million &#32;net developed acres under lease in certain premier U.S. resource plays as of December 31, 2015 . Approximately 59% &#32;of our net undeveloped acres are located within unconventional resource plays in the Bakken, SCOOP, Northwest Cana, STACK and Arkoma Woodford areas. We have developed sizable acreage positions in our core operating areas and believe the concentration of our assets allows us to achieve operating efficiencies and reduce costs through economies of scale. We are among the largest leaseholders 

in the Bakken and SCOOP plays with approximately 1.05 million &#32;net acres and 439,800 &#32;net acres under lease in those respective plays at December 31, 2015 . Being an early entrant in the Bakken and SCOOP plays has allowed us to capture significant acreage positions in core parts of the plays. 

Expertise with Horizontal Drilling and Enhanced Completion Methods . We have substantial experience with horizontal drilling and enhanced completion methods and continue to be among the industry leaders in the use of new drilling and completion technologies. We continue to optimize drilling and completion efficiencies through the use of multi-well pad drilling in our operating areas. Further, we are among industry leaders in extending lateral drilling lengths. Results to date indicate longer laterals have a positive impact on well productivity and economics. We have also been among industry leaders in testing enhanced completion technologies involving various combinations of fluid types, proppant types and volumes, and stimulation stage lengths to determine optimal methods for maximizing crude oil recoveries and rates of return. We continually refine our drilling and completion techniques in an effort to deliver improved results across our properties. 

Control Operations Over a Substantial Portion of Our Assets and Investments . As of December 31, 2015 , we operated properties comprising 87% &#32;of our total proved reserves and 83% &#32;of our PV-10. By controlling a significant portion of our operations, we are able to more effectively manage the cost and timing of exploration and development of our properties, including the drilling and completion methods used. 

Experienced Management Team . Our senior management team has extensive expertise in the oil and gas industry. Our Chief Executive Officer, Harold G. Hamm, began his career in the oil and gas industry in 1967. Our 9 senior officers have an average of 34 years of oil and gas industry experience. 

Financial Position and Liquidity . We have a revolving credit facility with lender commitments totaling $2.75 billion &#32;which may be increased up to a total of $4.0 billion upon agreement with participating lenders to provide additional liquidity if needed to take advantage of business opportunities and fund our capital program and commitments. We had approximately $1.9 billion &#32;of available borrowing capacity under our credit facility at February 19, 2016 &#32;after considering outstanding borrowings and letters of credit. We have no near-term debt maturities, with our earliest maturity being a $500 million term loan due in November 2018. 

Our credit facility is unsecured and does not have a borrowing base requirement that is subject to periodic redetermination based on changes in commodity prices and proved reserves. Additionally, downgrades or other negative rating actions with respect to our credit rating do not trigger a reduction in our current credit facility commitments, nor do such actions trigger a security requirement or change in covenants. Downgrades of our credit rating will, however, trigger increases in our credit facility's interest rates and commitment fees paid on unused borrowing availability under certain circumstances. 

In November 2015, we completed transactions that increased our lender commitments under our revolving credit facility and refinanced a portion of our credit facility borrowings to an unsecured three-year term loan with a lower interest rate. These transactions enhanced our liquidity and reduced our interest expense. 

Crude Oil and Natural Gas Operations 

Proved Reserves 

Proved reserves are those quantities of crude oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates renewal is reasonably certain. In connection with the estimation of proved reserves, the term &#8220;reasonable certainty&#8221; implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of crude oil and/or natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. To achieve reasonable certainty, our internal reserve engineers and Ryder Scott Company, L.P (&#8220;Ryder Scott&#8221;), our independent reserve engineers, employed technologies that have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability. The technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves include, but are not limited to, well logs, geologic maps including isopach and structure maps, analogy and statistical analysis, and available downhole and production data, seismic data and well test data. 

The following table sets forth our estimated proved crude oil and natural gas reserves and PV-10 by reserve category as of December 31, 2015 . The total Standardized Measure of discounted cash flows as of December 31, 2015 &#32;is also presented. Our reserve estimates as of December 31, 2015 &#32;are based primarily on a reserve report prepared by Ryder Scott. In preparing its report, Ryder Scott evaluated properties representing approximately 99% &#32;of our PV-10, 99% &#32;of our proved crude oil reserves, and 97% &#32;of our proved natural gas reserves as of December 31, 2015 . Our internal technical staff evaluated the remaining properties. A copy of Ryder Scott&#8217;s summary report is included as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. &#160; 

Our estimated proved reserves and related future net revenues, PV-10 and Standardized Measure at December 31, 2015 &#32;were determined using the 12-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month commodity prices for the period of January 2015 &#32;through December 2015 , without giving effect to derivative transactions, and were held constant throughout the lives of the properties. These prices were $50.28 &#32;per Bbl for crude oil and $2.58 &#32;per MMBtu for natural gas ( $41.63 &#32;per Bbl for crude oil and $2.35 &#32;per Mcf for natural gas adjusted for location and quality differentials).

Revisions of previous estimates. Revisions represent changes in previous reserve estimates, either upward or downward, resulting from new information normally obtained from development drilling and production history or resulting from a change in economic factors, such as commodity prices, operating costs, or development costs. 

Commodity prices decreased significantly in 2015. The 12-month average price for crude oil decreased 47% from $94.99 per Bbl for 2014 to $50.28 &#32;per Bbl for 2015, while the 12-month average price for natural gas decreased 41% from $4.35 per MMBtu for 2014 to $2.58 &#32;per MMBtu for 2015. These decreases shortened the economic lives of certain producing properties and caused certain exploration and development projects to become uneconomic which had an adverse impact on our proved reserve estimates, resulting in downward reserve revisions of 185 &#32;MMBo and 391 &#32;Bcf (totaling 251 &#32;MMBoe) in 2015. We may experience additional downward reserve revisions as a result of prices in 2016 if the currently depressed price environment for crude oil and natural gas persists or worsens. 

In response to the continued decrease in commodity prices throughout 2015, we have further refined our drilling program and reduced our planned rig count to concentrate our efforts in our core areas of North Dakota and Oklahoma that provide the best opportunities to improve recoveries and rates of return. The refinement of our drilling program contributed to the removal of PUD reserves no longer scheduled to be developed within five years from the date in which they were first booked. One factor leading to the removal is an increased emphasis on multi-well pad drilling in the Bakken, which resulted in the removal of PUDs in certain areas in favor of PUDs more likely to be developed with pad drilling where operating efficiencies may be realized. Further, in the SCOOP play we removed certain PUD locations originally planned to be developed with standard lateral drilling lengths in favor of PUDs to be developed with extended length laterals in similar locations. Longer laterals are believed to have a positive impact on well productivity and economics. The combination of these and other factors resulted in 

the removal of 65 &#32;MMBo and 197 &#32;Bcf (totaling 98 &#32;MMBoe) of PUD reserves in 2015. These removals do not necessarily represent the elimination of recoverable hydrocarbons physically in place. In some instances the removed reserves may be developed in the future in the event of a favorable change in commodity prices and an expansion of our capital expenditure budget. 

Additionally, changes in anticipated production performance on certain properties resulted in 63 MMBo of downward revisions to crude oil proved reserves and 125 Bcf of upward revisions to natural gas proved reserves (netting to 42 MMBoe of downward revisions) in 2015. 

The downward revisions described above were partially offset by upward revisions in 2015 due to lower operating costs being realized in conjunction with depressed commodity prices and improvements in operating efficiencies as well as other factors. 

Extensions, discoveries and other additions. These are additions to our proved reserves that result from (i) extension of the proved acreage of previously discovered reservoirs through additional drilling in periods subsequent to discovery and (ii) discovery of new fields with proved reserves or of new reservoirs of proved reserves in old fields. Extensions, discoveries and other additions for each of the three years reflected in the table above were primarily due to increases in proved reserves associated with our successful drilling activity in the Bakken field and SCOOP play. Proved reserve additions from our drilling activities in the Bakken totaled 96 MMBoe, 222 MMBoe and 276 MMBoe for 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively, while reserve additions in SCOOP totaled 93 MMBoe, 208 MMBoe and 158 MMBoe for 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. Additionally, extensions and discoveries in 2015 were significantly impacted by successful drilling results in the Northwest Cana/STACK area, resulting in proved reserve additions of 57 MMBoe in 2015 . See the subsequent section titled Summary of Crude Oil and Natural Gas Properties and Projects &#32;for a discussion of our 2015 &#32;drilling activities. We expect a significant portion of future reserve additions will come from our major development projects in the Bakken, SCOOP, and Northwest Cana/STACK areas. 

Sales of minerals in place. &#32;These are reductions to proved reserves resulting from the disposition of properties during a period. See Part II, Item 8. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212;Note 14. Property Dispositions &#32;for further discussion of notable dispositions. We may continue to seek opportunities to sell non-strategic properties if and when we have the ability to dispose of such assets at favorable terms. 

Purchases of minerals in place. These are additions to proved reserves resulting from the acquisition of properties during a period. We have had no significant mineral purchases in the past three years. However, we may participate as a buyer of properties when and if we have the ability to increase our position in strategic plays at favorable terms. 

Proved Undeveloped Reserves 

All of our PUD reserves at December 31, 2015 &#32;are located in the Bakken, SCOOP, and Northwest Cana/STACK plays, our most active development areas, with those plays comprising 51%, 40%, and 9%, respectively, of our total PUD reserves at year-end 2015 . The following table provides information regarding changes in our PUD reserves for the year ended December 31, 2015 . Our PUD reserves at December 31, 2015 &#32;include 91 MMBoe of reserves associated with operated drilled but uncompleted wells. &#160;

Revisions of previous estimates. During the year ended December 31, 2015 , we removed 1,225 gross (689 net) PUD locations, which resulted in the removal of 65 &#32;MMBo and 197 &#32;Bcf (totaling 98 &#32;MMBoe) of PUD reserves. These removals were due to the continued decrease in commodity prices during 2015, particularly in late 2015, and resulting refinement of our drilling program to place greater emphasis on core areas of the Bakken, SCOOP and Northwest Cana/STACK areas that provide the best opportunities to improve recoveries and rates of return, with increased focus on areas capable of being developed through the use of multi-well pad drilling and extended length laterals. These and other factors contributed to the removal of PUD 

reserves in certain areas having less attractive rates of return, are less likely to be developed using pad drilling or extended laterals, or are otherwise no longer scheduled to be developed within five years of the date in which they were initially booked. 

Also as a result of decreased commodity prices, certain exploration and development projects became uneconomic which had an adverse impact on our PUD reserve estimates, resulting in downward revisions of 131 MMBo and 301 Bcf (totaling 181 &#32;MMBoe) in 2015. 

Additionally, changes in anticipated production performance on producing properties having offsetting PUD locations resulted in 46 MMBo of downward revisions to crude oil PUD reserves and 121 Bcf of upward revisions to natural gas PUD reserves (netting to 26 MMBoe of downward revisions) in 2015. 

The downward revisions described above were partially offset by upward revisions in 2015 due to lower operating costs being realized on producing properties having offsetting PUD locations in conjunction with depressed commodity prices and improvements in operating efficiencies as well as other factors. 

Extensions and discoveries. Extensions and discoveries were primarily due to increases in PUD reserves associated with our successful drilling activity in the Bakken, SCOOP and Northwest Cana/STACK areas. PUD reserve additions in the Bakken totaled 65 MMBo and 109 Bcf (totaling 83 MMBoe) in 2015 , SCOOP PUD reserve additions totaled 28 MMBo and 248 Bcf (totaling 69 MMBoe), and Northwest Cana/STACK PUD reserve additions totaled 19 MMBo and 190 Bcf (totaling 50 MMBoe). See the subsequent section titled Summary of Crude Oil and Natural Gas Properties and Projects &#32;for a discussion of our 2015 &#32;drilling activities in these areas. 

Conversion to proved developed reserves. In 2015 , we developed approximately 18% of our PUD locations and 10% of our PUD reserves booked as of December 31, 2014 &#32;through the drilling of 526 gross (165 net) development wells at an aggregate capital cost of approximately $1.0 billion. In the second half of 2015, we accelerated the reduction of our capital spending and well completion activities in response to the continued decrease in commodity prices, which resulted in our 2015 capital spending being approximately $200 million below budget. These actions adversely impacted our conversion of PUD reserves to proved developed reserves during the year. 

Development plans. &#32;We have acquired substantial leasehold positions in the Bakken, SCOOP and Northwest Cana/STACK plays. Our drilling programs to date in those areas have focused on proving our undeveloped leasehold acreage through strategic drilling, thereby increasing the amount of leasehold acreage in the secondary term of the lease with no further drilling obligations (i.e., categorized as held by production) and resulting in a reduced amount of leasehold acreage in the primary term of the lease. Going forward, while we may opportunistically drill strategic exploratory wells, the majority of our capital expenditures will be focused on developing our PUD locations given the current commodity price environment. Estimated future development costs relating to the development of PUD reserves are projected to be approximately $0.8 billion in 2016 , $0.9 billion in 2017 , $1.4 billion in 2018 , $2.0 billion in 2019 , and $1.4 billion in 2020 . These capital expenditure projections are reflective of the significant decrease in commodity prices during the year and have been established based on an expectation of available cash flows and availability under our revolving credit facility. Development of our existing PUD reserves at December 31, 2015 &#32;is expected to occur within five years of the date of initial booking of the PUDs. PUD reserves not expected to be developed within five years of initial booking because of depressed commodity prices or for other reasons have been removed from our reserves at December 31, 2015 . We had no PUD reserves at December 31, 2015 &#32;that remained undeveloped beyond five years from the date of initial booking. 

Qualifications of Technical Persons and Internal Controls Over Reserves Estimation Process 

Ryder Scott, our independent reserves evaluation consulting firm, estimated, in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles and definitions and guidelines established by the SEC, 99% &#32;of our PV-10, 99% &#32;of our proved crude oil reserves, and 97% &#32;of our proved natural gas reserves as of December 31, 2015 &#32;included in this Form 10-K. The Ryder Scott technical personnel responsible for preparing the reserve estimates presented herein meet the requirements regarding qualifications, independence, objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. Refer to Exhibit 99 included with this Form 10-K for further discussion of the qualifications of Ryder Scott personnel. 

We maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals who work closely with our independent reserve engineers to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of data furnished to Ryder Scott in their reserves estimation process. In the fourth quarter, our technical team is in contact regularly with representatives of Ryder Scott to review properties and discuss methods and assumptions used in Ryder Scott&#8217;s preparation of the year-end reserve estimates. Proved reserve information is reviewed by our Audit Committee with representatives of Ryder Scott and by our internal technical staff before the information is filed with the SEC on Form 10-K. Additionally, certain members of our senior management review and 

approve the Ryder Scott reserve report and on a semi-annual basis review any internally estimated significant changes to our proved reserves. 

Our Vice President&#8212;Corporate Reserves is the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our reserve estimates. He has a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering, an MBA in Finance and 31 years of industry experience with positions of increasing responsibility in operations, acquisitions, engineering and evaluations. He has worked in the area of reserves and reservoir engineering most of his career and is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers. The Vice President&#8212;Corporate Reserves reports directly to our President and Chief Operating Officer. The reserve estimates are reviewed and approved by the President and Chief Operating Officer and certain other members of senior management. 

Proved Reserve and PV-10 Sensitivities 

Our year-end 2015 &#32;proved reserve and PV-10 estimates were prepared using 2015 average prices of $50.28 &#32;per Bbl for crude oil and $2.58 &#32;per MMBtu for natural gas. Commodity prices existing in February 2016 are lower than the 2015 average prices. If commodity prices do not increase from current levels, our future calculations of estimated proved reserves and PV-10 will be based on lower prices which could result in the removal of then uneconomic reserves from our proved reserves in future periods. 

Provided below are sensitivities illustrating the potential impact on our estimated proved reserves and PV-10 at December 31, 2015 &#32;under different pricing scenarios for crude oil and natural gas. In these sensitivities, all factors other than the commodity price assumption have been held constant for each well. These sensitivities are only meant to demonstrate the impact that changing commodity prices may have on estimated proved reserves and PV-10 and there is no assurance these outcomes will be realized. 

The crude oil price sensitivities provided below show the impact on proved reserves and PV-10 under various crude oil price scenarios, with natural gas prices being held constant at the 2015 average price of $2.58 &#32;per MMBtu. 

&#32; 

The natural gas price sensitivities provided below show the impact on proved reserves and PV-10 under various natural gas price scenarios, with crude oil prices being held constant at the 2015 average price of $50.28 &#32;per Bbl.

As of December 31, 2015 , there were 417 gross (178 net) operated and non-operated wells that have been spud and are in the process of drilling, completing or waiting on completion. 

For 2016, we plan to operate an average of approximately 19 &#32;drilling rigs for the year. Our rig activity for 2016 &#32;will depend on crude oil and natural gas prices and potential drilling efficiency gains and, accordingly, our rig count may increase or decrease from planned levels. As a result of the significant decrease in commodity prices, the number of providers of materials and services has decreased in the regions where we operate. As a result, the likelihood of experiencing shortages of materials and services may be increased in connection with any period of commodity price recovery. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212;The unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel and oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans within budget and on a timely basis. 

Summary of Crude Oil and Natural Gas Properties and Projects 

In the following discussion, we review our budgeted number of wells and capital expenditures for 2016 &#32;in our key operating areas. Our 2016 &#32;capital budget is reflective of the depressed commodity price environment and has been established based on an expectation of available cash flows. If cash flows are materially impacted by a further decline in commodity prices, we have the ability to reduce our capital expenditures or utilize the availability of our revolving credit facility if needed to fund our operations. Conversely, higher cash flows resulting from an increase in commodity prices could result in increased capital expenditures. 

The following table provides information regarding well counts and 2016 budgeted capital expenditures by operating area. &#160;

Represents wells expected to be drilled, completed, and producing in 2016 and excludes an expected increase in our drilled but uncompleted well inventory of 75 gross (47 net) wells during the year. 

North Region 

Our properties in the North region represented 63% of our PV-10 as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 66% of our average daily Boe production for the fourth quarter of 2015 . Our average daily production from such properties was 148,911 Boe per day for the fourth quarter of 2015 , an increase of 3% over the comparable 2014 &#32;period. Our principal producing properties in the North region are located in the Bakken field and the Red River units. 

Bakken Field 

The Bakken field of North Dakota and Montana is one of the premier crude oil resource plays in the United States. We are a leading producer, leasehold owner and operator in the Bakken. As of December 31, 2015 , we controlled one of the largest leasehold positions in the Bakken with approximately 1.71 million gross (1.05 million net) acres under lease. 

Our total Bakken production averaged 136,355 Boe per day during the fourth quarter of 2015 , up 4% from the 2014 &#32;fourth quarter due to additional drilling and completion activity. Despite depressed commodity prices in 2015, we continued to make progress with our Bakken drilling program during the year which was almost entirely focused in North Dakota. Our 2015 drilling activity in North Dakota focused on the continued development of de-risked, higher rate-of-return areas in core parts of the play and the testing of various enhanced completion technologies to determine optimal methods for maximizing crude oil recoveries and rates of return. 

In 2015 , we completed 650 gross (181 net) wells in the Bakken. Our Bakken properties represented 56% of our PV-10 at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 61% of our average daily Boe production for the 2015 &#32;fourth quarter. Our total proved Bakken field reserves as of December 31, 2015 &#32;were 663 &#32;MMBoe, which represents a decrease of 23% compared to December 31, 2014 &#32;due in part to downward reserve revisions in 2015 prompted by lower commodity prices and changes in drilling plans. Our inventory of proved undeveloped locations totaled 1,292 gross (705 net) wells as of December 31, 2015 . 

As of December 31, 2015 , we operated eight &#32; rigs in the Bakken, all in North Dakota, which we subsequently decreased to four operated rigs in early 2016. We plan to average approximately four &#32; operated rigs in North Dakota Bakken throughout 2016 . We plan to operate fewer rigs in North Dakota Bakken in 2016 &#32;compared to 2015 &#32;as part of our efforts to align our 2016 &#32;capital expenditures with cash flows in response to the continued decrease in crude oil prices in late 2015 and early 2016. 

In 2016 , we plan to invest approximately $320 million &#32;to drill, complete and initiate production on 127 &#32;gross ( 26 &#32;net) wells in North Dakota Bakken. Our 2016 &#32;drilling program will focus on drilling de-risked acreage in core parts of the play that provide opportunities for converting undeveloped acreage to acreage held by production, increasing capital efficiency, reducing finding and development costs, and maximizing rates of return. 

Red River Units 

The Red River units are comprised of nine units located along the Cedar Creek Anticline in North Dakota, South Dakota and Montana that produce crude oil and natural gas from the Red River &#8220;B&#8221; formation. Our principal producing properties in the Red River units include the Cedar Hills units in North Dakota and Montana, the Medicine Pole Hills units in North Dakota, and the Buffalo Red River units in South Dakota. Our properties in the Red River units comprise a portion of the Cedar Hills field. 

All combined, our Red River units and adjacent areas represented 7% of our PV-10 as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 5% of our average daily Boe production for the fourth quarter of 2015 . Our average daily production from these legacy properties decreased 12% in the fourth quarter of 2015 &#32;compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 &#32;due to natural declines in production and reduced drilling activity. We undertook limited drilling activity in the Red River units in 2015, choosing instead to allocate capital to areas in North Dakota Bakken and Oklahoma that generate more attractive rates of return. For 2016, we plan to invest approximately $8 million in the Red River units primarily on well workover activities aimed at enhancing production and recoveries for these legacy properties. 

North Region Marketing Activities 

Crude Oil. &#32;We utilize a portfolio approach (rail and pipe) to market our crude oil that began in 2008 with our first shipments of crude oil by rail out of the Williston Basin. Accessing new pipeline transportation optionality that came online in 2015, we shifted a significant portion of our crude oil from rail transportation to pipeline transportation during the year. We plan to continue with a portfolio approach to reach the optimum markets in an effort to maximize wellhead value for our crude oil production. 

Natural Gas . Field infrastructure build-out continued in the Williston Basin in 2015 &#32;as third party midstream gathering and processing companies expanded field gathering and compression facilities, cryogenic processing capacity and natural gas liquids (&#8220;NGL&#8221;) pipeline and rail capacity to market centers. In 2015 , we continued to be a leader in minimizing natural gas flaring in North Dakota. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , we delivered approximately 87% &#32;of our operated natural gas production in North Dakota Bakken to market, flaring approximately 13% &#32;compared to an average of 18% &#32;flared by industry peers operating in the play. 

South Region 

Our properties in the South region represented 37% of our PV-10 as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 34% of our average daily Boe production for the fourth quarter of 2015 . For the 2015 &#32;fourth quarter, our average daily production from such properties was 76,025 Boe per day, an increase of 56% from the comparable period in 2014 . Our principal producing properties in the South region are located in the SCOOP, Northwest Cana and STACK areas of Oklahoma. 

SCOOP 

The SCOOP play currently extends across Garvin, Grady, Stephens, Carter, McClain and Love Counties in Oklahoma and contains crude oil and condensate-rich fairways as delineated by numerous industry wells. Our SCOOP leasehold has the potential to contain hydrocarbons from a variety of conventional and unconventional reservoirs overlying and underlying the Woodford formation in Oklahoma. In 2014, our drilling activities resulted in the vertical expansion of our SCOOP position and discovery of the Springer formation, which is located approximately 1,000 to 1,500 feet above the Woodford formation. Located in the heart of our SCOOP acreage, our Springer position supplements our Woodford leasehold and expands our resource potential and inventory in the play. Our 2015 drilling activity in SCOOP focused on expanding the known productive extents of the SCOOP Woodford and SCOOP Springer formations and continued development of de-risked, higher rate-of-return areas in core parts of the play. Also, in 2015 we began operation of water recycling facilities in the SCOOP area that economically reuse stimulation water for both operational efficiencies and environmental benefits. 

We are a leading producer, leasehold owner and operator in the SCOOP play. As of December 31, 2015 , we controlled one of the largest leasehold positions in SCOOP with approximately 771,300 gross ( 439,800 &#32;net) acres under lease. SCOOP represented 31% of our PV-10 as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 29% of our average daily Boe production for the fourth quarter of 2015 . For the year ended December 31, 2015 , SCOOP production grew 75% over 2014 &#32;due to the continued success of our drilling activity in the play. We completed 204 &#32;gross ( 74 &#32;net) wells in SCOOP during 2015 . Proved reserves increased 12% year-over-year to 413 &#32;MMBoe as of December 31, 2015 , of which 32% represents proved developed reserves. Our inventory of proved undeveloped drilling locations in SCOOP as of December 31, 2015 &#32;totaled 370 gross (224 net) wells. 

In 2016 , we plan to invest approximately $260 million &#32;to drill, complete and initiate production on 113 &#32;gross (25 net) wells in the SCOOP play. Our 2016 &#32;drilling program will continue to focus on expanding the known productive extents of the SCOOP Woodford and SCOOP Springer formations and de-risking our acreage, while focusing on areas that provide opportunities for converting undeveloped acreage to acreage held by production, increasing capital efficiency, reducing finding and development costs, and maximizing rates of return. As of December 31, 2015 , we had six operated rigs drilling in the SCOOP play and plan to average approximately five to six operated rigs throughout 2016. 

Northwest Cana and STACK 

Our Northwest Cana properties are located primarily in Blaine, Dewey and Custer Counties of Oklahoma and primarily target the Woodford formation. In September 2014, we entered into an agreement with a U.S. subsidiary of SK E&#38;S Co. Ltd (&#8220;SK&#8221;) of South Korea to jointly develop a significant portion of our Northwest Cana natural gas properties, primarily in Blaine and Dewey counties. Under the agreement, SK has committed to fund, or carry, 50% of our share of certain future drilling and completion costs through September 2019, which has enabled us to generate favorable economics and value from previously idle properties in Northwest Cana. As of December 31, 2015 , we had five operated rigs drilling in Northwest Cana and plan to average approximately five operated rigs throughout 2016 to capitalize on the favorable economics provided by our joint development agreement with SK. In 2016, we plan to invest approximately $62 million &#32;to drill, complete and initiate production on 28 &#32;gross ( 11 &#32;net) wells in Northwest Cana within the area of mutual interest with SK. 

In 2015, we added the STACK play to our portfolio of assets through our leasing and drilling efforts. STACK, an acronym for Sooner Trend Anadarko Canadian Kingfisher, is a significant new resource play located in the Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma characterized by stacked geologic formations with major targets in the Meramec and Osage formations overlying the Woodford formation. A significant portion of our STACK acreage is located in over-pressured portions of Blaine, Dewey and Custer Counties of Oklahoma where we believe the reservoirs are typically thicker and deliver superior production rates relative to normal-pressured areas of the STACK petroleum system. Our drilling in STACK is in the early stages and production has just recently begun to grow. We anticipate the economics from our STACK properties will compare favorably with our SCOOP and North Dakota Bakken assets and will provide value-added opportunities for the Company. As of December 31, 2015 , we had four &#32; operated rigs drilling in STACK and we plan to average approximately four to five operated rigs throughout 2016. In 2016, we plan to invest approximately $142 million &#32;to drill, complete and initiate production on 15 gross (9 net) wells in STACK. Our 2016 activities will be focused on delineating and de-risking our acreage, monitoring production, and further developing our geologic and economic models in the area. 

Combined, our Northwest Cana and STACK properties represented 5% of our PV-10 as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 3% of our average daily Boe production for the fourth quarter of 2015 . As of December 31, 2015 , we held a total of 155,221 &#32;net acres under lease in Northwest Cana and STACK, representing acreage available for drilling in the Woodford formation (Northwest Cana) and the Meramec and Osage formations (STACK) overlying the Woodford and inclusive of 38,600 &#32;total net acres of Woodford drilling rights in the area of mutual interest established under our Northwest Cana joint development agreement with SK. 

Combined production in Northwest Cana and STACK increased to an average rate of 7,709 Boe per day during the fourth quarter of 2015 , up 104% over the 2014 &#32;fourth quarter due to additional drilling and completion activity resulting from our drilling program. We completed a combined 26 gross (10 net) wells in Northwest Cana and STACK during 2015. Proved reserves totaled 84 &#32;MMBoe as of December 31, 2015 , of which 25% represents proved developed reserves. Our combined inventory of proved undeveloped locations stood at 198 gross (66 net) wells as of December 31, 2015 . 

South Region Marketing Activities 

Crude Oil. &#32;Our South region production is located in relatively close proximity to regional refineries as well as the crude oil trading hub located in Cushing, Oklahoma. Because of this close proximity to local markets as well as Cushing, we are able to market our South region production with the intent of capturing the best market prices available depending on the crude oil grade and location. We use the competition among refineries, midstream companies, and bulk traders in an effort to maximize wellhead value for our crude oil production. 

Natural Gas . In 2015 , field infrastructure build-out continued at a rapid pace in the Anadarko Basin and in SCOOP as third party midstream gathering and processing companies expanded field gathering and compression facilities, cryogenic processing capacity and NGL pipeline capacity to market centers. On January 1, 2016 a third party placed a new lateral into service that connects to an existing plant which provides a connection to an interstate pipeline system for sales to downstream customers. 

Throughout our South region leasehold, we are coordinating our well completion operations to coincide with well connections to gathering systems in order to minimize greenhouse gas emissions. We continue to assess downstream transportation options 

and have developed relationships with downstream transport and end-use customers for possible future portfolio pricing benefits.

Crude oil sales volumes differ from production volumes because, at various times, we have stored crude oil in inventory due to pipeline line fill requirements, low commodity prices, or marketing disruptions or we have sold crude oil from inventory. Crude oil sales volumes were 147 &#32;MBbls more than production volumes for 2015 , 408 &#32;MBbls less than production volumes for 2014 , and 4 &#32;MBbls less than production volumes for 2013 .

Title to Properties 

As is customary in the crude oil and natural gas industry, upon initiation of leasing fee mineral interests on undeveloped lands which do not have associated proved reserves, contract landmen conduct a title examination of courthouse records to determine fee mineral ownership. Such title examinations are reviewed and approved by Company landmen. Upon entering into a purchase and sale agreement for an acquisition from a third party, whether lands are producing crude oil and natural gas leases or non-producing, Company and contract landmen perform title examinations at applicable courthouses and examine the seller's internal land, legal, well, marketing and accounting records including existing title opinions. We may also procure an acquisition title opinion from outside legal counsel on higher value properties. 

Prior to the commencement of drilling operations, we procure an original title opinion, or supplement an existing title opinion, from outside legal counsel and perform curative work to satisfy requirements pertaining to material title defects, if any. We will not commence drilling operations until we have cured material title defects as to the Company's interest. 

We have procured title opinions and cured material defects as to Company interests on substantially all of our producing properties and believe we have defensible title to our producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the crude oil and natural gas industry. Our crude oil and natural gas properties are subject to customary royalty and leasehold burdens which we believe do not materially interfere with the use of the properties or affect our carrying value of such properties. 

Marketing and Major Customers 

Most of our crude oil production is sold to crude oil refining companies at major market centers. Other production not sold at major market centers is sold to midstream marketing companies or crude oil refining companies at the lease. We have significant production directly connected to pipeline gathering systems, with the remaining balance of our production being transported by truck or rail. Where directly marketed crude oil is transported by truck, it is delivered to a point on a connected pipeline system for delivery to a sales point &#8220;downstream&#8221; on another connecting pipeline. When crude oil is sold at the lease the sale is complete at that point. 

The majority of our natural gas production is sold at our lease locations to midstream purchasers under term contracts. These contracts include multi-year term agreements with acreage dedication. Some of our contracts allow us the flexibility to accept, as partial payment for our sale of gas in the field, an &#8220;in-kind&#8221; volume of processed gas at the tailgate of the midstream purchaser&#8217;s processing plant. When we elect to do so, we transport this processed gas to a downstream market where it is sold. Sales at these downstream markets are mostly under monthly interruptible packaged volume deals, short term seasonal packages, and long term multi-year contracts. We continue to develop relationships and have potential future contracts with end-use customers, including utilities, industrial users, and liquefied natural gas exporters, for sale of gas we elect to take in-kind in lieu of cash for our leasehold sales. 

Our marketing of crude oil and natural gas can be affected by factors beyond our control, the effects of which cannot be accurately predicted. For a description of some of these factors, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk factors&#8212;Our business depends on crude oil and natural gas transportation, processing and refining facilities, most of which are owned by third parties, and on the availability of rail transportation. 

For the year ended December 31, 2015 , sales to Phillips 66 Company accounted for approximately 11% of our total crude oil and natural gas revenues. No other purchasers accounted for more than 10% of our total crude oil and natural gas revenues for 2015 . We believe the loss of any single purchaser would not have a material adverse effect on our operations, as crude oil and natural gas are fungible products with well-established markets and numerous purchasers in various regions. 

Competition 

We operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, marketing crude oil and natural gas and securing trained personnel. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the crude oil and natural gas industry. Our competitors vary within the regions in which we operate, and some of our competitors may possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources greater than ours, which can be particularly important in the areas in which we operate. Those companies may be able to pay more for productive crude oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects and to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit. Our ability to acquire additional prospects and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions economically in a highly competitive environment. In addition, as a result of the significant decrease in commodity prices, the number of providers of materials and services has decreased in the regions where we operate. As a result, the likelihood of experiencing competition and shortages of materials and services may be increased in connection with any period of commodity price recovery. 

Regulation of the Crude Oil and Natural Gas Industry 

Our operations are conducted onshore almost entirely in the United States. The crude oil and natural gas industry in the United States is subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels. Laws, rules, regulations, policies, and interpretations affecting our industry have been and are pervasive and are continuously reviewed by legislators and regulators, resulting in the imposition of new or increased requirements on us and other industry participants. Applicable laws and regulations and other requirements affecting our industry often carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. These requirements may have a significant effect on the exploration, development, production and sale of crude oil and natural gas and increase the cost of doing business and affect profitability. In addition, because public policy changes affecting the crude oil and natural gas industry are commonplace and because laws, rules and regulations may be enacted, amended or reinterpreted, we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws, rules and regulations. We do not expect any future legislative or regulatory initiatives will affect us in a manner materially different than they would affect our similarly situated competitors. 

The following is a discussion of significant laws, rules and regulations that may affect us in the areas in which we operate. 

Regulation of sales and transportation of crude oil and natural gas liquids 

Sales of crude oil and natural gas liquids or condensate in the United States are not currently subject to price controls and are made at negotiated prices. Nevertheless, the U.S. Congress could enact price controls in the future. Since the 1970s, the United States has regulated the exportation of petroleum and petroleum products, which restricted the markets for these commodities and affected sales prices. However, in December 2015, the U.S. Congress passed a legislative bill eliminating the export restrictions. 

With regard to our physical sales of crude oil and any derivative instruments relating to crude oil, we are required to comply with anti-market manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (&#8220;FTC&#8221;) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (&#8220;CFTC&#8221;). See the discussion below of &#8220;Other Federal Laws and Regulations Affecting Our Industry&#8212;FTC and CFTC Market Manipulation Rules.&#8221; If we violate the anti-market manipulation laws and regulations, we could be subject to substantial penalties and related third-party damage claims by, among others, sellers, royalty owners and taxing authorities. 

Our sales of crude oil are affected by the availability, terms and costs of transportation. The transportation of crude oil and NGLs, as well as other liquid products, is subject to rate and access regulation. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (&#8220;FERC&#8221;) regulates interstate crude oil and NGL pipeline transportation rates under the Interstate Commerce Act and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws. In general, pipeline rates must be just and reasonable and must not be unduly discriminatory or confer any undue preference upon any shipper. Oil and other liquid pipeline rates are often cost-based, although many pipeline charges today are based on historical rates adjusted for inflation and other factors, and other charges may result from settlement rates agreed to by all shippers or market-based rates, which are permitted in certain circumstances. FERC or interested persons may challenge existing or changed rates or services. Intrastate crude oil and NGL pipeline transportation rates may be subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate crude oil pipeline rates, varies from state to state. Insofar as the interstate and intrastate transportation rates we pay are generally applicable to all comparable shippers, we believe the regulation of intrastate transportation rates will not affect us in a way that materially differs from the effect on our similarly situated competitors. 

Further, interstate pipelines and intrastate common carrier pipelines must provide service on an equitable basis. Under this standard, such pipelines must offer service to all similarly situated shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates. When such pipelines operate at full capacity, access is governed by prorating provisions, which may be set forth in the pipelines&#8217; published tariffs. We believe we generally will have access to crude oil pipeline transportation services to the same extent as our similarly situated competitors. 

We transport a portion of the operated crude oil production from our North region to market centers using rail transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties, with approximately 17% &#32;of such production being shipped by rail in December 2015 . The U.S. Department of Transportation&#8217;s (&#8220;U.S. DOT&#8221;) Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (&#8220;PHMSA&#8221;) establishes safety regulations relating to crude-by-rail transportation. Third party rail operators are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board of the U.S. DOT, the Federal Railroad Administration (&#8220;FRA&#8221;) of the U.S. DOT, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, as well as other federal regulatory agencies. Additionally, various state and local agencies have jurisdiction over disposal of hazardous waste and seek to regulate movement of hazardous materials if not preempted by federal law. 

In 2008, the U.S. Congress passed the Rail Safety and Improvement Act, which implemented regulations governing different areas related to railroad safety. More recently, the FRA and PHMSA have undertaken several actions to enhance the safe transport of crude oil, including but not limited to: issuing an order requiring proper testing, classification and handling of crude oil as a hazardous material; requiring expanded hazardous material route planning for railroads to avoid populated and other sensitive areas; issuing safety advisories, alerts, emergency orders and regulatory updates; conducting special unannounced inspections; moving forward with rulemaking to enhance tank car standards for certain trains carrying crude oil and ethanol; and reaching agreement with the railroad industry on a series of voluntary actions it can take to improve safety. Notably, in May 2014 the U.S. DOT issued an order requiring all railroads operating trains containing large amounts of Bakken crude oil to notify state emergency response commissions about the operation of such trains through their states. The order requires each railroad operating trains containing more than 1,000,000 gallons of Bakken crude oil, or approximately 35 tank cars, in a particular state to provide the state with notification regarding the volumes of Bakken crude oil being transported, frequencies of anticipated train traffic and the route through which Bakken crude oil will be transported. Also in May 2014, the FRA and PHMSA issued a safety advisory to the rail industry strongly recommending the use of tank cars with the highest level of integrity in their fleet when transporting Bakken crude oil. In May 2015, PHMSA issued a final rule which requires, among other things, enhanced tank car standards for new and existing tank cars, a classification and testing program for crude oil, and a requirement that older DOT-111 tank cars be retrofitted to comply with new tank car design standards in accordance with a specified timeline beginning in May 2017. 

We do not currently own or operate rail transportation facilities or rail cars; however, regulations that impact the testing or rail transportation of crude oil could increase our costs of doing business and limit our ability to transport and sell our crude oil at market centers throughout the United States, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We are unable to estimate the potential impact on our business associated with new federal or state rail transportation regulations; however, we do not expect such regulations will affect us in a materially different way than similarly situated competitors. 

At the state level, in December 2014 the North Dakota Industrial Commission ("NDIC") introduced new rules designed to reduce the potential flammability of crude oil produced from the Bakken petroleum system (the Bakken, Three Forks, and Sanish Pool formations) before it is loaded on railcars and transported. The rules, which became effective in April 2015, &#32;outline a series of standards for pressure and temperature for production facilities to follow in order to separate certain liquids and gases from the crude oil prior to transport. The regulations are designed to leave the crude oil with a vapor pressure of no more than 13.7 pounds per square inch ("psi") compared to national standards that require 14.7 psi. While the new rules could increase the cost of doing business in North Dakota, we do not expect these changes to have a material impact on us nor will they affect us in a way that materially differs from our similarly situated competitors. 

Regulation of sales and transportation of natural gas 

In 1989, the U.S. Congress enacted the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act, which removed all remaining price and non-price controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas. The FERC, which has the authority under the Natural Gas Act (&#8220;NGA&#8221;) to regulate prices, terms, and conditions for the sale of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce, has issued blanket authorizations for all gas resellers subject to FERC regulation, except interstate pipelines, to resell natural gas at market prices. However, either the U.S. Congress or the FERC (with respect to the resale of gas in interstate commerce) could re-impose price controls in the future. The U.S. Department of Energy (&#8220;U.S. DOE&#8221;) regulates the terms and conditions for the exportation and importation of natural gas (including liquefied natural gas or &#8220;LNG&#8221;). U.S. law provides for very limited regulation of exports to and imports from any country that has entered into a Free Trade Agreement (&#8220;FTA&#8221;) with the United States that provides for national treatment of trade in natural gas; however, the U.S. DOE&#8217;s regulation of imports and exports from and to countries without such FTAs is more comprehensive. The FERC also regulates the construction and operation of import and export facilities, including LNG terminals. Regulation of imports and exports and related facilities may materially affect natural gas markets and sales prices. 

The FERC regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions under the NGA and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (&#8220;NGPA&#8221;), which affects the marketing of natural gas we produce, as well as revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas. The FERC has endeavored to make natural gas transportation more accessible to natural gas buyers and sellers on an open and non-discriminatory basis. The FERC has stated that open access policies are necessary to improve the competitive structure of the natural gas pipeline industry and to create a regulatory framework to put natural gas sellers into more direct contractual relations with natural gas buyers by, among other things, unbundling the sale of natural gas from the sale of transportation and storage services. The FERC has issued a series of orders to implement its open access policies. As a result, the interstate pipelines&#8217; traditional role as wholesalers of natural gas has been eliminated and replaced by a structure under which pipelines provide transportation and storage services on an open access basis to others who buy and sell natural gas. Although the FERC&#8217;s orders do not directly regulate natural gas producers, they are intended to foster increased competition within all phases of the natural gas industry. We cannot provide any assurance that the pro-competitive regulatory 

approach established by the FERC will continue. However, we do not believe any action taken will affect us in a materially different way than similarly situated natural gas producers. 

With regard to our physical sales of natural gas and any derivative instruments relating to natural gas, we are required to observe anti-market manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by the FERC and the CFTC. See the discussion below of &#8220;Other Federal Laws and Regulations Affecting Our Industry&#8212;FTC and CFTC Market Manipulation Rules.&#8221; If we violate the anti-market manipulation laws and regulations, we could be subject to substantial penalties and related third-party damage claims by, among others, sellers, royalty owners and taxing authorities. In addition, pursuant to various FERC orders, we may be required to submit reports to the FERC for some of our operations. See the discussion below of &#8220;Other Federal Laws and Regulations Affecting Our Industry&#8212;FERC Market Transparency and Reporting Rules.&#8221; 

Gathering service, which occurs upstream of jurisdictional transmission services, is generally regulated by the states onshore and in state waters. Although its policies on gathering systems have varied in the past, the FERC has reclassified certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as non-jurisdictional gathering facilities, which has the tendency to increase our costs of getting natural gas to point of sale locations. State regulation of natural gas gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental, and in some circumstances, equitable take requirements. Natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny at both the state and federal levels in the future. We cannot predict what effect, if any, such changes may have on us, but the natural gas industry could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes, including changes in the interpretation of existing requirements or programs to implement those requirements. We do not believe we would be affected by any such regulatory changes in a materially different way than our similarly situated competitors. 

Intrastate natural gas transportation service is also subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies. Like the regulation of interstate transportation rates, the regulation of intrastate transportation rates affects the marketing of natural gas we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas. The basis for intrastate regulation of natural gas transportation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate natural gas pipeline rates and services varies from state to state. Insofar as such regulation within a particular state will generally affect all intrastate natural gas shippers within the state on a comparable basis, we believe the regulation of intrastate natural gas transportation in states in which we operate and ship natural gas on an intrastate basis will not affect us in a way that materially differs from our similarly situated competitors. 

Regulation of production 

The production of crude oil and natural gas is subject to regulation under a wide range of federal, state and local statutes, rules, orders and regulations, which require, among other matters, permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. All of the states in which we own and operate properties have regulations governing conservation, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of crude oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of maximum allowable rates of production from crude oil and natural gas wells, the regulation of well spacing, and the plugging and abandonment of wells, as well as regulations that generally limit or prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas. The effect of these regulations is to limit the amount of crude oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations we can drill, although we can apply for exceptions to such regulations or to have reductions in well spacing. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production, severance or excise tax with respect to the production and sale of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction. 

The failure to comply with these rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. Our similarly situated competitors in the crude oil and natural gas industry are generally subject to the same statutes, regulatory requirements and restrictions. 

Other federal laws and regulations affecting our industry 

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. &#32;In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) was enacted into law. The Dodd-Frank Act established federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities, such as us, that participate in that market. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the CFTC, the SEC, and other regulators to establish rules and regulations to implement the new legislation. Although the CFTC has issued final regulations to implement significant aspects of the legislation, others remain to be finalized or implemented and it is not possible at this time to predict when this will be accomplished. 

In November 2013, the CFTC proposed rules establishing position limits with respect to certain futures and option contracts and equivalent swaps, subject to exceptions for certain bona fide hedging. As these new position limit rules are not yet final, the impact of these provisions on us is uncertain at this time. 

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, mandatory clearing is now required for all market participants, unless an exception is available. The CFTC has designated certain interest rate swaps and credit default swaps for mandatory clearing. The CFTC has not yet required the clearing of any other classes of swaps, including physical commodity swaps, and the trade execution 

requirement does not apply to swaps not subject to a clearing mandate. Although we expect to qualify for the end-user exception from the clearing requirement for our swaps entered into to hedge our commercial risks, the application of the mandatory clearing requirements to other market participants, such as swap dealers, along with changes to the markets for swaps as a result of the trade execution requirement, may change the cost and availability of the swaps we use for hedging. If any of our swaps do not qualify for the commercial end-user exception, or if the cost of entering into uncleared swaps becomes prohibitive, we may be required to clear such transactions or execute them on a derivatives contract market or swap execution facility. The ultimate effect of the proposed rules and any additional regulations on our business is uncertain. 

In December 2015, the CFTC issued final rules establishing minimum margin requirements for uncleared swaps for swap dealers and major swap participants. The final rules do not impose margin requirements on commercial end users. Although we expect to qualify for the end-user exception from the margin requirements for swaps entered into to hedge our commercial risks, the application of such requirements to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may change the cost and availability of the swaps we use for hedging. If any of our swaps do not qualify for the commercial end-user exception, the posting of collateral could reduce our liquidity and cash available for capital expenditures and could reduce our ability to manage commodity price volatility and the volatility in our cash flows. 

In addition to the CFTC&#8217;s swap regulations, certain foreign jurisdictions are in the process of adopting or implementing laws and regulations relating to transactions in derivatives, including margin and central clearing requirements, which in each case may affect our counterparties and the derivatives markets generally. Other rules, including the restrictions on proprietary trading adopted under Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, also known as the Volcker Rule, may alter the business practices of some of our counterparties and in some cases may cause them to stop transacting in or making markets in derivatives. Moreover, federal banking regulators are reevaluating the authorization under which banking entities subject to their authority may engage in physical commodities transactions. 

Although we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these rulemakings, new rules and regulations, to the extent applicable to us or our derivative counterparties, may result in increased costs and cash collateral requirements for the types of derivative instruments we use to manage our financial and commercial risks related to fluctuations in commodity prices. Additional effects of the new regulations, including increased regulatory reporting and recordkeeping costs, increased regulatory capital requirements for our counterparties, and market dislocations or disruptions, among other consequences, could have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business. 

Additionally, the SEC had adopted rules as required under the Dodd-Frank Act requiring registrants to disclose certain payments made to the U.S. Federal government and foreign governments in connection with the commercial development of crude oil, natural gas or minerals. The disclosure requirements were challenged by certain business groups and were subsequently vacated by a Federal court in July 2013. In December 2015, the SEC issued a revised proposal for public comment. As the proposed rules are not yet final, the impact of the rules on our business is uncertain at this time. 

Energy Policy Act of 2005. &#32;The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (&#8220;EPAct 2005&#8221;) included a comprehensive compilation of tax incentives, authorized appropriations for grants and guaranteed loans, and made significant changes to the statutory framework affecting the energy industry. Among other matters, EPAct 2005 amended the NGA to add an anti-market manipulation provision making it unlawful for any entity, including otherwise non-jurisdictional producers such as us, to use any deceptive or manipulative device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to regulation by the FERC, in contravention of rules prescribed by the FERC. In January 2006, the FERC issued rules implementing the anti-market manipulation provision of EPAct 2005. These anti-market manipulation rules apply to activities of natural gas pipelines and storage companies that provide interstate services, as well as otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted &#8220;in connection with&#8221; natural gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction, which now includes the annual reporting requirements described further below. 

The EPAct 2005 also provides the FERC with the power to assess civil penalties of up to $1,000,000 per day per violation for violations of the NGA and NGPA and the authority to order disgorgement of profits associated with any violation. 

FERC Market Transparency and Reporting Rules. &#32;The FERC requires wholesale buyers and sellers of more than 2.2 million MMBtus of physical natural gas in the previous calendar year, including interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines, natural gas gatherers, natural gas processors, natural gas marketers, and natural gas producers, to report, on May 1 of each year, aggregate volumes of natural gas purchased or sold at wholesale in the prior calendar year to the extent such transactions utilize, contribute to, or may contribute to the formation of price indices. The FERC also requires market participants to indicate whether they report prices to any index publishers and, if so, whether their reporting complies with the FERC&#8217;s policy statement on price reporting. Failure to comply with these reporting requirements could subject us to enhanced civil penalty liability under the EPAct 2005. 

FTC and CFTC Market Manipulation Rules . Wholesale sales of petroleum are subject to provisions of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (&#8220;EISA&#8221;) and regulations by the FTC. Under the EISA, the FTC issued its Petroleum Market Manipulation Rule (the &#8220;Rule&#8221;), which became effective in November 2009, and prohibits fraudulent or deceptive conduct (including false or misleading statements of material fact) in connection with wholesale purchases or sales of crude oil or refined petroleum products. Under the EISA, the FTC has authority to request a court to impose fines of up to $1,000,000 per day per violation. The CFTC has also adopted anti-market manipulation regulations that prohibit, among other things, fraud and price manipulation in the commodity and futures markets. The CFTC may assess fines of up to the greater of $1,000,000 or triple the monetary gain for violations of its anti-market manipulation regulations. Knowing or willful violations of the Commodity Exchange Act may also lead to a felony conviction. 

Additional proposals and proceedings that may affect the crude oil and natural gas industry are pending before the U.S. Congress, the FERC and the courts. We cannot predict the ultimate impact these or the above laws and regulations may have on our crude oil and natural gas operations. We do not believe we will be affected by any such action in a materially different way than our similarly situated competitors. 

Environmental, health and safety regulation 

General . We are subject to stringent and complex federal, state, and local laws, rules and regulations governing environmental compliance, including the discharge of materials into the environment, and worker health and safety. These laws, rules and regulations may, among other things: 

&#8226; 

require the acquisition of various permits to conduct exploration, drilling and production operations; 

&#8226; 

restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with crude oil and natural gas drilling, production and transportation activities; 

&#8226; 

limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas including areas containing endangered species of plants and animals; 

&#8226; 

require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations, such as requirements to close pits and plug abandoned wells; and 

&#8226; 

impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from drilling and production operations. 

These laws, rules and regulations may also restrict the rate of crude oil and natural gas production below a rate otherwise possible. The regulatory burden on the crude oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability. Additionally, the U.S. Congress and federal and state agencies frequently revise environmental, health and safety laws, rules and regulations, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, disposal, cleanup and remediation requirements for the crude oil and natural gas industry could have a significant impact on our operating costs. 

Environmental protection and natural gas flaring . We strive to operate in accordance with all applicable regulatory and legal requirements and have focused on continuously improving our health, safety, and environmental (&#8220;HSE&#8221;) performance; however, at times circumstances may arise that adversely affect our compliance with applicable HSE requirements. We have established internal policies and procedures regarding HSE matters for all employees, contractors, and vendors. In connection with our HSE initiatives, we work to identify and manage our environmental and safety risks and the impact of our operations and improve our HSE efforts. We monitor our HSE performance to assess our compliance with environmental protection and safety initiatives and peer benchmarking with trade associations. 

One of our HSE initiatives is the reduction of air emissions produced from our operations, particularly with respect to the flaring of natural gas from our operated well sites in the Bakken field of North Dakota. North Dakota statutes permit flaring of natural gas from a well that has not been connected to a gas gathering line for a period of one year from the date of a well's first production. After one year, a producer is required to cap the well, connect it to a gas gathering line, find acceptable alternative uses for a percentage of the flared gas, or apply to the NDIC for a written exemption for any future flaring; otherwise, the producer is required to pay royalties and production taxes based on the volume and value of the gas flared from the unconnected well. While the NDIC ultimately determines the volume and value of any such gas flared and the applicable royalties and production taxes, the NDIC has thus far generally accepted our methods for calculating these figures. Furthermore, the NDIC has generally accepted applications we have submitted to secure exemptions from the post-year flaring restrictions. Finally, NDIC rules for new drilling permit applications also require the submission of gas capture plans that address measures taken by operators to capture and not flare produced gas, regardless of whether it has been or will be connected within the first year of production. Thus far, the NDIC has generally accepted our gas capture plans submitted with applications for drilling permits. In September 2015, the NDIC extended the deadline to comply with the requirement to capture 85% of the natural gas produced from a well by one year, with a new compliance deadline of November 1, 2016. 

Compliance with the NDIC's flaring requirements or the imposition of any additional limitations on flaring could result in increased costs and have an adverse effect on our operations. 

For the year ended December 31, 2015, we delivered approximately 87% &#32;of our operated natural gas production in North Dakota Bakken to market, flaring approximately 13% &#32;compared to 13% in 2014, 11% in 2013 and 15% in 2012. Flaring from our operated well sites in the North Dakota Bakken is less than our industry peers operating in the play. According to data published by the NDIC, our industry as a whole flared approximately 18% &#32;of produced natural gas volumes in the state during 2015. We are a participant in the NDIC&#8217;s Flaring Reduction Task Force and are engaged in working with other task force members and the NDIC to develop action plans for mitigating natural gas flaring in the state. Flared natural gas volumes from our operated SCOOP, Northwest Cana and STACK properties in Oklahoma are negligible given the existence of established natural gas transportation infrastructure. 

There are environmental and financial risks associated with natural gas flaring and we attempt to manage these risks on an ongoing basis. To date, we have taken numerous actions to reduce flaring from our operated well sites. We make efforts to coordinate our well completion operations to coincide with well connections to gathering systems in order to minimize flaring, but may not always be successful in these efforts. Our ultimate goal is to reduce natural gas flaring from our operated well sites as much as is practicable. For example, in operating areas such as the Buffalo Red River units in South Dakota, the quality of the natural gas is not adequate to meet requirements for sale, so we employ processes to efficiently combust the gas in an effort to minimize impacts to the environment. Our levels of flaring are and will be dependent upon external factors such as investment from third parties in the development of gas gathering systems, state regulations, and the granting of reasonable right-of-way access by land owners. 

We have incurred in the past, and expect to incur in the future, capital and other expenditures related to environmental compliance. Such expenditures are included within our overall capital and operating budgets and are not separately itemized. Although we believe our continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations, we cannot assure you the passage of more stringent laws or regulations in the future will not materially impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

Environmental, health and safety laws, rules and regulations . Some of the existing environmental and worker health and safety laws, rules and regulations to which we are subject include, among others: (i) regulations by the Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;) and various state agencies regarding approved methods of disposal for certain hazardous and nonhazardous wastes; (ii) the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and analogous state laws that may require the removal of previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), the cleanup of property contamination (including groundwater contamination), and remedial lease restoration activities to prevent future contamination from prior operations; (iii) federal Department of Transportation safety laws and comparable state and local requirements; (iv) the Clean Air Act and comparable state and local requirements, which establish pollution control requirements with respect to air emissions from our operations; (v) the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, which contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to oil spills into waters of the United States; (vi) the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the Clean Water Act, and analogous state laws which impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including crude oil and other substances generated by our operations, into waters of the United States or state waters; (vii) the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which is a principal federal statute governing the treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, and comparable state statutes; (viii) the Safe Drinking Water Act and analogous state laws which impose requirements relating to our underground injection activities; (ix) the National Environmental Policy Act and comparable state statutes, which require government agencies, including the Department of Interior, to evaluate major agency actions that have the potential to significantly impact the environment; (x) the Endangered Species Act and comparable state statutes, which afford protections to certain plant and animal species; (xi) the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, which imposes certain restrictions for the protection of migratory birds; (xii) the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, which imposes certain restrictions for the protection of bald and golden eagles; (xiii) the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act and comparable state statutes, which require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials stored, used or produced in our operations, and (xiv) state regulations and statutes governing the handling, treatment, storage and disposal of naturally occurring radioactive material. Any failure to comply with these laws, rules and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of corrective or remedial obligations, the issuance of orders enjoining performance of some or all of our operations, and potential litigation. 

Air emissions and climate change . Federal, state and local laws and regulations are being enacted to address concerns about the effects the emission of carbon dioxide and other identified &#8220;greenhouse gases&#8221; may have on the environment and climate worldwide, generally referred to as &#8220;climate change.&#8221; For example, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act ("CAA") establishing, among other things, Prevention of Significant Deterioration (&#8220;PSD&#8221;) and construction and Title V operating permit reviews for certain large stationary sources. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for greenhouse gas emissions are also required to meet &#8220;best available control technology&#8221; standards established on a case-by- 

case basis. We currently do not have any facilities that are required to adhere to the PSD or Title V permit requirements; however, attempts by the EPA to aggregate multiple oil and gas production facilities, each of which is currently and has long been regarded as an individual stationary source, for permitting purposes could result in the aggregate emissions from these independent facilities triggering Title V and/or PSD requirements. EPA rulemakings related to greenhouse gas emissions could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified sources. 

In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified onshore and offshore oil and gas production sources in the United States on an annual basis, which include certain of our operations. In August 2015, the EPA proposed new regulations setting methane emission standards for new and modified oil and gas production and natural gas processing and transmission facilities as part of the Obama Administration&#8217;s efforts to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by up to 45% from 2012 levels by 2025 even though there is consensus that oil and gas producers&#8217; compliance with EPA's New Source Performance Standard Subpart OOOO, which was promulgated in 2012, has already achieved the methane reductions which are now being targeted by the recently proposed regulations. The proposed regulations are expected to be finalized in 2016. On January 22, 2016, the Bureau of Land Management issued a pre-publication version of a proposed venting and flaring rule, which is expected to be finalized in 2016 and, like the forthcoming EPA regulations, will address methane emissions from crude oil and natural gas sources. To the extent the new regulations impose reporting obligations on, or limit emissions of greenhouse gases from, our equipment and operations they could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions associated with our operations, the impact of which, though uncertain at this time as the regulations are not yet final, is not expected to be material and will not affect us in a way that materially differs from our similarly situated competitors. 

In December 2015, a global climate agreement was reached in Paris at the 21st Conference of Parties organized by the United Nations under the Framework Convention on Climate Change. The agreement, which goes into effect in 2020, resulted in nearly 200 countries, including the United States, committing to work towards limiting global warming and agreeing to a monitoring and review process of greenhouse gas emissions. The agreement includes binding and non-binding elements and did not require ratification by the U.S. Congress. Nonetheless, the agreement may result in increased political pressure on the United States to ensure continued compliance with enforcement measures under the Clean Air Act and may spur further initiatives aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the future. 

While the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the federal level in recent years. In the absence of such federal legislation, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by means of cap and trade programs that typically require major sources of greenhouse gas emissions, such as electric power plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those greenhouse gases. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how such legislation or new regulations adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business, any future laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations. In addition, substantial limitations on greenhouse gas emissions could adversely affect the demand for the crude oil and natural gas we produce. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events. If any such effects from such causes were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our exploration and production operations. 

With respect to air quality regulation more generally, the EPA has also established air emission controls for crude oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations under the CAA's New Source Performance Standards and National Standards for Emission of Hazardous Air Pollutants programs. With regard to production activities, the rules require, among other things, the reduction of volatile organic compound (&#8220;VOC&#8221;) emissions from three subcategories of fractured and refractured gas wells for which well completion operations are conducted: wildcat (exploratory) and delineation gas wells; low reservoir pressure non-wildcat and non-delineation gas wells; and all &#8220;other&#8221; fractured and refractured gas wells. All three subcategories of wells must route flowback emissions to a gathering line or be captured and combusted using a combustion device such as a flare. However, the &#8220;other&#8221; wells must use reduced emission completions or &#8220;green completions.&#8221; The rules also established specific new requirements regarding emissions from compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage tanks and other production equipment. The rules are designed to limit emissions of VOCs, sulfur dioxide, and hazardous air pollutants from a variety of sources within natural gas processing plants, oil and natural gas production facilities, and natural gas transmission compressor stations. We have modified our operations and well equipment as needed to comply with these rules. Ongoing compliance with the rules is not expected to affect us in a way that materially differs from our similarly situated competitors. In addition, in October 2015 the EPA revised the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (&#8220;NAAQS&#8221;) for ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion for both the 8-hour primary and secondary standards. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay or prohibit our ability to obtain such permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant. 

Hydraulic fracturing . Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and additives under pressure into rock formations to stimulate crude oil and natural gas production. In recent years there has been increased public concern regarding an alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to adversely affect drinking water supplies and to induce seismic events. As a result, several federal and state agencies are studying the environmental risks with respect to hydraulic fracturing, and proposals have been made to enact separate federal, state and local legislation that would increase the regulatory burden imposed on hydraulic fracturing. 

Also at the federal level, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (&#8220;SDWA&#8221;) over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuels and published permitting guidance in February 2014 related to such activities. In May 2014, the EPA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to collect data on chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations under Section 8 of the Toxic Substances Control Act. To date, no other action has been taken. Further, in April 2015 the EPA issued proposed regulations under the Clean Water Act governing discharges to publicly owned treatment works of waste water from hydraulic fracturing and certain other natural gas operations. In 2015 the EPA completed a study of the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities on water resources and published a draft assessment in June 2015 for peer review and public comment. In its assessment, the EPA indicated it did not find evidence that hydraulic fracturing mechanisms caused widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water resources in the United States. Nonetheless, the results of the study or similar governmental reviews could spur initiatives to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or otherwise, and there has been recent speculation the EPA may conduct a second similar study. Finally, the U.S. Department of Interior issued final rules in March 2015 related to the regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands, including requirements for chemical disclosure, well bore integrity and handling of flowback water. The U.S. District Court of Wyoming has temporarily stayed implementation of this rule and a final decision remains pending. 

At the state level, several states, including states in which we operate, have adopted or are considering adopting legal requirements imposing more stringent permitting, disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. Local governments also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular. In certain areas of the United States, new drilling permits for hydraulic fracturing have been put on hold pending development of additional standards. 

We voluntarily participate in FracFocus, a national publicly accessible Internet-based registry developed by the Ground Water Protection Council and the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission. This registry, located at www.fracfocus.org , provides our industry with an avenue to voluntarily disclose additives used in the hydraulic fracturing process. The additives used in the hydraulic fracturing process on all wells we operate are disclosed on that website. 

The adoption of any future federal, state or local laws, rules or implementing regulations imposing permitting or reporting obligations on, or otherwise limiting, hydraulic fracturing processes in areas in which we operate could make it more difficult and more expensive to complete crude oil and natural gas wells in low-permeability formations, increase our costs of compliance and doing business, and delay, prevent or prohibit the development of natural resources from unconventional formations. Compliance, or the consequences of our failure to comply, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. At this time it is not possible to estimate the potential impact on our business if such federal or state legislation is enacted into law. 

Waste water disposal. Underground injection wells are a predominant method for disposing of waste water from oil and gas activities. In response to recent seismic events near underground injection wells used for the disposal of oil and gas-related waste waters, federal and some state agencies are investigating whether such wells have caused increased seismic activity. Some states, including states in which we operate, have delayed permit approvals, mandated a reduction in injection volumes, or have shut down or imposed moratoria on the use of injection wells. Regulators in some states, including states in which we operate, are considering additional requirements related to seismic safety. For example, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission (&#8220;OCC&#8221;) has adopted rules for operators of saltwater disposal wells in certain seismically-active areas in the Arbuckle formation of Oklahoma. These rules require, among other things, that disposal well operators conduct mechanical integrity testing or make certain demonstrations of such wells&#8217; respective depths that, depending on the depth, could require plugging the well and/or the reduction of volumes disposed in such wells. Oklahoma has adopted a &#8220;traffic light&#8221; system, wherein the OCC reviews new or existing disposal wells for proximity to faults, seismicity in the area and other factors in determining whether such wells should be permitted, permitted only with special restrictions, or not permitted. At the federal level, the EPA's current regulatory requirements for such wells do not require the consideration of seismic impacts when issuing permits. We cannot predict the EPA's future actions in this regard. The introduction of new environmental initiatives and regulations related to the disposal of wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of hydrocarbons, could limit or prohibit our ability to utilize underground injection wells. A lack of waste water disposal sites could cause us to delay, curtail or discontinue our exploration and development plans. Additionally, increased costs associated with the transportation and disposal of produced water, including the cost of complying with regulations concerning produced water disposal, may reduce 

our profitability. These costs are commonly incurred by all oil and gas producers and we do not believe the costs associated with the disposal of produced water will have a material adverse effect on our operations to any greater degree than other similarly situated competitors. In 2015, we began operation of water recycling facilities in the SCOOP area that economically reuse stimulation water for both operational efficiencies and environmental benefits. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we employed 1,143 &#32;people. Our future success will depend partially on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements and have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages. We consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory. We utilize the services of independent contractors to perform various field and other services.
