C ORPORATE O VERVIEW 

Chesapeake Utilities Corporation is a Delaware corporation formed in 1947. We are a diversified energy company engaged, through our operating divisions and subsidiaries, in various energy and other businesses. We operate primarily on the Delmarva Peninsula and in Florida, Pennsylvania and Ohio, providing natural gas distribution and transmission, natural gas supply, gathering and processing, electric distribution and propane distribution service. The core of our business is regulated energy services, which provides stable earnings through our utility operations. Our unregulated businesses provide opportunities to achieve returns greater than those of a traditional utility. The following charts present operating income by type of energy served and geographic area for the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and average investment by type of energy served and geographic area as of December 31, 2015 . 

O PERATING &#32;S EGMENTS 

We operate within two reportable segments: Regulated Energy and Unregulated Energy. 

The Regulated Energy segment includes our natural gas distribution, natural gas transmission and electric distribution operations. All operations in this segment are regulated, as to their rates and service, by the PSC having jurisdiction in each state in which we operate or by the FERC in the case of Eastern Shore. 

The Unregulated Energy segment includes our propane distribution, propane wholesale marketing, natural gas marketing and natural gas supply, gathering and processing services, which are unregulated as to their rates and services. Also included in this segment are other unregulated energy services, such as energy-related merchandise sales and heating, ventilation and air conditioning plumbing and electrical services. In the future, our Unregulated Energy segment will include electricity and steam generation services from the CHP plant we are currently constructing in Nassau County, Florida. The revenues from these services will be included in the Unregulated Energy segment.

The remainder of our operations is presented as &#8220;Other businesses and eliminations". Prior to September 30, 2014, our business included a third segment, "Other", which consisted primarily of BravePoint, our former advanced information services subsidiary. On October 1, 2014, we sold BravePoint. "Other businesses and eliminations" now solely consists of unregulated subsidiaries that own real estate leased to Chesapeake Utilities, as well as certain corporate costs not allocated to other operations. 

The following chart shows our principal business structure by segment and other businesses:

Overview of Business 

Regulated Energy is our largest segment and consists of: (i) our natural gas distribution operations in Delaware, Maryland and Florida; (ii) our electric distribution operation in Florida; and (iii) our natural gas transmission operations on the Delmarva Peninsula and in Florida. Our natural gas and electric distribution operations, which are local distribution utilities, generate revenues based on tariff rates approved by the PSC of each state in which we operate. The PSCs have also authorized our utilities to negotiate rates, based on approved methodologies, with customers that have competitive alternatives. Some of our customers in Maryland are currently served with propane under PSC-approved tariff rates as we prepare to convert some of our underground propane distribution system customers to natural gas. These customers are included in the Delmarva natural gas distribution operation. 

Page &#32;3 &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;Chesapeake Utilities Corporation 2015 Form 10-K 

Eastern Shore, our interstate natural gas transmission subsidiary, bills its customers based upon the FERC-approved tariff rates. Eastern Shore is also authorized by the FERC to negotiate rates above or below the FERC-approved tariff rates. Peninsula Pipeline, our Florida intrastate pipeline subsidiary, is subject to regulation by the Florida PSC, and has negotiated contracts with third-party customers and with certain affiliates. Our rates are designed to provide the opportunity to generate revenues to recover all prudently incurred costs and provide a return on rate base sufficient to pay interest on debt and a reasonable return for our stockholders. Rate base generally consists of the original cost of utility plant less accumulated depreciation on utility plant in service, working capital and certain other assets and, depending upon the particular regulatory jurisdiction, may also include deferred income tax liabilities and other additions or deletions. 

The natural gas commodity market for Chesapeake Utilities' Florida division and FPU&#8217;s Indiantown division is deregulated. Accordingly, marketers, rather than a traditional utility, sell natural gas to end-use customers in those jurisdictions. For all of our other local distribution utilities, we have fuel cost recovery mechanisms authorized by the PSCs that allow us to periodically adjust fuel rates to reflect changes in the wholesale cost of natural gas and electricity and to ensure we recover all of the costs prudently incurred in purchasing natural gas and electricity for our customers. 

Weather 

Revenues from our residential and commercial sales are affected by seasonal variations in weather conditions, which directly influence the volume of natural gas and electricity sold and delivered. Specifically, customer demand substantially increases during the winter months, when natural gas and electricity are used for heating. For electricity, customer demand also increases during the summer months, when electricity is used for cooling. Accordingly, the volumes sold for these purposes are directly affected by the severity of summer and winter weather and can vary substantially from year to year. We measure the relative impact of weather by using an accepted degree-day methodology. Degree-day data is used to estimate amounts of energy required to maintain comfortable indoor temperature levels based on each day&#8217;s average temperature. A degree-day is the measure of the variation in the weather based on the extent to which the average daily temperature (from 10:00 am to 10:00 am) falls above or below 65 degrees Fahrenheit. Each degree of temperature below 65 degrees Fahrenheit is counted as one heating degree-day. Each degree of temperature above 65 degrees Fahrenheit is counted as one cooling degree-day. Normal heating degree-days are based on the most recent 10-year average. 

In an effort to stabilize the level of net revenues collected from customers of Chesapeake Utilities' Maryland division regardless of weather conditions, Chesapeake Utilities' Maryland division&#8217;s rates include a weather normalization adjustment for residential heating and smaller commercial heating customers. A weather normalization adjustment is a billing adjustment mechanism (or "decoupled" rate mechanism) that is designed to eliminate the effect of deviations from average seasonal temperatures on utility net revenues. We do not currently have any weather normalization or &#8220;decoupled&#8221; rate mechanisms for our other local distribution utilities. We recently filed for approval of a weather normalization adjustment by the Delaware PSC for Chesapeake Utilities' Delaware division and by the Maryland PSC for Sandpiper, see Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#32;(Note 18, Rates and Other Regulatory Activities , in the Consolidated Financial Statements) for more information.

(1) Eastern Shore's service to our local distribution affiliates is based on FERC-approved rates and is an integral component of the cost associated with providing natural gas supplies for those affiliates. We eliminate operating revenues of Eastern Shore against the cost of sales of those affiliates in our consolidated financial information; however, our local distribution affiliates include this amount in their purchased fuel cost and recover it through fuel cost recovery mechanisms. 

(2) &#32; Operating revenues from "Other" sources are from the rental of gas properties.

Peninsula Pipeline contracts with both affiliated and non-affiliated customers to provide firm transportation service. All of the contracts provide a fixed annual transportation fee. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , operating revenues of Peninsula Pipeline were $5.1 million , $3.8 million &#32;of which were related to service to FPU under a contract with FPU, which was previously approved by the Florida PSC. Peninsula Pipeline's operating revenue from FPU is eliminated against the cost of sales in consolidation; however, FPU includes this amount in its purchased fuel cost and recovers it through the fuel cost recovery mechanism.

(1) We filed base rate proceedings for Chesapeake Utilities' Delaware division and Sandpiper on December 21, 2015 and December 1, 2015, respectively. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#32;(Note 18, Rates and Other Regulatory Activities , in the Consolidated Financial Statements) for more information. 

(2) The effective date of the order approving the settlement agreement, which adjusted the rates originally approved on June 4, 2009. 

(3) Allowed return on equity. 

(4) Allowed pre-tax, pre-interest rate of return. 

As of December 31, 2015 , our investments in our regulated operations were as follows: $112.7 million &#32;for Delmarva natural gas distribution; $251.0 million &#32;for Florida natural gas and electric distribution; and $166.3 million &#32;for natural gas transmission. 

The terms of the settlement agreement for the FPU electric division rate case prescribe an authorized return on equity range of 9.25 to 11.25 percent, with a mid-point of 10.25 percent. In addition, the FPU electric division cannot file for a base rate increase prior to December 2016, unless its allowed return on equity falls below the authorized range. If the allowed return on equity exceeds the authorized range, the Office of the Public Counsel can seek a rate decrease. 

The terms of the settlement agreement in Eastern Shore&#8217;s most recent base rate proceeding provided a five-year moratorium (which will end on December 31, 2016) on Eastern Shore&#8217;s right to file a base rate increase and other parties&#8217; rights to challenge Eastern Shore&#8217;s rates. However, Eastern Shore is allowed to file for rate adjustments during those five years in the event certain costs related to government-mandated obligations are incurred and Eastern Shore&#8217;s pre-tax earnings do not equal or exceed 13.90 percent. Eastern Shore is also required to file a base rate proceeding by January 2017. 

In May 2013, the Maryland PSC approved our application to acquire the ESG operating assets to transfer the ESG franchises to Sandpiper. The Maryland PSC also approved a new gas service tariff and rates applicable to natural gas and propane distribution customers in Worcester County, Maryland, and directed that Sandpiper file a base rate proceeding within two and one-half years. This proceeding was filed on December 1, 2015. 

Chesapeake Utilities Corporation 2015 Form 10-K Page &#32;6 

In addition to the base rates approved by the PSCs, certain of our local distribution utilities have additional surcharge mechanisms, which were separately approved by their respective PSC. The most notable surcharge mechanisms include Delaware&#8217;s surcharge to increase the availability of natural gas in portions of eastern Sussex County, Delaware; Maryland's surcharge designed to recover the costs associated with conversions to natural gas and to improve infrastructure in Worcester County, Maryland; and Florida&#8217;s GRIP surcharge designed to recover capital and other costs, inclusive of an appropriate return on investment, associated with accelerating the replacement of qualifying distribution mains. 

See &#32; Item 8 , Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#32;(Note 18 , Rates and Other Regulatory Activities, &#32;in the Consolidated Financial Statements) for more information . 

Competition 

Our natural gas and electric distribution operations and our natural gas transmission operations compete with other forms of energy, including natural gas, electricity, oil, propane and other alternative sources of energy. The principal competitive factors are price and, to a lesser extent, accessibility. Our natural gas distribution operations have several large industrial customers that are able to use fuel oil or propane as an alternative to natural gas. When oil or propane prices decline, these interruptible customers may convert to an alternative fuel source to satisfy their fuel requirements, and our sales volumes may decline. To address the uncertainty of alternative fuel prices, we use flexible pricing arrangements on both the supply and sales sides of our business to compete with alternative fuel price fluctuations. 

Large industrial natural gas customers may be able to bypass our distribution and transmission systems and make direct connections with &#8220;upstream&#8221; interstate transmission pipelines when such connections are economically feasible. Certain large industrial electric customers may be capable of generating electricity for their own consumption. Although the risk of bypassing our systems is not considered significant, we may adjust services and rates for these customers to retain their business in certain situations. 

Supplies, Transmission and Storage 

We believe that the availability of supply and transmission of natural gas and electricity is adequate under existing arrangements to meet the anticipated needs of our customers. 

Chesapeake Utilities' Delaware and Maryland divisions use their firm transportation resources to meet a significant percentage of their projected demand requirements. They purchase firm natural gas supplies to meet those projected requirements with purchases of base load, daily spot supplies and storage service. They have both firm and interruptible transportation service contracts with four interstate &#8220;open access&#8221; pipeline companies (Eastern Shore, Transco, Columbia and TETLP) in order to meet customer demand. Their distribution system is directly interconnected with Eastern Shore&#8217;s pipeline, which is directly interconnected with the upstream pipelines of Transco, Columbia and TETLP. 

Chesapeake Utilities' Delaware division has 72,254 Dts of maximum daily firm transportation capacity with Eastern Shore through contracts expiring on various dates between 2016 and 2028. It also has a total of 66,483 Dts of maximum daily firm transportation capacity with three upstream pipelines through contracts expiring between 2016 and 2028. Chesapeake Utilities' Maryland division has 26,448 Dts/d of maximum firm transportation capacity with Eastern Shore through contracts expiring on various dates between 2016 and 2027 and a total of 26,228 Dts/d of maximum firm transportation capacity with three upstream pipelines through contracts expiring between 2016 and 2027. The Delaware and Maryland divisions also have the capability to use propane-air peak-shaving equipment to supplement or displace natural gas purchases. 

Chesapeake Utilities' Delaware and Maryland divisions contract with an unaffiliated energy marketing and risk management company through an asset management agreement to optimize their transportation and storage capacity and secure an adequate supply of natural gas. Pursuant to the asset management agreement, the asset manager pays our divisions a fee, which our divisions share with their customers. The current asset management agreement expires in March 2017. 

Sandpiper is a party to a capacity, supply and operating agreement with EGWIC to purchase propane over a six-year term. Approximately three years &#32;remain under this contract. Sandpiper's current annual commitment is estimated at approximately 6.5 million &#32;gallons. Sandpiper also has 2,450 Dts of maximum daily firm transportation capacity available from Eastern Shore through contracts expiring on various dates between 2016 and 2027. 

In 2015, Chesapeake Utilities' Florida division's previous two firm transportation service agreements with FGT were consolidated under FPU's firm transportation agreements. Chesapeake Utilities' Florida division has a firm transportation service agreement with Gulfstream for firm transportation capacity of 10,000 Dts/d until May 2022. Pursuant to a program approved by the Florida PSC, all of the capacity under this agreement has been released to various third parties, including PESCO. Under the terms of these capacity release agreements, we are contingently liable to Gulfstream, if any party that acquired the capacity through release fails to pay the capacity charge. 

Page &#32;7 &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;Chesapeake Utilities Corporation 2015 Form 10-K 

FPU has firm transportation service agreements with FGT, Florida City Gas and Peninsula Pipeline, ranging from 52,455 to 81,056 Dts/d. These agreements expire on various dates between 2020 and 2035. FPU uses gas marketers and producers to procure all of its gas supplies to meet projected requirements. FPU also uses Peoples Gas to provide wholesale gas sales service in areas far from FPU's interconnections with FGT. 

Eastern Shore has three agreements with Transco for a total of 7,292 Dts/d of firm daily storage injection and withdrawal entitlements and total storage capacity of 288,003 Dts. These agreements expire on various dates between 2018 and 2023. Eastern Shore retains these firm storage services in order to provide swing transportation service and firm storage service to customers requesting such services. 

FPU currently purchases its wholesale electricity primarily from two suppliers, JEA and Gulf Power, under full requirements contracts expiring in December 2017 and 2019, respectively. The JEA contract provides generation and transmission service to northeast Florida. The Gulf Power contract provides generation and transmission service to northwest Florida. FPU also has a renewable energy purchase agreement with Rayonier to purchase between 1.7 MWH and 3.0 MWH of electricity annually through 2036. In September 2014, FPU entered into an agreement with its affiliate, Eight Flags, to purchase up to 20 MWH of electricity from a CHP plant located in Nassau County, Florida, once construction of the plant is completed. Both agreements with Rayonier and Eight Flags will serve a portion of FPU's electric distribution customer load in northeast Florida. 

U NREGULATED &#32;E NERGY 

Our Unregulated Energy segment provides propane distribution, propane wholesale marketing, natural gas marketing, supply, gathering and processing and other unregulated energy-related services to customers. Revenues generated from this segment are not subject to any federal, state or local pricing regulations. Our businesses in this segment typically complement our regulated businesses by offering propane as a fuel source where natural gas is not readily available, or by providing natural gas marketing, supply, gathering and processing services to our customers. Through competitive pricing and supply management, these businesses provide the opportunity to generate returns greater than those of a traditional utility. 

Propane Distribution 

Our propane distribution operations sell propane primarily to residential, commercial/industrial and wholesale customers in Delaware, Maryland, Virginia and in southeastern Pennsylvania through Sharp and Sharpgas, and in Florida through FPU and Flo-gas. Many of our propane distribution customers are &#8220;bulk delivery&#8221; customers. We make deliveries of propane to the bulk delivery customers as needed, based on the level of propane remaining in the tank located at the customer&#8217;s premises. We invoice and record revenues for our bulk delivery service customers at the time of delivery, rather than upon customers&#8217; actual usage, since the customers typically own the propane gas in the tanks on their premises. We also have underground propane distribution systems serving various neighborhoods and communities. Such customers are billed monthly based on actual consumption, which is measured by meters installed on their premises. In Florida, we also offer metered propane distribution service to residential and commercial customers. The customers' tanks are metered, and we read and bill the customers once a month. 

Propane Distribution - Weather 

Revenues from our propane distribution sales activities are affected by seasonal variations in weather conditions. Weather conditions directly influence the volume of propane used by our metered customers or sold and delivered to our bulk customers; specifically, their demand substantially increases during the winter months when propane is used for heating. The timing of deliveries to the bulk delivery customers can also vary significantly from year to year depending on weather variation. Accordingly, the propane volumes sold for heating are directly affected by the severity of winter weather and can vary substantially from year to year. Sustained warmer-than-normal temperatures will tend to reduce propane use, while sustained colder-than-normal temperatures will tend to increase consumption.

Propane Distribution - Competition 

We compete with several other propane distributors in our geographic markets, primarily on the basis of price and service. Our competitors generally include local outlets of national distributors and local independent distributors, whose proximity to customers entails lower costs to provide service. As an energy source, propane competes with home heating oil and electricity, which are typically more expensive (based on equivalent unit of heat value). Since natural gas has historically been less expensive than propane, propane is generally not distributed in geographic areas served by natural gas pipelines or distribution systems. 

Propane Distribution - Supplies, Transportation and Storage 

We purchase propane for our propane distribution operations primarily from suppliers, including major oil companies, independent producers of natural gas liquids and from Xeron. Although supplies of propane from these and other sources are generally readily available for purchase, extreme market conditions, such as significant fluctuation in weather, closing of refineries and disruption in supply chains, could result in a reduction in available supplies. 

Propane is transported by trucks and railroad cars from refineries, natural gas processing plants or pipeline terminals to our bulk storage facilities. We own various bulk propane storage facilities with an aggregate capacity of approximately 4.1 million &#32;gallons in Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida. From these storage facilities, propane is delivered by &#8220;bobtail&#8221; trucks, owned and operated by us, to tanks located at the customers&#8217; premises. 

Propane Wholesale Marketing 

Through Xeron, we market propane and crude oil to major independent oil and petrochemical companies, wholesale resellers and retail propane companies located primarily in the southeastern United States. Xeron enters into forward contracts with various counterparties to commit to purchase or sell an agreed-upon quantity of propane and crude oil at an agreed-upon price at a specified future date, which typically ranges from one to six months from the execution of the contract. At the expiration of the forward 

Page &#32;9 &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;Chesapeake Utilities Corporation 2015 Form 10-K 

contracts, Xeron typically settles its purchases and sales financially, without taking physical delivery of the propane or crude oil. Xeron also enters into futures and other option contracts that are traded on the InterContinentalExchange, Inc. The level and profitability of the propane and crude oil wholesale marketing activity is affected by both propane and crude oil wholesale price volatility and liquidity in the wholesale market. In 2015 , Xeron had operating revenues, net of the associated cost of propane and crude oil sold, totaling approximately $301,000 . For further discussion of Xeron&#8217;s wholesale marketing activities, market risks and controls that monitor Xeron&#8217;s risks, refer to Item 7A, Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Market Risk. Xeron does not own physical storage facilities or equipment to transport propane or crude oil; however, it contracts for storage and pipeline capacity to facilitate the sale of propane and crude oil on a wholesale basis. 

Natural Gas Marketing 

We provide natural gas supply and supply management services through PESCO to 2,996 customers in Florida, 30 customers located primarily on the Delmarva Peninsula and five customers operating in other states. In 2015 , PESCO had operating revenues of $42.0 million &#32;in Florida, $7.5 million &#32;from customers located primarily on the Delmarva Peninsula and $6.8 million &#32;from other customers. PESCO competes with regulated utilities and other unregulated third-party marketers to sell natural gas supplies directly to commercial and industrial customers through competitively-priced contracts. PESCO does not own or operate any natural gas transmission or distribution assets. The gas that PESCO sells is delivered to retail customers through affiliated and non-affiliated local distribution company systems and transmission pipelines. PESCO bills its customers directly or through the billing services of the regulated utilities that deliver the gas. 

Other Unregulated Natural Gas Services 

On April 1, 2015, we completed the merger with Gatherco, in which Gatherco merged with and into Aspire Energy, a then newly formed, wholly-owned subsidiary of Chesapeake Utilities. As a result, Aspire Energy is an unregulated natural gas infrastructure company with approximately 2,500 miles of pipeline systems in 40 counties throughout Ohio. The majority of Aspire Energy&#8217;s margin is derived from long-term supply agreements with Columbia Gas of Ohio and Consumers Gas Cooperative, which together serve more than 20,000 end-use customers. Aspire Energy primarily sources gas from 300 conventional producers and provides gathering and processing services necessary to maintain quality and reliability to its wholesale markets. 

For the period from April 1, 2015 (the date the merger closed) to December 31, 2015 , operating revenues and deliveries by customer class were as follows:

Other Unregulated Businesses 

We provide heating, ventilation and air conditioning, plumbing and electrical services to residential, commercial and industrial customers throughout the lower Delmarva Peninsula. FPU sells energy-related merchandise in Florida. Operating revenues in 2015 &#32;from these other unregulated businesses totaled $5.3 million . 

O THER B USINESSES 

Overview 

Other businesses consists primarily of other unregulated subsidiaries, including Skipjack and ESRE that own real estate leased to affiliates; and certain unallocated corporate costs, which are not directly attributable to a specific business unit. Skipjack and ESRE own and lease office buildings in Delaware and Maryland to divisions and other subsidiaries of Chesapeake Utilities.

E NVIRONMENTAL &#32;C OMPLIANCE 

We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control. These laws and regulations require us to remove or remediate the effect on the environment of the disposal or release of specified substances at current and former operating sites. We have participated in the investigation, assessment or remediation, and have exposures at seven former MGP sites. At December 31, 2015 , we have recorded $10.6 million &#32;in environmental liabilities associated with these MGP sites, representing our estimate of future costs principally related to two of the seven former MGP sites. The most significant site is located in West Palm Beach, Florida, where FPU previously operated an MGP and is currently implementing a remedial plan approved by the FDEP. The estimated cost of remediation for the West Palm Beach site ranges from approximately $4.5 million &#32;to $15.4 million . We are also currently assessing a remediation plan and actively remediating a former MGP site in Winter Haven, Florida. The estimated cost of remediation for the Winter Haven site is not expected to exceed $443,000 . We have entered into a voluntary clean-up program for our former MGP site in Seaford Delaware, where the cost of potential remedial actions for the site is estimated to be between $273,000 &#32;and $465,000 . We are also discussing with the MDE another former MGP site in Maryland. 

Base rates of our local distribution utilities include, or are expected to include, recovery of environmental remediation costs adequate to fully recover our current estimate of remediation costs. We continue to expect that any costs related to environmental remediation and related activities beyond our current estimate will also be recoverable from customers through rates. 

We completed the investigation, assessment and remediation of eight natural gas pipeline facilities in Ohio that Aspire Energy acquired from Gatherco pursuant to the merger. The costs incurred to date associated with remediation activities for these facilities, is approximately $1.0 million . Pursuant to the merger agreement, an escrow was established to fund certain claims by Chesapeake Utilities and Aspire Energy for indemnification by Gatherco, including environmental claims. Gatherco's indemnification obligations for environmental matters apply to remediation costs in excess of $431,250 &#32;and are capped at $1.65 million . We expect to be reimbursed for substantially all remediation costs we have incurred to date associated with these pipeline facilities in excess of $431,250. 

For additional information on each site, refer to Item 8 , Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#32;(see Note 19 , Environmental Commitments and Contingencies &#32;in the Consolidated Financial Statements). &#32;&#32;&#32; 

E MPLOYEES 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had a total of 832 &#32;employees, 116 &#32;of whom are union employees represented by two labor unions: the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and Commercial Workers Union, whose collective bargaining agreements expire in 2019.
