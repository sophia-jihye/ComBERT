 Item 1. Business 

General 

EPR Properties (&#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;EPR&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was formed on August 22, 1997 as a Maryland real estate investment trust (&#8220;REIT&#8221;), and an initial public offering of our common shares of beneficial interest (&#8220;common shares&#8221;) was completed on November 18, 1997. Since that time, the Company has grown into a leading specialty REIT with an investment portfolio that includes primarily entertainment, education and recreation properties. The underwriting of our investments is centered on key industry and property cash flow criteria. As further explained under &#8220;Growth Strategies&#8221; below, our investments are also guided by a focus on inflection opportunities that are associated with or support enduring uses, excellent executions, attractive economics and an advantageous market position. 

We are a self-administered REIT. As of December 31, 2015 , our total assets exceeded $4.2 billion &#32;(after accumulated depreciation of approximately $0.5 billion ). Our investments are generally structured as long-term triple-net leases that require the tenants to pay substantially all expenses associated with the operation and maintenance of the property, or as long-term mortgages with economics similar to our triple-net lease structure. 

Our total investments were approximately $4.6 billion &#32;at December 31, 2015 . Total investments is defined herein as the sum of the carrying values of rental properties (before accumulated depreciation), land held for development, property under development, mortgage notes receivable (including related accrued interest receivable), net, investment in a direct financing lease, net, investment in joint ventures, intangible assets (before accumulated amortization) and notes receivable and related accrued interest receivable, net. Below is a reconciliation of the carrying value of total investments to the constituent items in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015 &#32;(in thousands):

Management believes that total investments is a useful measure for management and investors as it illustrates across which asset categories the Company&#8217;s funds have been invested. Total investments is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not a substitute for total assets under GAAP. It is most directly comparable to the GAAP measure, &#8220;Total assets&#8221;. Furthermore, total investments may not be comparable to similarly titled financial measures reported by other companies due to differences in the way the Company calculates this measure.

For financial reporting purposes, we group our investments into four reportable operating segments: Entertainment, Education, Recreation and Other. Our total investments of approximately $4.6 billion &#32;at December 31, 2015 &#32;consisted of interests in the following: 

&#8226; 

$2.5 billion &#32;or 53% related to entertainment properties, which includes megaplex theatres, entertainment retail centers (centers typically anchored by an entertainment component such as a megaplex theatre or live performance venue and containing other entertainment-related or retail properties), family entertainment centers and other retail parcels; 

&#8226; 

$1.0 billion &#32;or 22% related to education properties, which consists of investments in public charter schools, early education centers and K-12 private schools; 

&#8226; 

$943.3 million &#32;or 21% related to recreation properties, which includes metro ski parks and waterparks and golf entertainment complexes; and 

&#8226; 

$203.4 million &#32;or 4% related to other properties, which consists primarily of $200.9 million related to the Adelaar casino and resort project in Sullivan County, New York (excluding $38.7 million related to the Adelaar indoor waterpark project included in recreation). 

As further described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, during the year ended December 31, 2015 , $33.7 million , or approximately 8% &#32;of our total revenue was derived from our four entertainment retail centers in Ontario, Canada. The Company&#8217;s wholly owned subsidiaries that hold the Canadian entertainment retail centers represent approximately $169.7 million &#32;or 8% &#32;of the Company&#8217;s equity as of December 31, 2015 . 

We believe entertainment, education and recreation are highly enduring sectors of the real estate industry and that, as a result of our focus on properties in these sectors, industry relationships and the knowledge of our management, we have a competitive advantage in providing capital to operators of these types of properties. We believe this focused niche approach offers the potential for higher growth and better yields. 

We believe our management&#8217;s knowledge and industry relationships have facilitated favorable opportunities for us to acquire, finance and lease properties. Historically, our primary challenges have been locating suitable properties, negotiating favorable lease or financing terms, and managing our real estate portfolio as we have continued to grow. We are particularly focused on property categories which allow us to use our experience to mitigate some of the risks inherent in the current economic environment. We cannot provide any assurance that any such potential investment or acquisition opportunities will arise in the near future, or that we will actively pursue any such opportunities. 

Although we are primarily a long-term investor, we may also sell assets if we believe that it is in the best interest of our shareholders. 

Entertainment 

As of December 31, 2015 , our Entertainment segment consisted of investments in megaplex theatres, entertainment retail centers, family entertainment centers and other retail parcels totaling approximately $2.5 billion &#32;with interests in: 

&#8226; 

131 &#32;megaplex theatre properties located in 34 states and Ontario, Canada; 

&#8226; 

nine &#32;entertainment retail centers (which include eight &#32;additional megaplex theatre properties and one &#32;live performance venue) located in Westminster, Colorado; New Rochelle, New York; Burbank, California; Suffolk, Virginia; Charlotte, North Carolina; and Ontario, Canada; 

&#8226; 

seven &#32;family entertainment centers located in Illinois, Indiana and Florida; 

&#8226; 

land parcels leased to restaurant and retail operators adjacent to several of our theatre properties; 

&#8226; 

$23.6 million in construction in progress primarily for real estate development for two megaplex theatres and redevelopment of two of our existing megaplex theatres as well as eight other retail redevelopment projects; and 

&#8226; 

$4.5 million in undeveloped land inventory. 

As of December 31, 2015 , our owned real estate portfolio of megaplex theatre properties consisted of approximately 10.0 million &#32;square feet and was 100% &#32;leased and our remaining owned entertainment real estate portfolio consisted of 1.8 million square feet and was 87% leased. The combined owned entertainment real estate portfolio consisted of 11.8 million &#32;square feet and was 98% &#32;leased. Our owned theatre properties are leased to 15 different leading theatre operators. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , approximately 20% &#32;of our total revenue was derived from rental payments by American Multi-Cinema, Inc. ("AMC"). 

A significant portion of our assets consist of megaplex theatres. Megaplex theatres typically are multi-screen with stadium-style seating (seating with elevation between rows to provide unobstructed viewing) and provide a significantly enhanced audio and visual experience for the patron versus other formats. Many theater operators continue to expand their food and beverage offerings, including the introduction of in-theatre dining options and alcohol availability. In addition, as exhibitors further increase their focus on enhancing the customer experience, more spacious and comfortable seating options are being introduced in some theatres, including fully reclining seats. The introduction of these seating options has required theatre operators to make physical changes to the existing seating arrangements that can result in a significant loss of existing seats. However, favorable customer response to these changes generally has significantly increased ticket sales and food and beverage revenue at impacted locations, overcoming the loss of seats and creating a net positive for the theatre operator. 

The success of several of our larger 24 and 30 screen properties has resulted in other exhibitors building properties that have reduced the 20 to 25 mile customer drawing range that these properties previously enjoyed. As a result of this and other competitive pressures, in some cases we have, at the expiration of the primary term of a lease, reduced the rental rate per square foot and/or reduced the number of screens at a property to better reflect the existing market demands. Such screen reductions may occur in the future as well but these reductions do create an opportunity to reclaim a portion of the former theatre or parking lot for conversion to another use, while retaining the majority of the building for the newly re-configured theatre. In addition to positioning expiring theatre assets for continued success, the redevelopment of these assets creates an opportunity to diversify the Company's tenant base. 

The theatre box office had a very strong year in 2015 with increased attendance and revenues reaching an all-time high of over $11 billion per Box Office Analyst, and we expect the development of new megaplex theatres and the conversion or partial conversion of existing theatres to enhanced amenity formats to continue in the United States and abroad over the long-term. As a result of the significant capital commitment involved in building new megaplex theatres and redeveloping existing theatres, as well as the experience and industry relationships of our management, we believe we will continue to have opportunities to provide capital to exhibition businesses in the future. 

We also continue to seek opportunities for the development of additional restaurant, retail and other entertainment venues around our existing portfolio. The opportunity to capitalize on the traffic generation of our market-dominant 

theatres to create entertainment retail centers (&#8220;ERCs&#8221;) not only strengthens the execution of the megaplex theatre but adds diversity to our tenant and asset base. We have and will continue to evaluate our existing portfolio for additional development of retail and entertainment density, and we will also continue to evaluate the purchase or financing of existing ERCs that have demonstrated strong financial performance and meet our quality standards. The leasing and property management requirements of our ERCs are generally met through the use of third-party professional service providers. 

Our family entertainment center operators offer a variety of entertainment options including live performance, bowling and bocce ball as well as an observation deck on the 94th floor of the John Hancock building in downtown Chicago, Illinois. We will continue to evaluate the development, purchase or financing of family entertainment centers. 

We will continue to seek opportunities for the development of, or acquisition of, other entertainment related properties that leverage our expertise in this area. 

Education 

As of December 31, 2015 , our Education segment consisted of investments in public charter schools, early education centers and K-12 private schools totaling approximately $1.0 billion &#32;with interests in: 

&#8226; 

70 &#32;public charter school properties located in 18 states and the District of Columbia; 

&#8226; 

18 &#32;early education centers located in six states; 

&#8226; 

two &#32;K-12 private schools located in New York and Illinois and one &#32;5-12 private school located in California; and 

&#8226; 

$112.8 million in construction in progress for real estate development or expansion of 11 public charter schools, 14 early education centers and one K-12 private school. 

As of December 31, 2015 , our owned education real estate portfolio consisted of approximately 4.2 million &#32;square feet and was 100% &#32;leased. We have 39 &#32;different operators for our owned public charter schools. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , approximately 6% of our total revenue was derived from rental payments by Imagine. 

Public charter schools are tuition-free, independent schools that are publicly funded by local, state and federal tax dollars based on enrollment. Driven by the need to improve the quality of public education and provide more school choices in the U.S., public charter schools are one of the fastest growing segments of the multi-billion dollar educational facilities sector, and we believe a critical need exists for the financing of new and refurbished educational facilities. To meet this need, we have established relationships with public charter school operators, authorizers and developers across the country and expect to continue to develop our leadership position in providing real estate financing in this area. Public charter schools are operated pursuant to charters granted by various state or other regulatory authorities and are dependent upon funding from local, state and federal tax dollars. Like public schools, public charter schools are required to meet both state and federal academic standards. 

Various government bodies that provide educational funding have pressure to reduce their spending budgets and have reduced educational funding in some cases and may continue to reduce educational funding in the future. This can impact our tenants' operations and potentially their ability to pay our scheduled rent. However, these reductions differ state by state and have historically been more significant at the post-secondary education level than at the K-12 level that our tenants serve. Furthermore, while there can be no assurance as to the level of these cuts, we analyze each state's fiscal situation and commitment to the charter school movement before providing financing in a new state, and also factor in anticipated reductions (as applicable) in the states in which we do decide to do business. 

Many of our public charter school lease and mortgage agreements contain purchase or prepayment options whereby the tenant can acquire the property or prepay the mortgage loan for a premium over the total development cost at certain points during the terms of the agreements. If these schools meet certain criteria, the tenants may be able to obtain bond financing at lower rates and therefore be motivated to exercise these options. We do not anticipate that all of these options will be exercised but cannot determine at this time the amount or timing of such option exercises. In accordance with GAAP, prepayment penalties related to mortgage agreements are included in mortgage and other financing income 

and are included in FFO as adjusted (See Item 7 &#8211; &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Funds From Operations&#8221; for a discussion of FFO and FFO as adjusted, which are non-GAAP measures). However, if a tenant exercises the option to purchase a property under lease, GAAP requires that a gain on sale be recognized for the amount of cash received over the carrying value of the property and gains on sale are typically excluded from FFO as adjusted. Accordingly, for consistency in presentation and with the wording and intent of the lease provisions, we treat the premium over the total development cost (i.e. the undepreciated cost) as a termination fee and include such fees in FFO as adjusted, and only the difference between the total development cost and the carrying value is treated as gain on sale and excluded from FFO as adjusted. No such termination fees related to public charter school buy-outs have been recorded through December 31, 2015, but we anticipate recording such amounts beginning in 2016. 

As of December 31, 2015 , the number of properties potentially impacted by option exercises, the total development cost and the total estimated amount of the prepayment penalties or lease termination fees in the first option period by year are as follows (dollars in thousands):

(1) Subsequent to December 31, 2015, a mortgage note was prepaid on January 5, 2016. In connection with the full payoff of this note, the Company received a prepayment penalty of $3.6 million. 

As with public charter schools, the Company's expansion into both early childhood education centers and private schools is supported by strong unmet demand, and we expect to increase our investment in both of these areas. 

Early childhood education centers continue to see demand due to the proliferation of dual income families and the increasing emphasis on early childhood education, beyond traditional daycare. There is increased demand for curriculum-based, child-centered learning. Within this property type, larger centers with more amenities are emerging and enjoying enhanced economies of scale. We believe this property type is a logical extension of our education platform and allows us to increase our diversity and geographical reach with these assets. 

Within private schools, we believe K-12 private education has significant growth potential for schools that have differentiated, high quality offerings. Many private schools in large urban and suburban areas are at capacity and have large waiting lists making admission more difficult. The demand for nonsectarian private education has increased in recent years as parents and students become more focused on the comprehensive impact of a strong school environment. 

During 2015, our Education segment was our fastest growing segment and we will continue to seek opportunities for the development of, or acquisition of, other education related properties that leverage our expertise in this area. 

Recreation 

As of December 31, 2015 , our Recreation segment consisted of investments in metro ski parks, resorts, waterparks and golf entertainment complexes totaling approximately $943.3 million &#32;with interests in: 

&#8226; 

10 metro ski parks located in Ohio, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Virginia; 

&#8226; 

five &#32;waterparks located in Kansas, Texas and Pennsylvania; 

&#8226; 

19 &#32;golf entertainment complexes in nine states; and 

&#8226; 

$59.5 million in construction in progress for three golf entertainment complexes and the development of an indoor waterpark hotel at the Adelaar casino and resort project located in Sullivan County, New York. 

As of December 31, 2015 , our owned recreation real estate portfolio was 100% &#32;leased. 

Our metro ski parks are leased to or we have mortgages receivable from four different operators, the largest operator of which is Peak Resorts, Inc. ("Peak"). For the year ended December 31, 2015 , approximately 3% of our total revenue related to Peak. 

Our daily attendance ski park model provides a sustainable advantage for the value conscious consumer, providing outdoor entertainment during the winter. All of the ski parks that serve as collateral for our mortgage notes in this area, as well as our three owned properties, offer snowmaking capabilities and provide a variety of terrains and vertical drop options. We believe that the primary appeal of our ski parks lies in the convenient, low cost and reliable experience consumers can expect. Given that all of our ski parks are located near major metropolitan areas, they offer skiing and snowboarding without the expense, travel, or lengthy preparations of remote ski resorts. Furthermore, advanced snowmaking capabilities increase the reliability of the experience versus other ski areas that do not have such capabilities. We expect to continue to pursue opportunities in this area. 

Our three waterparks located in Kansas and Texas offer innovative attractions that attract a diverse segment of customers. These waterparks serve as collateral for our mortgage notes and are operated by Schlitterbahn Waterparks and Resorts, an industry leader. Our other two waterparks, located in Pennsylvania, are leased to the operator of Camelback Mountain Ski Resort and include an indoor waterpark hotel and an outdoor waterpark as well as an adventure park. We also have an indoor waterpark hotel in process at the Adelaar project in Sullivan County, New York. As many waterparks are growing from single-day attendance to a destination getaway, we believe indoor waterpark hotels increase the four-season appeal at many resorts. We will continue to pursue opportunities in this area. 

Our golf entertainment complexes are leased to, or under mortgage with, Topgolf, which combines golf with entertainment, competition and food and beverage service. By combining an interactive entertainment and food and beverage experience with a long-lived recreational activity, we believe Topgolf provides an innovative, enjoyable and repeatable customer experience. We expect to continue to pursue opportunities related to golf entertainment complexes. 

We will continue to seek opportunities for the development of, or acquisition of, other recreation related properties that leverage our expertise in this area. 

&#160; 

Other 

As of December 31, 2015 , our Other segment consisted of investments totaling approximately $203.4 million &#32;with interests in: 

&#8226; 

$183.0 million in construction in progress for development of the casino, golf course, entertainment village and infrastructure related to the Adelaar casino and resort project in Sullivan County, New York; 

&#8226; 

$17.9 million related to undeveloped land inventory at our Adelaar casino and resort project in Sullivan County, New York; and 

&#8226; 

$2.5 million in mortgage financing related to one sold winery property. 

In December 2015, a subsidiary of Empire Resorts, Inc. ("Empire Resorts") was awarded a New York gaming license to operate the Montreign Resort Casino (the &#8220;Casino Project&#8221;), which will be located within our Adelaar project in Sullivan County, New York. The Adelaar project will initially consist of the Casino Project, an indoor waterpark hotel (the &#8220;Waterpark Project&#8221;), a redesigned golf course (the &#8220;Golf Course&#8221;) and an entertainment village, which will include retail, restaurant, shopping and entertainment (the &#8220;Entertainment Village&#8221;). Also in December 2015, we entered into 70-year ground leases (terminable by the lessee after 20 years) with subsidiaries of Empire Resorts for the three parcels 

of land upon which the Casino Project, Golf Course and Entertainment Village are located and granted these entities a purchase option for parcels. The Company has committed to the build-to-suit development of the Waterpark Project to be leased to a waterpark operator, and the Company anticipates funding between $100.0 million to $120.0 million over the next three years. For additional information regarding this project, see Item 7 - &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Recent Developments - Adelaar Casino and Resort Project in Sullivan County, New York.&#8221; 

Business Objectives and Strategies 

Our vision is to become the leading specialty REIT by focusing our unique knowledge and resources on select underserved real estate segments which provide the potential for outsized returns. 

Our long-term primary business objective is to enhance shareholder value by achieving predictable and increasing Funds From Operations (&#8220;FFO&#8221;) and dividends per share (See Item 7 &#8211; &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Funds From Operations&#8221; for a discussion of FFO, which is a non-GAAP measure). Our prevailing strategy is to focus on long-term investments in a limited number of categories in which we maintain a depth of knowledge and relationships, and which we believe offer sustained performance throughout all economic cycles. We intend to achieve this objective by continuing to execute the Growth Strategies, Operating Strategies and Capitalization Strategies described below. 

Growth Strategies 

Central to our growth is remaining focused on acquiring or developing properties in our primary investment segments: Entertainment, Education and Recreation. We may also pursue opportunities to provide mortgage financing for these investment segments in certain situations where this structure is more advantageous than owning the underlying real estate. 

Our segment focus is consistent with our strategic organizational design which is structured around building centers of knowledge and strong operating competencies in each of our primary segments. Retention and building of this knowledge depth creates a competitive advantage allowing us to more quickly identify key market trends. 

To this end, we will deliberately apply information and our ingenuity to identify properties which represent potential logical extensions within each of our segments, or potential future investment segments. As part of our strategic planning and portfolio management process we assess new opportunities against the following five key underwriting principles: 

Inflection Opportunity 

&#8226; 

Specialty versus commodity real estate 

&#8226; 

New or emerging generation of real estate as a result of age, technology or change in consumer lifestyle or habits 

Enduring Value 

&#8226; 

Underlying activity long-lived 

&#8226; 

Real estate that supports commercially successful activities 

&#8226; 

Outlook for business stable or growing 

Excellent Execution 

&#8226; 

Best-of-class executions that create market-dominant properties 

&#8226; 

Sustainable customer demand within the category despite a potential change in tenancy 

&#8226; 

Tenants with a reliable track record of customer service and satisfaction 

Attractive Economics 

&#8226; 

Initially accretive with escalating yield over time 

&#8226; 

Rent participation features which allow for participation in financial performance 

&#8226; 

Scalable depth of opportunity 

&#8226; 

Strong, stable rent coverage and the potential for cross default features 

Advantageous Position 

&#8226; 

First mover advantage and/or dominant player in real estate ownership or financing 

&#8226; 

Preferred tenant or borrower relationship that provides access to sites and development projects 

&#8226; 

Data available to assess and monitor performance 

Operating Strategies 

Lease Risk Minimization 

To avoid initial lease-up risks and produce a predictable income stream, we typically acquire or develop single-tenant properties that are leased under long-term leases. We believe our willingness to make long-term investments in properties offers our tenants financial flexibility and allows tenants to allocate capital to their core businesses. Although we will continue to emphasize single-tenant properties, we have acquired or developed, and may continue to acquire or develop, multi-tenant properties we believe add shareholder value. 

Lease Structure 

We have structured our leasing arrangements to achieve a positive spread between our cost of capital and the rents paid by our tenants. We typically structure leases on a triple-net basis under which the tenants bear the principal portion of the financial and operational responsibility for the properties. During each lease term and any renewal periods, the leases typically provide for periodic increases in rent and/or percentage rent based upon a percentage of the tenant&#8217;s gross sales over a pre-determined level. In our multi-tenant property leases and some of our theatre leases, we generally require the tenant to pay a common area maintenance (&#8220;CAM&#8221;) charge to defray its pro rata share of insurance, taxes and maintenance costs. 

Mortgage Structure 

We have structured our mortgages to achieve economics similar to our triple-net lease structure with a positive spread between our cost of capital and the interest paid by our tenants. During each mortgage term and any renewal periods, the notes typically provide for periodic increases in interest and/or participating features based upon a percentage of the tenant&#8217;s gross sales over a pre-determined level. 

Development and Redevelopment 

We intend to continue developing properties and redeveloping existing properties that meet our guiding principles. We generally do not begin development of a single-tenant property without a signed lease providing for rental payments during the development period that are commensurate with our level of capital investment. In the case of a multi-tenant development, we generally require a significant amount of the development to be pre-leased prior to construction to minimize lease-up risks. In addition, to minimize overhead costs and to provide the greatest amount of flexibility, we generally outsource construction management to third-party firms. 

We believe our build-to-suit development program is a competitive advantage. First, we believe our strong relationships with our tenants and developers drive new investment opportunities that are often exclusive to us, rather than bid broadly, and with our deep knowledge of their businesses, we believe we are a value-added partner in the underwriting of each new investment. Second, we offer financing from start to finish for a build-to-suit project such that there is no need for a tenant to seek separate construction and permanent financing, which we believe makes us a more attractive partner. Third, we are actively developing strong relationships with tenants in our select segments leading to multiple investments without strict investment portfolio allocations. Finally, multiple investments with the same tenant allows us in most cases to include cross-default provisions in our lease or financing contracts, meaning a default in an obligation to us at one location is a default under all obligations with that tenant. 

We will also investigate opportunities to redevelop certain of our existing properties. We may redevelop properties in conjunction with a lease renewal or new tenant, or we may redevelop properties that have more earnings potential due to the redevelopment. Additionally, certain of our properties have excess land where we will proactively seek opportunities to further develop. 

Tenant and Customer Relationships 

We intend to continue developing and maintaining long-term working relationships with entertainment, education, recreation and other specialty business operators and developers by providing capital for multiple properties on an international, national or regional basis, thereby creating efficiency and value for both the operators and the Company. 

Portfolio Diversification 

We will endeavor to further diversify our asset base by property type, geographic location and tenant or customer. In pursuing this diversification strategy, we will target entertainment, education, recreation and other specialty business operators that we view as leaders in their market segments and have the ability to compete effectively and perform under their agreements with the Company. 

Dispositions 

We will consider property dispositions for reasons such as creating price awareness of a certain property type, opportunistically taking advantage of an above market offer or reducing exposure related to a certain tenant, property type or geographic area. 

Capitalization Strategies 

Debt and Equity Financing 

Our debt to gross assets ratio (i.e. debt of the Company as a percentage of total assets plus accumulated depreciation) was 42% &#32;at December 31, 2015 . We expect to maintain a debt to gross assets ratio of between 35% and 45% going forward. While maintaining lower leverage mitigates the growth in per share results, we believe lower leverage and an emphasis on liquidity are prudent during the current economic environment. 

We rely primarily on an unsecured debt structure and expect to continue to pay off our existing secured debt. In the future, while we may obtain secured debt from time to time or assume secured debt financing obligations in acquisitions, we intend to issue primarily unsecured debt securities to satisfy our debt financing needs. We believe this strategy increases our access to capital and permit us to more efficiently match available debt and equity financing to our ongoing capital requirements. 

Our sources of equity financing consist of the issuance of common shares as well as the issuance of preferred shares (including convertible preferred shares). In addition to larger underwritten registered public offerings of both common and preferred shares, we have also offered shares pursuant to registered public offerings through the direct share purchase component of our Dividend Reinvestment and Direct Share Purchase Plan (&#8220;DSP Plan&#8221;). While such offerings are generally smaller than a typical underwritten public offering, issuing common shares under the direct share purchase component of our DSP Plan allows us to access capital on a more frequent basis in a cost-effective manner. We expect to opportunistically access the equity markets in the future and, depending primarily on the size and timing of our equity capital needs, may continue to issue shares under the direct share purchase component of our DSP Plan. Furthermore, we may issue shares in connection with acquisitions in the future. 

Joint Ventures 

We will examine and may pursue potential additional joint venture opportunities with institutional investors or developers if the investments to which they relate meet our guiding principles discussed above. We may employ higher leverage in joint ventures. 

Payment of Regular Dividends 

We began paying dividend distributions to our common shareholders on a monthly basis (as opposed to a quarterly basis) in the second quarter of 2013 and expect to continue to do so in the future. We expect to continue to pay dividend distributions to our preferred shareholders on a quarterly basis. Our Series C cumulative convertible preferred shares (&#8220;Series C preferred shares&#8221;) have a dividend rate of 5.75%, our Series E cumulative convertible preferred shares (&#8220;Series E preferred shares&#8221;) have a dividend rate of 9.00% and our Series F cumulative redeemable preferred shares ("Series F preferred shares") have a dividend rate of 6.625%. Among the factors the Company&#8217;s board of trustees (&#8220;Board of Trustees&#8221;) considers in setting the common share dividend rate are the applicable REIT tax rules and regulations that apply to dividends, the Company&#8217;s results of operations, including FFO and FFO as adjusted per share, and the Company&#8217;s Cash Available for Distribution (defined as net cash flow available for distribution after payment of operating expenses, debt service, preferred dividends and other obligations). 

Competition 

We compete for real estate financing opportunities with other companies that invest in real estate, as well as traditional financial sources such as banks and insurance companies. REITs have financed, and may continue to seek to finance, entertainment, education, recreation and other specialty properties as new properties are developed or become available for acquisition. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had 49 full-time employees.
