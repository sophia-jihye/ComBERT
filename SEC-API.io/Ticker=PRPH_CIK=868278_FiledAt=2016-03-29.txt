General Development of Business 

&#160; 

We are a manufacturer, marketer and distributor of a diversified range of homeopathic and health care products that are offered to the general public. We are also engaged in the research and development of potential over-the-counter (&#8220;OTC&#8221;) drug, natural base health products along with supplements, personal care and cosmeceutical products. 

&#160; 

Our primary business is the manufacture, distribution, marketing and sale of OTC health care and cold remedy products to consumers through national chain, regional, specialty and local retail stores. Our flagship brand is Cold-EEZE &#174; and our principal product is Cold-EEZE &#174; cold remedy zinc gluconate lozenges, proven in clinical studies to reduce the duration and severity of symptoms of the common cold. In addition to Cold-EEZE &#174; cold remedy lozenges, we market and distribute non-lozenge forms of our proprietary zinc gluconate formulation, (i) Cold-EEZE &#174; cold remedy QuickMelts &#174; and (ii) Cold-EEZE &#174; cold remedy Oral Spray. In Fiscal 2013, we expanded our Cold-EEZE &#174; cold remedy QuickMelts &#174; product line and began shipments to retailers in July 2013 Cold-EEZE &#174; Plus Immune Support + Energy QuickMelts &#174; . In Fiscal 2014 we began shipments in June 2014 of Cold-EEZE &#174; Plus Natural Multi-Symptom QuickMelts &#174; . Each of these new Cold-EEZE &#174; QuickMelts &#174; products are based on our proprietary zinc gluconate formulation in combination with certain natural (i) immune system support, (ii) energy, (iii) sleep and relaxation, and/or (iv) cold and flu symptom relieving active ingredients. In Fiscal 2015, we introduced three new Cold-EEZE &#174; product line extensions: (i) a Cold-EEZE &#174; Multi-Symptom Relief for Cold and Flu lozenge, (ii) a Cold-EEZE &#174; Daytime and Nighttime Multi-Symptom Relief in liquid form for each of adults and children, and (iii) Cold-EEZE &#174; Natural Allergy Relief caplets for indoor and outdoor allergies. Shipments for these three new Cold-EEZE &#174; product line extensions began in the third quarter of Fiscal 2015. 

&#160; 

Cold-EEZE &#174; is an established product in the health care and cough-cold market. For Fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, our revenues have come principally from our OTC health care and cold remedy products. For Fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, our net sales for each period were related to markets in the United States. 

&#160; 

We use a December 31 year-end for financial reporting purposes. References herein to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 shall be the term &#8220;Fiscal 2015&#8221; and references to other &#8220;Fiscal&#8221; years shall mean the year, which ended on December 31 of the year indicated. 

&#160; 

We were initially organized as a corporation in Nevada in July 1989. Effective June 18, 2015, we changed our state of incorporation from the State of Nevada to the State of Delaware. Our principal executive offices are located at 621 N. Shady Retreat Road, Doylestown, Pennsylvania 18901 and our telephone number is 215-345-0919. The terms, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221; and the &#8220;Company&#8221; refer to the Company together with its consolidated subsidiaries unless the context otherwise requires.

Description of Business Operations 

&#160; 

Cold-EEZE &#174; is our most popular OTC health care and cold remedy product. Cold-EEZE cold remedy lozenges, QuickMelts &#174; and Oral Spray product benefits are derived from our proprietary zinc gluconate formulation. Cold-EEZE &#174; cold remedy lozenges effectiveness has been substantiated in two double-blind clinical studies proving that Cold-EEZE &#174; cold remedy lozenges reduce the duration of the common cold by 42%. We acquired worldwide manufacturing and distribution rights to our lozenge formulation in 1992 and commenced national marketing in 1996. In addition to our lozenge product, the Cold-EEZE &#174; Cold Remedy proprietary zinc gluconate formulation is available in two additional cold remedy delivery forms, (i) a fast dissolving QuickMelt and (ii) an Oral Spray. We also offer our product line extensions (i) Cold-EEZE &#174; Daytime and Nighttime Multi-Symptom Relief in liquid for each of adults and children (ii) Cold-EEZE &#174; Natural Allergy Relief caplets for indoor and outdoor allergies. The demand for our OTC cold remedy products is seasonal and the first and fourth quarters of each year generally have the largest sales volume. 

&#160; 

Our business operations are concentrated on the development, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of our proprietary Cold-EEZE &#174; cold remedy lozenge products and on the development of various product extensions. Our product line of OTC health care and cold remedy products are reviewed regularly to identify new consumer opportunities and/or trends in flavor, convenience, packaging and delivery systems or forms to help improve market share for our products. 

&#160; 

Although we continue to expand our Cold-EEZE &#174; product offerings, some retailers are limiting and/or reallocating shelf and promotional space away from the cough-cold category to other product categories. With cough-cold shelf and promotional space at a premium, opportunities in the future to introduce new Cold-EEZE &#174; products in the cough-cold category may be limited. Therefore, to continue to grow our Company, we are in the process of implementing a series of new product development and pre-commercialization initiatives in the dietary supplement category. 

&#160; 

Initial dietary supplement product development activities were completed in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2015 under the brand name of TK Supplements TM . The inaugural TK Supplements TM product line is comprised of three men&#8217;s health products: (i) Legendz XL TM for sexual health, (ii) Triple Edge XL TM , a daily energy booster plus testosterone support, and (iii) Super ProstaFlow Plus TM for prostate and urinary health. The first of these three TK Supplements TM products, Legendz XL TM , is scheduled for launch in the first half of Fiscal 2016. Initially, it will be introduced to consumers through direct to consumer marketing including DRTV. If this initial launch is successful, Legendz XL (as well as the other products under development) may ultimately be distributed to retailers, leveraging our Cold-EEZE distribution platform and infrastructure. While management anticipates the growth potential in this category may be better, the risks associated with introducing new products that do not leverage the Cold-EEZE &#174; brand name may be higher. Therefore, no assurance can be made that our new product efforts will be successful. 

&#160; 

Additionally, we are active in exploring new product technologies, applications, product line extensions and other new product opportunities consistent with our Company and brand image, and our standard of proven consumer benefit and efficacy. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing Facility 

&#160; 

Our wholly owned subsidiary, Pharmaloz Manufacturing, Inc. (&#8220;PMI&#8221;), produces our Cold-EEZE &#174; cold remedy lozenges and other lozenge products in addition to performing operational tasks such as warehousing, customer order processing and shipping. Our PMI facility is located in Lebanon, Pennsylvania. Additionally, our PMI facility is a United States Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) registered facility that engages in contract manufacturing and distribution activities. PMI also produces and sells therapeutic lozenges to unaffiliated third party retail, wholesale and distribution outlets.

OTC Health Care and Cold-Remedy Products 

&#160; 

In May 1992, we entered into an exclusive agreement for worldwide representation, manufacturing and marketing of a zinc gluconate formulation. This zinc gluconate formulation is the foundation of our brand; Cold-EEZE &#174; health care and cold remedy products which are distributed principally in the United States. Cold-EEZE &#174; cold remedy products are an OTC consumer product used to reduce the duration of the common cold. We have substantiated the effectiveness of Cold-EEZE &#174; cold remedy lozenges through a variety of studies. A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study, conducted at Dartmouth College of Health Science, Hanover, New Hampshire, concluded that the lozenge formulation treatment, initiated within 48 hours of symptom onset, resulted in a significant reduction in the total duration of the common cold. 

&#160; 

On May 22, 1992, &#8220;Zinc and the Common Cold, a Controlled Clinical Study,&#8221; was published in England in the Journal of International Medical Research , Volume 20, Number 3, Pages 234-246. According to this publication, (a) flavorings used in other zinc lozenge products (citrate, tartrate, separate, orotate, picolinate, mannitol or sorbitol) render the zinc inactive and unavailable to the patient&#8217;s nasal passages, mouth and throat where cold symptoms have to be treated, (b) this patented formulation delivers approximately 93% of the active zinc to the mucosal surfaces and (c) the patient has the same sequence of symptoms as in the absence of treatment but goes through the phases at an accelerated rate and with reduced symptom severity. 

&#160; 

On July 15, 1996, results of a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study on the common cold, which commenced at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation on October 3, 1994, were published. The study &#8220; Zinc Gluconate Lozenges for Treating the Common Cold&#8221; was completed and published in The Annals of Internal Medicine &#8211; Volume 125 Number 2. Using a 13.3 mg lozenge (almost half the strength of the lozenge used in the Dartmouth study), the result still showed a 42% reduction in the duration of common cold symptoms. 

&#160; 

In addition to our Cold-EEZE &#174; cold remedy lozenges, we also market and distribute non-lozenge forms of our proprietary zinc gluconate formulation, (i) Cold-EEZE &#174; cold remedy QuickMelts &#174; are fast dissolving tablets that are taken orally and (ii) Cold-EEZE &#174; cold remedy Oral Spray a liquid form of our zinc gluconate formulation that is sprayed in the mouth. The Cold-EEZE &#174; cold remedy QuickMelts &#174; product line is comprised of (i) Cold-EEZE &#174; Daytime/Nighttime QuickMelts &#174; (launched in Fiscal 2012) (ii) Cold-EEZE &#174; Plus Immune Support + Energy QuickMelts &#174; (launched in Fiscal 2013) and (iii) Cold-EEZE &#174; Plus Multi-Symptom QuickMelts &#174; (launched in Fiscal 2014). 

&#160; 

We also manufacture, market and distribute organic cough drops and a Vitamin C supplement and perform contract manufacturing services of cough drop, dietary supplements, and other OTC cold remedy products for third parties. 

&#160; 

In Fiscal 2015, we introduced (i) a Cold-EEZE &#174; Multi-Symptom Relief for Cold and Flu lozenge, (ii) a Cold-EEZE &#174; Daytime and Nighttime Multi-Symptom Relief in liquid form for each of adults and children, and (iii) Cold-EEZE &#174; Natural Allergy Relief caplets for indoor and outdoor allergies. Shipments for these three new Cold-EEZE &#174; product line extensions began in the third quarter of Fiscal 2015. Our new multi-symptom lozenge contains the same proprietary cold shortening zinc gluconate formulation plus additional active ingredients for temporary relief of flu symptoms, cough, and sore and irritated throat. Our Cold-EEZE &#174; Daytime and Nighttime Multi-Symptom Relief in liquid form provide temporary relief of cold and flu symptoms. Our Cold-EEZE &#174; Natural Allergy Relief caplets provide temporary relief of indoor and outdoor allergy symptoms. 

&#160; 

Our business is subject to federal and state health and safety laws and regulations. Our OTC health care and cold remedies are subject to regulations by various federal, state and local agencies, including the FDA. Additionally, Cold-EEZE &#174; homeopathic cold remedy lozenges, QuickMelts &#174; , Oral Spray and Allergy caplets are subject to the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States. See &#8220;Regulatory Matters&#8221; below for more information.

Patents, Trademarks, Royalty and Commission Agreements 

&#160; 

Patents and Trademarks 

&#160; 

We do not currently own patents for our OTC health care and cold-remedy products. We maintain various trademarks for each of our products including Cold-EEZE &#174; , QuickMelts &#174; , Organix Rx Complete &#174; and Organix Rx Defense &#174; , ORXx Complete TM and ORXx Defense TM , TK Supplements TM , Legendz XL TM , TripleEdge XL TM and Super ProstaFlow Plus TM . 

&#160; 

We currently own various domestic and international patents covering certain product development initiatives principally developed under our Pharma subsidiary operations. To date, we have not realized any meaningful levels of revenues from such patents and we suspended in Fiscal 2009 any further commercialization efforts for various products under such patents. 

&#160; 

Joint Venture 

&#160; 

On March 22, 2010, we, Phosphagenics Limited (&#8220;PSI Parent&#8221;), an Australian corporation, Phosphagenics Inc. (&#8220;PSI&#8221;), a Delaware corporation and subsidiary of PSI Parent, and Phusion LLC (&#8220;Phusion&#8221;), a Delaware limited liability company, entered into a Limited Liability Company Agreement (the &#8220;LLC Agreement&#8221;) of the Phusion joint venture and additional related agreements for the purpose of developing and commercializing, for worldwide distribution and sale, a wide range of non-prescription remedies using PSI Parent&#8217;s proprietary patented TPM&#8482; technology (&#8220;TPM&#8221;). TPM facilitates the delivery and depth of penetration of active molecules in pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and other products. Pursuant to the LLC Agreement, we and PSI each own a 50% membership interest in the Phusion joint venture. 

&#160; 

Our Phusion joint venture has (i) an exclusive, royalty-free, world-wide (subject to certain limitations), paid-up license to exploit OTC drugs (and certain other products) that embody certain PSI Parent&#8217;s TPM-related patents and related know-how (collectively, the &#8220;PSI Technology&#8221;) and (ii) a non-exclusive, royalty-free, world-wide (subject to certain limitations) paid-up license to exploit certain compounds that embody the PSI Technology for use in a product combining one or more of such compounds with an OTC drug or in a product that is part of a regimen that includes the application of an OTC drug (see Note 10 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). 

&#160; 

On October 17, 2014, we initiated a demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association, case number 01-14-0001-7373. This demand for arbitration pertains to our Phusion joint venture and the matter is against PSI Parent and PSI (collectively known as the &#8220;Phosphagenics Entities&#8221;) (see Item 3. Legal Proceedings). 

&#160; 

TK Supplements TM 

&#160; 

On June 30, 2015, we executed a Direct Response Production Agreement (&#8220;DRPA&#8221;) with Pacific Custom Video Productions Inc. (&#8220;PCV&#8221;) to produce a series of direct response television commercials for certain TK Supplements TM products. The cost of the commercial development was $300,000 which was paid in Fiscal 2015 and is included as a component of prepaid expenses at December 31, 2015. As TK Supplements TM products are launched in Fiscal 2016, these costs will be charged to operations as the products are shipped and television commercial air time is purchased and broadcasted. In addition, the Company agreed to pay to PCV a three percent performance incentive in the form of a royalty (aka commission) of net sales collected, as defined in the agreement, of certain TK Supplements TM products marketed and promoted with PCV. Performance incentive fees have not been incurred in Fiscal 2015 and will not be incurred until the TK Supplements TM product line is launched which is scheduled to commence in the first half of Fiscal 2016. 

&#160; 

Product Distribution and Customers 

&#160; 

Currently, our products are distributed through national chain, regional, specialty and local retail stores throughout the United States. Revenues for Fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $20.6 million, $22.1 million and $25.0 million, respectively. Walgreen Company (&#8220;Walgreens&#8221;) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (&#8220;Wal-Mart&#8221;) accounted for approximately 15.8% and 11.3%, respectively, for Fiscal 2015. Walgreens, Wal-Mart and CVS Health Corporation (&#8220;CVS&#8221;) accounted for approximately 18.9%, 16.9% and 11.3%, respectively, of our Fiscal 2014 revenues. Walgreens, Wal-Mart and CVS accounted for approximately 20.4%, 14.3% and 11.6%, respectively, of our Fiscal 2013 revenues. The loss of sales to any one or more of these large retail customers could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160;- 5 - &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

In addition, we have entered into multiple broker, distributor and representative agreements with third parties which provide for commission compensation based on sales performance. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

We have historically invested significantly in research and development activities. Our research and development costs for Fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $1.1 million, $1.3 million and $824,000 respectively. Our research and development initiatives have been principally focused on product line development and/or line extensions for OTC health care and cold remedy products under the Cold-EEZE &#174; and TK Supplements TM brands. 

&#160; 

Currently, we fund our research and development costs with cash generated from operations. In addition to funding from operations, we may seek to raise capital through the issuance of securities or to other financing sources to support our research and development activities including new product technologies, applications, licensing, commercialization and other development opportunities, as well as acquisitions of new formulations, ingredients, applications and other products. Any such funding through the issuance of our equity securities would result in the dilution of current stockholder ownership. Should research or commercialization activity progress on certain formulations, resulting expenditures may require substantial financial support and may necessitate the consideration of alternative approaches such as licensing, joint venture or partnership arrangements that meet our long term goals and objectives. Ultimately, should internal working capital be insufficient and external funding methods or other business arrangements become unattainable, it could result in the deferral or loss of future growth and development opportunities. 

&#160; 

Regulatory Matters 

&#160; 

We are subject to federal and state laws and regulations adopted for the health and safety of users of pharmaceutical and health care products. Our OTC health care and cold remedy products are subject to regulation by various federal, state, and local agencies, including the FDA. In addition, our Cold-EEZE &#174; cold remedy products are subject to the standards established by the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States. These regulatory authorities have broad powers, and we may be subject to regulatory and legislative changes that can affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by influencing the demand for and the costs of manufacturing or distributing its products. Our Cold-EEZE &#174; cold remedy products are considered a homeopathic drug and are exempt from pre-approval requirements and other, but not all, FDA requirements. 

&#160; 

Many homeopathic drug and dietary supplement products, including Cold-EEZE &#174; cold remedy and TK Supplements TM products, are manufactured and distributed under FDA enforcement policies that provide criteria needed to market a homeopathic OTC drug or dietary supplement products without FDA approval. We believe we meet those requirements, which include registration of our manufacturing facility, listing of the product in FDA&#8217;s product database, and packaging, labeling, and manufacturing homeopathic drugs and dietary supplements in compliance with current good manufacturing practice (&#8220;cGMP&#8221;) regulations. In addition, the FDA is currently not enforcing the requirement for a laboratory determination of identity and strength of each active ingredient prior to release for distribution, although this exemption is pending FDA review and we cannot assure that the exemption will be permanently implemented. We also cannot assure that the FDA will agree with our determination of compliance. If the FDA disagrees, the FDA could, upon inspection, issue a notice of violations, referred to as a form FDA-483, or issue a Warning Letter, or both. If we fail to take timely corrective actions to the satisfaction of FDA, the agency can initiate legal actions, such as seizure and injunction, which could include a recall order or the entry of a consent decree, or both. In addition, we could be subject to monetary penalties and even criminal prosecution for egregious conduct. We believe that we are in compliance with all such laws, regulations, and standards currently in effect including the Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act as amended from time to time, and the standards established under the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States. 

&#160; 

Pre-clinical development, clinical trials, product manufacturing, labeling, marketing, distribution and licensing and/or acquisition of potential new products are also generally subject to federal and state regulation in the United States and other countries. Obtaining FDA and any other required regulatory approval for certain OTC products, or seeking the issuance of a final monograph from the FDA for certain OTC products, can require substantial resources and take several years. The length of this process depends on the type, complexity and novelty of the product and the nature of the disease or other indications to be treated. If we cannot obtain regulatory approval of, or final OTC monograph for, a new product(s) in a timely manner or if patents are not granted or are subsequently challenged, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We compete with other suppliers of OTC cold remedy and health care products. These suppliers range widely in size. Some of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical or marketing resources than we do. Management believes that our Cold-EEZE &#174; cold remedy lozenge products, which have been clinically proven in two double-blind studies to reduce the severity of common cold symptoms, offer a significant advantage over many of our competitors in the OTC cold remedy market. We believe that our ability to compete depends on a number of factors, including product quality and price, availability, speed to market, consumer marketing, reliability, credit terms, brand name recognition, delivery time and post-sale service and support. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, we employed 54 full-time employees and no part-time employee, the majority of which were employed at our manufacturing facility in a production function. The remaining employees were involved in an executive, sales, marketing or administrative capacity. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or are members of a union. 

&#160; 

Suppliers; Raw Materials 

&#160; 

We derive our sales principally from our Cold-EEZE &#174; cold remedy zinc gluconate products which are available in various forms&#8211; lozenges, oral spray and QuickMelts &#174; &#8211; and various flavors for purchase by consumers at retail stores. We also produce private label lozenge products for sale to certain retail customers. We manufacture our zinc lozenge products at our Lebanon, Pennsylvania facility. The constituent raw materials and packaging used in the manufacture and presentation of these items are procured from various sources with additional suppliers having been identified in the event that alternatives are required. While the absence of a current raw materials or packaging source may cause short term interruption, we expect that identified alternative sources would fill our needs in a short time and any transition period would be mitigated by adequate levels of finished product available for sale. Certain products within our line of products such as Cold-EEZE &#174; cold remedy Oral Spray, Cold-EEZE &#174; cold remedy QuickMelts &#174; , Cold-EEZE &#174; Daytime and Nighttime Multi-Symptom Relief in liquid form and Cold-EEZE &#174; Natural Allergy Relief caplets are manufactured for us by various third party contract manufacturers and while currently purchased from single sources, we have identified additional suppliers in the event that alternatives are required. We anticipate that if alternative supplies become necessary, they would fill our needs in a short time and any transition period would be mitigated by adequate levels of finished product available for sale.
