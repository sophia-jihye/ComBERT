C OMPETITION . 

The sale of apparel, accessories and personal care products through stores and direct-to-consumer channels is a highly competitive business with numerous participants, including individual and chain fashion specialty stores, as well as regional and national department stores. As the Company continues expanding internationally, it also faces competition in local markets from established chains, as well as local specialty stores. Brand recognition, fashion, price, service, store location, selection and quality are the principal competitive factors in retail store and direct-to-consumer sales. 

The competitive challenges facing the Company include: anticipating and quickly responding to changing fashion trends and maintaining the aspirational positioning of its brands. Furthermore, the Company faces additional competitive challenges as many retailers continue promotional activities, particularly in the U.S. In response to these conditions, the Company has engaged in promotional activity and increased its focus on operating efficiency while seeking to preserve the value of its brands.

The Company believes it maintains a good relationship with its associates. However, in the normal course of business, the Company is party to lawsuits involving former and current associates. 

E NVIRONMENTAL &#32;M ATTERS .
