 ITEM 1. BUSINESS &#160; 

Overview 

&#160;

The Company operates a portfolio of two dating applications, FirstMet, available through desktop and mobile platforms, and The Grade, which is available through iOS and Android TM platforms. We also intend to expand our portfolio through the development of new applications, including a new application based on our existing product platform that we expect will launch in the third quarter of 2016. In March 2016, we completed a rebranding of our dating application &#8220;Are You Interested?&#8221; (&#8220;AYI&#8221;) under the name FirstMet. FirstMet offers distinctive features and superior user experience of AYI under a refreshed brand identity.

&#160;

Our dating applications and the revenues generated therefrom are supported by a large user database of approximately 30 million users. Our management believes that the scale of our user database presents a competitive advantage in the dating industry and can present growth opportunities to build future dating application brands or to commercialize by presenting third party advertising.

&#160;

FirstMet 

&#160;

We provide a leading online dating application under the FirstMet brand that is native on Facebook, iOS and Android platforms and is also accessible on mobile devices and desktops at FirstMet.com. Our FirstMet application is available to users and active subscribers. FirstMet is extremely scalable and requires limited incremental operational cost to add users, active subscribers or new features catering to additional discrete audiences. FirstMet was the #16 grossing application in the U.S. Lifestyle Category on Apple &#174; App Store SM in the United States as of March 7, 2016.

&#160;

In March 2016, we completed a rebranding of AYI under the name FirstMet. As a result of devoting our efforts to the rebranding, we decreased our marketing investment in AYI throughout the latter half of 2015 to reserve cash for the planned rebranding to FirstMet, as well as for other growth initiatives.

&#160;

We believe that the number of active subscribers is directly correlated to our spending on sales and marketing. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our spending on sales and marketing was 5.7% lower than the year ended December 31, 2014, which we believe resulted in a decrease in the number of active subscribers during 2015, as seen in the chart below:

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

As of March 7, 2016, FirstMet had approximately 82,600 active subscribers, which constituted a 18.0% decrease in active subscribers since December 31, 2014. New subscription transactions for FirstMet for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased 20% as compared to the same period in 2014. Although the number of active subscribers and new subscription transactions decreased in 2015 compared to 2014, in December 2015, as part of a plan to support the rebranding of AYI to FirstMet, we diverted a portion of our sales and marketing budget from The Grade to FirstMet. As a result, we achieved a 6.3% increase in bookings in December 2015 compared to the prior month and a 3.4% increase in bookings in January 2016 compared to the prior month. We expect that, for the foreseeable future, we will continue to allocate the significant majority of our resources and spending to FirstMet in an effort to increase our operating cash flow by focusing on our revenue-generating application.

&#160;

The Grade 

&#160; 

We also provide an online dating application under The Grade brand that is native on iOS and Android TM . The Grade is a mobile application that we launched in November 2014 to pursue our strategy of providing a portfolio of dating and social applications. The Grade is a mobile dating application that holds users accountable to a high standard of behavior by using a proprietary algorithm that assigns letter grades to users ranging from &#8220;A+&#8221; to &#8220;F&#8221; based on profile quality, messaging quality and reviews from other users of the application. Users with a grade of &#8220;D&#8221; receive a warning and instructions on how to improve their grade, while users who fail to improve an &#8220;F&#8221; grade are at risk of expulsion. By providing user grades and expelling low-quality users who receive an &#8220;F&#8221; grade, The Grade aims to create a community of high-quality users who are desirable, articulate and responsive.

&#160;

&#160; 1 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The Grade is presently building an audience focusing on the New York metropolitan area as its core market for user adoption. During this introductory growth phase, the application is offered free to users and, apart from testing monetization approaches, there are no immediate plans to monetize The Grade. Our growth strategy for The Grade has been to rely principally on word-of-mouth advertising and public relations campaigns, which has resulted in The Grade appearing in a number of print, television and online media sources during 2015, including a mention on the front page of the Wall Street Journal in October 2015. In addition, as part of our marketing initiatives for The Grade, we appointed Lauren Urasek, author of the book &#8220;Popular: The Ups and Downs of Online Dating from the Most Popular Girl in New York City,&#8221; as a brand ambassador to The Grade in October 2015, which we believe has helped raise The Grade&#8217;s profile and drive user growth. Since its launch through December 31, 2015, The Grade has achieved cumulative user activity of more than 43.3 million swipes.

&#160;

In December 2015, we began realigning our focus from The Grade to FirstMet. We expect that, for the foreseeable future, we will continue to allocate the significant majority of our resources and spending to FirstMet in an effort to increase our operating cash flow by focusing on our revenue-generating application. As we sustain this lower level of spending on sales and marketing for The Grade, we expect that we may experience a decrease in the number of The Grade&#8217;s users and the growth in the cumulative number of swipes may slow over time.

&#160;

Sources of Competitive Strength 

&#160; 

We believe the success of our online dating applications is the direct result of the superior user experience the applications provide. While many online dating applications and websites provide similar functionality, most competitive services require meaningful effort and initiative on the part of the user to make contact with other users. Our applications are designed to eliminate effort and friction in user-to-user interaction by automating certain aspects of the introductory dialog between users. As a consequence, we believe our users find our experience more social and enjoyable than many competitive interactive dating services.

&#160;

Our data-driven business practices also differentiate us from our competitors and provide us with a competitive advantage. The user engagement of our applications and the propensity of users to subscribe is continually enhanced through constant experimentation. Our sophisticated A/B testing framework, a framework for comparing two versions of the same application, can support millions of different versions of our applications in parallel in order to test new features and functionality, design changes and changes to our algorithms. We have also developed business processes and human resources dedicated to business intelligence to analyze and interpret A/B test data, with the result that every change we make to our applications produces verifiable benefits, and the user experience and economics of our applications continually improve.

&#160;

Financial Overview 

&#160; 

We generate revenues from subscriptions as well as advertising agreements with third parties. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our revenues were $12.0 million and $13.6 million, respectively. We had net losses of $1.3 million and $1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As of March 7, 2016, we had 24 employees, all of whom were located in our New York City headquarters.

&#160;

Our Applications 

&#160;

FirstMet 

&#160;

FirstMet attracts a demographically and geographically diverse user base, with users in over 180 different countries. FirstMet is intuitive, and allows users and subscribers to easily find, connect and communicate with each other. Key features and tools of our FirstMet application include:

&#160;

Profile Creation 

&#160;

Users can join FirstMet by creating a personal profile that is connected to their email address or by using &#8220;Facebook Connect&#8221; to create a profile. A FirstMet user with a Facebook profile can easily import information from his or her profile, including photos and interest data. FirstMet profiles are also updated in real time as users add interests on Facebook. Once a profile has been created, FirstMet users are able to browse for potential matches, including other singles with similar interests. Using this information, FirstMet has designed features around similar interests that improve the online dating experience and, compared to traditional online dating websites, more closely mirrors the way singles traditionally meet offline. We continually update FirstMet&#8217;s feature set with new features to increase user engagement, make users more social and to increase the number of users that are converted to active subscribers.

&#160;

Browse Function 

&#160; 

FirstMet&#8217;s game-like &#8220;browse&#8221; function presents profiles of other users that match user criteria and prompts them to indicate if they are &#8220;interested&#8221; by either clicking on a &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;skip&#8221; button above the profile picture or by sending a message when viewing that user&#8217;s profile. Users are notified when another user has clicked &#8220;yes&#8221; on their profile or if they have received a message from another user. In instances where users select &#34;yes&#34; on another user&#8217;s profile, the application automatically introduces the two users, who are likely to have similar interests.

&#160;

Subscription Benefits 

&#160;

FirstMet operates on a &#8220;freemium&#8221; model, whereby certain application features are free to all users and other features are only available to paid subscribers. All users are allowed to create a profile, browse, search and view other user&#8217;s profiles, send instant messages and send an initial message to any user. Unlimited messaging and other premium features require a paid subscription.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Accessibility 

&#160;

Our easy-to-use mobile interface allows our users to engage with our online dating application from virtually anywhere at any time. The availability of our online dating application across mobile devices, tablets and personal computers enables our users to move seamlessly between devices, increasing the opportunities for user engagement and real-time interactions.

&#160; 

The Grade 

&#160;

We designed The Grade as a free mobile application that caters to individuals who are dissatisfied with the quality of user interactions on mobile online dating applications. By providing user grades and expelling users who receive a failing &#8220;F&#8221; grade, the application holds users accountable for their behavior and aims to create a community of desirable, responsive and articulate users. As of March 7, 2016, we had more than 52.9 million swipes by users of The Grade. Some of the key features and tools of The Grade include:

&#160;

Profile Creation 

&#160; 

Users can join The Grade by using &#8220;Facebook Connect&#8221; to easily create a profile. With the user&#8217;s permission, The Grade will obtain certain information from a user&#8217;s Facebook profile, including photos and location data. The Grade then displays other users as potential matches based on location, gender and age preferences. &#160; 

&#160; 

Browse Function 

&#160; 

Once a user creates a profile, The Grade automatically presents the user with potential matches by displaying a profile picture of the potential match along with the user's overall grade. The browse function allows users to indicate whether they &#8220;like&#8221; a profile by selecting a checkmark or selecting an &#8220;X&#8221; if they are not interested in the potential match. By scrolling up or down on the profile picture, users can view additional pictures as well as other profile information, including similar interests, common friends, education, religion, ethnicity, &#8220;about me&#8221; and grades in the three categories - profile quality, messaging and peer reviews. Users are automatically notified when a &#8220;match&#8221; exists, meaning both users &#8220;like&#8221; one another&#8217;s profile. Once users have been matched, they are allowed to send messages to each other.

&#160; 

Grading System 

&#160; 

A user&#8217;s overall grade is based on an algorithm that incorporates the grades based on profile quality, messaging and peer-reviews generated from the opinions received from other users. The profile quality grade is based on several factors, including the quantity and quality of a user&#8217;s photos, how many optional profile fields are filled out, how often a user&#8217;s profile gets &#8220;liked&#8221; and the length and quality of a user&#8217;s &#8220;about me&#8221; section. The messaging grade uses an algorithm to analyze how often a user responds to messages and how often the user obtains a response back, as well as analyzes messages for grammatical mistakes, spelling errors, use of slang and length, and whether a user&#8217;s messages contain inappropriate content. These three categories are combined to create a user&#8217;s overall grade, which is visible to other users of the application.

&#160;

Application Development 

&#160;

Our application development processes are designed to enable us to rapidly and cost effectively develop our online dating applications to meet the expectations and preferences of users and the requirements of the third party platforms through which we offer our applications. These processes include a sophisticated A/B testing framework that allows us to run a significant number of statistically relevant tests on our applications at any given time. We can test new features, new functionality, design changes and changes to our proprietary algorithms and compare the results to control groups to see if they would be likely to improve the conversion of users into subscribers. We have also integrated Splunk Enterprise technology, a data analysis and management tool, into our data analytics and application development processes to provide a real-time granular analysis of user behavior and the ability to &#8220;lock-in&#8221; features that outperform their relevant control groups.

&#160;

A significant amount of our logins occur through third party platforms. We believe we provide value to these third party platforms by: (i) creating and maintaining user engagement on, and integrating with, the platforms; (ii) driving traffic to the platforms to generate advertising revenue for such platforms, including through the placement of advertisements on our online dating applications, and (iii) directly purchasing advertising from these platforms.

&#160;

In March 2016, we completed a rebranding of AYI under the name FirstMet. We are coupling an aggressive win-back strategy with the launch of FirstMet in order to reactivate dormant AYI users. In addition, we are currently developing a new application based on FirstMet&#8217;s platform that is expected to launch in the third quarter of 2016. The new application is planned to have similar functionality to FirstMet but will address a different target audience and will be based on a new brand identity. We expect that we will operate the new application in parallel with FirstMet in order to leverage FirstMet&#8217;s user base and cross-sell our users with multiple brands. We believe that FirstMet&#8217;s highly scalable infrastructure provides us with a significant competitive advantage, and in the future we expect that we may continue to develop new applications based on FirstMet&#8217;s platform that address new audiences. FirstMet is available on mobile and desktop platforms and our new application is planned to be available on mobile and desktop platforms at launch.

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

A significant portion of our users continue to access our applications through mobile applications and our application development and support is substantially focused on mobile platforms. We plan to continue development on iPhone, Android and other mobile devices, and on January 13, 2016, we launched The Grade on Apple Watch through iOS.

&#160;

With our vast amount of data that we have accumulated over several years across multiple platforms, we believe that leveraging this user base and the data therefrom allows us to create an exceptional experience for users looking to meet people with mutual friends or similar interests.

&#160;

Our Strengths 

&#160;

Since our inception, we have developed and are leveraging the following key strengths of our business model:

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; &#8220; Freemium &#8221; Online Dating Model . We operate FirstMet on a &#8220;freemium&#8221; model in which certain application features are free to all users and other features are only available to subscribers. We believe this &#8220;freemium&#8221; model, when combined with our development of FirstMet as an online dating application, differentiates us from other applications in the online dating industry. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Engaging Functionality on a Highly Scalable Platform . We have designed our applications with game-like &#8220;browse&#8221; functions and other features that prompt interactions between users, which make our applications highly engaging and easy to use. While many online dating applications and websites provide similar functionality, most competitive services require meaningful effort and initiative on the part of the user to make contact with other users. Our applications are designed to eliminate effort and friction in user-to-user interaction by automating certain aspects of the introductory dialogue between users. We have developed many different and popular online dating features for our applications, including the ability to search for potential matches with similar interests on FirstMet and the ability to view a user&#8217;s grade on The Grade. Our applications are also extremely scalable and require limited incremental cost to add additional users, create new features catering to additional discrete audiences or to build new applications based on developed feature-sets with new brand identities. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Marketing Effectiveness and Data Analytics . We believe that our data analytics and application development processes provide us with a competitive advantage over other online dating websites and applications. Our data analytics provides us with critical visibility into the effectiveness of our sales and marketing expense and allow us to quickly modify such expenditures to create more effective user acquisition campaigns. Our application development processes also include a sophisticated A/B testing framework that allows us to test new features, new functionality, design changes, changes to our proprietary algorithms and compare our results to control groups. These processes provide a real-time granular analysis of user behavior and allow us to modify our applications to increase user engagement and the number of users that convert into paying subscribers. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Increased Mobile Penetration. Our easy-to-use mobile dating applications have been designed to acquire users on every platform and allow users to interact with other users from virtually anywhere and at any time. Our applications have been designed to work on small screens and other mobile devices, and allow users to create a profile, interact with other users and pay for subscriptions using their mobile devices. The Grade is only available as a mobile application and our mobile FirstMet application is increasingly being adopted by our users over the desktop application. For example, in December 2015, approximately 55.1% of logins to FirstMet were made through a mobile device as compared to 43.9% of logins to FirstMet in December 2014. &#160;

Our Strategy 

&#160;

Our strategy includes the following key components:

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; Increase Our Subscriber Base Through Cost-Effective Advertising. Although we continue to invest in user acquisition campaigns to promote FirstMet and The Grade and increase the number of users and paid subscribers, we decreased our sales and marketing expense in AYI throughout the latter half of 2015 to reserve cash for the rebranding to FirstMet and other growth initiatives. We frequently analyze our sales and marketing expense in an effort to ensure that we optimize our return on investments in these areas. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Increase Our Mobile Presence . We plan to increase the presence of the FirstMet and The Grade applications in the mobile market through improving the mobile user experience, increasing our prominence on the Apple iTunes store and Google Play store and transitioning desktop users to become mobile users. Consistent with this objective, we recently relaunched FirstMet on iOS and Android. In addition, we have created a seamless cross-platform experience that allows new and existing FirstMet users to login to any platform to access their messages, communicate cross-platform with other users and subscribe to access the entire feature set. In January 2016, we launched our application The Grade for Apple Watch. We are also continuing to prioritize initiatives that will improve the rate at which we convert our mobile users into paid subscribers. &#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; Introduce New Applications . We plan to develop a portfolio of applications around the core FirstMet application by investing substantial resources to develop and launch new mobile and desktop applications or by developing separate versions of our existing product platform for specific target demographics or geographies. We began to implement this portfolio approach through the launch of The Grade in November 2014, and, as described above, we plan to launch a new application in the third quarter of 2016. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Increase Our International Presence . We have begun to prioritize efforts to increase the international presence of the FirstMet application, including by developing localized and translated versions of the FirstMet application for certain international countries. We expect that by localizing and translating the FirstMet application to various international countries, we will increase the number of our users and paid subscribers and will realize higher user conversion and retention rates. &#160;

Marketing Strategy &#160;

&#160;

Our current marketing activities aim to raise awareness of the FirstMet and The Grade brands and attract users by promoting the unique content and quality of our applications. We primarily advertise through Internet and mobile advertising and run hundreds of user acquisition campaigns at any given time, targeting various classifications of users. 

&#160;

We acquire a significant number of our users through paid marketing channels. We plan our sales and marketing activities based on our expected return on investment (which we measure based on the profit margin of proceeds from sales and marketing expenditures, divided by sales and marketing expense) and believe that we lead or equal our public company competitors based on our overall revenue yield from sales and marketing expense. Our sales and marketing efficiency continues to be enhanced by constant experimentation and optimizations to increase user engagement and the number of users that are converted to paid subscribers. &#160; 

&#160;

Throughout the latter half of 2015, we decreased our marketing investment in AYI to reserve cash for the rebranding to FirstMet in the first quarter of 2016, as well as for other growth initiatives. 

&#160;

As part of the marketing initiatives for The Grade, we appointed Lauren Urasek, author of the book &#8220;Popular: The Ups and Downs of Online Dating from the Most Popular Girl in New York City,&#8221; as a brand ambassador to The Grade in October 2015, which we believe has helped raise The Grade&#8217;s profile and drive user growth. We also market The Grade by, among other things, providing online dating information to the media. During 2015, The Grade was referenced in The Wall Street Journal, Good Morning America, New York Post, USA Today, Fortune, BuzzFeed, ABC News, TIME and People. 

&#160;

In December 2015, as part of a plan to realign our focus from The Grade to FirstMet, we diverted a portion of our sales and marketing budget from The Grade to FirstMet. As a result, we achieved a 6.3% increase in bookings in December 2015 compared to the prior month and a 3.4% increase in bookings in January 2016 compared to the prior month. As we sustain this lower level of sales and marketing for The Grade, we expect that we may experience a decrease in the number of The Grade&#8217;s users and the growth in the cumulative number of swipes may slow over time. 

&#160;

Payment Options &#160;

&#160;

Our users have a variety of methods by which to purchase subscriptions to FirstMet. Users can pay by credit card, electronic check, PayPal, Fortumo or as an in-App purchase through Apple Inc.&#8217;s App Store. Pursuant to Apple Inc.&#8217;s terms of service, Apple Inc. retains 30% of the revenue that is generated from sales on our iPhone application through in-App purchases. Regardless of which payment method is utilized, users may access FirstMet through any of the gateways we offer. 

&#160;

Competition &#160;

&#160;

We face substantial competition from online dating websites such as Christianmingle.com, Cupid.com, eHarmony.com, POF.com, Match.com, LLC (&#8220;Match.com&#8221;) or other IAC/InterActiveCorp. (&#8220;IAC&#8221;) properties, as well as online dating applications provided by Badoo Trading Limited, IAC, MeetMe, Inc. and Zoosk, Inc. (&#8220;Zoosk&#8221;). We also face substantial competition from mobile-based applications including Tinder, Happn, Hinge and Bumble. We believe that users often utilize multiple dating websites or applications, and the use of one dating website or application is not necessarily to the exclusion of others. In addition, there are relatively few significant barriers to entry in our industry and, as a result, any organization that has adequate financial resources and technical expertise may become a competitor.

&#160;

Achieving a critical mass of users is crucial for online dating websites and applications. As a result of our user base, we believe we are well-positioned to continue as a leader in online dating. We believe that our user base also allows us to compete favorably in the marketplace with our current and future applications. Additionally, we seek to offer applications and services that are differentiated in the industry, superior in quality, and more appealing than those of our competitors. Additionally, we believe that we have the tools and expertise to attract new users through Facebook and other sources at a lower cost per subscriber than certain of our traditional online dating competitors. We also believe that the industry offers substantial room for growth as social networking application platforms and mobile platforms continue to expand as the Internet becomes more of a mainstream method for finding a relationship.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Patent and Trademarks 

&#160;

To establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, patent applications, confidentiality agreements and other contractual rights. We are also pursuing patents related to certain feature sets on the FirstMet application currently under development. We have two registered trademarks in the United States for &#8220;Snap Interactive&#8221;; three registered trademarks for &#8220;Are You Interested?&#8221; and variations thereof in the United States, including several pending applications and registrations in other countries; a registered trademark for a question-mark-heart logo in the United States and pending applications for &#8220;ayi&#8221; and &#8220;FirstMet&#8221; in the United States. 

&#160; 

Governmental Regulations 

&#160;

We are subject to a number of U.S. federal and state laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet, many of which are still evolving and being litigated in the courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. These laws and regulations may involve user privacy, data protection, content, intellectual property, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, taxation and online payment services. In particular, we are subject to federal and state laws regarding privacy and protection of user data, which are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. We are also subject to diverse and evolving laws and regulations in other countries in which we operate. The application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly-evolving industry in which we operate. Because our online dating applications are accessible worldwide and used by residents of some foreign countries, foreign jurisdictions may claim that we must comply with foreign laws, even in jurisdictions in which we have no local business entity, employees or infrastructure.

&#160;

We are also subject to federal laws and regulations regarding content, privacy and the protection of user data, including The Communications Decency Act of 1996, as amended (&#8220;The Communications Decency Act&#8221;), The Children&#8217;s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, as amended, The Digital Millennium Copyright Act, The Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, as amended, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, and the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography And Marketing (&#8220;CAN-SPAM&#8221;) Act of 2003, among others. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act limits our liability as an online service provider for linking to or hosting third-party content that infringes copyrights. The Communications Decency Act provides statutory protections to online service providers like us who distribute third-party content. The Children&#8217;s Online Privacy Protection Act restricts the ability of online service providers to collect personal information from children under 13. Congress, the Federal Trade Commission (&#8220;FTC&#8221;) and many states have promulgated laws and regulations regarding email advertising, including the CAN-SPAM Act. Any changes in these laws or judicial interpretations narrowing the protections of these laws may subject us to increased risk, increased costs of compliance, and limits on the operation of certain parts of our business.

&#160;

Growing public concern about privacy and the use of personal information may subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny. The FTC has, over the last few years, begun investigating companies that have used personally identifiable information in a deceptive or unfair manner or in violation of a posted privacy policy. If we are accused of violating the terms of our privacy policy or implementing unfair privacy practices, we may be forced to expend significant financial and managerial resources to defend against an FTC enforcement action. Our user database holds the personal information of our users and subscribers residing in the United States and other countries, and we could be sued by those users if any of the information is misappropriated. Any failure by us to adequately protect our users&#8217; privacy and data could also result in loss of user confidence in our online dating applications and services and ultimately in a loss of active subscribers, which could adversely affect our business.

&#160;

In addition, virtually every U.S. state has passed laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data resulting in unauthorized disclosure, many of which are modeled on California&#8217;s Information Practices Act. There are a number of legislative proposals pending before the U.S. Congress and various state legislative bodies concerning data protection that could, if adopted, have an adverse effect on our business. We are unable to determine if and when such legislation may be adopted. Many jurisdictions, including the European Union, have adopted breach notification and other data protection notification laws designed to prevent unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information. The introduction of new privacy and data breach laws and the interpretation of existing privacy and data breach laws in the United States, Europe and other foreign jurisdictions is constantly evolving. There is a risk that new laws may be introduced or existing laws may be applied in a way that would conflict our current data protection practices or prevent the transfer of data between countries in which we operate.

&#160;

While online personal services are not currently required to verify the age or identity of subscribers, or to run criminal background checks, legislation in this area has been proposed over the last few years in Ohio, Texas, California, Michigan, New Jersey, Florida and Virginia. Companies that provide personals services are not currently subject to the same type of regulation as companies deemed &#8220;dating service&#8221; providers. However, if a court holds that we are legally providing &#8220;dating services&#8221; as defined in the relevant regulations, we may be required to comply with additional state regulations. Further, Connecticut, New York, Florida, Texas and New Jersey each have enacted laws that require us to display safety warnings and disclosures to users that we do not conduct background checks.

&#160;

In addition, rising concern about the use of social networking technologies for illegal conduct may in the future produce legislation or other governmental action that could require changes to our online dating applications or restrict or impose additional costs upon the conduct of our business. These regulatory and legislative developments, including excessive taxation, may prevent or significantly limit our ability to expand our business.

As of March 7, 2016, we had 24 &#160; employees, all of whom are employed on a full-time basis. We believe that our future success depends in part on our continued ability to hire, assimilate and retain qualified personnel.
