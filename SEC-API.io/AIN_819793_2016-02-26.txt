 Item 1. Business 

Albany International Corp. (the Registrant, the Company, we, us, or our) and its subsidiaries are engaged in two business segments.

The Machine Clothing (MC) segment supplies permeable and impermeable belts used in the manufacture of paper, paperboard, tissue and towel pulp, nonwovens, fiber cement and several other industrial applications.

We design, manufacture, and market paper machine clothing for each section of the paper machine and for every grade of paper. We manufacture and sell approximately twice as much paper machine clothing worldwide than any other company. Paper machine clothing products are customized, consumable products of technologically sophisticated design that utilize polymeric materials in a complex structure. The design and material composition of paper machine clothing can have a considerable effect on the quality of paper products produced and the efficiency of the paper machines on which it is used. Principal products in the paper machine clothing segment include forming, pressing, and dryer fabrics, and process belts. A forming fabric assists in paper sheet formation and conveys the very wet sheet (more than 75% water) through the forming section. Press fabrics are designed to carry the sheet through the press section, where water is pressed from the sheet as it passes through the press nip. In the dryer section, dryer fabrics manage air movement and hold the sheet against heated cylinders to enhance drying. Process belts are used in the press section to increase dryness and enhance sheet properties, as well as in other sections of the machine to improve runnability and enhance sheet qualities.

The Machine Clothing segment also supplies customized, consumable fabrics used in the manufacturing process in the pulp, corrugator, nonwovens, fiber cement, building products, and tannery and textile industries.

We sell our Machine Clothing products directly to customer end-users. Our products, manufacturing processes, and distribution channels for Machine Clothing are substantially the same in each region of the world in which we operate. The sales of paper machine clothing forming, pressing, and dryer fabrics, individually and in the aggregate, accounted for more than 10 percent of our consolidated net sales during one or more of the last three years.

The Albany Engineered Composites (AEC) segment, including Albany Safran Composites, LLC (ASC), in which our customer SAFRAN Group owns a 10 percent noncontrolling interest, provides highly engineered, advanced composite structures based on proprietary technology to customers in the aerospace and defense industries. AEC&#8217;s largest program relates to CFM International&#8217;s LEAP engine, which is scheduled to enter into service in 2016. AEC, through ASC, is the exclusive supplier to this program of advanced composite fan blades and cases under a long-term supply contract. In 2015, approximately 15 percent of this segment&#8217;s sales were related to U.S. government contracts or programs.

See &#8220;Business Environment Overview and Trends&#8221; under Item 7, Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for a discussion of general segment developments in recent years.

Following is a table of net sales by segment for 2015, 2014, and 2013.

(in thousands) &#160; 2015 &#160; 2014 &#160; 2013 Machine Clothing &#160; $608,581 &#160; &#160; $655,026 &#160; &#160; $674,747 &#160; Albany Engineered Composites &#160; 101,287 &#160; &#160; 90,319 &#160; &#160; 82,667 &#160; Consolidated total &#160; $709,868 &#160; &#160; $745,345 &#160; &#160; $757,414 &#160; &#160;

The table setting forth certain sales, operating income, and balance sheet data that appears in Note 3, &#8220;Reportable Segments and Geographic Data,&#8221; of the Consolidated Financial Statements, included under Item 8 of this Form 10-K, is incorporated herein.

&#160;

&#160;

International Operations 

We maintain manufacturing facilities in Brazil, Canada, China, France, Italy, Mexico, South Korea, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States. We also have a 50% interest in a company in Russia (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).

Our geographically diversified operations allow us to serve our markets efficiently and to provide extensive technical services to our customers. We benefit from the transfer of research and development and product innovations between geographic regions. The worldwide scope of our manufacturing and marketing efforts helps to mitigate the impact of regional economic downturns.

Our global presence subjects us to certain risks, including controls on foreign exchange and the repatriation of funds. We have a cash repatriation strategy that targets a certain amount of foreign current year earnings that are not permanently reinvested. To date, we have been able to make such repatriations without substantial governmental restrictions and do not foresee any material changes in our ability to continue to do so in the future. In addition, we believe that the risks associated with our operations outside the United States are no greater than those normally associated with doing business in those locations.

Working Capital, Customers, Seasonality, and Backlog 

Payment terms granted to paper industry and other machine clothing customers reflect general competitive practices. Terms vary with product, competitive conditions, and the country of operation. In some markets, customer agreements require us to maintain significant amounts of finished goods inventories to assure continuous availability of our products.

In addition to supplying paper, paperboard, and tissue companies, the Machine Clothing segment is a leading supplier to the nonwovens (which includes the manufacture of products such as diapers, personal care and household wipes), building products, and tannery and textile industries. These non-paper industries have a wide range of customers, with markets that vary from industrial applications to consumer use.

The Albany Engineered Composites segment primarily serves customers in commercial and military aircraft engine and airframe markets. Sales and working capital rose sharply in the last few years in this segment. Additionally, we anticipate intensive growth in the future, which could lead to further increases in working capital levels.

In the Machine Clothing segment, the Chinese New Year, summer months, and the end of the year are often periods of lower production for some of our customers, which can lead to weak sales periods for the Company. In recent years, these seasonal variations coupled with shorter order cycles and reduction of inventory throughout the supply chain have resulted in sales being distributed unevenly throughout the year. These combined factors make quarterly comparisons difficult throughout the year. Seasonality is not a significant factor in the Albany Engineered Composites segment.

Backlog in the Machine Clothing segment was $171.0 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $195.5 million at December 31, 2014. The decrease reflects a trend toward shorter order-to-delivery times. Backlog in the Albany Engineered Composites segment was $34.0 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $22.8 million at December 31, 2014. The backlog in each segment is generally expected to be invoiced during the next 12 months.

Research and Development and Technology 

We invest in research, new product development, and technical analysis with the objective of maintaining our technological leadership in each business segment. While much of our research activity supports existing products, we also engage in significant research and development activities for new technology platforms, products and product enhancements.

&#160;

Machine Clothing is custom-designed for each user, depending on the type, size, and speed of the machine, and the products being produced. Product design is also a function of the machine section, the grade of product being produced, and the quality of the stock used. Technical expertise, judgment, and experience are critical in designing the appropriate clothing for machine, position, and application. As a result, we employ highly skilled sales and technical service personnel who work directly with each customer&#8217;s plant operating management. Our technical service programs give our service engineers field access to the measurement and analysis equipment needed for troubleshooting and application engineering in many areas. Sales, service, and technical expenses are major cost components of the Company. Many employees in sales and technical functions have engineering degrees, paper mill experience, or other manufacturing experience in the markets in which they operate. Our market leadership position reflects our commitment to technological innovation. This innovation has resulted in a stream of new Machine Clothing products and enhancements, including the INLINE forming fabric family including KRAFTLINE and PRINTLINE; press fabrics such as HYDROCROSS, SEAM HYDROCROSS, SEAMPLANE, Seam KMX, and SPRING; process belts such as VENTABELT EVM, VENTABELT XTS and TRANSBELT GX; dryer fabrics such as SPIRALTOP, AEROPULSE and AEROPOINT; DURASPIRAL corrugator belts; and TOPSTAT, SUPRASTAT and NOVALACE fabrics for the nonwovens industry.

Albany Engineered Composites designs, develops and manufactures advanced composite parts for complex aerospace and other high-performance applications, using a range of core technologies, including its proprietary 3D woven reinforced composites technology. AEC is capable of designing and manufacturing 3D composite structures that are reinforced in multiple directions. By controlling the fiber and matrix materials, as well as the weaving architecture, we are able to engineer components that meet specific performance goals while also meeting cost, qualification, certification and production needs. AEC&#8217;s other core technologies include traditional and non-traditional 2D laminated composite structures, contour weaving, steered weaving, discrete through-thickness reinforcement technologies (such as Z-fiber&#8482; reinforcements), and sandwich structures (X_COR&#8482;, K_COR&#8482; and Ceramic Truss Core or CTC&#8482;). AEC&#8217;s research and technology team also works actively with existing and potential customers on applications involving other emerging technologies, such as ceramic matrix composites, pin insertion and 3D fiber placement.

Company-funded research expenses totaled $31.7 million in 2015, $32.4 million in 2014, and $30.2 million in 2013. In 2015, these costs were 4.5% of total Company net sales, including $11.0 million or 10.9% of net sales in our AEC segment. Research and development in the AEC segment includes both Company-sponsored and customer-funded activities. Some customer funded research and development may be on a cost sharing basis, in which case amounts charged to the customer are credited against research and development costs. Research and development expenses were reduced by $0.0 million in 2015, $0.4 million in 2014, and $1.4 million in 2013 as a result of such arrangements. For customer-funded research and development in which we anticipate funding to exceed expenses, we include amounts charged to the customer in Net sales. Cost of sales associated with customer-funded research was $3.4 million in 2015, $3.6 million in 2014, and $2.8 million in 2013.

We conduct our major research and development in Halmstad, Sweden; Manchester, England; Kaukauna, Wisconsin and Rochester, New Hampshire. Additionally, we conduct process and product design development activities at locations in Quebec, Canada; Kaukauna, Wisconsin; and St. Stephen, South Carolina.

We have developed, and continue to develop, proprietary intellectual property germane to the industries we serve. Our intellectual property takes many forms, including patents, trademarks, trade names and domains, and trade secrets. Our trade secrets include, among other things, manufacturing know-how and unique processes and equipment. Because intellectual property in the form of patents is published, we often forgo patent protection and preserve the intellectual property as trade secrets. We aggressively protect our proprietary intellectual property, pursuing patent protection when appropriate. Our active portfolio currently contains well over 1,900 patents, and more than 200 new patents are typically granted each year. While we consider our total portfolio of intellectual property, including our patents, to be an important competitive advantage, we do not believe that any single patent is critical to the continuation of our business. All brand names and product names are trade names

&#160;

of Albany International Corp. or its subsidiaries. We have from time to time licensed some of our patents and/or know-how to one or more competitors, and have been licensed under some competitors&#8217; patents, in each case mainly to enhance customer acceptance of new products. The revenue from such licenses is less than 1 percent of consolidated net sales.

Raw Materials 

Primary raw materials for our Machine Clothing products are polymer monofilaments and fibers, which have generally been available from a number of suppliers. Therefore, we have not needed to maintain raw material inventories in excess of our current needs to assure availability. In addition, we manufacture polymer monofilaments, a basic raw material for all types of Machine Clothing, at our facility in Homer, New York, which supplies approximately 50% of our worldwide monofilament requirements. In the AEC segment, the primary raw materials are carbon fiber and resin. While there are a number of potential suppliers of carbon fiber and other raw materials used by AEC, the use of certain suppliers may be mandated by customer agreements, and alternative suppliers would be subject to material qualification or other requirements. Currently, the primary raw materials used in each segment are derived from petroleum, and are therefore sensitive to changes in the price of petroleum and petroleum intermediates.

Competition 

In the paper machine clothing market, we believe that we had a worldwide market share of approximately 30% in 2015, while the two largest competitors each had a market share of approximately half of ours.

While some competitors in the Machine Clothing segment tend to compete more on the basis of price, and others attempt to compete more on the basis of technology, both are significant competitive factors in this industry. Some of the Company&#8217;s paper machine clothing competitors also supply paper machines and papermaking equipment, and endeavor to compete by bundling clothing with original equipment and aftermarket services. We, like our competitors, provide technical support to customers through our sales and technical service personnel, including (1) consulting on performance of the machine, (2) consulting on machine configurations, both new and rebuilt, (3) selection and custom manufacture of the appropriate machine clothing, and (4) storing fabrics for delivery to the user. Revenues earned from these services are reflected in the prices charged for our products.

The primary competitive factors in the markets in which our Albany Engineered Composites segment competes is product performance and price. Achieving lower weight without sacrificing strength is the key to improving fuel efficiency, and is a critical performance requirement in the aerospace industry. Our unique, proprietary capabilities in composites enable us to offer customers the opportunity to displace metal components and, in some cases, conventional composites with lower-weight, high-strength, and potentially high-temperature composites. The dominant competitive factor is how the customer weighs these performance benefits, which include fuel savings due to lower weight, against the possible cost advantage of more traditional metal and composite components.

Employees 

We employ approximately 3,900 persons, of whom 64% are engaged in manufacturing our products. Wages and benefits are competitive with those of other manufacturers in the geographic areas in which our facilities are located. In general, we consider our relations with employees to be excellent.

A number of hourly employees outside of the United States are members of various unions.
