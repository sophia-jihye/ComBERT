 Item 1. Business. 

&#160; 

In this Report, we use the terms &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;XsunX,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; and &#8220;our,&#8221; unless otherwise indicated, or the context otherwise requires, to refer to XsunX, Inc. 

Organization 

XsunX, Inc. (&#8220;XsunX,&#8221; the &#8220;Company&#8221; or the &#8220;issuer&#8221;) is a Colorado corporation formerly known as Sun River Mining Inc. &#8220;Sun River&#8221;). The Company was originally incorporated in Colorado on February 25, 1997. Effective September 24, 2003, the Company completed a plan of reorganization and name change to XsunX, Inc. 

&#160; 

Business Overview 

&#160; 

XsunX specializes in the sale, design, and installation of solar photovoltaic power generation (PV), and energy saving technologies that provide our clients long term savings, predictability, and control of their energy costs. Our background and experience spans virtually all aspects of solar including technology assessment, design, and development. 

The Company has developed a highly skilled team of qualified engineering and specialty contractors with extensive commercial and residential solar experience necessary to service the diverse conditions that can be encountered in the design and installation of PV, and energy saving technologies. The company couples this superior design and delivery capability with factory direct pricing, and zero down financing options to provide our clients with energy solutions that can quickly pay for themselves. 

Our business development objectives are to capitalize on the demand within the California commercial and residential markets for the installation of solar electric power systems. The demand, underscored in a 2015 market data report from the U.S. Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) indicates $11.7 billion dollars was invested into PV system installations in California in 2014 representing a 66% increase over the previous year, and nationally capacity is forecasted to double through the addition of roughly 20,000 megawatts (MW) in the 2015-16 period with California leading the way. Helping to drive these significant solar adoption numbers are continued cost reductions, coupled with government tax and investment incentives providing significant investment incentives for consumers whom we market to in efforts to make sales. 

We have historically focused our operations toward commercial rooftop solar power sales. In the second half of 2015 period we began to expand our marketing efforts to include residential sales, however an area in which we believe we can establish distinct marketing and sales advantages is through the sale and delivery of commercial solar carport systems. 

While we believe that the commercial and residential rooftop solar will continue to offer sales growth opportunities, non-residential solar carport systems can, in many instances, provide us the opportunity to offer customers larger project sizing, greater electricity savings, and the ability to differentiate XsunX from competitors. 

In the 2015 period we established the capabilities to design, directly source all of the major system components, and deliver solar carport systems allowing us to eliminate reliance on costly third party specialty subcontractors whom we believe the majority of our competitors rely on. This has allowed us to reduce our carport structure installation costs by approximate 35%, and the overall PV system cost by approximately 15% which, we believe, provides us with a distinct pricing advantage for solar carports within the greater Southern California markets that we serve. 

&#160; 

Market for Solar Power 

&#160; 

We believe that a significant demand for our solar power energy solutions is developing, in part, as a result of following propositions: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

&#160; We provide the ability to control and predict future energy costs . Our customers invest in the ability to self-generate power to offset and/or eliminate the purchase of third party utility provided electric energy. These investments provide predictability and control of energy costs, and can significantly reduce overall energy costs while insulating clients from rising retail electricity prices. 

&#160; &#8226; 

&#160; Maturity and dependability of solar technologies . The results and benefits from investments in solar power systems have begun to produce long term statistical data. This historical performance data allows investment benefits for near and long term future operations to be accurately estimated. This provides customers greater reliance on future results, and the confidence to make investments. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

&#160; Rapid capital recovery of solar investments . Reports provided by U.S. Energy Department indicate that the installed price reductions for solar PV systems are driving record installation demand. These cost reductions for the major components that make up PV systems allow us to provide per watt pricing that, coupled with tax and operating benefits, can often result in capital investment recovery within 3 to 4 years. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our Approach 

&#160; 

We provide customers with a turn-key suite of services and products. Our customer relationship development begins with a financial analysis providing detailed estimated investment benefits and results over the first twenty five years of a solar power systems life span. Through this process we tailor our system designs to maximize the financial benefits and returns for each customer. Our strategy is to develop and deliver systems that can provide the client with the greatest benefits. We then focus on 100% customer satisfaction by consistently matching customer expectations with our performance, and the delivery of our systems. 

&#160; 

The key elements of our approach include: 

&#160; &#8226; 

&#160; Lead Generation . We market our services utilizing efforts that include wide area advertising in regional newspapers, door-to-door canvasing, list generation and target marketing, and customer referrals. Our sales development efforts work with prospective customers from initial interest through tailored proposals and, ultimately, signed contracts. We plan to grow our sales efforts and team while continually reviewing market trends, and the adoption of new approaches to engage more customers. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

&#160; Detailed Investment Analysis . We use information related to our customer&#8217;s energy usage, costs, planned operations, and tax basis to determine optimal solar system and investment sizing. We combine this data and provide customers with 25 year investment projections that detail capital recovery expectations, system performance and energy savings, tax and operating benefits, and property re-sale value improvement estimates. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

&#160; Financing . We have established relationships with lenders and have been approved to offer their finance options to prospective customers. Through our lender association network we offer customers financing options that include commercial equipment loans, lease options, power purchase agreements (PPA&#8217;s), PACE &#38; HERO financing through property tax assessment, and we offer clients the option to apply utility incentives towards system purchase buy-downs thereby reducing up front out of pocket expenditures or the amount of capital financed. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

&#160; Design &#38; Engineering . To ensure accuracy we perform our site surveys directly and do not rely on third party services. We then finalize designs that will match proposed financial results, and work with a highly skilled team of qualified engineers with extensive commercial solar experience to ensure compliance with all codes, and best practices for the solar system operation. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

&#160; Installation . We make the installation process simple for our customers. Once we complete the design and engineering of a solar energy system, we obtain all necessary building permits. Then, as the general contractor and construction manager, we provide all materials and components and use highly qualified licensed specialty contractors with extensive commercial and solar experience to provide on-site assembly of solar systems, utility interconnections, and roofing or structural work. We manage and ensure local building department approvals, and arrange for interconnection to the power grid with the utility. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

&#160; Monitoring, Maintenance, and Service . We provide our customers with real-time facility wide monitoring of both solar energy generation and facility wide energy consumption. In addition to providing clients with a better understanding of their energy usage, and the opportunity to modify their usage to realize savings, these monitoring systems allow us to confirm the continuing proper operation of installed solar energy systems. We also service what we sell and provide customers with a single source for all system maintenance or warranty coordination and service. 

&#160; 

Our Customers 

&#160; 

Our customers, and key market, are owner occupied commercial facilities. We do not focus on specific industries or business type, but typically we have found manufacturing, storage, warehousing, agricultural, and single story commercial office space facilities offer greater opportunities for the placement of solar systems. While we can offer financing solutions through our network of lenders for non-owner occupied facilities the greatest financial benefits can be realized by owner occupied commercial facilities. 

&#160; 

We work to identify &#8220;best&#8221; candidates for our systems and we have found that facilities in excess of 3,000 square feet of roof area, and monthly utility costs in excess of $350 provide the minimum practical entry point for our services. However, &#8220;best&#8221; candidates typically require a minimum of 29kW (kilowatt) in solar system sizing, and have monthly utility costs in excess of $650. In the 2015 fiscal period we provided proposals for systems ranging in size from 20kW to 980kW with 30kW to 200kW providing the largest number of sales opportunities. 

&#160; 

The diversity of our customer type presents us with a diverse scope of installation requirements. We routinely encounter installation applications that may require roof mounting, ground or post mounting, carport systems, and custom applications necessary to overcome physical site conditions. 

&#160; 

As we work to expand our marketing and customer acquisition efforts we intend to seek sales opportunities for government facilities, and respond to proposal requests for utility scale solar power operations. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Sales, Marketing, and Planned Operations 

&#160; 

We have traditionally focused our sales efforts and operations on the delivery of commercial solar power systems in the California market. We believe that our focus provides us long term benefits for brand development as a commercial solar power specialist within a market that we believe to be in the early stages of growth, and poised for a broad adoption of solar power generation. 

We see this as a significant business development opportunity as management has the skillset associated with construction management, the licensing qualifications necessary for us to qualify as a licensed contractor in California, we have extensive experience associated with solar PV technologies and the design requirements associated with the delivery of a commercial solar power system, and there is a market demand available for us to provide these services to. We believe that these efforts may provide us with the fastest path to increasing revenue generation, and the ability to reduce future dependency on the sale of debt or equity to fund operations. 

&#160; 

In the second half of 2015 period we began to expand our marketing efforts to include residential sales, however an area in which we believe we can establish distinct marketing and sales advantages is through the sale and delivery of commercial solar carport systems. 

While we believe that the commercial and residential rooftop solar will continue to offer sales growth opportunities, non-residential solar carport systems can, in many instances, provide us the opportunity to offer customers larger project sizing, greater electricity savings, and the ability to differentiate XsunX from competitors. 

In the 2015 period we established the capabilities to design, directly source all of the major system components, and deliver solar carport systems allowing us to eliminate reliance on costly third party specialty subcontractors whom we believe the majority of our competitors rely on. This has allowed us to reduce our carport structure installation costs by approximate 35%, and the overall PV system cost by approximately 15% which, we believe, provides us with a distinct pricing advantage for solar carports within the greater Southern California markets that we serve. 

We plan to market the advantages we have developed through efforts that include advertising, direct outside sales, targeted direct marketing, commissioned consultants, and the referral of satisfied customers. 

&#160; 

Solar System Operations and Supply 

&#160; 

We purchase major components such as solar panels, inverters, and solar module mounting hardware directly from manufacturers and supply houses. When possible, we have establish direct factory purchasing relationships. We have selected these suppliers and components based on cost, reliability, warranty coverage, ease of installation, application design and suitability, and technology advantages. 

&#160; 

Additionally, to compete favorably we have establish relationships with lenders through which we can introduce financing options for the systems we design and install. These financing options provide an alternative cash management solution for our target customers, and a sales inducement to purchase systems. 

&#160; 

For the foreseeable future we anticipate that we will purchase the system components for each project on an as-needed basis from suppliers at the then-prevailing prices pursuant to purchase orders issued. Due to the volatility of component pricing we do not anticipate any supplier arrangements that will contain long-term pricing or volume commitments. Should our sales results, volume, and market conditions warrant we may in the future elect to make purchase commitments to ensure sufficient supply and reduced pricing of the components that we use. 

&#160; 

Our operations focus is to provide complete solar power project design, management of engineering, facility preparation, installation of systems, repair or restoration to all affected areas resulting from the installation process, and any ongoing maintenance agreements as may be sold. To accomplish this we use the services of licensed service professionals in each of the representative trades or specialties necessary. Additionally, we provide qualified staff to supervise project operations, inspections, and system start up and energizing. In the 2016 fiscal period we anticipate that the addition of direct delivery of solar carport systems may allow our sales to increase, and we plan to expand our direct project management capabilities through the addition of qualified field supervisory and engineering staff. 

CIGSolar&#174; Thin Film Operations 

Prior to the start of our commercial solar power sales operations we had, through September 2013, devoted the majority of our resources to the development of a low cost solution for the manufacture of Copper Indium Gallium Selenide (CIGS) thin film solar cells which we call CIGSolar&#174;. Our target market and customer for this technology are manufacturers who produce solar cells and assemble solar modules. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

During the 2012 and 2013 periods all manufacturers of thin film solar technologies experienced a significant erosion of any cost advantages that their technologies may have provided relative to the use of silicon technologies. As a result of the rapid and unprecedented cost reductions to the use of silicon technologies, the thin film industry has experienced a significant reduction to the number of companies that produce, or intended to produce, thin film solar products in the 2014 and 2015 periods as compared to earlier periods. Silicon solar modules are anticipated to remain the dominant technology and increase market share in 2016 while thin film technology production is anticipated to continue to lose market share. 

In response to these continuing trends we do not plan to devote resources towards additional testing, calibration, or enhancements to our thin film technologies. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We believe that our primary competitors are traditional utilities who have a well-established relationship with our target customers, and provide the ease of a status quo relationship without upfront investment costs. To compete with these traditional utilities our products and services must present compelling financial incentives to induce customers to make initial investments that, prior to the application of investment incentives, may equal 8 to 10 years of typical incremental traditional utility service costs. 

&#160; 

Helping to accelerate the capital recovery timelines, and the attractiveness of purchasing our systems, are City, State, and Federal government based installation and tax incentives. Additionally, net energy metering (NEM) programs provide customers the ability to receive credits from their respective utility for the production of solar power that at times may be unused and sent into the utility network. Together these programs often help to accelerate capital recovery timelines for customers to within 3 to 5 years. 

&#160; 

To compete with a traditional utility we present customers with compelling differentiating benefits to support commercial solar power investment decisions. These include lifecycle investment rate of returns that can exceed 30%, long term control and predictability of energy costs, reductions to facility operating costs, increased property or business re-sale value, turn-key system installation, the management of available utility incentives, and the ability to view all aspects of electrical power usage to further improve operational efficiencies. Based on these factors we believe that we compete favorably with traditional utilities in the regions we service. 

&#160; 

We also compete with companies that provide products and services in other segments of the solar energy and energy-related products value chain. To expand our sales and revenue options, and to improve our competitive position, we plan to offer customers more options that we anticipate will include energy storage systems, energy efficiency consultations, and additional energy-related products and services. 

In the 2015 period we established the capabilities to design, directly source all of the major system components, and deliver solar carport systems allowing us to eliminate reliance on costly third party specialty subcontractors whom we believe the majority of our competitors rely on. This has allowed us to reduce our carport structure installation costs by approximate 35%, and the overall PV system cost by approximately 15% which, we believe, provides us with a distinct pricing advantage for solar carports within the greater Southern California markets that we serve. 

Our plan for operations is to offer customers distinct practical benefits as an all-in-one provider. However, we cannot assure that we will be able to compete successfully in the solar power industry, or that future competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

The following is an outline of certain patents and technologies we have developed, attempted to develop, have acquired, or licensed: 

&#160; 

The Company has previously worked to develop a hybrid manufacturing solution to produce high performance Copper Indium Gallium (di) Selenide (CIGS) thin film solar cells. Our technology, which we call CIGSolar&#174;, focuses on the mass production of individual thin-film CIGS solar cells that match silicon solar cell dimensions and could offered as a non-toxic, high-efficiency and lowest-cost alternative to the use of silicon solar cells. 

In April 2012 we filed claims related to our thermal effusion source design. In October 2014 we received a Restriction Requirement from the United States Patent and Trademark Office that reports the results of the initial examination of the patent application. The examination by the USPTO asserts that the application is directed to two distinct inventions and has issued a restriction requirement. The term &#8220;restriction&#8221; is applied where the Examiner believes that two (2) or more inventions are separately claimed in the same patent application. Thus, by issuing the restriction requirement, the Examiner is asserting that our application covers more than one invention. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

After completing a review of options related to modifying our patent application, and the limited market conditions related to the demand for thin film technologies, we elected to abandon our claims. We do not anticipate any further efforts related to filing or pursuing patent claims related to our prior thin film CIGS efforts. 

&#160; 

In September 2003, the Company was assigned the rights to three patents as part of an Asset Purchase Agreement with Xoptix Inc., a California corporation. The patents acquired were No. 6,180,871 for Transparent Solar Cell and Method of Fabrication (Device), granted on January 30, 2001; No. 6,320,117 for Transparent Solar Cell and Method of Fabrication (Method of Fabrication), granted on November 20, 2001; and No. 6,509,204 for Transparent Solar Cell and Method of Fabrication (formed with a Schottky barrier diode and method of its manufacture), granted on January 21, 2003. We do not currently employ nor envision the use of the above named patents in the development or commercialization of our CIGSolar&#174; technology. Because of technological and business developments within the solar industry, we believe that these patents no longer provide business opportunities for the Company to pursue. 

On July 10, 2012, the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued a certificate of registration No. 4,172,218 granting the Company a trademark for the use of &#8220;CIGSolar&#8221;. 

We rely on trademark and copyright law, trade secret protection and confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have not been subject to any intellectual property claims. 

Company History 

XsunX is a Colorado corporation formerly known as Sun River Mining Inc. (&#8220;Sun River&#8221;). The Company was originally incorporated in Colorado on February 25, 1997. Effective September 24, 2003, the Company completed a Plan of Reorganization and Asset Purchase Agreement (the &#8220;Plan&#8221;). 

Pursuant to the Plan, the Company acquired the following three patents from Xoptix, Inc., a California corporation for Seventy Million (70,000,000) shares of common stock (post reverse split one for twenty): No. 6,180,871 for Transparent Solar Cell and Method of Fabrication (Device), granted on January 30, 2001; No. 6,320,117 for Transparent Solar Cell and Method of Fabrication (Method of Fabrication), granted on November 20, 2001; and No. 6,509,204 for Transparent Solar Cell and Method of Fabrication (formed with a Schottky barrier diode and method of its manufacture), granted on January 21, 2003. 

Pursuant to the Plan, the Company authorized the issuance of 110,530,000 (post reverse split) common shares. Prior to the Plan, the Company had no tangible assets and insignificant liabilities. Subsequent to the Plan, the Company completed its name change from Sun River Mining, Inc. to XsunX, Inc. The transaction was completed on September 30, 2003. 

Government Contracts 

There are no government contracts as of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. 

Compliance with Environmental Laws and Regulations 

The operations of the Company are subject to local, state and federal laws and regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control. Compliance with these regulations by the Company has required that, when necessary, we retain the use of consulting firms to assist in the engineering and design of systems related to equipment operations, management of industrial gas storage and delivery systems, and occupancy fire and safety construction standards to deal with emergency conditions. We do not anticipate that these costs will have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s operations or competitive position, and the cost of such compliance has not been material to date. The Company is unable to assess or predict at this time what effect additional regulations or legislation could have on its activities. 

Employees and Consultants 

As of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, we had three full-time employees including Mr. Tom Djokovich who is President and CEO. While we do add to, and reduce, the size of our workforce based on current needs this represents no full-time employee change to the same period ended 2014. To compensate our need for additional staff the Company also relies on qualified consultants and licensed professionals to perform specific functions that otherwise would require an employee. As we continue to expand our business developments efforts we may need to add staff to adequately respond to sales inquiries, project management, and general labor as warranted. We consider relations with our employees and consultants to be good. 

Seasonality 

Our operations can experience some seasonality with increased demand early and later in in each year.
