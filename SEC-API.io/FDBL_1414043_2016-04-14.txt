Who We Are 

As of December 31, 2013, Titan Iron Ore. Corp. was a mineral exploration company. Due to our inability to raise capital to further develop mining claims and pursue mineral exploration, we decided to exit the mining business and look for other opportunities. On February 3, 2014, we completed a merger with iHookup Social, Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#8220;iHookup&#8221;) pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the &#8220;Merger Agreement&#8221;) dated January 31, 2014. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, we incorporated a new subsidiary called iHookup Operations Corp, a Delaware corporation, which merged with and into iHookup, causing the subsidiary&#8217;s separate existence to cease and iHookup to become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. iHookup&#8217;s stockholders exchanged all of their twelve million (12,000,000) shares of outstanding common stock for fifty million (50,000,000) shares of the Company&#8217;s newly designated Series A Preferred Stock. Each share of common stock entitles its holder to one vote on each matter submitted to the stockholders. The holders of preferred stock are entitled to cast votes equal to nine (9) times the total number of shares of common stock which are issued and outstanding, voting together with the holders of common stock as a single class. Such Series A Preferred Stock shall also be convertible into the number of shares of common stock which equals nine (9) times the total number of shares of common stock which are issued and outstanding at the time of conversion until the closing of a Qualified Financing (i.e. the sale and issuance of our equity securities that results in gross proceeds in excess of $2,500,000). As a result of the transaction, the former Friendable stockholders received a controlling interest in the Company. 

Friendable&#8217;s business is development and dissemination of a "proximity based" mobile social media application that facilitates connections between people, utilizing the intelligence of GPS and localized recommendations. Management believes that its Friendable app brand, feature set and over all appeal to a broad base of social user demographics will assist in the company's goal of building millions of registered users across the US and worldwide. The company's number one focus and growth metric is registered users, with users equating to valuation drivers in the current market sector of Friendable. As critical mass continues to build in terms of registered users, management believes millions of users may attract other social media giants to Friendable for potential M&#38;A discussions, it should be noted that users have been the basis for M&#38;A activity by such companies that have deep monetization engines that can benefit from the acquisition of users in a specific demographic.

Marketing 

&#160;

We market our application utilizing a variety of online and offline marketing activities. 

&#160;

Our online marketing activities generally consist of the purchase of mobile-banners and other display advertising and search engine marketing. We run various mobile ad campaigns targeting male, female and Apple / iOS and Android users on Facebook and other regional, US and international sites. In addition, the company produces video ads that may be run on mobile &#8220;video&#8221; ad networks or be placed based on a variety of alliances with third parties who advertise and promote our services, from time to time. Such video advertising may be expanded and utilized in commercials, on Facebook, YouTube, and various other editorial and public relations efforts. 

&#160;

The company plans to announce specific name changes and feature additions to its current application, believed by management to enable the brand to expand its services beyond what currently exists in the marketplace today. 

Revenue 

The company's revenue model is to incorporate and derive revenue from subscription fees, in-app purchases (upgrades/coins purchased by users, using the app) as well as advertising/sponsorship as population density and overall users growth expands to support active page views. 

Competition 

The mobile-social business is highly competitive and barriers to entry are minimal. We compete primarily with other social networking, messaging and dating applications (e.g. Facebook, Lovoo, Banjo), but also category specific websites (e.g. Match.com, Tinder and eHarmony), social apps, dating and matchmaking services, other social media platforms and apps, and other conventional media companies that provide socially active lifestyle services. 

We believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the following factors: 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

establishing a &#8220;Friendly&#8221; brand that will be socially shared, acceptable and viral in nature; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

the size and diversity of our registered member and subscriber bases relative to those of our competitors; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

the functionality of our application and the attractiveness of their features and our services and offerings generally to consumers relative to those of our competitors; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

how quickly we can enhance our existing technology and services and/or develop new features and localized opportunities and venue based monetization opportunities in response to: 

&#160; &#9679; 

new, emerging and rapidly changing technologies;

&#160; &#9679; 

the introduction of product and service offerings by our competitors; 

&#160; &#9679; 

changes in consumer requirements and trends in the single community relative to our competitors; and 

&#160; &#9679; 

our ability to engage in cost-effective marketing efforts, including by way of maintaining relationships with third parties with which we have entered into alliances, and the recognition and strength of our various brands relative to those of our competitors

Intellectual Property 

We intend, in due course, subject to legal advice, to apply for trademark, copyright and/or patent protection in the United States and other jurisdictions. We regard our intellectual property, including our software and trademark, as valuable assets and intend to vigorously defend them against infringement. 

While there can be no assurance that registered trademarks and copyrights will protect our proprietary information, we intend to file for protection and assert our intellectual property rights against any infringer. Although any assertion of our rights can result in a substantial cost to, and diversion of effort by, our Company, management believes that the protection of our intellectual property rights is an important part of our operating strategy. 

Market Opportunity 

&#160;

As a whole, mobile applications create a socially connected experience while allowing users to stay active or do as they choose while on the move, pushing forward with both personal and professional goals. Social Networking is one of the fastest growing market segments in mobile communications, continuing to attract new users. A common problem faced across all age and demographic profiles, is the lack of time in each day. Easy, accessible and user driven technologies are replacing traditional avenues of meeting people by providing yet another way to embrace our &#8220;Do it all&#8221; and &#8220;Have it all&#8221; mobile - social generation.

Friendable believes that Social Networking and socializing in general is inherently local, being better served by mobile applications that provide accessibility wherever users go. &#160; Today&#8217;s mobile society prefers to not be in front of a computer to view potential connections, or to receive or send messages. Instead, the user&#8217;s phone is always by his or her side.
