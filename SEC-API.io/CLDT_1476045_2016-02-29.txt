 Item 1. Business 

Overview 

&#160; 

Chatham Lodging Trust (&#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was formed as a Maryland real estate investment trust on October 26, 2009. We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes (a "REIT") commencing with our 2010 taxable year. The Company is internally-managed and was organized to invest primarily in upscale extended-stay and premium-branded select-service hotels. 

We had no operations prior to the consummation of our initial public offering ("IPO") in April 2010. The net proceeds from our share offerings are contributed to Chatham Lodging, L.P., our operating partnership (the &#8220;Operating Partnership&#8221;), in exchange for partnership interests. Substantially all of the Company&#8217;s assets are held by, and all of its operations are conducted through, the Operating Partnership. Chatham Lodging Trust is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership and owns 100% of the common units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership ("common units"). Certain of the employees of the Company hold vested and unvested long-term incentive plan units in the Operating Partnership ("LTIP Units"), which are presented as non-controlling interests on our consolidated balance sheets. 

From its inception through December 31, 2015 , the Company has completed the following offerings of its common shares of beneficial interest, $0.01 par value per share ("common shares"):

(1) Excludes any shares issued pursuant to the Company's ATM Plan or DRSPP (each as defined below). 

(2) The Company sold 500,000 common shares to Jeffrey H. Fisher, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer ("Mr. Fisher") in a private placement concurrent with the closing of its IPO. 

In January 2014, the Company established a $25 million dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan ("DRSPP"). Under the DRSPP, shareholders may purchase additional common shares by reinvesting some or all of the cash dividends received on the Company's common shares. Shareholders may also make optional cash purchases of the Company's common shares subject to certain limitations detailed in the prospectus for the DRSPP. As of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively, we had issued 5,595 &#32;and 2,083 &#32;shares under the DRSPP at a weighted average price of $25.00 &#32;and $24.38 &#32;per share, respectively. As of December 31, 2015 , there were common shares having a maximum aggregate sales price of approximately $24.9 &#32;million available for issuance under the DRSPP. 

In January 2014, the Company established an At the Market Equity Offering ("ATM Plan") whereby, from time to time, we may publicly offer and sell up to $50 million of our common shares by means of ordinary brokers' transactions on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE"), in negotiated transactions or in transactions that are deemed to be "at the market" offerings as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act, with Cantor Fitzgerald &#38; Co. ("Cantor") acting as sales agent. On January 13, 2015, the Company entered into a sales agreement with Barclays Capital Inc. (&#8220;Barclays&#8221;) to add Barclays as an additional sales agent under the Company&#8217;s ATM Plan. As of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively, we had issued 880,820 &#32;and 880,820 &#32;shares under the ATM Plan at a weighted average price of $23.54 &#32;per share in addition to the offerings discussed above. As of December 31, 2015 , there were common shares having a maximum aggregate sales price of approximately $29.3 &#32;million available for issuance under the ATM Plan. 

As of December 31, 2015 , the Company owned 38 &#32;hotels with an aggregate of 5,678 &#32;rooms located in 15 &#32;states and the District of Columbia. As of December 31, 2015 , the Company also (i) held a 10.3% &#32;noncontrolling interest in a joint venture (the &#8220;NewINK JV&#8221;) with NorthStar Realty Finance Corp. ("NorthStar"), which was formed in the second quarter of 2014 to acquire 47 &#32;hotels from a joint venture (the "Innkeepers JV") between the Company and Cerberus Capital Management (&#8220;Cerberus&#8221;), comprising an aggregate of 6,097 &#32;rooms and (ii) held a 10.0% &#32;noncontrolling interest in a separate joint venture (the "Inland JV") with NorthStar, which was formed in the fourth quarter of 2014 to acquired 48 &#32;hotels from Inland American Real Estate Trust, Inc. ("Inland"), comprising an aggregate of 6,401 &#32;rooms. The Company sold its 5.0% &#32;noncontrolling interest in a joint venture (the "Torrance JV") with Cerberus that owned the 248 -room Residence Inn by Marriott in Torrance, CA on December 30, 2015. We sometimes use the term, "JV's", which refers collectively to, for the period prior to December 31, 2015 , the NewINK JV, Inland JV and Torrance JV and, for the period subsequent to December 30, 2015, the NewINK JV and the Inland JV. 

To qualify as a REIT, the Company cannot operate its hotels. Therefore, the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries lease our wholly owned hotels to taxable REIT subsidiary lessees (&#8220;TRS Lessees&#8221;), which are wholly owned by one of the Company&#8217;s taxable REIT subsidiary (&#8220;TRS&#8221;) holding companies. The Company indirectly (i) owns its 10.3% interest in 47 &#32;of the NewINK JV hotels, (ii) owns its 10% interest in 48 &#32;of the Inland JV hotels and (iii) owned its 5% interest in the Torrance JV, which was sold on December 30, 2015, through the Operating Partnership. All of the NewINK JV hotels and Inland JV hotels are and the Torrance JV hotel was leased to TRS Lessees, in which the Company indirectly owns noncontrolling interests through one of its TRS holding companies. Each hotel is leased to a TRS Lessee under a percentage lease that provides for rental payments equal to the greater of (i) a fixed base rent amount or (ii) a percentage rent based on hotel room revenue. The initial term of each of the TRS leases is 5 years. Lease revenue from each TRS Lessee is eliminated in consolidation. 

The TRS Lessees have entered into management agreements with third-party management companies that provide day-to-day management for the hotels. As of December 31, 2015 , Island Hospitality Management Inc. (&#8220;IHM&#8221;), which was 51% owned by Mr. Fisher and 45% owned by affiliates of NorthStar Asset Management Group, Inc., managed 36 &#32;of the Company&#8217;s wholly owned hotels and Concord Hospitality Enterprises Company ("Concord") managed two of the Company&#8217;s wholly owned hotels. As of December 31, 2015 , all &#32;of the NewINK JV hotels were managed by IHM. As of December 31, 2015 , 34 &#32;of the Inland JV hotels are managed by IHM and 14 &#32;hotels are managed by Marriott International, Inc. ("Marriott"). The Torrance JV hotel was managed by Marriott. 

As of December 31, 2015 , our wholly owned hotels include upscale extended-stay hotels that operate under the Residence Inn by Marriott &#174; &#32;brand (fifteen hotels) and Homewood Suites by Hilton &#174; &#32;brand (nine hotels), as well as premium-branded select-service hotels that operate under the Courtyard by Marriott &#174; &#32;brand (four hotels), the Hampton Inn or Hampton Inn and Suites by Hilton &#174; &#32;brand (three hotels), the Hilton Garden Inn by Hilton &#174; &#32;brand (three hotels), the SpringHill Suites by Marriott &#174; &#32;brand (two hotels) and the Hyatt Place&#174; brand (two hotels). 

&#160; 

We primarily invest in upscale extended-stay hotels such as Homewood Suites by Hilton &#174; and Residence Inn by Marriott &#174; . Upscale extended-stay hotels typically have the following characteristics: 

&#160;&#8226;

&#160; Financial Information About Industry Segments 

We evaluate all of our hotels as a single industry segment because all of our hotels have similar economic characteristics and provide similar services to similar types of customers. Accordingly, we do not report segment information. 

&#160; &#160; Business Strategy 

&#160; 

Our primary objective is to generate attractive returns for our shareholders through investing in hotel properties (whether wholly owned or through a joint venture) at prices that provide strong returns on invested capital, paying dividends and generating long-term value appreciation. We believe we can create long-term value by pursuing the following strategies: 

&#160; 

&#160;&#8226; 

Disciplined acquisition of hotel properties: We invest primarily in premium-branded upscale extended-stay and select-service hotels with a focus on the 25 largest metropolitan markets in the United States. We focus on acquiring hotel properties at prices below replacement cost in markets that have strong demand generators and where we expect demand growth will outpace new supply. We also seek to acquire properties that we believe are undermanaged or undercapitalized. We currently do not intend to engage in new hotel development. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;&#8226; 

Opportunistic hotel repositioning: We employ value-added strategies, such as re-branding, renovating, expanding or changing management, when we believe such strategies will increase the operating results and values of the hotels we acquire. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;&#8226; 

Aggressive asset management: Although as a REIT we cannot operate our hotels, we proactively manage our third-party hotel managers in seeking to maximize hotel operating performance. Our asset management activities seek to ensure that our third-party hotel managers effectively utilize franchise brands' marketing programs, develop effective sales management policies and plans, operate properties efficiently, control costs, and develop operational initiatives for our hotels that increase guest satisfaction. As part of our asset management activities, we regularly review opportunities to reinvest in our hotels to maintain quality, increase long-term value and generate attractive returns on invested capital. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;&#8226; 

Flexible selection of hotel management companies: We are flexible in our selection of hotel management companies and select managers that we believe will maximize the performance of our hotels. We utilize independent management companies, including IHM, a hotel management company 51% owned by Mr. Fisher and 45% owned by affiliates of NorthStar Asset Management Group, Inc., that currently manages 36 of our wholly owned hotels, all of the hotels owned by the NewINK JV and 34 hotels owned by the Inland JV. We believe this strategy increases the universe of potential acquisition opportunities we can consider because many hotel properties are encumbered by long-term management contracts. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;&#8226; 

Selective investment in hotel debt: We may consider selectively investing in debt collateralized by hotel property if we believe we can foreclose on or acquire ownership of the underlying hotel property in the relative near term. We do not intend to invest in any debt where we do not expect to gain ownership of the underlying property or to originate any debt financing. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We plan to maintain a prudent capital structure and intend to maintain our leverage over the long term at a ratio of net debt to investment in hotels (at cost) (defined as our initial acquisition price plus the gross amount of any subsequent capital investment and excluding any impairment charges) at a level that will be similar to the level at which we currently operate. A subsequent decrease in hotel property values will not necessarily cause us to repay debt to comply with this target. Our debt coverage ratios currently are favorable and, as a result, we are comfortable in this leverage range and believe we have the capacity and flexibility to take advantage of acquisition opportunities as they arise. &#32; At December 31, 2015 , our leverage ratio was approximately 41 &#32;percent, which decreased from 44 &#32;percent at December 31, 2014 . &#32; Over time, we intend to finance our growth with free cash flow, debt and issuances of common shares and/or preferred shares. Our debt may include mortgage debt collateralized by our hotel properties and unsecured debt. 

&#160; 

When purchasing hotel properties, we may issue common units in our Operating Partnership as full or partial consideration to sellers who may desire to take advantage of tax deferral on the sale of a hotel or participate in the potential appreciation in value of our common shares. 

Competition 

&#160; 

We face competition for investments in hotel properties from institutional pension funds, private equity investors, REITs, hotel companies and others who are engaged in hotel investments. Some of these entities have substantially greater financial and operational resources than we have or may be willing to use higher leverage. This competition may increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell, reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities available to us and increase the cost of acquiring our targeted hotel properties. 

&#160; 

The lodging industry is highly competitive. Our hotels compete with other hotels for guests in each market in which they operate. Competitive advantage is based on a number of factors, including location, convenience, brand affiliation, room rates, range of services and guest amenities or accommodations offered and quality of customer service. Competition is often specific to the individual markets in which our hotels are located and includes competition from existing and new hotels. Competition could adversely affect our occupancy rates, our average daily rates ("ADR") and revenue per available room (&#8220;RevPAR&#8221;), and may require us to provide additional amenities or make capital improvements that we otherwise would not have to make, which may reduce our profitability. 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

Demand for our hotels is affected by recurring seasonal patterns. Generally, we expect that we will have lower revenue, operating income and cash flow in the first and fourth quarters and higher revenue, operating income and cash flow in the second and third quarters. These general trends are, however, influenced by overall economic cycles and the geographic locations of our hotels. To the extent that cash flow from operations is insufficient during any quarter, due to temporary or seasonal fluctuations in revenue, we expect to utilize cash on hand or borrowings under our credit facility to pay expenses, debt service or to make distributions to our equity holders. 

Regulation 

Our properties are subject to various covenants, laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to common areas and fire and safety requirements. We believe each of our hotels has the necessary permits and approvals to operate its business, and each is adequately covered by insurance. 

Americans with Disabilities Act 

Our properties must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA") to the extent that such properties are "public accommodations" as defined by the ADA. Under the ADA, all public accommodations must meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. Although we believe that the properties in which we own interests (including the properties owned by the JV's) substantially comply with present requirements of the ADA, we have not conducted a comprehensive audit or investigation of all of these properties to determine compliance, and one or more properties may not be fully compliant with the ADA. 

In March 2012, a substantial number of changes to the Accessibility Guidelines under the ADA took effect. The new guidelines caused us to renovate some of our hotel properties and to incur costs to become fully compliant. 

If we or any of our joint ventures are required to make substantial modifications to our wholly owned or joint venture hotel properties, whether to comply with the ADA or other changes in governmental rules and regulations, our financial condition, results of operations, the market price of our common shares and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders could be adversely affected. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one, and we will continue to assess our properties and to make alterations as appropriate. 

Environmental Regulations 

&#160; 

Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on or in such property. Such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. The cost of any required remediation and the owner's liability therefore as to any property are generally not limited under such laws and could exceed the value of the property and/or the aggregate assets of the owner. The presence of such substances, or the failure to properly remediate contamination from such substances, may adversely affect the owner's ability to sell the real estate or to borrow funds using such property as collateral, which could have an adverse effect on our return from such investment. 

Furthermore, various court decisions have established that third parties may recover damages for injury caused by release of hazardous substances and for property contamination. For instance, a person exposed to asbestos while working at or staying in a hotel may seek to recover damages if he or she suffers injury from the asbestos. Lastly, some of these environmental issues restrict the use of a property or place conditions on various activities. One example is laws that require a business using chemicals to manage them carefully and to notify local officials if regulated spills occur. 

&#160; 

Although it is our policy to require an acceptable Phase I environmental survey for all real property in which we invest prior to our investment, such surveys are limited in scope. As a result, there can be no assurance that a Phase I environmental survey will uncover any or all hazardous or toxic substances on a property prior to our investment in that property. We cannot assure you that: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

there are not existing environmental liabilities related to our properties of which we are not aware; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

future laws, ordinances or regulations will not impose material environmental liability; or 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

the current environmental condition of a hotel will not be affected by the condition of properties in the vicinity of the hotel (such as the presence of leaking underground storage tanks) or by third parties unrelated to us. 

&#160; 

Tax Status 

&#160; 

We elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with our short taxable year ended December 31, 2010 under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;). Our qualification as a REIT depends upon our ability to meet, on a continuing basis, through actual investment and operating results, various complex requirements under the Code relating to, among other things, the sources of our gross income, the composition and values of our assets, our distribution levels and the diversity of ownership of our shares of beneficial interest. We believe that we are organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification as a REIT under the Code and that our current and intended manner of operation will enable us to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. 

&#160; 

As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on our REIT taxable income that we distribute currently to our shareholders. Under the Code, REITs are subject to numerous organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that they distribute each year at least 90% of their taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gains. If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any taxable year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, our income for that year will be taxed at regular corporate rates, and we will be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which we ceased to qualify as a REIT. Even if we qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we may still be subject to state and local taxes on our income and assets and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income. Additionally, any income earned by our TRS Lessees will be fully subject to federal, state and local corporate income tax. 

Hotel Management Agreements 

The management agreements with Concord have an initial ten -year term that expire on February 28, 2017 &#32;and will renew automatically for successive one -year terms unless terminated by the TRS Lessee or the manager by written notice to the other party no later than 90 days &#32;prior to the then current term&#8217;s expiration date. The management agreements may be terminated for cause, including the failure of the managed hotel to meet specified operating performance levels. If the Company were to terminate the management agreements during the first nine years of the term, other than for breach or default by the manager, the Company would be responsible for paying termination fees to the manager. Base management fees under the management agreements with Concord are calculated as a percentage of the hotel's gross room revenue. 

The management agreements with IHM have an initial term of five years &#32;and will automatically renew for two &#32;successive five -year periods unless IHM provides written notice no later than 90 days prior to the then current term's expiration date of their intent not to renew. The IHM management agreements provide for early termination at the Company&#8217;s option upon sale of any IHM-managed hotel for no termination fee, with six months &#32;advance notice. The IHM management agreements may be terminated for cause, including the failure of the managed hotel to meet specified performance levels. Base management fees are calculated as a percentage of the hotel's gross room revenue. If certain financial thresholds are met or exceeded, an incentive management fee is calculated as 10% of the hotel's net operating income less fixed costs, base management fees and a specified return threshold. The incentive management fee is capped at 1% of gross hotel revenues for the applicable calculation.

Ground Leases 

The Courtyard Altoona hotel is subject to a ground lease with an expiration date of April 30, 2029 with an extension option by the Company of up to 12 additional terms of five years each. Monthly payments are determined by the quarterly average room occupancy of the hotel. Rent is equal to approximately $8,000 per month when monthly occupancy is less than 85% and can increase up to approximately $20,000 per month if occupancy is 100%, with minimum rent increased by two and one-half percent (2.5%) on an annual basis. 

The Residence Inn San Diego Gaslamp hotel is subject to a ground lease with an expiration of January 31, 2065 with extension options of up to 3 additional terms of ten years each. Monthly payments are currently $40,000 per month and increase 10% every 5 years.
