GENERAL INFORMATION 

MGP is a leading producer and supplier of premium distilled spirits and specialty wheat proteins and starches. Distilled spirits include premium bourbon and rye whiskeys, and grain neutral spirits, including vodka and gin. The Company&#8217;s proteins and starches provide a host of functional, nutritional and sensory benefits for a wide range of food products to serve the packaged goods industry. MGP is also a top producer of high quality industrial alcohol for use in both food and non-food applications. Our distillery products are derived from corn and other grains (including rye, barley, wheat, barley malt, and milo), and our ingredient products are derived from wheat flour. The majority of our sales are made directly or through distributors to manufacturers and processors of finished packaged goods or to bakeries. 

The Company is headquartered in Atchison, Kansas, where distilled alcohol products and food ingredients are produced at the Company's production facility ("Atchison facility"). Premium spirits are also distilled and matured at the Company&#8217;s facility in Lawrenceburg and Greendale, Indiana ("Lawrenceburg facility"). 

&#160; 

INFORMATION ABOUT SEGMENTS 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015 , the Company has two reportable segments: distillery products and ingredient solutions. On February 8, 2013, we sold all of the assets included in a third segment, our other segment, which included a bioplastics manufacturing business. Additional information about our reportable segments can be found in Management&#8217;s Discussion &#38; Analysis ("MD&#38;A") and Note 11. 

Distillery Products Segment &#32;- We process corn and other grains into food grade alcohol and distillery co-products, such as distillers feed (commonly called dried distillers grain in the industry), fuel grade alcohol, and corn oil. We also provide warehouse services, including barrel put away, barrel storage, and barrel retrieval services. We have certain contracts with customers to supply distilled products (or "distillate"), as well as certain contracts with customers to provide barreling and warehousing services. Contracts with customers may be monthly, annual, and multi-year with periodic review of pricing. Sales of fuel grade alcohol are made on the spot market. During 2015, our five largest distillery products customers, combined, accounted for about 23.3 percent of our consolidated net sales. 

&#160; 

Food Grade Alcohol - The majority of our distillery capacities are dedicated to the production of high quality, high purity food grade alcohol for beverage and industrial applications. 

Food grade alcohol sold for beverage applications consists primarily of premium bourbon and rye whiskeys, and grain neutral spirits, including vodka and gin. Our premium bourbon is created by distilling grains, primarily corn. Our whiskey is made from fermented grain mash, including rye and corn. Our whiskeys are primarily sold as unaged new distillate, which are then aged by our customers from two to four years and are sold at various proof concentrations. Grain neutral spirits are sold in bulk quantities at various proof concentrations. Our gin is created by redistilling grain neutral spirits together with proprietary customer formulations of botanicals or botanical oils. 

&#160; 

In July 2015, we announced our first retail-distributed brand which was made available for retail sale in September 2015. The brand, Metze's Select, is a limited edition Indiana Straight Bourbon Whiskey. 

Food-grade industrial alcohol is used as an ingredient in foods (e.g., vinegar and food flavorings), personal care products (e.g., hair sprays and hand sanitizers), cleaning solutions, pharmaceuticals, and a variety of other products. We sell food-grade industrial alcohol in tank truck or rail car quantities direct to a number of industrial processors. 

&#160; 

Distillers Feed and related Co-Products - The bulk alcohol co-products sales include distillers feed, fuel grade alcohol, and corn oil. Distillers feed is principally derived from the mash from alcohol processing operations. The mash is dried and sold primarily to processors of animal feeds as a high protein additive. We produce fuel grade alcohol as a co-product of our food grade alcohol business at our distillery in Atchison. We produce corn oil as a value-added co-product through a corn oil extraction process. 

&#160; 

Fuel grade alcohol is sold primarily for blending with gasoline to increase the octane and oxygen levels of the gasoline. As an octane enhancer, fuel grade alcohol can serve as a substitute for lead and petroleum-based octane enhancers. As an oxygenate, fuel grade alcohol has been used in gasoline to meet certain environmental regulations and laws relating to air quality by reducing carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon particulates and other toxic emissions generated from the burning of gasoline. 

&#160; 

Warehouse revenue - Customers who purchase unaged barreled whiskey distillate may, and in most cases do, also enter into separate warehouse service agreements with us for the storage of product for aging that include services for barrel put away, barrel storage and barrel retrieval. Revenue from warehousing services is recognized upon providing the service and/or over the passage of time, as in the case of storage fees. 

Ingredient Solutions Segment &#32;- Our ingredient solutions segment consists primarily of specialty wheat starches, specialty wheat proteins, commodity wheat starch and commodity wheat protein. Contracts with ingredients customers are generally price, volume, and term agreements which are fixed for three or six month periods, with very few agreements of 12 months duration or more. During 2015, our five largest ingredient solutions customers, combined, accounted for about 11.2 percent of our consolidated net sales. 

Specialty Wheat Starches &#32;- Wheat starch constitutes the carbohydrate-bearing portion of wheat flour. We produce a premium wheat starch powder by extracting the starch from the starch slurry, substantially free of all impurities and fibers, and then dry the starch in spray, flash or drum dryers. 

A substantial portion of our premium wheat starch is altered during processing to produce certain unique specialty wheat starches designed for special applications. We sell our specialty starches on a global basis, primarily to food processors and distributors. 

We market our specialty wheat starches under the trademarks Fibersym&#174; Resistant Starch series, FiberRite&#174; RW Resistant Starch, Pregel&#174; Instant Starch series, and Midsol&#174; Cook-up Starch series. They are used primarily for food applications as an ingredient in a variety of food products to affect their nutritional profile, appearance, texture, tenderness, taste, palatability, cooking temperature, stability, viscosity, binding and freeze-thaw characteristics. Important physical properties contributed by wheat starch include whiteness, clean flavor, viscosity and texture. For example, our starches are used to improve the taste and texture of cream puffs, &#233;clairs, puddings, pie fillings, breading and batters; to improve the size, symmetry and taste of angel food cakes; to alter the viscosity of soups, sauces and gravies; to improve the freeze-thaw stability and shelf life of fruit pies and other frozen foods; to improve moisture retention in microwavable foods; and to add stability and to improve spreadability in frostings, mixes, glazes and sugar coatings. 

&#160; 

Our wheat starches, as a whole, generally compete primarily with corn starch, which dominates the United States starch market. However, the unique characteristics of our specialty wheat starches provide a number of advantages over corn and other starches for certain baking and other end uses. 

&#160; 

Specialty Wheat Proteins &#32;- We have developed a number of specialty wheat proteins for food applications. Specialty wheat proteins are derived from vital wheat gluten through a variety of proprietary processes which change its molecular structure. Specialty wheat proteins for food applications include products in the Arise&#174; , Optein&#174;, and Trutex&#174;. Our specialty wheat proteins generally compete with other ingredients and modified proteins having similar characteristics, primarily soy proteins and other wheat proteins, with differentiation being based on factors such as functionality, price and, in the case of food applications, flavor. 

&#160; 

Commodity Wheat Starch - As is the case with value-added wheat starches, our commodity wheat starch has both food and non-food applications, but such applications are more limited than those of value-added wheat starches and typically sell for a lower price in the marketplace. Commodity wheat starch competes primarily with corn starches, which dominate the marketplace and prices generally track the fluctuations in the corn starch market. 

Commodity Wheat Proteins - Commodity wheat protein, or vital wheat gluten, is a free-flowing light tan powder which contains approximately 70 to 80 percent protein. When we process wheat flour to derive starch, we also derive vital wheat gluten. Vital wheat gluten is added by bakeries and food processors to baked goods, such as breads, and to pet foods, cereals, processed meats, and fish and poultry to improve the nutritional content, texture, strength, shape and volume of the product. The neutral flavor and color of vital wheat gluten also enhances the flavor and color of certain foods. The cohesiveness and elasticity of the gluten enables the dough in wheat and other high protein breads to rise and to support added ingredients, such as whole cracked grains, raisins and fibers. This allows bakers to make an array of different breads by varying the gluten content of the dough. Vital wheat gluten is also added to white breads, hot dog buns, and hamburger buns to improve the strength and cohesiveness of the product. 

COMPETITIVE CONDITION 

The markets in which our products are sold are competitive. Our products compete against similar products of many large and small companies. In our distillery products segment, competition is based primarily on product innovation, product characteristics, functionality, price, service and quality factors such as flavor. In our ingredient solutions segment competition is based primarily on product innovation, product characteristics, price, name, color, flavor, or other properties that affect how the ingredient is being used. 

PATENTS 

&#160; 

We are involved in a number of patent-related activities. We have filed patent applications to protect a range of inventions made in our expanding research and development efforts, including inventions relating to applications for our products. Some of these patents or licenses cover significant product formulation and processes used to manufacture our products. 

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 

&#160; 

During 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , we spent $748 , $1,622 , and $2,472 , respectively, on research and development activities. Research and development activities allow us to develop products across both of our segments to respond to changing consumer trends. 

SEASONALITY 

&#160; 

Our sales are generally not seasonal. 

TRANSPORTATION 

&#160; 

Historically, our output has been transported to customers by truck and rail, most of which is provided by common carriers. We use third party transportation companies to help us manage truck and rail carriers who deliver our products to our North American customers. As of December 31, 2015 , we leased 200 &#32;rail cars under operating leases. 

RAW MATERIALS AND PACKAGING MATERIALS 

Our principal distillery products segment raw materials are corn and other grains (including rye, barley, wheat, barley malt, and milo), which are processed into food grade alcohol and distillery co-products consisting of distillers feed, fuel grade alcohol, and corn oil. Our principal ingredient solutions segment raw material is wheat flour, which is processed into starches and proteins. The cost of grain has at times been subject to substantial fluctuation. 

In 2015 , we purchased most of our grain requirements from two suppliers, Bunge Milling and Consolidated Grain and Barge ("CGB"). Our current grain supply contracts with Bunge Milling and CGB both expire December 31, 2017. These contracts permit us to purchase grain for delivery up to 12 months into the future at negotiated prices, based on a formula using several factors. We also order wheat flour anywhere from one to 12 months into the future. We provide for our wheat flour requirements through a supply contract with Ardent Mills, which has a term that expires July 10, 2019. We typically enter contracts for future delivery only to protect margins on contracted alcohol sales, expected ingredient sales, and general usage. 

&#160; 

Our principal packaging material for our distillery products segment is oak barrels. Both new and used barrels are utilized for the aging of premium bourbon and rye whiskeys. We purchase oak barrels from multiple suppliers and some customers supply their own barrels. 

We also source food grade alcohol from Illinois Corn Processing, LLC ("ICP"), our 30 percent -owned joint venture. See additional information related to ICP in "Equity Method Investments" below, &#32; MD&#38;A, &#32; and Note 3. 

ENERGY 

&#160; 

We seek to assure the availability of fuels at competitive prices. We use natural gas to operate boilers that we use to make steam heat. We procure natural gas for our facilities in the open market from various suppliers. We have a risk management program whereby we may purchase contracts for the delivery of natural gas in the future at pre-determined prices or we can purchase futures contracts on the exchange. Depending on existing market conditions, in Atchison we have the ability to transport gas through a gas pipeline owned by a wholly-owned subsidiary. Historically, prices of natural gas have been higher in the late fall and winter months than during other periods. 

EMPLOYEES 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had a total of 293 &#32;employees. A collective bargaining agreement covering 102 &#32;employees at the Atchison facility expires on August 31, 2019. Another collective bargaining agreement covering 56 &#32;employees at the Lawrenceburg facility expires on December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2014 &#32;and 2013 , we had a total of 268 &#32;and 268 &#32; employees, respectively. We consider our relations with our personnel generally to be good. 

REGULATION 

&#160; 

We are subject to a broad range of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations intended to protect public health and the environment. Our operations are also subject to regulation by various federal agencies, including the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Trade Bureau ("TTB"), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Food and Drug Administration and the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("USEPA"), and by various state and local authorities. Such regulations cover virtually every aspect of our operations, including production facilities, marketing, pricing, labeling, packaging, advertising, water usage, waste water discharge, disposal of hazardous wastes and emissions and other matters. 

&#160; 

TTB regulation includes periodic TTB audits of all production reports, shipping documents, and licenses to assure that proper records are maintained. We are also required to file and maintain monthly reports with the TTB of alcohol inventories and shipments. 

EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS 

Illinois Corn Processing, LLC ("ICP"). &#32;On November 20, 2009, we completed a series of related transactions pursuant to which we contributed our Pekin facility and certain maintenance and repair materials to a newly-formed company, ICP, and then sold 50 percent &#32;of the membership interest in ICP to ICP Holdings, an affiliate of SEACOR. ICP reactivated distillery operations at the Pekin facility during the quarter ended March 31, 2010, and now produces high quality food grade alcohol, chemical intermediates, and fuel. 

In connection with these transactions, we entered into various agreements with ICP and ICP Holdings, including a Contribution Agreement, an LLC Interest Purchase Agreement and a Limited Liability Company Agreement. Under the LLC Interest Purchase Agreement, we sold ICP Holdings 50 percent of the membership interest in ICP. This agreement gave ICP Holdings the option to purchase up to an additional 20 percent of the membership interest in ICP at any time between the second and fifth anniversary based on an agreed to criteria. On February 1, 2012, ICP Holdings exercised its option and purchased an additional 20 percent from us for $9,103, reducing our ownership from 50 percent &#32;to 30 percent . 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the Limited Liability Company Agreement, control of day to day operations generally is retained by the members, acting by a majority in interest. Following ICP Holdings' exercise of its option referred to above, ICP Holdings owns 70 percent of ICP and generally is entitled to control its day to day operations. The Limited Liability Company Agreement also provides for the creation of an advisory board which consists of two advisers appointed by us and four advisers appointed by ICP Holdings. All actions of the advisory board require majority approval of the entire board, except that any transaction between ICP and ICP Holdings or its affiliates must be approved by the advisers appointed by us. The Limited Liability Company Agreement gives either member certain rights to shut down the facility if it operates at a loss. Such rights are conditional in certain instances but absolute if EBITDA (as defined in the agreement) losses are an aggregate $1,500 over any three consecutive quarters or if ICP's net working capital is less than $2,500. ICP Holdings also has the right to shut down the facility if ICP is in default under its loan agreement for failure to pay principal or interest for two months. 

On April 9, 2015, ICP obtained a $30,000 revolving credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., which may be increased in the future by an additional $20,000, subject to lender approval. The revolver matures on April 9, 2018. Simultaneous with the execution of the new revolving credit facility, ICP terminated its $15,000 amended and restated revolving credit facility with an affiliate of SEACOR, which would have matured January 31, 2016. The Company has no funding requirement to ICP. 

D.M. Ingredients GmbH ("DMI"). In 2007, we acquired a 50 percent &#32;interest in DMI, a German joint venture company that produces certain of our specialty ingredients products through a toller for distribution in the European Union ("E.U.") and elsewhere. 

On December 29, 2014, we gave notice to D.M. Ingredients, GmbH, ("DMI") and to our partner in DMI, Crespel and Dieters GmbH &#38; Co. KG ("C&#38;D"), to terminate our joint venture effective June 30, 2015. C&#38;D also provided notice to terminate DMI effective June 30, 2015. On June 22, 2015, a termination agreement was executed by and between us, DMI, and C&#38;D to dissolve DMI effective June 30, 2015. On June 22, 2015 a termination agreement was executed by and between us and DMI to terminate our distribution agreement effective June 29, 2015. Under German law, commencing on June 30, 2015, normal operations for DMI ceased and a one-year winding down process began.
