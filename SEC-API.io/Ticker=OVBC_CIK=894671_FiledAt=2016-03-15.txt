 ITEM 1 - BUSINESS 

Organizational History and Subsidiaries 

Ohio Valley Banc Corp. (&#8220;Ohio Valley&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is an Ohio corporation registered as a financial holding company pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (&#8220;BHC Act&#8221;). Ohio Valley was incorporated under the laws of the State of Ohio on January 8, 1992 and began conducting business on October 23, 1992. The principal executive offices of Ohio Valley are located at 420 Third Avenue, Gallipolis, Ohio 45631. Ohio Valley&#8217;s common shares are listed on The NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol &#8220;OVBC.&#8221; Ohio Valley has one banking subsidiary, The Ohio Valley Bank Company (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;). Ohio Valley also owns three nonbank subsidiaries, Loan Central, Inc., which engages in lending (&#8220;Loan Central&#8221;), Ohio Valley Financial Services Agency, LLC, which is used to facilitate the receipt of commissions on insurance sold by the Bank and Loan Central (&#8220;Ohio Valley Financial Services&#8221;), and OVBC Captive, Inc., a limited purpose property and casualty insurance company (&#8220;OVBC Captive&#8221;). Ohio Valley also owns one wholly-owned subsidiary trust formed solely to issue a trust preferred security. Ohio Valley and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the &#8220;Company.&#8221; Ohio Valley&#8217;s financial service operations are considered by management to be aggregated in two reportable segments: banking and consumer finance. Total revenues from the banking segment, which accounted for the majority of the Company&#8217;s total revenues, totaled 90.9%, 90.6% and 90.5% of total consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Business of Ohio Valley 

As a financial holding company registered under the BHC Act, Ohio Valley&#8217;s primary business is community banking. As of December 31, 2015, Ohio Valley&#8217;s consolidated assets approximated to $796,285,000, and total shareholders&#8217; equity approximated to $90,470,000. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; Ohio Valley is also permitted to engage in certain non-banking activities under the provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (&#8220;GLB Act&#8221;), such as securities underwriting and dealing activities, insurance agency and underwriting activities and merchant banking/equity investment activities. Ohio Valley presently has an insurance agency, Ohio Valley Financial Services, which is used to facilitate the receipt of commissions on insurance sold by the Bank and Loan Central. Ohio Valley also has a captive insurance company, OVBC Captive, that is engaged in the business of providing commercial property and various liability insurance to the Company and related entities. Management will consider opportunities to engage in additional nonbanking activities as they arise. 

Business of Bank Subsidiary 

A substantial portion of Ohio Valley&#8217;s revenue is derived from cash dividends paid by the Bank. The Bank presently has fourteen offices located in Ohio and West Virginia, all but three offering automatic teller machines (&#8220;ATMs&#8221;). Eight of these offices also offer drive-up services. The Bank accounted for substantially all of Ohio Valley&#8217;s consolidated assets at December 31, 2015. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

The Bank is primarily engaged in commercial and retail banking. The Bank is a full-service financial institution offering a blend of commercial and consumer banking services within southeastern Ohio as well as western West Virginia. The banking services offered by the Bank include the acceptance of deposits in checking, savings, time and money market accounts; the making and servicing of personal, commercial, floor plan and student loans; and the making of construction and real estate loans. The Bank also offers individual retirement accounts, safe deposit boxes, wire transfers and other standard banking products and services. As part of its lending function, the Bank offers credit card services. The Bank&#8217;s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;). In addition to originating loans, the Bank invests in U.S. government and agency obligations, interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions, and other investments permitted by applicable law. 

The Bank began offering trust services in 1981. The trust department acts as trustee under wills, trusts and profit sharing plans, as executor and administrator of estates, and as guardian for estates of minors and incompetents. In addition, the trust department performs a variety of investment and security services where the Bank acts as an agent on behalf of the client. Trust services are available to all customers of the Bank. 

The Bank also offers Internet banking to its customers, which allows customers to perform various transactions using a computer from any location as long as they have access to the Internet and a secure browser. Specifically, customers can check personal account balances, receive information about transactions within their accounts, make transfers between accounts, stop payment on a check, and reorder checks. Customers may also pay bills online and can make payments to virtually any business or individual. Furthermore, the Bank offers other financial management online services, such as cash management and news updates related to repossession auctions, current rates and general bank news. 

Business of Loan Central 

Loan Central is engaged in consumer finance, offering smaller balance personal and mortgage loans to individuals with higher credit risk history. Loan Central&#8217;s line of business also includes seasonal tax refund loan services. Loan Central presently has seven offices, all located within southeastern Ohio. 

Business of Financial Services Subsidiaries 

Ohio Valley Financial Services is a licensed insurance agency that is used to facilitate the receipt of commissions on insurance sold by the Bank and Loan Central. Ohio Valley Financial Services is licensed by the State of Ohio Department of Insurance. 

OVBC Captive is a pure captive insurance company engaged in providing commercial property and various liability insurance to the Company and affiliates. OVBC Captive has been approved under the guidelines of the State of Nevada Division of Insurance. 

Variable Interest Entities 

&#160;

&#160; &#160; Ohio Valley owns one special purpose entity, Ohio Valley Statutory Trust III, which has issued $8,500,000 in trust preferred securities. Ohio Valley has issued a like amount of subordinated debentures to the Trust in exchange for the proceeds of the issuance of the trust preferred securities. Ohio Valley used the proceeds to provide additional capital to the Bank to support growth. Further detail on Ohio Valley Statutory Trust III is located in Ohio Valley&#8217;s 2015 Annual Report to Shareholders under &#8220;Note H &#8211; Subordinated Debentures and Trust Preferred Securities,&#8221; in the notes to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.

&#160; 

Recent Corporate Developments 

On January 7, 2016, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Milton Bancorp Agreement") with Milton Bancorp, Inc. (&#8220;Milton Bancorp&#8221;). The Milton Bancorp Agreement calls for Milton Bancorp to merge into the Company and for Milton Bancorp's wholly-owned subsidiary, The Milton Banking Company, which operates five branches in Ohio, to merge into the Bank. Under the terms of the Milton Bancorp Agreement, shareholders of Milton Bancorp will receive for each of the 400 outstanding common shares of Milton Bancorp 1,636 of the Company&#8217;s common shares, $37,219 in cash, or a combination of the Company&#8217;s common shares and cash for each share of Milton Bancorp, subject to a limitation that 80% of the outstanding Milton Bancorp common shares will be exchanged for the Company&#8217;s common shares and 20% of the outstanding Milton Bancorp common shares will be exchanged for cash. In addition, the 1,237 preferred shares of Milton Bancorp will be exchanged for $3,600 per share. The Milton Bancorp transaction is expected to close by the third quarter of 2016, pending adoption of the Milton Bancorp Agreement by the shareholders of Milton Bancorp, the satisfaction of various closing conditions, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of each party (subject to certain exceptions), the performance in all material respects by each party of its obligations under the Milton Bancorp Agreement and other conditions customary for transactions of this type, including regulatory approval. Additional information can be found in Note R of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Financial Information 

Financial information regarding the Company as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 and results of operations for the last three fiscal years is contained in the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. 

Lending Activities 

The Company&#8217;s loan portfolio decreased $9,016,000 to finish at $585,752,000 in 2015. The loan portfolio is comprised of commercial (commercial real estate and commercial and industrial), residential real estate and consumer loans, including credit card and home equity loans. During 2015, commercial loans decreased $10,362,000, or 4.0%, while consumer loans increased $1,099,000, or 1.0%, and residential real estate loans increased $247,000, or 0.1%, as compared to 2014. Consolidated interest and fee revenue from loans accounted for 74.52%, 72.89%, and 75.53% of total consolidated revenues in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Company&#8217;s market area for lending is primarily located in southeastern Ohio and portions of western West Virginia. &#160; The Company believes that there is no significant concentration of loans to borrowers engaged in the same or similar industries and does not have any loans to foreign entities. 

&#160; 

Residential Real Estate Loans 

The Company&#8217;s residential real estate loans consist primarily of one- to four-family residential mortgages and carry many of the same customer and industry risks as the commercial loan portfolio. Real estate loans to consumers are secured primarily by a first lien mortgage or deed of trust with evidence of title in favor of the Bank. The Company also requires proof of hazard insurance, required at the time of closing, with the Bank or Loan Central named as the mortgagee and as loss payee. The Company generally requires the amount of a residential real estate loan be no more than 80% of the purchase price or the appraisal value (whichever is the lesser) of the real estate securing the loan, unless private mortgage insurance is obtained by the borrower for the percentage exceeding 80%. These loans generally range from one-year adjustable to thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages. The Company&#8217;s market area for real estate lending is primarily located in southeastern Ohio and portions of western West Virginia. The Bank continues to sell a portion of its new fixed-rate real estate loan originations to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (&#8220;Freddie Mac&#8221;) to enhance customer service and loan pricing. Secondary market sales of these real estate loans, which have fixed rates with fifteen- to thirty-year terms, have assisted in meeting the consumer preference for long-term fixed-rate loans as well as minimized the Bank&#8217;s exposure to interest rate risk. Currently, the Bank&#8217;s fixed-rate real estate loan offerings are limited to maturity terms up to fifteen years, with 100% of its thirty-year real estate loan demand being sold to Freddie Mac. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Commercial Loans 

The Company&#8217;s commercial loan portfolio consists of loans to corporate borrowers primarily in small to mid-sized industrial and commercial companies that include service, retail and wholesale merchants. Collateral securing these loans includes equipment, inventory, stock, commercial real estate and rental property. Commercial loans are considered to have a higher level of risk compared to other types of loans (i.e., single-family residential mortgages, installment loans and credit card loans), although care is taken to minimize these risks. Numerous risk factors impact this portfolio, such as the economy, new technology, labor rates, cash flow, financial structure and asset quality. The payment experience on commercial loans is dependent on adequate cash flows from the business to service both interest and principal due. Thus, commercial loans may be more sensitive to adverse conditions in the economy generally or adverse conditions in a specific industry. The Company diversifies risk within this portfolio by closely monitoring industry concentrations and portfolios to ensure that it does not exceed established lending guidelines. Underwriting standards require a comprehensive credit analysis and independent evaluation of virtually all larger balance commercial loans prior to approval. The Bank&#8217;s loan committee will review and approve all new commercial loan originations that exceed the originating loan officer&#8217;s lending limits according to the following thresholds: up to $750,000 unsecured, up to $3,000,000 secured, and up to $3,000,000 aggregate. The Executive Committee of the Bank&#8217;s Board of Directors will review and approve all new commercial loan originations up to the legal lending limit of the Bank. 

&#160; 

Consumer Loans 

Consumer loans are secured by automobiles, mobile homes, recreational vehicles and other personal property. Personal loans and unsecured credit card receivables are also included as consumer loans. The Company makes installment credit available to customers in their primary market area of southeastern Ohio and portions of western West Virginia. Credit approval for consumer loans requires demonstration of sufficient income to repay principal and interest due, stability of employment, a positive credit record and sufficient collateral for secured loans. The Company monitors the risk associated with these types of loans by monitoring factors such as portfolio growth, lending policies and economic conditions. Underwriting standards are continually evaluated and modified based upon these factors. A qualified compliance officer is responsible for monitoring the performance of his or her respective consumer portfolio and updating loan personnel. The Company makes credit life insurance and health and accident insurance available to all qualified borrowers, thus reducing their risk of loss when their income is terminated or interrupted. The Company reviews its respective consumer loan portfolios monthly to charge off loans which do not meet applicable standards. Credit card accounts are administered in accordance with the same standards as those applied to other consumer loans. Consumer loans generally involve more risk as to collectibility than mortgage loans because of the type and nature of collateral and, in certain instances, the absence of collateral. As a result, consumer lending collections are dependent upon the borrower&#8217;s continued financial stability and are adversely affected by job loss, divorce or personal bankruptcy and by adverse economic conditions. Also included in the category of consumer loans are home equity loans. Home equity lines of credit are generally made as second mortgages and charged a variable interest rate. Home equity lines are written with ten-year terms but are reviewed annually. The Company&#8217;s consumer loans also consist of seasonal refund anticipation loans (&#8220;RAL&#8217;s&#8221;) offered by Loan Central during the tax season. RAL&#8217;s are short-term cash advances against a customer's anticipated income tax refund. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Underwriting Standards 

&#160;

&#160; &#160; The Company&#8217;s underwriting guidelines and standards are updated periodically and are presented to the Board of Directors of the holding company for approval. The purposes of the standards and guidelines are to grant loans on a sound and collectible basis; to invest available funds in a safe, profitable manner; to serve the legitimate credit needs of the Company&#8217;s primary market areas; and to ensure that all loan applicants receive fair and equal treatment in the lending process. It is the intent of the underwriting guidelines and standards to: minimize losses by carefully investigating the credit history of each applicant, verify the source of repayment and the ability of the applicant to repay, collateralize those loans in which collateral is deemed to be required, exercise care in the documentation of the application, review, approval, and origination process, and administer a comprehensive loan collection program. The above guidelines are adhered to and subject to the experience, background and personal judgment of the loan officer assigned to the loan application. A loan officer may grant, with justification, a loan with variances from the underwriting guidelines and standards. However, a loan officer may not exceed his or her respective lending authority without obtaining the prior, proper approval from a superior. 

Investment Activities 

&#160;

&#160; &#160; The Company&#8217;s investment policy stresses the management of the investment securities portfolio, which includes both securities held to maturity and securities available for sale, to maximize the return over the long-term in a manner that is consistent with good banking practices and relative safety of principal. The Company&#8217;s investment portfolio is comprised of U.S. Government sponsored entity and mortgage-backed securities as well as obligations of state and political subdivisions. Revenues from interest and dividends on securities accounted for 5.94%, 5.60% and 5.02% of total consolidated revenues in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. &#160; The Company currently does not engage in trading account activity. 

&#160; 

Funding Activities 

Sources of funds for loan and investment activities include &#8220;core deposits.&#8221; Core deposits include demand deposits, savings, money market, NOW accounts, and certificates of deposit less than $100,000. The Company will also utilize certificates of deposit from wholesale markets, when necessary, to support growth in assets. Short- and long-term advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank have also been a significant source of funding. Further funding &#160; has come from &#160; one trust preferred securities offering through Ohio Valley Statutory Trust III, totaling $8,500,000. Ohio Valley used the proceeds to provide additional capital to the Bank to support growth. 

&#160; 

Electronic Refund Check / Electronic Refund Deposit Activities 

The Company began its participation in a tax refund service in 2006, in which it serves as a facilitator for the clearing of tax refunds for a single tax refund product provider. A tax refund clearing agreement between the Bank and tax refund product provider requires the Bank to process electronic refund checks (&#8220;ERC&#8217;s&#8221;) and electronic refund deposits (&#8220;ERD&#8217;s&#8221;) presented for payment on behalf of taxpayers containing taxpayer refunds. The Bank will, in turn, receive a fee paid by the third-party tax software provider for each transaction that is processed. As a result of ERC/ERD fee activity being mostly seasonal, the majority of income will generally be recorded during the first half of the fiscal year, with only minimal income recorded thereafter. During the year ended 2015, the Company&#8217;s ERC/ERD fees totaled $2,371,000, a decrease of $762,000, or 24.3%, as compared to the same period in 2014. Although the volume of ERC/ERD items increased during the 2015 tax season compared to 2014, management anticipated the tax fee revenue would still decrease due to changes in product service agreements. On October 21, 2014, the Bank entered into a new agreement with the third-party tax refund product provider. The new agreement generally provided for a different fee structure, including different fees depending upon the tax refund product selected, and fees that generally will be lower for each refund facilitated, with a reduction in per transaction fees to occur in future years. It is impossible to predict the number of refunds that will be facilitated in the future, the products chosen and therefore the fees that will be received by the Bank. Nevertheless, the Bank anticipates that without an increase in the number of refunds facilitated by the Bank, the fees received by the Bank from this arrangement will continue to be reduced in future years. Although ERC/ERD fees were down in 2015, management continues to be pleased with the significant contribution this revenue source has made, accounting for 27.6% of the overall noninterest income during the year ended 2015. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Competition 

Competition among providers of financial products and services continues to increase, with consumers having the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives. The principal factors of competition for the Company&#8217;s banking business are the rates of interest charged for loans, the rates of interest paid for deposits, the fees charged for services and the availability and quality of services. The market area for the Bank is concentrated primarily in the Gallia, Jackson, Pike and Meigs Counties of Ohio as well as the Mason and Cabell Counties of West Virginia. Some additional business originates from the surrounding Ohio counties of Lawrence, Vinton, Scioto, Athens and Ross. Competition for deposits and loans comes primarily from local banks and savings associations, although some competition is also experienced from local credit unions and insurance companies. The Company also competes with non-financial institutions that offer financial products and services. Some of the Company&#8217;s competitors are not subject to the same level of regulation and oversight that is required of banks and bank holding companies. As a result, some of these competitors may have lower cost structures. 

Loan Central&#8217;s market presence further strengthens the Company&#8217;s ability to compete in the Gallia, Jackson, Lawrence and Pike Counties by serving a consumer base that may not meet the Bank&#8217;s credit standards. Loan Central also operates in Scioto and Ross counties of Ohio, which are outside the Bank&#8217;s primary market area. With the exception of Loan Central&#8217;s tax refund loan activities and the Bank&#8217;s ERC/ERD activities, the Company&#8217;s business is not seasonal, nor is it dependent upon a single or small group of customers. 

Historically, larger regional institutions, with substantially greater resources, have been generating a growing market presence. Yet, in recent years, the financial industry continues to consolidate, which affects competition by eliminating some regional and local institutions, while strengthening the acquiring companies. Many financial institutions have experienced significant challenges as a result of the economic crisis, which resulted in bank failures and significant intervention from the U.S. Government. 

Overall, the Company believes it is able to compete effectively in both current and newer markets. There can be no assurance, however, that our ability to market products and services successfully or to obtain adequate yield on our loans will not be impacted by the nature of the competition that now exists or may later develop. 

Supervision and Regulation 

The following is a summary of certain statutes and regulations affecting Ohio Valley as well as the Bank and Loan Central. The summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to such statutes and regulations. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Regulation of Bank Holding Company 

Ohio Valley is subject to the requirements of the BHC Act and to the reporting requirements of, and examination and regulation by, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;Federal Reserve Board&#8221;). The Federal Reserve Board also has extensive enforcement authority over bank holding companies, including, among other things, the ability to: 

&#183; 

assess civil money penalties; 

&#183; 

issue cease and desist or removal orders; and 

&#183; 

require that a bank holding company divest subsidiaries (including its banking subsidiaries). 

In general, the Federal Reserve Board may initiate enforcement action for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. 

A bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial strength to each subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support those subsidiary banks. The Federal Reserve Board may require a bank holding company to contribute additional capital to an undercapitalized subsidiary bank and may disapprove of the payment of dividends to the shareholders of the bank holding company if the Federal Reserve Board believes the payment would be an unsafe or unsound practice. The Federal Reserve Board also requires bank holding companies to provide advance notification of planned dividends under certain circumstances. 

&#160; 

The BHC Act requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board in any case where a bank holding company proposes to: 

&#183; 

acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any bank that is not already majority-owned by it; 

&#183; 

acquire all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company; or 

&#183; 

merge or consolidate with any other bank holding company. 

&#160; &#160; 

On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act"). This law is significantly changing the regulation of financial institutions and the financial services industry. Because the Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of regulations with significant discretion, and some provisions require stock exchange rulemaking, some of which still have not been adopted, some of the effects they will have on our company are not yet known. 

Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act apply directly only to institutions much larger than ours, and some will affect only institutions with different charters than ours or institutions that engage in activities in which we do not engage. Among the changes pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act that can still be expected to have an effect on our business and not fully realized are the following: 

&#183; 

the Dodd-Frank Act created a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the &#8220;CFPB&#8221;) with broad powers to adopt and enforce consumer protection regulations; 

&#183; 

new capital regulations for bank holding companies have been adopted, which are still being phased in and which impose stricter requirements, and any new trust preferred securities will no longer count toward Tier I capital; and 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

new corporate governance requirements applicable generally to all public companies in all industries require new compensation practices, including providing shareholders the opportunity to cast a non-binding vote on executive compensation and considering the independence of compensation advisers, and new executive compensation disclosure requirements. In addition, companies will be required to &#8220;claw back&#8221; incentive compensation under certain circumstances, although regulations have not yet been adopted. 

In addition, new regulations regarding debit card fees were enacted by the Federal Reserve in October 2011. The new rules cap debit card interchange fees for banks with $10 billion or more in assets and prohibit network exclusivity arrangements and routing restrictions. Although the fee standards do not apply to Ohio Valley, competition and other market forces may result in a loss of revenue to us from these fees. 

Although it is impossible for us to predict at this time all the effects the Dodd-Frank Act will have on us and the rest of our industry, it is possible that our revenue could decrease, our interest expense could increase and deposit insurance premiums could change, and steps may need to be taken to increase qualifying capital. We expect that our operating and compliance costs will increase and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 

We cannot predict what other legislation or economic policies of the various regulatory authorities might be enacted or adopted or what other regulations might be adopted or the effects thereof. Future legislation and policies and the effects thereof might have a significant influence on overall growth and distribution of loans, investments and deposits and affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on time and savings deposits. Such legislation and policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. 

Transactions with Affiliates, Directors, Executive Officers and Shareholders 

Section 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W restrict transactions by banks and their subsidiaries with their affiliates. An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity which controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the bank. 

Generally, Sections 23A and 23B and Regulation W: 

&#183; &#160; 

limit the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10% of that bank&#8217;s capital stock and surplus (i.e., tangible capital); 

&#183; &#160; 

limit the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; with all affiliates to 20% of that bank&#8217;s capital stock and surplus; and 

&#183; &#160; 

require that all such transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank subsidiary, as those provided to a non-affiliate. 

The term &#8220;covered transaction&#8221; includes the making of loans to the affiliate, the purchase of assets from the affiliate, the issuance of a guarantee on behalf of the affiliate, the purchase of securities issued by the affiliate, and other similar types of transactions. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

A bank&#8217;s authority to extend credit to executive officers, directors and greater than 10% shareholders, as well as entities such persons control, is subject to Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O promulgated thereunder by the Federal Reserve Board. Among other things, these loans must be made on terms substantially the same as those offered to unaffiliated individuals or be made as part of a benefit or compensation program and on terms widely available to employees, and must not involve a greater than normal risk of repayment. In addition, the amount of loans a bank may make to these persons is based, in part, on the bank&#8217;s capital position, and specified approval procedures must be followed in making loans which exceed specified amounts. 

Regulation of Ohio State Chartered Banks 

As an Ohio state-chartered bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland (&#8220;FRB&#8221;), the Bank is supervised and regulated primarily by the Ohio Division of Financial Institutions, the Federal Reserve Board and the CFPB. 

The Bank&#8217;s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC, and the Bank is subject to the applicable provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and certain regulations of the FDIC. 

Various requirements and restrictions under the laws of the United States, the State of Ohio and the State of West Virginia affect the operations of the Bank, including requirements to maintain reserves against deposits, restrictions on the nature and amount of loans that may be made and the interest that may be charged thereon, restrictions relating to investments and other activities, limitations on credit exposure to correspondent banks, limitations on activities based on capital and surplus, limitations on payment of dividends, and limitations on branching. Consumer laws and regulations also affect the services provided to Bank customers. 

Holding Company Activities 

Ohio Valley became a financial holding company during 2000, permitting it to engage in activities beyond those permitted for traditional bank holding companies. In order to become a financial holding company, a bank holding company and all of its depository institutions must be well capitalized and well managed under federal banking regulations, and the depository institutions must have received a Community Investment Act rating of at least satisfactory. 

Financial holding companies may engage in a wide variety of financial activities, including any activity that the Federal Reserve Board and the Treasury Department consider financial in nature or incidental to financial activities, and any activity that the Federal Reserve Board determines complementary to a financial activity and which does not pose a substantial safety and soundness risk. These activities include securities underwriting and dealing activities, insurance and underwriting activities and merchant banking/equity investment activities. Because it has authority to engage in a broad array of financial activities, a financial holding company may have several affiliates that are functionally regulated by financial regulators other than the Federal Reserve Board, such as the SEC and state insurance regulators. 

Loan Central is supervised and regulated by the State of Ohio Department of Financial Institutions, Division of Consumer Finance. Ohio Valley Financial Services is supervised and regulated by the State of Ohio Department of Insurance. OVBC Captive is supervised and regulated by the State of Nevada Division of Insurance. The insurance laws and regulations applicable to insurance agencies, including Ohio Valley Financial Services and OVBC Captive, require education and licensing of individual agents and agencies, require reports and impose business conduct rules. 

The GLB Act provides that if a subsidiary bank of a financial holding company fails to be both well capitalized and well managed, the financial holding company must enter into a written agreement with the Federal Reserve Board within 45 days to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements. Until the Federal Reserve Board determines that the bank is again well capitalized and well managed, the Federal Reserve Board may impose additional limitations or conditions on the conduct or activities of the financial holding company or any affiliate that the Federal Reserve Board finds to be appropriate or consistent with federal banking laws. If the financial holding company does not correct the capital or management deficiencies within 180 days, the financial holding company may be required to divest ownership or control of all banks, including state-chartered non-member banks and other well-capitalized institutions owned by the financial holding company. If an insured bank subsidiary fails to maintain a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act, the financial holding company may not engage in activities permitted only to financial holding companies until such time as the bank receives a satisfactory rating.

&#160; 

Capital Requirements 

Financial institutions and their holding companies are required to maintain capital as a way of absorbing losses that can, as well as losses that cannot, be predicted. The Federal Reserve has adopted risk-based capital guidelines for financial holding companies as well as state banks that are members of the Federal Reserve Bank. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the FDIC have adopted risk-based capital guidelines for national banks and state non-member banks, respectively. The guidelines provide a systematic analytical framework which makes regulatory capital requirements sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banking organizations, takes off-balance sheet exposures expressly into account in evaluating capital adequacy and minimizes disincentives to holding liquid, low-risk assets. Capital levels as measured by these standards are also used to categorize financial institutions for purposes of certain prompt corrective action regulatory provisions. 

Prior to January 1, 2015, the guidelines included a minimum for the ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8%, with at least half of the ratio composed of common shareholders&#8217; equity, minority interests in certain equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries and a limited amount of qualifying preferred stock and qualified trust preferred securities, less goodwill and certain other intangible assets (known as &#8220;Tier 1&#8221; risk-based capital). The guidelines also provided for a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets, or &#8220;leverage ratio,&#8221; of 3% for financial holding companies and bank holding companies that meet certain criteria, including having the highest regulatory rating, and 4% for all other financial holding companies and bank holding companies. 

The risk-based capital guidelines adopted by the federal banking agencies are based on the &#8220;International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standard&#8221; (Basel I), published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the &#8220;Basel Committee&#8221;) in 1988. In 2004, the Basel Committee published a new capital adequacy framework (Basel II) for large, internationally active banking organizations, and in December 2010 and January 2011, the Basel Committee issued an update to Basel II (&#8220;Basel III&#8221;). The Basel Committee frameworks did not become applicable to banks supervised in the United States until adopted into United States law or regulations. Although the United States banking regulators imposed some of the Basel II and Basel III rules on banks with $250 billion or more in assets or $10 billion of on-balance sheet foreign exposure, it was not until July 2013 that the United States banking regulators issued final (or, in the case of the FDIC, interim final) new capital rules applicable to smaller banking organizations which also implement certain of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act (the &#8220;Basel III Capital Rules&#8221;). Community banking organizations, including the Ohio Valley and the Bank, began transitioning to the new rules on January 1, 2015. The new minimum capital requirements became effective on January 1, 2015, whereas a new capital conservation buffer and deductions from common equity capital phase in from January 1, 2016, through January 1, 2019, and most deductions from common equity tier 1 capital will phase in from January 1, 2015, through January 1, 2019. 

The new rules include (a) a new common equity tier 1 capital ratio of at least 4.5 percent, (b) a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6.0 percent, rather than the former 4.0 percent, (c) a minimum total capital ratio that remains at 8.0 percent, and (d) a minimum leverage ratio of 4%. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Common equity for the common equity tier 1 capital ratio includes common stock (plus related surplus) and retained earnings, plus limited amounts of minority interests in the form of common stock, less the majority of certain regulatory deductions. 

Tier 1 capital includes common equity as defined for the common equity tier 1 capital ratio, plus certain non-cumulative preferred stock and related surplus, cumulative preferred stock and related surplus and trust preferred securities that have been grandfathered (but which are not permitted going forward), and limited amounts of minority interests in the form of additional Tier 1 capital instruments, less certain deductions. 

Tier 2 capital, which can be included in the total capital ratio, includes certain capital instruments (such as subordinated debt) and limited amounts of the allowance for loan and lease losses, subject to new eligibility criteria, less applicable deductions. 

The deductions from common equity tier 1 capital include goodwill and other intangibles, certain deferred tax assets, mortgage-servicing assets above certain levels, gains on sale in connection with a securitization, investments in a banking organization&#8217;s own capital instruments and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions (above certain levels). The deductions phase in from 2015 through 2019. 

Under the guidelines, capital is compared to the relative risk related to the balance sheet. To derive the risk included in the balance sheet, one of several risk weights is applied to different balance sheet and off-balance sheet assets, primarily based on the relative credit risk of the counterparty. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Some of the risk weightings were changed effective January 1, 2015. 

The new rules also place restrictions on the payment of capital distributions, including dividends, and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers if the company does not hold a capital conservation buffer of greater than 2.5 percent composed of common equity tier 1 capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements, or if its eligible retained income is negative in that quarter and its capital conservation buffer ratio was less than 2.5 percent at the beginning of the quarter. The capital conservation buffer phases in starting on January 1, 2016, at .625%. The implementation of Basel III is not expected to have a material impact on Ohio Valley&#8217;s or the Bank&#8217;s capital ratios. 

Pursuant to the Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s Small Bank Holding Company Policy, as a holding company with assets of less than $1 billion, the Company is not required to comply with the consolidated capital requirements, although the Bank must comply with the new capital requirements. 

Federal banking regulators have established regulations governing prompt corrective action to resolve capital deficient banks. Under these regulations, institutions which become undercapitalized become subject to mandatory regulatory scrutiny and limitations, which increase as capital continues to decrease. Such institutions are also required to file capital plans with their primary federal regulator, and their holding companies must guarantee the capital shortfall up to 5% of the assets of the capital deficient institution at the time it becomes undercapitalized. 

Effective January 1, 2015, in order to be &#8220;well-capitalized,&#8221; a bank must have a common equity tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6.5%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8% and a leverage ratio of at least 5%, and the bank must not be subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level or any capital measure. Ohio Valley&#8217;s management believes that the Bank meets the ratio requirements to be deemed &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; according to the guidelines described above. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Limits on Dividends 

The ability of a bank holding company to obtain funds for the payment of dividends and for other cash requirements is largely dependent on the amount of dividends that may be declared by its subsidiary banks and other subsidiaries. However, the Federal Reserve Board expects Ohio Valley to serve as a source of strength to the Bank, which may require it to retain capital for further investments in the Bank, rather than for dividends for shareholders of Ohio Valley. The Bank may not pay dividends to Ohio Valley if, after paying such dividends, it would fail to meet the required minimum levels under the risk-based capital guidelines and the minimum leverage ratio requirements. The Bank must have the approval of its regulatory authorities if a dividend in any year would cause the total dividends for that year to exceed the sum of its current year&#8217;s net profits and retained net profits for the preceding two years, less required transfers to surplus. Payment of dividends by the Bank may be restricted at any time at the discretion of its regulatory authorities, if they deem such dividends to constitute an unsafe and/or unsound banking practice or if necessary to maintain adequate capital for the Bank. These provisions could have the effect of limiting Ohio Valley&#8217;s ability to pay dividends on its outstanding common shares. 

In addition, Federal Reserve Board policy requires Ohio Valley to provide notice to the FRB in advance of the payment of a dividend to Ohio Valley&#8217;s shareholders under certain circumstances, and the FRB may disapprove of such dividend payment if the FRB determines the payment would be an unsafe or unsound practice. 

Dividend restrictions are also listed within the provisions of Ohio Valley&#8217;s trust preferred security arrangements. Under the provisions of these agreements, the interest payable on the trust preferred securities is deferral for up to five years and any such deferral would not be considered a default. During any period of deferral, Ohio Valley would be precluded from declaring or paying dividends to its shareholders or repurchasing any of its common stock. 

Deposit Insurance Assessments 

The FDIC is an independent federal agency which insures deposits, up to prescribed statutory limits, of federally-insured banks and savings associations and safeguards the safety and soundness of the financial institution industry. 

The deposits of the Bank are insured up to statutorily prescribed limits by the FDIC, generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor. Insurance premiums for insured institutions are determined based upon the member's capital level and supervisory rating provided to the FDIC by the bank's primary federal regulatory and other information the FDIC determines to be relevant to the risk posed to the deposit insurance fund (&#8220;DIF&#8221;). Until a change in regulations adopted by the FDIC in February 2011, the assessment rate determined by considering such factors was then applied to the amount of the bank's deposits to determine the bank's insurance premium. On April 1, 2011, the assessment base was changed from total domestic deposits to average total assets minus average tangible equity. The new regulations also change the assessment for larger institutions and the assessment rate schedules. The FDIC has proposed changes to its assessment system for banks with less than $10 billion in assets that have been insured by the FDIC for at least five years. The proposed changes would revise the financial ratios method so that it would be based on a statistical model estimating the probability of failure of a bank over three years, update the financial measures used in the financial ratios method consistent with the statistical model; and eliminate risk categories for established small banks and using the financial ratios method to determine assessment rates for all such banks (subject to minimum or maximum initial assessment rates based upon a bank&#8217;s composite examination rating). 

Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the insured institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition enacted or imposed by the bank's regulatory agency. Notice would be given to all depositors before the deposit insurance was terminated. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

The FDIC may impose an additional special assessment if the FDIC estimates that the DIF reserve will fall to a level that would adversely affect public confidence or to a level that will be close to or below zero. Any future special assessments will increase insurance premium expense on deposits if and when they become effective. We cannot provide any assurance as to the ultimate amount or timing of any future special assessments. 

Monetary Policy and Economic Conditions 

The business of commercial banks is affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the policies of various governmental regulatory authorities, including the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board regulates the money and credit conditions and interest rates in order to influence general economic conditions primarily through open market operations in U.S. Government securities, changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. These policies and regulations significantly influence the amount of bank loans and deposits and the interest rates charged and paid thereon, and thus have an effect on earnings. 

Patriot Act 

The Uniting and Strengthening of America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorist Act of 2001 (the &#8220;Patriot Act&#8221;) gives the federal government new powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. Title III of the Patriot Act takes measures intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies. Further, certain provisions of Title III impose affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions. Among other requirements, Title III and related regulations require regulated financial institutions to establish a program specifying procedures for obtaining identifying information from customers seeking to open new accounts and establish enhanced due diligence policies, procedures and controls designed to detect and report suspicious activity. The Company has established policies and procedures to comply with the requirements of the Patriot Act. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, Ohio Valley and its subsidiaries had approximately 248 full-time equivalent employees and officers. Management considers its relationship with its employees and officers to be good. 

Other Information 

Management anticipates no material effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position of the Company by reason of any laws regulating or protecting the environment. Ohio Valley believes that the nature of the operations of its subsidiaries has little, if any, environmental impact. Ohio Valley, therefore, anticipates no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in its current fiscal year or for the foreseeable future. 

The Bank and Loan Central may be required to make capital expenditures related to properties which they may acquire through foreclosure proceedings in the future. However, the amount of such capital expenditures, if any, is not currently determinable. 

&#160;
