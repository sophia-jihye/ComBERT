 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

GENERAL 

Mack-Cali Realty Corporation, a Maryland corporation, together with its subsidiaries (collectively the &#8220;Company&#8221;), is a fully-integrated, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust (&#8220;REIT&#8221;) that owns and operates a real estate portfolio comprised predominantly of Class A office and office/flex properties located primarily in the Northeast with a recent emphasis on expansion into the multi-family rental sector in the same markets. The Company performs substantially all real estate leasing, management, acquisition, development and construction services on an in-house basis. Mack-Cali Realty Corporation was incorporated on May 24, 1994. The Company&#8217;s executive offices are located at 343 Thornall Street, Edison, New Jersey 08837-2206, and its telephone number is (732) 590-1000. The Company has an internet website at www.mack-cali.com. 

As of December 31, 2015, the Company owned or had interests in 275 properties, consisting of 147 office and 109 flex properties, totaling approximately 29.9 million square feet, leased to approximately 1,900 commercial tenants and 19 multi-family rental properties containing 5,644 residential units, plus developable land (collectively, the &#8220;Properties&#8221;). The Properties are comprised of: (a) 223 wholly-owned or Company-controlled properties consisting of 111 office buildings and 106 flex buildings aggregating approximately 24.2 million square feet and six multi-family properties totaling 1,301 apartments, (collectively, the &#8220;Consolidated Properties&#8221;); and (b) 36 office properties totaling approximately 5.6 million square feet, 13 multi-family properties totaling 4,343 apartments, two retail properties totaling 81,700 square feet and a 350-room hotel, which are owned by unconsolidated joint ventures in which the Company has investment interests. Unless otherwise indicated, all references to square feet represent net rentable area. As of December 31, 2015, the office and flex properties included in the Consolidated Properties were 86.2 percent leased. Percentage leased includes all leases in effect as of the period end date, some of which have commencement dates in the future, and leases that expire at the period end date. Leases that expired as of December 31, 2015 aggregate 69,522 square feet, or 0.3 percent of the net rentable square footage. The Properties are located in seven states, primarily in the Northeast, and the District of Columbia. See Item 2: Properties. 

On June 3, 2015, Mitchell E. Rudin joined the Company as its Chief Executive Officer and Michael J. DeMarco joined the Company as its President and Chief Operating Officer. The Company&#8217;s new management team assessed the Company&#8217;s historical strategy of focusing its operations, acquisition and development of office properties in high-barrier-to-entry markets and sub-markets where it believes it is, or can become, a significant and preferred owner and operator. In September 2015, the Company announced a three-year strategic initiative to transform into a more concentrated owner of New Jersey Hudson River waterfront and transit-oriented office properties and a regional owner of luxury multi-family residential properties. In furtherance of this strategy, the Company has commenced a comprehensive review of its portfolio and operations and is developing a business strategy that focuses on reshaping its portfolio over time. As part of this plan, the Company anticipates that it may dispose of a significant portion of its properties that do not meet its long-term goals, and, in September 2015, compiled a list of its properties that it considers as non-core to its ongoing operations. Specifically, the Company considers a non-core property to have one or more of the following attributes: (1) assets that do not offer an opportunity to create a competitive advantage; (2) assets that produce a low cash yield; (3) assets which have physical attributes that constrain their market competitiveness; and (4) assets located in low growth markets. The Company believes that the potential sales of these non-core properties over time would result in total estimated sales proceeds ranging from approximately $600 million to $800 million. 

The Company believes that its Properties have excellent locations and access and are well-maintained and professionally managed. As a result, the Company believes that its Properties attract high quality tenants and residents, and achieve high rental, occupancy and tenant retention rates within their markets. The Company also believes that its extensive market knowledge provides it with a significant competitive advantage, which is further enhanced by its strong reputation for, and emphasis on, delivering highly responsive, professional management services. 

&#160; 

BUSINESS STRATEGIES 

Operations 

Reputation : &#160; The Company has established a reputation as a highly-regarded landlord with an emphasis on delivering quality customer service in buildings it owns and/or manages. The Company believes that its continued success depends in part on enhancing its reputation as an operator of choice, which will facilitate the retention of current tenants and residents and the attraction of new tenants and residents. The Company believes it provides a superior level of service to its customers, which should in turn, allow the Company to maintain occupancy rates, at or above market levels, as well as improve tenant retention. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Communication with tenants : The Company emphasizes frequent communication with its customers to ensure first-class service to the Properties. Property management personnel generally are located on site at the Properties to provide convenient access to management and to ensure that the Properties are well-maintained. Property management&#8217;s primary responsibility is to ensure that buildings are operated at peak efficiency in order to meet both the Company&#8217;s and tenants&#8217; needs and expectations. Property management personnel additionally budget and oversee capital improvements and building system upgrades to enhance the Properties&#8217; competitive advantages in their respective markets and to maintain the quality of the Properties. 

The Company&#8217;s in-house leasing representatives for its office portfolio develop and maintain long-term relationships with the Company&#8217;s diverse tenant base and coordinate leasing, expansion, relocation and build-to-suit opportunities. This approach allows the Company to offer office space in the appropriate size and location to current or prospective tenants in any of its sub-markets. 

The Company&#8217;s in-house multi-family rental management team emphasizes meticulous attention to detail and an unwavering commitment to customer service to complement the quality, design excellence and luxury living attributes of its multi-family rental properties. The Company believes this strategy will enable the Company to buttress management&#8217;s reputation with the market-leading designs, amenities and features of its multi-family rental properties to attract quality residents. 

Portfolio Management : The Company plans to continue to own and operate a portfolio of office and office/flex properties in high-barrier-to-entry markets, with a primary focus in the Northeast. The Company also expects to continue to complement its core portfolio of office and office/flex properties by pursuing acquisition and development opportunities in the multi-family rental sector. The Company&#8217;s primary objectives are to maximize operating cash flow and to enhance the value of its portfolio through effective management, acquisition, development and property sales strategies. 

The Company seeks to maximize the value of its existing office and office/flex portfolio through implementing operating strategies designed to produce the highest effective rental and occupancy rates and lowest tenant installation costs within the markets that it operates, and further within the parameters of those markets. The Company continues to pursue internal growth through leasing vacant space, re-leasing space at the highest possible effective rents in light of current market conditions with contractual rent increases and developing or redeveloping office space for its diverse base of high credit quality tenants, including Daiichi Sankyo, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi FUJI Ltd and The United States of America - GSA. In addition, the Company seeks economies of scale through volume discounts to take advantage of its size and dominance in particular sub-markets, and operating efficiencies through the use of in-house management, leasing, marketing, financing, accounting, legal, development and construction services. 

The Company continually reviews its portfolio and opportunities to divest office and office/flex properties that, among other things, no longer meet its long-term strategy, have reached their potential, are less efficient to operate or can be sold at attractive prices when market conditions are favorable. The Company anticipates redeploying the proceeds from sales of office and office/flex properties to develop, redevelop and acquire multi-family rental properties, as well as reposition certain office properties into multi-family/mixed use properties, in its core Northeast sub-markets as part of its overall strategy to reposition its portfolio from office and office/flex to a mix of office, office/flex and multi-family rental properties. 

The Company believes that the opportunity to invest in multi-family development properties at higher returns on cost will position the Company to potentially produce higher levels of net operating income than if the Company were to only purchase stabilized multi-family properties at market returns. The Company anticipates that it will be several years before its multi-family development projects are income-producing. The Company believes that the transition to a company with a greater proportion of its properties in the multi-family residential sector will ultimately result in the creation of greater shareholder value than remaining a primarily suburban commercial office company, in part due to the lower capitalization rates associated with the multi-family sector. 

Acquisitions : The Company also believes that growth opportunities exist through acquiring operating properties or properties for redevelopment with attractive returns in its core Northeast sub-markets where, based on its expertise in leasing, managing and operating properties, it believes it is, or can become, a significant and preferred owner and operator. The Company intends either directly or through joint ventures to acquire, invest in or redevelop additional properties, that: (i) are expected to provide attractive long-term yields; (ii) are well-located, of high quality and competitive in their respective sub-markets; (iii) are located in its existing sub-markets or in sub-markets in which the Company is or can become a significant and preferred owner and operator; and (iv) it believes have been under-managed or are otherwise capable of improved performance through intensive management, capital improvements and/or leasing that should result in increased effective rental and occupancy rates. 

The Company has entered into and may continue in the future to enter into joint ventures (including limited liability companies and partnerships) through which it would own an indirect economic interest of less than 100 percent of a property owned directly by such joint ventures, and may include joint ventures that the Company does not control or manage, especially in connection with its expansion into the multi-family rental sector. The decision to pursue property acquisitions either directly or through joint ventures is based on a variety of factors and considerations, including: (i) the economic and tax terms required by a seller or co-developer of a property; (ii) the Company&#8217;s desire to diversify its portfolio by expanding into the multi-family rental sector and achieve a blended portfolio of office and multi-family rental properties by market and sub-market; (iii) the Company&#8217;s goal of maintaining a strong balance sheet; and (iv) the Company&#8217;s expectation that, in some circumstances, it will be able to achieve higher returns on its invested capital or reduce its risk if a joint venture vehicle is used. Investments in joint ventures are not limited to a specified percentage of the Company&#8217;s assets. Each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated, and the Company&#8217;s ability to operate and/or dispose of its interests in a joint venture in its sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture agreement. Many of the Company&#8217;s joint venture agreements entitle it to receive leasing, management, development and similar fees and/or a promoted interest if certain return thresholds are met. See Note 4: Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures &#8211; to the Company&#8217;s Financial Statements. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Development : &#160; The Company seeks to selectively develop additional properties either directly or through joint ventures where it believes such development will result in a favorable risk-adjusted return on investment in coordination with the above operating strategies. The Company identifies development opportunities primarily through its local market presence. Such development primarily will occur: (i) in stable core Northeast sub-markets where the demand for such space exceeds available supply; and (ii) where the Company is, or can become, a significant and preferred owner and operator. As part of the Company&#8217;s strategy to expand its multi-family rental portfolio, the Company may consider development opportunities with respect to improved land with existing commercial uses and seek to rezone the sites for multi-family rental use and development. As a result of competitive market conditions for land suitable for development, the Company may be required to hold land prior to construction for extended periods while entitlements or rezoning is obtained. The Company also may undertake repositioning opportunities that may require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital. 

Property Sales : While management&#8217;s principal intention is to own and operate its properties on a long-term basis, it periodically assesses the attributes of each of its properties, with a particular focus on the supply and demand fundamentals of the sub-markets in which they are located. As a result of this assessment during 2015, the Company has identified non-core office properties that it may sell over time for total estimated sales proceeds that it believes may be between approximately $600 million and $800 million. The Company continually reviews its portfolio and opportunities to divest properties that, among other things, no longer meet its long-term strategy, have reached their potential, are less efficient to operate, or can be sold at attractive prices when market conditions are favorable. 

Financial 

The Company currently intends to maintain a ratio of debt-to-undepreciated assets (total debt of the Company as a percentage of total undepreciated assets) of 50 percent or less, however there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in maintaining this ratio. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company&#8217;s total debt constituted approximately 39.0 percent and 37.3 percent of total undepreciated assets of the Company, respectively. Although there is no limit in the Company&#8217;s organizational documents on the amount of indebtedness that the Company may incur, the Company has entered into certain financial agreements which contain covenants that limit the Company&#8217;s ability to incur indebtedness under certain circumstances. The Company intends to utilize the most appropriate sources of capital for future acquisitions, development, capital improvements and other investments, which may include funds from operating activities, proceeds from property and land sales, joint venture capital, and short-term and long-term borrowings (including draws on the Company&#8217;s revolving credit facility), and the issuance of additional debt or equity securities. 

EMPLOYEES 

As of December 31, 2015, the Company had approximately 530 full-time employees. 

COMPETITION 

The leasing of real estate is highly competitive. The Properties compete for tenants and residents with lessors and developers of similar properties located in their respective markets primarily on the basis of location, the quality of properties, leasing terms (including rent and other charges and allowances for tenant improvements), services or amenities provided, the design and condition of the Properties, and reputation as an owner and operator of quality properties in the relevant markets. Additionally, the number of competitive multi-family rental properties in a particular area could have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s ability to lease residential units and on rents charged. In addition, other forms of multi-family rental properties or single family housing provide alternatives to potential residents of multi-family properties. &#160; The Company competes with other entities, some of which may have significant resources or who may be willing to accept lower returns or pay higher prices than the Company in terms of acquisition and development opportunities. The Company also experiences competition when attempting to acquire or dispose of real estate, including competition from domestic and foreign financial institutions, other REITs, life insurance companies, pension trusts, trust funds, partnerships, individual investors and others. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

REGULATIONS 

Many laws and governmental regulations apply to the ownership and/or operation of the Properties and changes in these laws and regulations, or their interpretation by agencies and the courts, occur frequently. 

Under various laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health, an owner of real estate may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances located on or in the property. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner was responsible for, or even knew of, the presence of such substances. The presence of such substances may adversely affect the owner&#8217;s ability to rent or sell the property or to borrow using such property as collateral and may expose it to liability resulting from any release of, or exposure to, such substances. Persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances at another location may also be liable for the costs of re&#173;moval or remediation of such substances at the disposal or treatment facility, whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such person. Certain environmental laws impose liability for the release of asbestos-containing materials into the air, and third parties may also seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with asbestos-containing materials and other hazardous or toxic substances. 

In connection with the ownership (direct or indirect), operation, management and development of real properties, the Company may be considered an owner or operator of such properties or as having arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and, therefore, potentially liable for removal or remediation costs, as well as certain other related costs, including governmental penalties and injuries to persons and property. 

There can be no assurance that (i) future laws, ordinances or regulations will not impose any material environmental liability, (ii) the current environmental condition of the Properties will not be affected by tenants, by the condition of land or operations in the vicinity of the Properties (such as the presence of underground storage tanks), or by third parties unrelated to the Company, or (iii) the Company&#8217;s assessments reveal all environmental liabilities and that there are no material environmental liabilities of which the Company is aware. If compliance with the various laws and regulations, now existing or hereafter adopted, exceeds the Company&#8217;s budgets for such items, the Company&#8217;s ability to make expected distributions to stockholders could be adversely affected. 

There are no other laws or regulations which have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s operations, other than typical federal, state and local laws affecting the development and operation of real property, such as zoning laws. 

INDUSTRY SEGMENTS 

The Company operates in three industry segments: (i) commercial and other real estate, (ii) multi-family real estate, and (iii) multi-family services. As of December 31, 2015, the Company does not have any foreign operations and its business is not seasonal. Please see our financial statements attached hereto and incorporated by reference herein for financial information relating to our industry segments. 

SIGNIFICANT TENANTS 

As of December 31, 2015, no tenant accounted for more than 10 percent of the Company&#8217;s consolidated revenues. 

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 

&#160; 

Acquisitions 

On December 23, 2015, the Company acquired a vacant 147,241 square-foot office property located in the Mack-Cali Business Campus in Parsippany, New Jersey, for approximately $10.3 million, which was funded primarily through borrowings under the Company&#8217;s unsecured revolving credit facility. This property is currently in redevelopment by the Company. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

On November 12, 2015, the Company acquired a 196,128 square-foot, 95.6 percent leased office property adjacent to an existing Mack-Cali property located in Edison, New Jersey, for approximately $53.1 million, which was funded primarily through borrowings under the Company&#8217;s unsecured revolving credit facility . 

Dispositions 

On June 26, 2015, the Company sold its 203,506 square foot office property located at 14 Sylvan Way in Parsippany, New Jersey for net sales proceeds of approximately $80 million, with a gain of approximately $24.7 million from the sale. 

Impairments on Properties Held and Used 

In September 2015, the Company announced a three-year strategic initiative to transform the Company into a more concentrated owner of New Jersey Hudson River waterfront and transit-oriented office properties and a regional owner of luxury multi-family residential properties. In connection with the transformation of the Company&#8217;s portfolio, management began developing a disposition plan in September 2015, which will be an ongoing assessment process. Through this plan, the Company, in the coming years, expects to dispose of primarily office properties considered non-core to its ongoing operations. As a result, at September 30, 2015, the Company evaluated the recoverability of the carrying values of these non-core properties, and determined that due to the shortening of the expected periods of ownership, it was necessary to reduce the carrying values of 22 rental properties to their estimated fair values. Accordingly, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $158.6 million at September 30, 2015 reducing the aggregate carrying values of these properties from $554.3 million to their estimated fair values of $395.7 million. At December 31, 2015, as a result of its periodic evaluation of the recoverability of the carrying values resulting from its ongoing assessment of non-core properties, the Company recorded an additional impairment charge of $33.7 million. 

Four of the Company&#8217;s office properties are collateral for a mortgage loan that matured on August 11, 2014, with a principal balance of $63.3 million as of December 31, 2015. The loan was not repaid at maturity and the Company is in discussions with the lender regarding potential options in satisfaction of the obligation (see Note 10: Mortgages, Loans Payable and Other Obligations). As of September 30, 2015, the Company estimated that the carrying value of three of these properties, aggregating 479,877 square feet and located in Roseland and Parsippany, New Jersey, may not be recoverable over their anticipated holding periods. In order to reduce the carrying values of the properties to their estimated fair values, the Company recorded impairment charges of $5.6 million at September 30, 2015, which resulted from the current decline in leasing activity and market rents of the properties identified. The Company had previously recorded impairment charges on these properties at September 30, 2013 of $12.5 million. 

Development Activity 

On October 6, 2015, the Company entered into a joint venture partnership with XS Port Imperial Hotel, LLC (&#8220;XS&#8221;) to form XS Hotel Urban Renewal Associates LLC (&#8220;XS Hotel URA&#8221;) for the development and ownership of a 364-key dual branded hotel property located in Weehawken, New Jersey (&#8220;Port Imperial Hotel&#8221;). Concurrently, the Company and XS entered into a separate joint venture partnership to form XS Hotel Associates, L.L.C. (&#8220;XS Hotel&#8221;) for the management and operations of the completed hotel development. The Company holds a 90 percent interest and XS holds the remaining 10 percent interest in the consolidated joint ventures, XS Hotel URA and XS Hotel, with the Company having full and complete authority, power, and discretion to manage and control the ventures&#8217; business, affairs, and property. The construction of the Port Imperial Hotel is estimated to cost a total of $105.9 million, which will be funded by a $94 million construction loan with the balance to be funded with members&#8217; capital. Upon closing, Mack-Cali&#8217;s initial contribution was $27.3 million, which included a capital credit of $23.7 million for its contributed Hotel Condominium Land unit, and XS Hotel&#8217;s initial contribution was $3 million. As of December 31, 2015, the Company incurred development costs of $1.5 million and estimates it will need to fund an additional $3.3 million for the completion of the project. 

The Company owns developable land to accommodate a multi-phase development project of approximately 1,034-unit multi-family rental property located in Malden, Massachusetts. The initial phase commenced construction of 292 units in the third quarter of 2015 (the &#8220;Chase II Project&#8221;). The Chase II Project is estimated to cost a total of $74.9 million (of which the Company has incurred $22.1 million through December 31, 2015) and is expected to be ready for occupancy by second quarter 2017. The Company estimates it will need to fund additional costs of $4.8 million for the completion of the Chase II Project. On December 16, 2015, the Company obtained a construction loan with a maximum borrowing amount of $48 million (with no outstanding balance as of December 31, 2015), which bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 2.25 percent, reducing to LIBOR plus 2.0 percent subject to achieving certain conditions and matures in December 2018. 

On April 1, 2015, the Company acquired vacant land to accommodate a two-phase development of 365 multi-family residential units located in Worcester, Massachusetts (&#8220;the CitySquare Project&#8221;) for a purchase price of $3.1 million with an additional $1.25 million to be paid (which is accrued as of December 31, 2015), subject to certain conditions, in accordance with the terms of the purchase and sale agreement. The purchase price for the acquisition was funded primarily through borrowing under the Company&#8217;s unsecured revolving credit facility. The first phase with 237 units started construction in the third quarter 2015 with anticipated initial deliveries in the second quarter 2017. The second phase, with 128 units, is projected to begin construction in 2017. On December 10, 2015, the Company obtained a construction loan with a maximum borrowing amount of $41.5 million (with no outstanding balance as of December 31, 2015), which bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 2.5 percent, reducing to LIBOR plus 2.25 percent subject to achieving certain conditions and matures in December 2018. Total development costs are estimated to be approximately $92.5 million (of which $9.1 million was incurred by the Company through December 31, 2015 and estimates it will need to fund an additional $41.9 million for the completion of the project). 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

On May 21, 2014, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with Ironstate Harborside-A LLC (&#8220;ISA&#8221;) to form Harborside Unit A Urban Renewal, L.L.C. (&#8220;URL-Harborside&#8221;), a newly-formed joint venture that will develop, own and operate a high-rise tower of approximately 763 multi-family apartment units above a parking pedestal to be located on land contributed by the Company at its Harborside complex in Jersey City, New Jersey (the &#8220;URL Project&#8221;). The Company owns an 85 percent interest in URL-Harborside and the remaining interest is owned by ISA, with shared control over major decisions such as approval of budgets, property financings and leasing guidelines. The construction of the URL Project is estimated to cost a total of approximately $320 million (of which development costs of $210.2 million have been incurred by URL-Harborside through December 31, 2015). The URL Project is projected to be ready for occupancy by the fourth quarter of 2016. The venture has a construction/permanent loan with a maximum borrowing amount of $192 million (with $63.9 million outstanding as of December 31, 2015), which bears interest at a rate of 5.197 percent and matures in August 2029. The Company does not expect to fund any future development costs of the project, as future development costs will be funded by using the loan financing. 

The Company owns a 76.25 percent interest in a consolidated joint venture which is constructing a 108-unit multi-family development rental property located in Eastchester, New York (the &#8220;Eastchester Project&#8221;). The project is expected to be ready for occupancy by the second quarter of 2016. The Eastchester Project is estimated to cost a total of $50 million (of which development costs of $29.6 million have been incurred through December 31, 2015). The venture has a $28.8 million construction loan (with $10.9 million outstanding as of December 31, 2015). The Company expects to fund approximately $20.9 million for the development of the project (of which, as of December 31, 2015, the Company has incurred $14.7 million of the development costs and estimates it will need to fund an additional $6.2 million for the completion of the project.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Operations 

Several of the Company&#8217;s core office markets have shown signs of recent improvement. The percentage leased in the Company&#8217;s consolidated portfolio of stabilized operating commercial properties was 86.2 percent at December 31, 2015, as compared to 84.2 percent at December 31, 2014 and 86.1 percent at December 31, 2013. Percentage leased includes all leases in effect as of the period end date, some of which have commencement dates in the future and leases that expire at the period end date. Leases that expired as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 aggregate 69,522, 205,220 and 690,895 square feet, respectively, or 0.3, 0.8 and 2.5 percentage of the net rentable square footage, respectively. The Company believes that commercial vacancy rates have stabilized in most of its markets and may decrease in some of its markets through 2016. 

FINANCING ACTIVITY 

On January 7, 2016, the Company obtained a new $350 million unsecured term loan, which matures in January 2019 with two one-year extension options. The interest rate for the new term loan is currently 140 basis points over LIBOR, subject to adjustment on a sliding scale based on the Company's unsecured debt ratings, or at the Company's option, a defined leverage ratio. The Company entered into interest rate swap arrangements to fix LIBOR for the duration of the term loan. Including costs, the loan provides for a current all-in fixed rate of 3.12 percent. The proceeds from the loan were used primarily to repay outstanding borrowings on its unsecured revolving credit facility and to repay the Company's $200 million, 5.8 percent senior unsecured notes that matured on January 15, 2016.

risks and uncertainties affecting the general economic climate and conditions, which in turn may have a negative effect on the fundamentals of our business and the financial condition of our tenants and residents; 

&#183; 

the value of our real estate assets, which may limit our ability to dispose of assets at attractive prices or obtain or maintain debt financing secured by our properties or on an unsecured basis; 

&#183; 

the extent of any tenant bankruptcies or of any early lease terminations; 

&#183; 

our ability to lease or re-lease space at current or anticipated rents;

forward-looking financial and operational information, including information relating to future development projects, potential acquisitions or dispositions, and projected revenue and income; 

&#183; 

changes in operating costs; 

&#183; 

our ability to obtain adequate insurance, including coverage for terrorist acts; 

&#183; 

our credit worthiness and the availability of financing on attractive terms or at all, which may adversely impact our ability to pursue acquisition and development opportunities and refinance existing debt and our future interest expense; 

&#183; 

changes in governmental regulation, tax rates and similar matters; and 

&#183; 

other risks associated with the development and acquisition of properties, including risks that the development may not be completed on schedule, that the tenants or residents will not take occupancy or pay rent, or that development or operating costs may be greater than anticipated.
