Company Overview 

We are an innovator in broadband technologies and services. Our end-to-end platform of high-capacity Ka-band satellites, ground infrastructure and user terminals enables us to provide cost-effective, high-speed, high-quality broadband solutions to enterprises, consumers and government users around the globe, whether on the ground, on the move or in flight. In addition, we develop and provide advanced wireless communications systems, secure networking systems and cybersecurity and information assurance products and services. Our product, system and service offerings are often linked through common underlying technologies, customer applications and market relationships. We believe that our portfolio of products and services, combined with our ability to effectively cross-deploy technologies between government and commercial segments and across different geographic markets, provides us with a strong foundation to sustain and enhance our leadership in advanced communications and networking technologies. 

On May 4, 2015, our Board of Directors approved a change in our fiscal year from a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending on the Friday closest to March 31 to a fiscal year ending on March 31 of each year, effective with the fiscal year commencing April 4, 2015. Beginning April 4, 2015, our fiscal quarters end on June 30, September 30, December 31 and March 31 of each year. Fiscal year 2014 was a 53 week year, compared to a 52 week year in fiscal year 2015. Fiscal year 2016 was slightly shorter than 52 weeks due to the change in fiscal year beginning April 4, 2015. We do not believe that these differences in length of year had any material impact on our financial results. 

We conduct our business through three segments: satellite services, commercial networks and government systems. Financial information regarding our reporting segments and the geographic areas in which we deliver our services and products is included in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. 

Satellite Services 

Our satellite services segment provides satellite-based high-speed broadband services to consumers, enterprises, commercial airlines and mobile broadband customers primarily in the United States. Our Exede &#174; broadband services offer high-speed, high-quality broadband internet access across the contiguous United States. We also offer similar services for a growing number of commercial and business aircraft both in the United States and abroad. Our satellite services business also provides a platform for the provision of network management services to domestic and international satellite service providers. 

Our satellite services business uses our proprietary technology platform to provide broadband services with multiple applications. Our proprietary Ka-band satellites are at the core of our technology platform. Our first-generation high-capacity Ka-band spot-beam satellite, ViaSat-1, was placed into service in January 2012. At the time of launch we believe ViaSat-1 was the highest capacity, most cost-efficient satellite in the world, with a data throughput of approximately 140 Gigabits per second. In May 2013, we entered into a satellite construction contract for our ViaSat-2 satellite, our second-generation high-capacity Ka-band satellite design, which we expect will be launched during fiscal year 2017. We expect that our ViaSat-2 satellite will significantly expand our data throughput capacity, enabling us to improve the speed, availability and geographic coverage area of our broadband services. In addition, construction has commenced on two ViaSat-3 class satellites, our third-generation high-capacity Ka-band satellite design, pursuant to a limited authorization to proceed. Our ViaSat-3 class satellites are designed to further expand our data throughput capacity and geographic coverage area and to support the flexible allocation of capacity to dynamically respond to changing capacity demands, thereby improving the speed, availability and cost-efficiency of our proprietary Ka-band satellite network. We anticipate that our ViaSat-3 class satellites will be launched in late 2019 or 2020. 

We believe that growth in our satellite services segment will be driven in the coming years by continued rapid growth in demand for high-speed broadband services across the globe, driven both by continued increases in the number of internet users and connected devices and by increasing data usage, including for video 

&#160; 

streaming and mobile and in-flight connectivity. The primary services offered by our satellite services segment are comprised of: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Fixed Broadband &#160; Services. We offer satellite-based broadband internet services under the Exede and WildBlue &#174; brands to consumers and businesses primarily in the United States. Our broadband offerings provide users with high-speed broadband internet access and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services. We offer a range of service plans, with pricing based on a number of different factors, including available capacity, bandwidth limits, service quality levels, bundled offerings and terms of distribution. We also offer wholesale and retail broadband services to our national and regional distribution partners, including direct-to-home satellite video providers, retail service providers and communications companies. As of March 31, 2016, we provided broadband internet services to approximately 697,000 consumer and small business subscribers. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; In-Flight Broadband Services. Our award-winning in-flight broadband services (including our flagship Exede in the Air service) provide industry-leading in-flight internet and broadband connectivity services to commercial airlines and business jets. The data throughput capacity of our services enables commercial airlines and business jets to offer more passengers on more flights the ability to enjoy high-speed broadband services such as streaming video. As of March 31, 2016, 476 commercial aircraft were in service utilizing our Exede in-flight broadband services. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Mobile Broadband Services. Our Yonder &#174; mobile broadband services provide global network management and high-speed internet connectivity services for customers using airborne, maritime and ground-mobile satellite systems. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Enterprise Broadband Services. We offer a variety of other broadband services to enterprises, including business connectivity, live on-line event streaming, oil and natural gas data gathering services and high-definition satellite news gathering. 

In February 2016, we entered into a framework and subscription agreement (the Framework Agreement) with Eutelsat, pursuant to which we have agreed to enter into a strategic partnering arrangement with Eutelsat to own and operate satellite broadband infrastructure and equipment and provide satellite-based broadband internet services in the European region. The arrangement will consist of two entities coordinating efforts to expand the European broadband market: an entity to be owned 51% by Eutelsat and 49% by ViaSat following the closing will own and operate Eutelsat&#146;s KA-SAT satellite and related assets and offer wholesale satellite capacity services in the European region; and an entity to be owned 51% by ViaSat and 49% by Eutelsat following the closing will purchase wholesale satellite capacity services and offer retail satellite-based broadband internet services in the European region. At the closing under the Framework Agreement, Eutelsat will contribute and transfer assets relating to Eutelsat&#146;s existing wholesale satellite broadband business (including its KA-SAT satellite) to a newly formed subsidiary of Eutelsat in exchange for the issuance of new shares in such subsidiary, and following such contribution and issuance, we will purchase 49% of the issued shares of Eutelsat&#146;s subsidiary from Eutelsat for &#128;132.5 million and, similarly, Eutelsat will purchase 49% of the issued shares of a second newly formed subsidiary of ViaSat for an immaterial amount. Also at the closing, we and Eutelsat will enter into shareholders&#146; agreements and other ancillary agreements with respect to the ownership, management and operation of the two entities. The closing of the transactions under the Framework Agreement is subject to customary conditions, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals and third-party consents. We currently anticipate that the closing will occur in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. 

Commercial Networks 

Our commercial networks segment develops and produces a variety of advanced end-to-end satellite and wireless communication systems, ground networking equipment and space-to-earth connectivity systems. We design and build customized fixed and mobile satellite communication systems capable of serving a variety of markets and applications. In addition, we offer an array of ground networking equipment and products, including customer premise equipment (CPE), satellite modems, antenna technologies, earth stations and satellite networking hubs. Our communication systems, networking equipment and products are generally developed 

&#160; 

through a combination of customer and discretionary internal research and development funding, are utilized to provide services through our satellite services segment and are also sold to commercial networks customers. 

We believe growth in our commercial networks segment will be driven in the coming years by continued growth in worldwide demand for communications systems, ground networking equipment and products that enable or support access to high-speed broadband services, and by the increasing cost-effectiveness of satellite technologies to rapidly deploy broadband services across wide geographic areas and to large numbers of people within the satellite footprint. Our commercial networks segment also leverages the deployment of our own proprietary high-capacity Ka-band satellites, as well as Ka-band satellites operated or being built for third parties around the world, by providing the ground infrastructure and user terminals that access the satellites. However, our research and development investments in our ViaSat-3 class satellites and related ground infrastructure are expected to continue to negatively impact our financial results in our commercial networks segment in fiscal year 2017 and beyond. 

Our communication systems, ground networking equipment and products include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Fixed Satellite Networks. We are a leading end-to-end network technology supplier for the fixed satellite consumer and enterprise markets.

Customers of our government systems segment include the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), allied foreign governments, domestic and allied armed forces, public safety first-responders and remote government employees. 

We believe growth in our government systems segment in the coming years will be driven by continued growth in demand for higher-capacity, higher-quality broadband services and associated ground systems and advanced cybersecurity protections. This continued demand reflects the U.S. military&#146;s emphasis on &#147;network-centric&#148; highly mobile warfare over geographically dispersed areas (which requires the development and deployment of secure, IP-based communications networks, products and service offerings capable of supporting real-time dissemination of data using multiple transmission media) and increased use of IP-based network-centric 

&#160; 

and bandwidth-intensive applications at all organizational levels. Satellite-based systems are increasingly seen as the most reliable method of connecting rapidly moving armed forces who may out-run the range of terrestrial radio links and high-speed broadband connectivity is increasingly required to support real-time command and control decision-making and enhanced situational awareness. 

The primary products and services of our government systems segment include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Government Mobile Broadband. Our government mobile broadband products and services provide military and government users with high-speed, real-time broadband and multimedia connectivity in key regions of the world.

Our cybersecurity and information assurance products and services provide advanced, high-speed IP-based &#147;Type 1&#148; and High Assurance Internet Protocol Encryption (HAIPE &#174; )-compliant encryption solutions that enable military and government users to communicate information securely over networks, and that secure data stored on computers and storage devices. Our encryption products and modules use a programmable, high-assurance architecture that can be easily upgraded in the field or integrated into existing communication networks, and are available both on a stand-alone basis and as embedded modules within our tactical radio, information distribution and other satellite communication systems and products. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Tactical Data Links. We develop and produce advanced tactical radio and information distribution systems that enable real-time collection and dissemination of video and data using secure, jam-resistant transmission links from manned aircraft, ground mobile vehicles and other remote platforms to networked communication and command centers. Key products in this category include our Battlefield Awareness and Targeting System &#151; Dismounted (BATS-D) handheld link radios, as well as our Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) terminals for military fighter jets and their successor, MIDS Joint Tactical Radio System (MIDS-JTRS) terminals, &#147;disposable&#148; weapon data links and other portable small tactical terminals. 

Our Strengths 

We believe the following strengths position our business to capitalize on the attractive growth opportunities presented in our business segments: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Vertically Integrated End-to-End Platform of Leading Broadband Technologies . We believe our innovative ecosystem of high-capacity Ka-band satellites, ground infrastructure and user terminals provides a vertically integrated end-to-end platform that uniquely positions us to cost-effectively deliver a diverse portfolio of high-speed, high-quality broadband solutions and applications to enterprises, consumers and government users. Our product, system and service offerings are often linked through common underlying technologies, customer applications and market relationships. We 

&#160; 

&#160; believe that many of the market segments in which we compete have significant barriers to entry relating to the complexity of technology and the amount of required investment, and that limited competition exists for broadband services at higher data speeds. We believe that our comprehensive and vertically integrated portfolio of satellites, products and services, combined with our ability to effectively cross-deploy technologies between government and commercial segments and across different geographic markets, provides us with a strong foundation to sustain and enhance our leadership in broadband technologies and services. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Innovation of Next-Generation Satellite Technology. We have a long history of innovation in next-generation satellite technologies. Since our inception, we have designed and produced advanced satellite communications systems and equipment. Our award-winning first-generation high-capacity Ka-band spot-beam satellite, ViaSat-1, was placed into service in January 2012. In February 2012, the Society of Satellite Professionals International bestowed an Industry Innovators Award on us in recognition of the development and launch of our ViaSat-1 satellite and, with its data throughput of approximately 140 Gigabits per second, in 2013 ViaSat-1 earned a Guinness World Records &#174; title as the highest-capacity communications satellite in the world. In May 2013, we entered into a satellite construction contract for our ViaSat-2 satellite, our second-generation high-capacity Ka-band satellite design, which we expect will be launched during fiscal year 2017. We expect that our ViaSat-2 satellite will significantly expand our data throughput capacity, enabling us to improve the speed, availability and geographic coverage area of our broadband services. In addition, construction has commenced on two ViaSat-3 class satellites, our third-generation high-capacity Ka-band satellite design, pursuant to a limited authorization to proceed, and we anticipate that our ViaSat-3 class satellites will be launched in late 2019 or 2020. Our ViaSat-3 class satellites are designed to further expand our data throughput capacity and geographic coverage area and to support the flexible allocation of capacity to dynamically respond to changing capacity demands, thereby improving the speed, availability and cost-efficiency of our proprietary Ka-band satellite network. Our market-leading Exede in the Air in-flight broadband service has received numerous awards and accolades, including the Crystal Cabin Award for the best Passenger Comfort System in April 2015 and the Excellence in Avionics Award for In-Flight Connectivity Innovation in July 2015. We believe that our innovative satellite technologies and investments in the associated ground infrastructure will enable us to provide greater capacity and faster broadband speeds. We believe our history of developing proprietary and innovative satellite technologies spanning spacecraft, ground infrastructure, user terminals and network design demonstrates that we possess the expertise and credibility required to serve the evolving technology needs of our customers. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Diversification of Business Model . Our business is highly diversified, ranging from the provision of broadband services to consumers, enterprises and commercial airlines in the United States, to the worldwide sale of complex satellite communication systems and products to communications service providers and enterprises, to the sale of advanced wireless communications systems, secure networking systems and cybersecurity and information assurance products and services to government users and defense contractors. This diversification in product and service offerings, customer base and market segment helps to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in any of the individual markets we serve. In addition, the flexibility in our business model allows us to allocate our satellite capacity to markets where bandwidth usage demands and returns are highest. During fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, our satellite services segment generated 39%, 36% and 29% of total revenues, our commercial networks segment generated 18%, 25% and 29% of total revenues, and our government systems segment generated 43%, 39% and 42% of total revenues, respectively. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Blue-Chip Customer Base and Favorable Consumer Contract Terms. Our customers include the DoD, large defense contractors, allied foreign governments, civil agencies, satellite network integrators, large communications service providers, commercial airlines and enterprises requiring complex communications and networking solutions and services. We believe that the credit strength of our key customers, including the U.S. government, leading aerospace and defense prime contractors and commercial airlines, as well as our favorable consumer broadband contract terms, help support more consistent financial performance. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; Experienced Management Team. Our Chief Executive Officer, Mark Dankberg, and our Chief Technology Officers have been with the company since its inception in 1986. Mr. Dankberg is considered to be a leading expert in the field of satellite and wireless communications. In 2008, Mr. Dankberg received the prestigious AIAA Aerospace International Communication award, which recognized him for &#147;shepherding ViaSat into a leading satellite communications company through outstanding leadership and technical expertise.&#148; In 2013, Mr. Dankberg received the Innovator Award from the Arthur C. Clarke Foundation. In 2015, Mr. Dankberg was inducted into the Society of Satellite Professionals Hall of Fame for his leadership and visionary role in satellite communications. 

Our Strategy 

Our business strategy is to be a leading provider of high-speed and cost-effective broadband and advanced communications products and services, utilizing our leading satellite technologies. The principal elements of our strategy include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Maintain Focus on Technology Leadership. We will continue to focus on research and development to maintain our leadership position in satellite technologies and services. Innovative satellite and product development has been one of our hallmarks and continues to be critical to our success. Our research and development efforts are supported by an employee base of over 1,900 engineers and a culture that deeply values innovation. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Continue to Expand our Addressable Markets. We focus on designing and developing high-capacity satellite technologies. As the capacity, data throughput speeds and geographic coverage areas of our satellite systems continue to increase (with each generation of our high-capacity Ka-band satellite designs), we expect the addressable market for our broadband technologies, products and services (whether consumer, enterprise, commercial airline or government) to similarly expand. Higher capacity, more flexible satellites allow us to offer cost-effective broadband services that allow greater data usage at faster speeds, thereby enabling us to better compete against other broadband technologies (including terrestrial technologies) over large geographic areas. As the speed of our broadband offerings increases, we expect the number of companies able to provide competing broadband offerings at equivalent speeds to decrease. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Drive Cost Efficiencies. We continue to drive cost efficiencies in our businesses through our development of leading, vertically integrated satellite technologies. We optimize our satellite network systems through our development of an end-to-end platform of next-generation Ka-band satellites, ground networking equipment and user terminals that enable the provision of high-speed broadband services. Our ViaSat-3 class satellites are expected to further drive cost efficiencies through their ability to efficiently and dynamically match supply and demand through the flexible allocation of capacity within the satellite footprint. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Focus on International Opportunities. We believe that international markets represent an attractive opportunity for our business. As worldwide demand for broadband connectivity and services continues to grow, we expect that our comprehensive offering of next-generation Ka-band satellites, advanced end-to-end communication systems and ground networking equipment and products, and their ability to enable cost-effective, high-speed broadband services, will be increasingly attractive internationally. Following launch, our ViaSat-2 satellite currently under construction is expected to provide seven times the geographic coverage of ViaSat-1, and our ViaSat-3 class satellites currently under construction are expected to provide broadband services over the Americas and over Europe, the Middle East and Africa, respectively, thereby making our cost-effective, high-speed broadband service offerings available to new markets. We anticipate that our ViaSat-2 satellite will be launched during fiscal year 2017 and that our ViaSat-3 class satellites will be launched in late 2019 or 2020. In addition, in February 2016, we entered into a Framework Agreement with Eutelsat, pursuant to which we have agreed to enter into a strategic partnering arrangement with Eutelsat to own and operate satellite broadband infrastructure and equipment and provide broadband internet services in the European region. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; Pursue Growth Through Strategic Alliances, Partnering Arrangements and Relationships. We actively seek strategic relationships and joint ventures with companies whose financial, marketing, operational or technological resources can accelerate the introduction of new technologies and the penetration of new markets, such as our proposed European expansion in our satellite services segment contemplated by the Framework Agreement with Eutelsat. In our government systems segment, we regularly enter into teaming arrangements with other government contractors to more effectively capture complex government programs. We have also engaged in strategic relationships with companies that have innovative technologies and products, highly skilled personnel, market presence, or customer relationships and distribution channels that complement our strategy. We may continue to evaluate acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary companies, businesses, products or technologies to supplement our internal growth. 

Our Customers 

Our customer base is highly diversified. Customers in our satellite services segment include residential customers, commercial airlines, small businesses and other enterprise customers of our broadband services. The customers of our government systems and commercial networks segments include the DoD, U.S. National Security Agency, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, allied foreign governments, select other U.S. federal, state and local government agencies, defense contractors, satellite network integrators, large communications service providers and enterprises requiring complex communications and networking solutions. We enter into government contracts either directly with U.S. or foreign governments, or indirectly through domestic or international prime contractors. In our commercial networks segment, we also act as both a prime contractor and subcontractor for the sale of equipment and services. 

Revenues from the U.S. government as an individual customer comprised approximately 24%, 23% and 21% of total revenues for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. None of our commercial customers comprised 10% or more of total revenues in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014. 

U.S. Government Contracts 

Substantial portions of our revenues are generated from contracts and subcontracts with the DoD and other federal government agencies. Many of our contracts are subject to a competitive bid process and are awarded on the basis of technical merit, personnel qualifications, experience and price. We also receive some contract awards involving special technical capabilities on a negotiated, noncompetitive basis due to our unique technical capabilities in special areas. The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 has encouraged the use of commercial type pricing, such as firm fixed-price contracts, on dual use products. Our future revenues and income could be materially affected by changes in government procurement policies and related oversight, a reduction in expenditures for the products and services we provide, and other risks generally associated with federal government contracts. 

We provide products under federal government contracts that usually require performance over a period of several months to multiple years. Long-term contracts may be conditioned upon continued availability of congressional appropriations. Variances between anticipated budget and congressional appropriations may result in a delay, reduction or termination of these contracts. 

Our federal government contracts are performed under cost-reimbursement contracts, time-and-materials contracts and fixed-price contracts. Cost-reimbursement contracts provide for reimbursement of costs and payment of a fee. The fee may be either fixed by the contract or variable, based upon cost control, quality, delivery and the customer&#146;s subjective evaluation of the work. Under time-and-materials contracts, we receive a fixed amount by labor category for services performed and are reimbursed for the cost of materials purchased to perform the contract. Under a fixed-price contract, we agree to perform specific work for a fixed price and, accordingly, realize the benefit or detriment to the extent that the actual cost of performing the work differs from 

&#160; 

the contract price. In fiscal year 2016, approximately 13% of our total government revenues was generated from cost-reimbursement contracts with the federal government or our prime contractors, approximately 1% from time-and-materials contracts and approximately 86% from fixed-price contracts. 

Our allowable federal government contract costs and fees are subject to audit and review by the Defense Contracting Management Agency (DCMA) and the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA), as discussed below under &#147;&#151; Regulatory Environment &#151; Other Regulations.&#148; 

Our federal government contracts may be terminated, in whole or in part, at the convenience of the U.S. government. If a termination for convenience occurs, the U.S. government generally is obligated to pay the cost incurred by us under the contract plus a pro rata fee based upon the work completed. Contracts with prime contractors may have negotiated termination schedules that apply. When we participate as a subcontractor, we are at risk if the prime contractor does not perform its contract. Similarly, when we act as a prime contractor employing subcontractors, we are at risk if a subcontractor does not perform its subcontract. 

Some of our federal government contracts contain options that are exercisable at the discretion of the customer. An option may extend the period of performance for one or more years for additional consideration on terms and conditions similar to those contained in the original contract. An option may also increase the level of effort and assign new tasks to us. In our experience, options are exercised more often than not. 

Our eligibility to perform under our federal government contracts requires us to maintain adequate security measures. We have implemented security procedures that we believe adequately satisfy the requirements of our federal government contracts. 

Research and Development 

The industries in which we compete are subject to rapid technological developments, evolving standards, changes in customer requirements and continuing developments in the communications and networking environment. Our continuing ability to adapt to these changes, and to develop innovative satellite technologies and new and enhanced products and services, is a significant factor in maintaining or improving our competitive position and our prospects for growth. Therefore, we continue to make significant investments in next-generation satellite technologies and product development. 

We conduct the majority of our research and product development activities in-house and have a research and development and engineering staff, which includes over 1,900 engineers. Our product development activities focus on products that we consider viable revenue opportunities to support all of our business segments. A significant portion of our research and development efforts for our products have generally been conducted in direct response to the specific requirements of a customer&#146;s order and, accordingly, these amounts are included in the cost of sales when incurred and the related funding is included in revenues at that time. 

The portion of our contract revenues which includes research and development funded by government and commercial customers was approximately 20%, 23% and 31% during fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, of our total revenues. In addition, we incurred $77.2 million, $46.7 million and $60.7 million during fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, on independent research and development (IR&#38;D) expenses, which comprises research and development not directly funded by a third party. Funded research and development contains a profit component and is therefore not directly comparable to IR&#38;D. As a U.S. government contractor, we also are able to recover a portion of our IR&#38;D expenses, consisting primarily of salaries and other personnel-related expenses, supplies and prototype materials related to research and development programs. 

Intellectual Property 

We seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws and contractual rights. We also seek to maintain 

&#160; 

our trade secrets and confidential information through nondisclosure policies, the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements and other security measures. We have registered a number of patents and trademarks in the United States and in other countries and have a substantial number of patent filings pending determination. There can be no assurance, however, that these rights can be successfully enforced against competitive products in any particular jurisdiction. Although we believe the protection afforded by our patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and contracts has value, the rapidly changing technology in the networking, satellite and wireless communications industries and uncertainties in the legal process make our future success dependent primarily on the innovative skills, technological expertise and management abilities of our employees rather than on the protections afforded by patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and contractual rights. Accordingly, while these legal protections are important, they must be supported by other factors such as the expanding knowledge, ability and experience of our personnel, and the continued development of new products and product enhancements. 

Certain of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products, we believe, based upon past experience and standard industry practice, that such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. Nonetheless, there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Our inability to obtain these licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. 

The industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology, a large number of patents, and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. We cannot assure you that our patents and other proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, that others will not assert intellectual property rights to technologies that are relevant to us, or that our rights will give us a competitive advantage. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. 

Sales and Marketing 

We have a sales presence in various domestic and foreign locations, and we sell our products and services both directly and indirectly through channel partners, as described below: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Satellite Services Sales Organization. Our satellite services sales organization for our broadband internet services sells directly to residential customers in our retail channel through our Exede website, sales call centers and through over 1,000 active retailer dealers (including DirecTV), In addition, subscribers for our broadband internet services are also acquired through our wholesale distribution relationships with DISH Network and the National Rural Telecommunications Cooperative. Our satellite services sales organization also includes direct sales and business development personnel who work with enterprises and commercial airlines to identify business opportunities and develop solutions for customers&#146; needs. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Commercial Networks Sales Organization. Our commercial networks sales organization consists of sales managers and sales engineers, who act as the primary interface to establish account relationships and determine technical requirements for customer networks. In addition to our sales force, we maintain a highly trained service staff to provide technical product and service support to our customers. The sales cycle in the commercial network market is lengthy and it is not unusual for a sale to take up to 18 months from the initial contact through the execution of the agreement. The sales process often includes several network design iterations, network demonstrations and pilot networks consisting of a few sites. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Government Systems Sales Organization. Our government systems sales organization consists of both direct sales personnel who sell our standard products, and business development personnel who work with engineers, program managers, marketing managers and contract managers to identify business 

&#160; 

&#160; opportunities, develop customer relationships, develop solutions for customers&#146; needs, prepare proposals and negotiate contractual arrangements. The period of time from initial contact through the point of product sale and delivery can take over three years for more complex product developments. Products already in production can usually be delivered to a customer between 90 to 180 days from the point of product sale. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Strategic Partners. To augment our direct sales efforts, we seek to develop key strategic relationships to market and sell our products and services. We direct our sales and marketing efforts to our strategic partners, primarily through our senior management relationships. In some cases a strategic ally may be the prime contractor for a system or network installation and will subcontract a portion of the project to us. In other cases, the strategic ally may recommend us as the prime contractor for the design and integration of the network. We seek strategic relationships and partners based on many factors, including financial resources, technical capability, geographic location and market presence. 

Our marketing team works closely with our sales, research and product development organizations and our customers to increase the awareness of the ViaSat brand through a mix of positive program performance and our customers&#146; recommendation as well as public relations, advertising, trade show participation and conference speaking engagements by providing communications that keep the market current on our products and features. Our marketing team also identifies and sizes new target markets for our products and services, creates awareness of our company and our portfolio of offerings, and generates contacts and leads within these targeted markets. 

Competition 

The markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid change, converging technologies and a migration to solutions that offer higher capacity and speed and other superior advantages. These market factors represent both an opportunity and a competitive threat to us. In many cases our competitors can also be our customers or partners. Accordingly, maintaining an open and cooperative relationship is important. The overall number of our competitors may increase, and the identity and composition of competitors may change. As we continue to expand our business globally, we may see new competition in different geographic regions. 

To compete, we emphasize: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the high-speed, high-quality and broad geographic availability of our broadband services; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; our proven designs and network integration services for complex, customized network needs; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the increased bandwidth efficiency offered by our networks, products and services; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the innovative and flexible features integrated into our products and services; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; our network management experience; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; our end-to-end network implementation capabilities; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the distinct advantages of satellite data networks; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; technical advantages and advanced features of our antenna systems as compared to our competitors&#146; offerings; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the overall cost-effectiveness of our communications systems, products and services. 

While we believe we compete successfully on each of these factors, we expect to continue to face intense competition in each of our markets. 

In our satellite services segment, we face competition for consumer and enterprise broadband services both from existing competitors and emerging technologies. Our residential and other fixed broadband service offerings compete with broadband service offerings from wireline and wireless telecommunications companies, 

&#160; 

cable companies, satellite companies and internet service providers. Many of our competitors are larger than us, have substantial capital resources, have greater brand recognition, have access to spectrum or technologies not available to us, or are able to offer bundled service offerings that we are not able to duplicate, all of which may reduce demand for our broadband services. In addition, the broadband services market continues to see industry consolidation and vertical integration, which may enable our competitors to provide competing services to broader customer segments. New entrants, some with significant financial resources, and new emerging technologies (including 5G and advanced fiber) may compete with our broadband service offerings. For example, Google has launched high-speed internet and video services in a limited number of areas and has announced plans to expand in more areas. Our in-flight broadband service offerings compete against air-to-ground mobile services and other satellite-based services, such as the services offered by Global Eagle and Gogo. We believe that our Ka-band satellite-based in-flight broadband services offer a competitive combination of high-speed and data throughput capacity, that enable commercial airlines and business jets to offer more passengers on more flights the ability to enjoy high-speed broadband services such as streaming video. 

In our commercial networks segment, we compete with numerous other providers of satellite and terrestrial communications systems, products and equipment, including: ASC Signal, Astrium, Comtech, General Dynamics, Gilat, EchoStar (Hughes Network Systems), iDirect Technologies, L-3 Communications, Newtec, Panasonic, Space Systems/Loral, Thales and Zodiac Data Systems. In addition, some of our customers continuously evaluate whether to develop and manufacture their own products and could elect to compete with us at any time. 

Within our government systems segment, we generally compete with manufacturers of defense electronics products, systems or subsystems, such as BAE Systems, General Dynamics, Harris, Inmarsat, L-3 Communications, Rockwell Collins and similar companies. We may also occasionally compete directly with the largest defense prime contractors, including Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon Systems. In many cases we partner with our competitors, and therefore maintaining an open and cooperative relationship is important. 

Many of our competitors in our commercial networks and government systems segments have significant competitive advantages, including strong customer relationships, more experience with regulatory compliance, greater financial and management resources and access to technologies not available to us. Many of our competitors are also substantially larger than we are and may have more extensive engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do. As a result, these competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to changing technology or market conditions or may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products. 

Manufacturing 

Our manufacturing objective is to produce high-quality products that conform to specifications at the lowest possible manufacturing cost. To achieve this objective, we primarily utilize a range of contract manufacturers that are selected based on the production volumes and complexity of the product. By employing contract manufacturers, we are able to reduce the costs of products and support rapid fluctuations in delivery rates when needed. As part of our manufacturing process, we conduct extensive testing and quality control procedures for all products before they are delivered to customers. 

Contract manufacturers produce products for many different customers and are able to pass on the benefits of large-scale manufacturing to their customers. These manufacturers are able to produce high quality products at lower costs by: (1) exercising their high-volume purchasing power, (2) employing advanced and efficient production equipment and capital intensive systems whose costs are leveraged across their broad customer base, and (3) using a cost-effective skilled workforce. Our primary contract manufacturers include Benchmark, CyberTAN, Davida Technology Partners, EADS, Flextronics, Harris, IEC Electronics Corporation, Microelectronics Technology (MTI), NeoTech, Plexus and Regal Technology Partners. 

&#160; 

Our experienced management team facilitates an efficient contract manufacturing process through the development of strong relationships with a number of different domestic and off-shore contract manufacturers. By negotiating beneficial contract provisions and purchasing some of the equipment needed to manufacture our products, we retain the ability to move the production of our products from one contract manufacturing source to another if required. Our operations management has experience in the successful transition from in-house production to contract manufacturing. The degree to which we employ contract manufacturing depends on the maturity of the product and the forecasted production life cycle. We intend to limit our internal manufacturing capacity to supporting new product development activities, building customized products that need to be manufactured in strict accordance with a customer&#146;s specifications or delivery schedules, and building proprietary, highly sensitive ViaSat-designed products and components for use in our proprietary technology platform. Therefore, our internal manufacturing capability for standard products has been, and is expected to continue to be, very limited and we intend to continue to rely on contract manufacturers for large-scale manufacturing. We also rely on outside vendors to manufacture specific components and subassemblies used in the production of our products. Some components, subassemblies and services necessary for the manufacture of our products are obtained from a sole source supplier or a limited group of suppliers. 

Regulatory Environment 

We are required to comply with the laws and regulations of, and often obtain approvals from, national and local authorities in connection with the services that we provide. In particular, we provide a number of services that rely on the use of radio-frequency spectrum, and the provision of such services is highly regulated. National authorities generally require that the satellites they authorize be operated in a manner consistent with the regulations and procedures of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), which require the coordination of the operation of satellite systems in certain circumstances, and more generally are intended to avoid the occurrence of harmful interference among different users of the radio spectrum. 

We also produce a variety of communications systems and networking equipment, the design, manufacture, and marketing of which are subject to the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we sell such equipment. We are subject to export control laws and regulations, and trade and economic sanctions laws and regulations, with respect to the export of such systems and equipment. As a government contractor, we are subject to U.S. procurement laws and regulations. 

Radio-frequency and Communications Regulation 

International Telecommunication Union (ITU) 

The orbital location and frequencies for our satellites are subject to the ITU&#146;s frequency registration and coordination procedures. Those procedures are specified in the ITU Radio Regulations and seek to facilitate shared international use of limited spectrum and orbital resources in a manner that avoids harmful interference. Among other things, the ITU procedures establish procedures for establishing international priority with respect to the use of such resources, deadlines for bringing satellite networks into use in order to maintain such priority, and coordination rights and obligations with respect to other networks, which vary depending on whether such networks have higher or lower ITU priority. On our behalf, various countries have made and may in the future make additional filings for the frequency assignments at particular orbital locations that are used or to be used by our current satellite networks and potential future satellite networks we may build or acquire. In the event that any international coordination process that is triggered by such an ITU filing is not successfully completed, we may be compelled to accept more limited or suboptimal orbital and spectrum rights, to operate the applicable satellite(s) on a non-interference basis, or to cease operating such satellite(s) altogether. 

US Regulation 

The commercial use of radio-frequency spectrum in the United States is subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended 

&#160; 

(Communications Act). The FCC is responsible for licensing the operation of satellite earth stations and spacecraft, and for regulating the technical and other aspects of the operation of these facilities. 

Earth Stations. The Communications Act requires a license for the operation of transmitting satellite earth station facilities and certain receiving satellite earth station facilities in the United States. We currently hold licenses authorizing us to operate various earth stations within the United States, including but not limited to user terminals, facilities that aggregate traffic and interconnect with the internet backbone and network hubs. These licenses typically are granted for 10 to 15 year terms, and typically are renewed in the ordinary course. Material changes in these operations would require prior approval by the FCC. The operation of our earth stations is subject to various license conditions, as well as the technical and operational requirements of the FCC&#146;s rules and regulations. 

Space Stations. In the United States, the FCC authorizes the launch and operation of commercial spacecraft, and also authorizes non-U.S. licensed spacecraft to be used to serve the United States. The FCC has authorized the use of the ViaSat-1, WildBlue-1 and Anik F2 spacecraft to serve the United States. The FCC also has granted us the right to use certain future spacecraft to serve the United States, as long as we implement those spacecraft by certain deadlines. The use of these spacecraft in our business is subject to various conditions in the underlying authorizations, as well as the technical and operational requirements of the FCC&#146;s rules and regulations. 

Universal Service. Certain of our services may constitute the provision of telecommunications to, from or within the United States, and may require us to contribute a percentage of our revenues from such services to universal service support mechanisms that subsidize the provision of services to low-income consumers, high-cost areas, schools, libraries and rural health care providers. This percentage is set each calendar quarter by the FCC, and currently is 17.9%. Current FCC rules permit us to pass this universal service contribution through to our customers. For example, the FCC has established a new universal service funding mechanism to support the provision of voice and broadband services in certain high-cost areas of the United States, known as the Connect America Fund (the CAF). Among other things, the new CAF mechanism provides support to incumbent wireline carriers on a preferential basis, with those incumbents consequently securing the vast majority of available support, to the exclusion of competitive service providers, including satellite broadband providers. The FCC still is in the process of finalizing rules governing how much more limited support for competitive service providers will be distributed, and it is possible that those new rules would restrict the ability of satellite broadband providers to compete against terrestrial providers for even that more limited support, which would place us at a competitive disadvantage in the provision of broadband services those additional areas receiving CAF support. It is uncertain how and when the CAF will be implemented fully, and how such implementation could impact satellite broadband providers. Depending on the extent to which the CAF, as implemented, gives incumbents a competitive advantage in providing broadband services in supported areas, or terrestrial technologies a competitive advantage over satellite technologies, the CAF could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

CALEA. We are obligated to comply with the requirements of the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), which requires telecommunications providers and broadband internet access providers to ensure that law enforcement agencies are able to conduct lawfully-authorized surveillance of users of their services. 

Net Neutrality. In February 2015, the FCC adopted new rules intended to preserve the openness of the internet, a concept generally referred to as &#147;net neutrality&#148; or &#147;open internet.&#148; The FCC previously had attempted to adopt rules of this type but they were vacated in large part by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which concluded that the FCC had failed to establish the legal authority for and otherwise justify its actions. In adopting its new rules (which are similar in many respects to its old rules, and also broader in some respects), the FCC relied on Title II of the Communications Act, which authorizes the FCC to regulate telecommunications common carriers. More specifically, the FCC reclassified mass-market retail broadband internet access service as a &#147;telecommunications service&#148; subject to common-carrier regulation under Title II, 

&#160; 

reversing longstanding precedent classifying broadband as a lightly regulated &#147;information service&#148; not subject to such regulation. The FCC then took the further step of forbearing from applying most Title II requirements to internet service providers (ISPs). As a result, ISPs that provide mass-market, retail service offerings are subject to specific &#147;net neutrality&#148; rules and general common-carrier obligations ( e.g., those requiring rates, terms, and conditions of service to be &#147;just and reasonable&#148;) but are not subject to many of the specific common-carrier requirements found in the Communications Act and the FCC&#146;s rules. 

The FCC&#146;s new &#147;net neutrality&#148; rules, among other things, prohibit ISPs from: (i) blocking access to legal content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices (subject to an exception for &#147;reasonable network management&#148;); (ii) impairing or degrading lawful internet traffic on the basis of content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices (subject to the same exception); (iii) favoring some lawful internet traffic over other lawful traffic in exchange for consideration of any kind whatsoever; and (iv) unreasonably interfering with or unreasonably disadvantaging the ability of end users to access content or the ability of content providers to access end users (again subject to the exception for &#147;reasonable network management&#148;). ISPs also are obligated to make certain disclosures to consumers with respect to their network management policies. A number of parties already have sought judicial review and/or stay of the FCC&#146;s actions, including the leading trade associations for the cable, wireline, and wireless industries. More recently, the FCC has proposed to impose broadband-specific requirements intended to protect customer privacy and reduce the potential for data breaches. It is unclear what impact the new &#147;net neutrality&#148; rules or proposed customer privacy rules if adopted, will have on ViaSat&#146;s business; because many of the rules are vague, much of the law in this area likely will develop in the future, on a case-by-case basis, in response to complaints filed at the FCC. 

Satellite Spectrum . The space stations and ground network we use to provide our Exede broadband services operate using Ka-band spectrum that is designated for use on a primary basis for the types of satellite services we provide, as well as additional Ka-band spectrum that is designated primarily for fixed terrestrial wireless and other uses but that we are authorized to use on a secondary or non-interference basis. The FCC has commenced a rulemaking proceeding in which it is considering the use of the portion of the Ka-band designated for fixed terrestrial wireless use, as well as other bands above 24 GHz, for future &#147;5G&#148; wireless mobile broadband services. In this proceeding, the FCC has introduced proposals that may allow certain of our existing earth stations that we use to aggregate traffic and interconnect with the internet backbone to operate unimpeded by future 5G deployment. However, the FCC&#146;s proposals do not currently contemplate that the same protection would be afforded to all such earth stations or to earth stations that will be deployed in the future using this spectrum. If the FCC adopts rules for 5G spectrum that would require satellite operators to protect 5G networks from interference in Ka-band spectrum, we may be unable to utilize this spectrum as planned to expand our satellite network capacity. Similarly, if the FCC does not adopt and enforce suitable limits on 5G operations, 5G transmissions could cause harmful interference into our satellite receivers and prevent our satellites from working as intended. We are actively participating in this proceeding and have put forth proposals that we believe would enable terrestrial wireless and satellite operations to share this spectrum successfully. We cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding. The adoption of rules that would limit protection for satellite operations or constrain or prohibit the types of uses we have planned for this spectrum could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Foreign Licensing 

The spacecraft we use in our business are subject to the regulatory authority of, and conditions imposed by, foreign governments, as well as contractual arrangements with third parties and the rules and procedures of the ITU. Our ViaSat-1 satellite operates under authority granted to ManSat Limited by the governments of the Isle of Man and the United Kingdom (as well as authority from the FCC), and pursuant to contractual arrangements we have with ManSat Limited that extend past the expected useful life of ViaSat-1. ViaSat-2 is expected to operate under the authority of the United Kingdom. We also use Ka-band capacity on the Anik F2 satellite to provide our broadband services under an agreement with Telesat Canada, and we may do so until the end of the useful life of that satellite. Telesat Canada operates that satellite under authority granted to it by the government of Canada. 

&#160; 

We also currently use the WildBlue-1 satellite, which we own, and which is co-located with Anik F2 under authority granted to Telesat Canada by the government of Canada, and pursuant to an agreement we have with Telesat Canada that expires upon the end of the useful life of Anik F2. Accordingly, we are reliant upon ManSat Limited and Telesat Canada to maintain their respective governmental rights on which our operating rights are based. The use of these spacecraft in our business is subject to various conditions in the underlying authorizations held by us, ManSat Limited and Telesat Canada, as well as the technical and operational requirements of the rules and regulations of those jurisdictions. 

Equipment Design, Manufacture, and Marketing 

We must comply with the applicable laws and regulations and, where required, obtain the approval of the regulatory authority of each country in which we design, manufacture, or market our communications systems and networking equipment. Applicable laws and regulatory requirements vary from country to country, and jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The increasing demand for wireless communications has exerted pressure on regulatory bodies worldwide to adopt new standards for these products, generally following extensive investigation and deliberation over competing technologies. The delays inherent in this government approval process have in the past caused and may in the future cause the cancellation, postponement or rescheduling of the installation of communication systems by our customers, which in turn may have a material adverse impact on the sale of our products to the customers. 

Equipment Testing and Verification. In the United States, certain equipment that we manufacture must comply with applicable technical requirements intended to minimize radio interference to other communications services and ensure product safety. In the United States, the FCC is responsible for ensuring that communications devices comply with technical requirements for minimizing radio interference and human exposure to radio emissions. The FCC requires that equipment be tested either by the manufacturer or by a private testing organization to ensure compliance with the applicable technical requirements. For other classes of device, the FCC requires submission of an application, which must be approved by the FCC, or in some instances may be approved by a private testing organization. 

Export Controls. Due to the nature and sophistication of our communications products, we must comply with applicable U.S. government and other agency regulations regarding the handling and export of certain of our products. This often requires extra or special handling of these products and could increase our costs. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in substantial harm to the company, including fines, penalties and the forfeiture of future rights to sell or export these products. 

Other Regulations 

As a government contractor, we are routinely subject to audit and review by the DCMA, the DCAA and other U.S. government agencies of our performance on government contracts, indirect rates and pricing practices, accounting and management internal control business systems, and compliance with applicable contracting and procurement laws, regulations and standards. Both contractors and the U.S. government agencies conducting these audits and reviews have come under increased scrutiny. In particular, audits and reviews have become more rigorous and the standards to which we are held are being more strictly interpreted, increasing the likelihood of an audit or review resulting in an adverse outcome. Increases in congressional scrutiny and investigations into business practices and major programs supported by contractors may lead to increased legal costs and may harm our reputation and profitability if we are among the targeted companies. An adverse outcome to a review or audit or other failure to comply with applicable contracting and procurement laws, regulations and standards could result in material civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions being imposed on us, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, triggering of price reduction clauses, suspension of payments, significant customer refunds, fines and suspension, or a prohibition on doing business with U.S. government agencies. In addition, if we fail to obtain an &#147;adequate&#148; determination of our various accounting and management internal control business systems from applicable U.S. government agencies or if allegations of impropriety are 

&#160; 

made against us, we could suffer serious harm to our business or our reputation, including our ability to bid on new contracts or receive contract renewals or our competitive position in the bidding process. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We are also subject to a variety of U.S. and international regulations relating to the storage, discharge, handling, emission, generation, manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances used to manufacture our products. The failure to comply with current or future regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines on us, suspension of production, alteration of our manufacturing processes or cessation of operations. To date, these regulations have not had a material effect on our business, as we have neither incurred significant costs to maintain compliance nor to remedy past noncompliance, and we do not expect such regulations to have a material effect on our business in the current fiscal year. 

Seasonality 

In our satellite services segment, historically subscriber activity for our consumer broadband services has been influenced by seasonal effects related to traditional retail selling periods, with new sales activity generally anticipated to be higher in the second half of the calendar year. However, sales activity and churn can be strongly affected by other factors which may either offset or magnify any anticipated seasonal effects, including availability of capacity, promotional and subscriber retention efforts, changes in our resellers, distributors and wholesalers, changes in the competitive landscape, economic conditions, changes in credit check and subscriber approval processes and satellite beam congestion. 

Our commercial networks segment is not generally affected by seasonal impacts. In our government systems segment, our results are impacted by various factors including the timing of contract awards and the timing and availability of U.S. Government funding, as well as the timing of product deliveries and customer acceptance.

Employees 

As of March 31, 2016, we employed approximately 3,800 individuals worldwide. We consider the relationships with our employees to be positive. Competition for technical personnel in our industry is intense. We believe our future success depends in part on our continued ability to hire, assimilate and retain qualified personnel. To date, we believe we have been successful in recruiting qualified employees, but there is no assurance we will continue to be successful in the future.
