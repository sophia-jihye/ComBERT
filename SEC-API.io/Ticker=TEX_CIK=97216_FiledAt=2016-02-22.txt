BUSINESS 

GENERAL 

Terex is a lifting and material handling solutions company. We are focused on improving our operations and delivering reliable, customer-driven solutions for a wide range of commercial applications, including the construction, infrastructure, quarrying, mining, manufacturing, transportation, energy and utility industries. We report in five business segments: (i) Aerial Work Platforms; (ii) Cranes; (iii) Material Handling &#38; Port Solutions; (iv) Materials Processing; and (v) Construction. 

Our Company was incorporated in Delaware in October 1986 as Terex U.S.A., Inc. We have changed significantly since that time, achieving $6.5 billion &#32;of net sales in 2015 . Much of our growth has been accomplished through acquisitions, and as part of managing our portfolio of companies, we regularly consider the divestiture of non-core businesses and products. We also continue to focus on becoming an industry leading operating company. 

As we have expanded our operations, our business has become increasingly international in scope, with our products manufactured in North and South America, Europe, Australia and Asia and sold worldwide. We continue to focus on expanding our business globally, with a continued emphasis on developing markets such as China, India, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East.

BUSINESS COMBINATION AND PLAN OF MERGER 

On August 10, 2015, we entered into a Business Combination Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "BCA") with Konecranes Plc, a Finnish public company limited by shares ("Konecranes"). The combined company that would result from the transaction will be called Konecranes Terex Plc and will be incorporated in Finland. 

In the proposed transaction, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Konecranes would be merged with and into Terex and our shareholders would receive 0.8 &#32;of a Konecranes share for each existing Terex share (the &#8220;Merger&#8221;). Upon completion of the Merger, our shareholders would own approximately 60% and Konecranes shareholders would own approximately 40% of the combined company. The BCA includes undertakings by us and Konecranes that are typical in similar transactions, including undertakings by both companies to conduct their businesses in the ordinary course prior to the completion of the Merger. 

The BCA may be terminated by us or Konecranes under certain circumstances prior to the completion of the Merger, including, for example, because of a material breach by either party of the terms and conditions of the BCA. The parties have further agreed on certain termination fees customary in similar transactions and payable to the other party under certain circumstances. 

The transaction is subject to approval by both Terex and Konecranes shareholders, regulatory approvals, and the listing of the Konecranes shares or American Depositary Shares (the &#8220;ADSs&#8221;) on the New York Stock Exchange or another U.S. national securities exchange. Terex and Konecranes expect to convene meetings of their shareholders to approve the transaction in the first half of 2016. Closing of the transaction is expected to occur during the first half of 2016. 

See Note A &#8211; &#8220;Business Combination Agreement and Plan of Merger&#8221; in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the proposed Merger. 

OTHER 

We may assist customers in their rental, leasing and acquisition of our products through Terex Financial Services (&#8220;TFS&#8221;). TFS uses its equipment financing experience to provide financing solutions to our customers who purchase our equipment. TFS provides financing support primarily: (i) in the United States and on a limited basis in China, originating, underwriting, documenting, funding and servicing financing transactions directly with end-user customers, distributors and rental companies; and (ii) by facilitating loans and leases between our customers and third party financial institutions. Most of the transactions are fixed and floating rate loans. However, TFS also provides sales-type leases, operating leases and rentals. TFS, in the normal course of business, also sells loans and leases to financial institutions with which it has established relationships. 

The on-book financing activities of TFS have primarily been limited to the United States and China. Additionally, in those countries in which TFS engages in on-book financing, TFS continually evaluates the level to which it utilizes third party funding versus direct customer financing to meet its business objectives. 

TFS continually monitors used equipment values of Terex equipment in the secondary market sales channels for all of our equipment categories. This provides a basis for TFS to project future values of equipment for the underwriting of leases or loans. These re-marketing channels are also used if equipment is returned at end of lease, or is repossessed in case of a customer default. TFS uses the resale channel which maximizes proceeds and/or mitigates risk for Terex and our funding partners . 

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 

On May 30, 2014, the Company sold its truck business, which was consolidated in the Construction segment, to Volvo Construction Equipment for approximately $160 million . The truck business manufactured and sold off-highway rigid and articulated haul trucks. Included in the transaction was the manufacturing facility in Motherwell, Scotland. As a result, the reporting of the truck business has been included in discontinued operations for all periods presented. See Note E &#8211; &#8220;Discontinued Operations&#8221; in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our discontinued operations. 

BUSINESS STRATEGY 

General 

We operate a diverse portfolio of specialized machinery businesses that serve numerous end-use applications in several geographic markets. Our diverse portfolio reduces impact of any one application or market on business results while our focus on machinery-related businesses brings common operational characteristics that enable business efficiency. 

Over the past several years, we changed our business portfolio to better balance business drivers and strengthen the capabilities of our Company. We moved from a predominantly mining and construction equipment company to a more diverse portfolio that serves numerous end markets. Today, we are a lifting and material handling solutions company. Construction markets are still important to our success, along with several other economic drivers. These include global industrial activity, global trade, U.S. electricity demand and infrastructure maintenance. Service to the large installed base of our equipment now operating around the world is an important opportunity that can favorably impact future results. 

A key objective in developing our portfolio of businesses is market leadership. We may initially secure smaller positions, but our goal in developing businesses is to be a top three competitor in applications and geographies that we serve. This goal shapes acquisition, divestiture, and operating strategies in our Company. At the end of 2015 , approximately 75% of our revenue was generated in areas where we are a top three competitor in the market served. 

Operationally, we focus on three primary objectives: 

1. 

Customer Responsiveness 

2. 

Operational Efficiency 

3. 

Global Growth 

We must excel in each of these areas in order to be a more effective and more profitable company long term, and strong performance in all three areas is central to daily management of our Company. 

Our Customer Responsiveness goal is to exceed the performance of competitors in providing equipment that goes to work and stays at work, backed by world-class parts and service support. Each of our businesses measures customer satisfaction and develops roadmaps used to drive improvement in customer satisfaction. 

Our Operational Efficiency goal is to achieve the highest return on invested capital in our peer group. This implies an efficient factory footprint, efficient supply and delivery chains, and a lean mindset that helps eliminate waste throughout our processes for production, delivery, and service to the customer. It is our goal to provide the best value and have ability to compete on price when necessary. Competition in all of our businesses is intense and we must position ourselves to compete more effectively during all phases of future business cycles. 

Global Growth is also critical to our future success. A few of our businesses are focused in specific geographies, but most operate in global industries that require global presence. Collaboration across businesses, sharing of assets, and unified approaches to market development are all critical to efficient pursuit of global opportunities for growth. Efficient sharing of underlying resources enables our businesses to focus on things customers value most and to better position our company to participate as developed markets recover and as developing markets continue to evolve and grow. 

We remain committed to becoming a stronger and more effective company tomorrow than we are today. To succeed, we must focus on what makes our individual businesses strong while also working across businesses to harness the strength of the Company as a whole. Strategy plays an important role but, in the end, our success will be defined and driven by our people. People matter in our company, and it is the way that people work, both individually and collectively, that makes the difference between success and failure. Because of this, we work very hard on the composition of our team, on the values and culture of our company, and on the principles that guide our thinking each and every day. These principles are reflected in our purpose, mission, and vision, in a set of cultural characteristics that we call the Terex Way, and in the processes and practices that define the Terex Business System. 

Purpose, Mission, Vision 

Our purpose &#32;is to improve the lives of people around the world. Our mission &#32;is to provide solutions to our machinery and industrial product customers that yield superior productivity and return on investment.

Stakeholders : We aim to be the most profitable company in the industry as measured by return on invested capital. 

&#8226; 

Team Members : We aim to be the best place to work in the industry as determined by our team members. 

The Terex Way 

We operate our business based on our value system, &#8220;The Terex Way.&#8221; The Terex Way shapes the culture of our Company and reflects our collective commitment to what it means to be a part of Terex. The Terex Way is based on six key values: 

&#8226; 

Integrity : &#32; Integrity reflects honesty, ethics, transparency and accountability. We are committed to maintaining high ethical standards in all of our business dealings and we never sacrifice our integrity for profit. 

&#8226; 

Respect : Respect incorporates concern for safety, health, teamwork, diversity, inclusion and performance. We treat all our team members, customers and suppliers with respect and dignity. 

&#8226; 

Improvement : Improvement encompasses quality, problem-solving systems, a continuous improvement culture and collaboration. We continuously search for new and better ways of doing things, focusing on continuous improvement and the elimination of waste. 

&#8226; 

Servant Leadership : Servant leadership requires service to others, humility, authenticity and leading by example. We work to serve the needs of our customers, investors and team members. 

&#8226; 

Courage : Courage entails willingness to take risks, responsibility, action and empowerment. We have the courage to make a difference even when it is difficult. 

&#8226; 

Citizenship : &#32; Citizenship means social responsibility and environmental stewardship. We comply with all laws, respect all people&#8217;s values and cultures, and are good global, national and local citizens. 

The Terex Business System 

Our operational principles are based on the &#8220;Terex Business System,&#8221; or &#8220;TBS.&#8221; TBS is the framework around which we build our capabilities as an industry leading operating company to achieve our long-term goals. Founded on lean concepts, TBS is a set of guiding principles and business processes that collectively define how we do what we do. TBS is our playbook to deliver our customer, team member and financial goals. It aligns the Company globally with repeatable, teachable processes that harness the full potential of our team members, with each business segment implementing and adapting TBS to fit its manufacturing processes. TBS is not business strategy; it supports business strategy. We believe TBS provides us with a competitive advantage using customer-centric tools that continually enhance responsiveness and eliminate waste. 

PRODUCTS 

AERIAL WORK PLATFORMS 

AERIAL WORK PLATFORMS. Aerial work platform equipment safely positions workers and materials easily and quickly to elevated work areas to enhance productivity. These products have developed as alternatives to scaffolding and ladders. We offer a variety of aerial lifts that are categorized into six product families: portable material lifts; portable aerial work platforms; trailer-mounted articulating booms; self-propelled articulating and self-propelled telescopic booms; and scissor lifts. 

&#8226; 

Portable material lifts are used primarily indoors in the construction, industrial and theatrical markets. 

&#8226; 

Portable aerial work platforms are used primarily indoors in a variety of markets to perform overhead maintenance. 

&#8226; 

Trailer-mounted articulating booms are used both indoors and outdoors. They provide versatile reach, and have the ability to be towed between job sites. 

&#8226; 

Self-propelled articulating booms are primarily used in construction and industrial applications, both indoors and outdoors. They feature lifting versatility with up, out and over position capabilities to access difficult to reach overhead areas. 

&#8226; 

Self-propelled telescopic booms are used outdoors in commercial and industrial construction, as well as highway and bridge maintenance projects. 

&#8226; 

Scissor lifts are used in outdoor and indoor applications in a variety of construction, industrial and commercial settings. 

TELEHANDLERS. Telehandlers move and place materials on residential and commercial construction sites and are used in the energy and infrastructure industries. 

LIGHT TOWERS. Trailer-mounted light towers are used primarily to light work areas for construction, entertainment, emergency assistance and security during nighttime or low light applications. 

CRANES 

We offer a wide variety of cranes, including mobile telescopic cranes, tower cranes, lattice boom crawler cranes, lattice boom truck cranes and boom trucks. 

MOBILE TELESCOPIC CRANES. Mobile telescopic cranes are used primarily for industrial applications, in commercial and public works construction, and in maintenance applications to lift equipment or material. We offer a complete line of mobile telescopic cranes, including rough terrain cranes, truck cranes, all terrain cranes and pick and carry cranes. 

&#8226; 

Rough terrain cranes move materials and equipment on rugged or uneven terrain and are often located on a single construction or work site for long periods. Rough terrain cranes cannot be driven on highways and accordingly must be transported by truck to the work site. 

&#8226; 

Truck cranes have two cabs and can travel rapidly from job site to job site at highway speeds. Truck cranes are often used for multiple local jobs, primarily in urban or suburban areas. 

&#8226; 

All-terrain cranes were developed in Europe as a cross between rough terrain and truck cranes, and are designed to travel across both rough terrain and highways. 

&#8226; 

Pick and carry cranes are designed for a wide variety of applications, including use at mine sites, large fabrication yards, building and construction sites and in machinery maintenance and installation. They combine high road speed with all terrain capability. 

LATTICE BOOM CRAWLER AND LATTICE BOOM TRUCK CRANES. Lattice boom crawler and lattice boom truck cranes are designed to lift material on rough terrain. The boom is made of tubular steel sections, which, together with the base unit, are transported to and erected at a construction site. Applications include infrastructure building, wind turbine erection, construction of nuclear power and petrochemical plants and heavy lifting within oil refineries and the construction industry. 

TOWER CRANES. Tower cranes are often used in urban areas where space is constrained and in long-term or very high building sites. Tower cranes lift construction material and place the material at the point where it is being used. We produce the following types of tower cranes: 

&#8226; 

Self-erecting tower cranes unfold from sections and can be trailer mounted; certain larger models have a telescopic tower and folding jib. These cranes can be assembled on site in a few hours. Applications include residential and small commercial construction. 

&#8226; 

Hammerhead tower cranes have a tower and a horizontal jib assembled from sections. The tower extends above the jib to which suspension cables supporting the jib are attached. These cranes are assembled on-site in one to three days depending on height, and can increase in height with the project. 

&#8226; 

Flat top tower cranes have a tower and a horizontal jib assembled from sections. There is no A-frame above the jib, which is self-supporting and consists of reinforced jib sections. These cranes are assembled on-site in one to two days, and can increase in height with the project. 

&#8226; 

Luffing jib tower cranes have a tower and an angled jib assembled from sections. There is one A-frame above the jib to which suspension cables supporting the jib are attached. Unlike other tower cranes, there is no trolley to control linear movement of the load, which is accomplished by changing the jib angle. These cranes are assembled on-site in two to three days, and can increase in height with the project. 

TRUCK-MOUNTED CRANES (BOOM TRUCKS). We manufacture telescopic boom cranes and articulated hydraulic cranes for mounting on a commercial truck chassis. Truck-mounted cranes are used primarily in the construction and maintenance industries to lift equipment or materials to various heights. Boom trucks are generally lighter and have less lifting capacity than truck cranes, and are used for many of the same applications when lower lifting capacities are sufficient. An advantage of a boom truck is that the equipment or material to be lifted by the crane can be transported by the truck, which can travel at highway speeds. Applications include delivery of building materials and the installation of commercial air conditioners and other roof-mounted equipment. 

UTILITY EQUIPMENT. Our utility products include digger derricks, auger drills, insulated and non-insulated aerial devices and cable placers. These products are used by electric utilities, tree care companies, telecommunications and cable companies, and the related construction industries, as well as by government organizations. 

&#8226; 

Digger derricks are used to dig holes, hoist and set utility poles, as well as lift transformers and other materials at job sites. Auger drills are used to dig holes for utility poles or construction foundations requiring larger diameter holes in difficult soil conditions. 

&#8226; 

Insulated aerial devices are used to elevate workers and material to work areas at the top of utility poles, energized transmission lines and for trimming trees near energized electrical lines, as well as for miscellaneous purposes such as sign maintenance. Non-insulated aerials are used in applications where energized electrical lines are not a hazard. 

&#8226; 

Cable placers are used to install fiber optic, copper and strand telephone and cable lines. 

SERVICES. We offer a range of services for aerial work platform, construction, industrial crane and utility equipment consisting of inspections, preventative maintenance, general repairs, reconditioning, refurbishment, modernization and spare parts, as well as consultancy and training services. Our services are provided on our own products and on third-party products and related equipment. 

MATERIAL HANDLING &#38; PORT SOLUTIONS 

MATERIAL HANDLING. We manufacture universal cranes, process cranes and components, such as rope hoists, chain hoists, light crane systems, travel units and electric motors. 

&#8226; 

Universal cranes are configured individually from standardized modules for industrial infrastructure applications. 

&#8226; 

Process cranes are also made from largely standardized modules and are integrated individually into the customer&#8217;s specific production processes. 

&#8226; 

Rope hoists and chain hoists are used to facilitate the movement of materials in a factory. They can either be integrated as components in universal and process cranes or used as lifting devices in non-crane applications. 

&#8226; 

Light crane systems can be described as railway systems on ceilings that use hoists to move and lift materials in factories. 

&#8226; 

Wheel blocks, electric motors, gearboxes, converters and travel units are components that can be included in tailored solutions for drive applications that aid in the movement of materials in a factory. These components can also be used separately in non-crane applications. 

&#8226; 

Crane sets comprise component packages for customers who are constructing their own girders in a factory. 

PORT SOLUTIONS. We manufacture mobile harbor cranes, ship-to-shore gantry cranes, rubber tired and rail mounted gantry cranes, straddle carriers, sprinter carriers, reach stackers, empty container handlers, full container handlers, general cargo lift trucks, automated stacking cranes, automated guided vehicles and software solutions for logistic terminals. 

&#8226; 

Mobile harbor cranes are used for material handling at ports, including general cargo handling, shipping containers and bulk materials such as coal, iron ore and grain. Mobile harbor cranes can travel around the port as needed and have the ability to move large loads. Mobile harbor cranes can be fitted with a variety of attachments for handling different types of cargo and can also be mounted on a portal or pontoons. 

&#8226; 

Ship-to-shore gantry cranes are used to load and unload container vessels at ports. 

&#8226; 

Rubber tired and rail mounted gantry cranes are used for space intensive shipping container stacking at port and railway facilities. These products have both horizontal and vertical lifting capabilities and can stack up to six containers on top of each other. 

&#8226; 

Straddle carriers pick up and carry shipping containers from or to a quay-side crane while straddling their load. Straddle carriers have the capability to stack up to four shipping containers on top of each other. Straddle carriers are used in port and railway facilities to move shipping containers and to load and unload shipping containers from on-highway trucks. Straddle carriers have both horizontal and vertical lifting capabilities. 

&#8226; 

Sprinter carriers operate in a similar manner to straddle carriers, but at higher speeds in horizontal transport and can stack only one container on top of another container. 

&#8226; 

Reach stackers are used to pick up and stack shipping containers at port and railway facilities. At the end of each reach stacker&#8217;s boom is a spreader that enables it to attach to shipping containers of varying lengths and weights and to rotate the container. 

&#8226; 

Empty container handlers, full container handlers and general cargo lift trucks are small to medium-sized highly mobile trucks for use with a variety of container handling applications at port and railway facilities and provide general cargo lifting capabilities. 

&#8226; 

Automated stacking cranes are able to stack and manage shipping container storage either automatically, semi-automatically or manually. They also form the link between quayside and landside equipment such as ship-to-shore cranes, transport vehicles and trucks. 

&#8226; 

Automated guided vehicles can carry containers of varying size. The vehicles are controlled and supplied with data and orders by our proprietary designed software. Automated guided vehicles find their routes via transponders, which are powerful radio frequency identification chips that are embedded into the pavement of the terminal. In large container terminals involving container transport, storage and transloading, automated guided vehicles work hand-in-hand with automated stacking cranes. 

MATERIALS PROCESSING 

Materials processing equipment is used in processing aggregate materials for building applications and is also used in the quarrying, mining, demolition, recycling, landscaping and biomass production industries. Our materials processing equipment includes crushers, screens and feeders, washing systems as well as wood and biomass chippers. 

We manufacture a range of jaw, impactor (both horizontal and vertical shaft) and cone crushers, as well as base crushers for integration within mobile, modular and static plants. 

&#8226; 

Jaw crushers are used for crushing larger rock, primarily at the quarry face or on recycling duties. Applications include hard rock, sand and gravel and recycled materials. Cone crushers are used in secondary and tertiary applications to reduce a number of materials, including quarry rock and riverbed gravel. 

&#8226; 

Horizontal shaft impactors are primary and secondary crushers. They are typically applied to reduce soft to medium hard materials, as well as recycled materials. Vertical shaft impactors are secondary and tertiary crushers that reduce material utilizing various rotor configurations and are highly adaptable to any application. 

Our screening and feeder equipment includes: 

&#8226; 

Heavy duty inclined and horizontal screens and feeders, which are used in low to high tonnage applications and are available as either stationary or heavy-duty mobile equipment. Screens are used in all phases of plant design from handling quarried material to fine screening. Dry screening is used to process materials such as sand, gravel, quarry rock, coal, ore, construction and demolition waste, soil, compost and wood chips. 

&#8226; 

Feeders are used to unload materials from hoppers and bulk material storage at controlled rates. They are available for applications ranging from primary feed hoppers to fine material bin unloading. Our range includes apron feeders, grizzly feeders and pan feeders. 

Washing system products include a completely mobile, single chassis washing plant incorporating separation, washing, dewatering and stockpiling. We manufacture mobile and stationary screening rinsers, bucket-wheel dewaterers, scrubbing devices for aggregate, a mobile cyclone for maximum retention of sand particles, silt extraction systems, stockpiling conveyors and a sand screw system as an alternative to bucket-wheel dewaterers. We also manufacture washing screens, which are used to separate, wash, scrub, dewater and stockpile sand and gravel. 

Wood processing biomass and recycling equipment includes grinders, chippers, compost turners, shredders, and de-barker systems. This equipment is used in, among other things, the pulp and paper, wood energy, and green waste/construction and demolition recycling industries. 

CONSTRUCTION 

COMPACT CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT. We manufacture a wide variety of compact construction equipment used primarily in the construction and rental industries. Products include loader backhoes, compaction rollers, excavators, site dumpers, and wheel loaders. 

&#8226; 

Loader backhoes incorporate a front-end loader and rear excavator arm. They are used for loading, excavating and lifting in many construction and agricultural related applications. 

&#8226; 

Our compaction rollers range from pedestrian single drum to ride-on tandem drum rollers. 

&#8226; 

Excavators in the compact equipment category include mini, wheeled and midi excavators used in the general construction, landscaping and rental businesses. 

&#8226; 

Wheel loaders are used for loading and unloading materials. Applications include residential and non-residential construction, waste management and general construction. 

&#8226; 

Site dumpers are used to move materials from one location to another, and are primarily used for construction applications. 

SPECIALTY EQUIPMENT. We manufacture material handlers, concrete mixer trucks and concrete pavers. 

&#8226; 

Material handlers are designed for handling logs, scrap, recycling and other bulky materials with clamshell, magnet or grapple attachments. 

&#8226; 

Concrete mixer trucks are machines with a large revolving drum in which cement is mixed with other materials to make concrete. We offer models with custom chassis as well as rear discharge models mounted on commercial chassis, both with configurations from three to seven axles. 

&#8226; 

Our concrete pavers are used to finish bridges, concrete streets, highways and airport surfaces.

We define backlog as firm orders that are expected to be filled within one year, although there can be no assurance that all such backlog orders will be filled within that time. Our backlog orders represent primarily new equipment orders. Parts orders are generally filled on an as-ordered basis. 

Our management views backlog as one of many indicators of the performance of our business. Because many variables can cause changes in backlog, and these changes may or may not be of any significance, we consequently view backlog as an important, but not necessarily determinative, indicator of future results. High backlog can indicate a high level of future sales; however, when backlogs are high, this may also reflect a high level of production delays, which may result in future order cancellations from disappointed customers. Low backlog may indicate less future sales; however, they may also reflect a rapid ability to fill orders that is appreciated by our customers. 

Our overall backlog amounts at December 31, 2015 &#32;decreased $262.7 million &#32;from our backlog amounts at December 31, 2014 , primarily due to lower orders in AWP and Cranes. The translation effect of foreign exchange rates negatively impacted backlog year-over-year by approximately 8%. 

AWP segment backlog at December 31, 2015 &#32;decreased approximately 19% &#32;from our backlog amounts at December 31, 2014 . This decrease from the prior year was primarily due to lower fleet orders from large North American rental customers and to a lesser extent, the impact of the strong U.S. Dollar. 

The backlog at our Cranes segment decreased approximately 20% &#32;from December 31, 2014 . This decrease over the prior year was driven mostly by lower orders of rough terrain cranes, boom trucks and utilities products, partially offset by tower cranes. Foreign exchange negatively impacted 2015 backlog by approximately 6% when compared to 2014. 

Our MHPS segment backlog decreased approximately 6% &#32;from December 31, 2014 . This decrease was primarily due to the translation effect of foreign exchange rates, with backlog up slightly on a currency neutral basis. 

Our MP segment backlog at December 31, 2015 &#32;increased approximately 6% &#32;from December 31, 2014 . This increase over the prior year was primarily due to an acquisition which expanded the MP business segment and increased the order intake levels in 2015. 

Construction segment backlog at December 31, 2015 &#32;increased approximately 6% &#32;from December 31, 2014 . This increase over &#32; the prior year was primarily due to an increase in orders for Concrete Mixer Trucks in the United States; partially offset by timing differences in order patterns for Material Handlers in Germany. 

DISTRIBUTION 

We distribute our products through a global network of dealers, rental companies, major accounts and direct sales to customers. 

AERIAL WORK PLATFORMS 

Our aerial work platform, telehandler and light tower products are distributed principally through a global network of rental companies, independent distributors and, to a lesser extent, strategic accounts. We employ sales representatives who service these channel partners from offices located throughout the world. 

CRANES 

We market our crane products globally, optimizing assorted channel marketing systems including a distribution network and a direct sales force. We have direct sales, primarily to specialized crane rental companies, in certain crane markets such as Australia, the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, Belgium, Italy, France, Scandinavia and China to offer comprehensive service and support to customers. Distribution via a distributor network is often utilized in other geographic areas, including the United States and Canada where we also sell directly to key accounts. 

We sell utility equipment to the utility and municipal markets through a direct sales effort in certain territories and through a network of independent distributors in North America. Outside of North America, independent distributors sell our utility equipment directly to customers. 

MATERIAL HANDLING &#38; PORT SOLUTIONS 

Our port equipment products are sold both directly to customers and through independent distributors to port and terminal operators and are serviced either by our service organization or independent service providers. Our material handling products are also sold directly or indirectly, via independent distributors, to our end market customers. 

MATERIALS PROCESSING 

We distribute our products through a global network of independent distributors, rental companies, major accounts and direct sales to customers. 

CONSTRUCTION 

We distribute compact construction equipment primarily through a network of independent and rental distributors throughout the world. We distribute loader backhoes and compaction rollers manufactured in India through a network of approximately 50 distributors located in India, Nepal and neighboring countries. 

We distribute material handlers primarily through a network of independent distributors throughout the world. Our distributors are predominantly independent businesses, which generally serve the construction, mining, forestry and/or scrap industries. Although these distributors may carry products from a variety of manufacturers, they generally carry only one manufacturer&#8217;s &#8220;brand&#8221; of each particular type of product. We sell concrete pavers to end user customers directly. 

We sell concrete mixer trucks primarily directly to customers and through independent distributors in certain regions of the United States and Canada. 

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND ENGINEERING 

We maintain engineering staff primarily at our manufacturing locations to conduct research, development and engineering for site-specific products. Our businesses also assess global trends to understand future needs of our customers and help us decide which technologies to implement in future development projects. In addition, our engineering center in India supports our engineering teams worldwide through new product design, existing product design improvement and development of products for local markets. Continually monitoring our materials, manufacturing and engineering costs is essential to identify possible savings, then leverage those savings to improve our competitiveness and our customers&#8217; return on investment. Our research, development and engineering expenses are primarily incurred to develop (i) additional applications and extensions of our existing product lines to meet customer needs and take advantage of growth opportunities and (ii) customer responsive enhancements and continuous cost improvements of existing products. 

Our engineering focus mirrors the business priorities of delivering customer responsive solutions, growing in developing markets, complying with evolving regulatory standards in our global markets and applying our lean manufacturing principles by standardizing products, rationalizing components and strategically aligning with select global suppliers. Our engineering teams in China and India represent our commitment to engineering products for developing markets. They take equipment technology from the developed markets and translate it to appropriate technology for developing markets using the experience and cultural understanding of engineering teams native to those markets. 

Product change driven by regulations requiring Tier 4 emissions compliance in most of our diesel engine powered machinery has been an important part of our engineering priorities over the last several years and will continue to play a role in product development programs through 2017 as we work to finalize the engine-horsepower dependent phase-in of Tier 4 regulations across our various diesel-engine equipped products. We have also focused on producing more cost-effective product solutions across various segments. 

Costs decreased in 2015 as compared to 2014 due to the completion of much of our Tier 4 conversion work, fewer project bids and the positive effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. Costs incurred to develop new products and improve existing products remained relatively flat in 2014 as compared to 2013. Research, development and engineering costs were $119.1 million , $135.5 million &#32;and $131.5 million &#32;in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. We will continue our commitment to appropriate levels of research, development and engineering spending, commensurate with our level of vertical integration, in order to meet our customer needs, uphold competitive functionality of our products and maintain regulatory compliance in all the markets that we serve.

MAJOR CUSTOMERS 

None of our customers individually accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net sales in 2015 . In 2015 , our largest customer accounted for less than 5% &#32;of our consolidated net sales and our top ten customers in the aggregate accounted for less than 18% &#32;of our consolidated net sales. 

EMPLOYEES 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 20,400 &#32;employees; including approximately 6,500 &#32;employees in the U.S. Approximately four &#32;percent of our employees in the U.S. are represented by labor unions. Outside of the U.S., we enter into employment contracts and collective agreements in those countries in which such relationships are mandatory or customary. The provisions of these agreements correspond in each case with the required or customary terms in the subject jurisdiction. We generally consider our relations with our employees to be good. 

PATENTS, LICENSES AND TRADEMARKS 

We use proprietary materials such as patents, trademarks, trade secrets and trade names in our operations and take actions to protect these rights. 

We use several significant trademarks and trade names, most notably the Terex &#174; , Genie &#174; , Demag &#174; and Powerscreen &#174; &#32;trademarks. The other trademarks and trade names that we use include registered trademarks of Terex Corporation or its subsidiaries. The Demag &#174; &#32;trademark is a registered trademark of Mannesmann Demag Krauss-Maffei GmbH which is licensed to certain Terex subsidiaries for certain products. In the fourth quarter of 2015, in connection with our annual impairment test over our indefinite-lived trademarks, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $23 million in our MHPS segment. This charge is recorded in Goodwill and intangible asset impairments in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Income. 

We have many patents that we use in connection with our operations, and most of our products contain some proprietary technology. Many of these patents and related proprietary technology are important to the production of particular products; however, overall, our patents, taken together, are not material to our business or our overall financial results. 

Currently, we are engaged in various legal proceedings with respect to intellectual property rights. While the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect, individually or in the aggregate, on our business or operating performance. For more detail, see &#8220;Item 3 &#8211; Legal Proceedings.&#8221; 

SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS 

As part of The Terex Way, we are committed to providing a safe and healthy environment for our team members, and strive to provide quality products that are safe to use and operate in an environmentally conscious and respectful manner. 

We generate hazardous and non-hazardous wastes in the normal course of our manufacturing operations. As a result, we are subject to a wide range of environmental laws and regulations. All of our employees are required to obey all applicable health, safety and environmental laws and regulations and must observe proper safety rules and environmental practices in work situations. These laws and regulations govern actions that may have adverse environmental effects, such as discharges to air and water, and require compliance with certain practices when handling and disposing of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. These laws and regulations would also impose liability for costs of, and damages resulting from, cleaning up sites, past spills, disposals and other releases of hazardous substances, should any of such events occur. We are committed to complying with these standards and monitoring our workplaces to determine if equipment, machinery and facilities meet specified safety standards. Each of our manufacturing facilities is subject to an environmental audit at least once every five years to monitor compliance and no incidents have occurred which required us to pay material amounts to comply with such laws and regulations. We are dedicated to seeing that safety and health hazards are adequately addressed through appropriate work practices, training and procedures. For example, we continue to reduce lost time injuries in the workplace and work toward a world-class level of safety practices in our industry. 

We are dedicated to product safety when designing and manufacturing our equipment. Our equipment is designed to meet all applicable laws, regulations and industry standards for use in their markets. We continually incorporate safety improvements in our products. We maintain an internal product safety team that is dedicated to improving safety and investigating and resolving any product safety issues that arise. 

The use and operation of our equipment in an environmentally conscious manner is a priority for us. We are aware of global discussions regarding climate change and the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on global warming. We are increasing our production of products that have lower greenhouse gas emissions in response to both regulatory initiatives and anticipated market demand trends. For example, starting in 2010, one of our most significant design priorities was to include Tier 4 emission compliant diesel engines in our machinery. This continued to be a priority in 2015 and will continue to play a role in our product development programs through 2017 as we move through the engine-horsepower dependent phase-in of Tier 4 regulations across our diesel-engine equipped products. We manufacture a utility truck that uses plug-in electric hybrid technology to save fuel, reduce emissions and reduce noise in residential areas. Similarly, our MHPS segment offers hybrid drive diesel-hydraulic and diesel-electric systems on certain of its port equipment products. 

Increasing laws and regulations dealing with the environmental aspects of the products we manufacture can result in significant expenditures in designing and manufacturing new forms of equipment that satisfy such new laws and regulations. Compliance with laws and regulations regarding safety and the environment has required, and will continue to require, us to make expenditures. We currently do not expect these expenditures to have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. 

FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT INDUSTRY SEGMENTS, GEOGRAPHIC AREAS AND EXPORT SALES 

Information regarding foreign and domestic operations, export sales and segment information is included in Note C &#8211; &#8220;Business Segment Information&#8221; in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

SEASONAL FACTORS 

Over the past several years, our business has become less seasonal as we have grown and diversified our product offerings and expanded the geographic reach of our products. As we enter 2016, we expect the overall economic environment will affect our sales more than historical seasonal trends. 

WORKING CAPITAL 

Our businesses are working capital intensive and require funding to purchase production and replacement parts inventories, capital expenditures to repair, replace and upgrade existing facilities, as well as finance receivables from customers and dealers. We have debt service requirements, including semi-annual interest payments on our outstanding notes and quarterly interest payments on our bank credit facility. We believe cash generated from operations, together with availability under our bank credit facility and cash on hand, provide us with adequate liquidity to meet our operating and debt service requirements. See Item 1A &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; for a detailed description of the risks resulting from our debt and our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to operate our business. We will continue to pursue cash generation opportunities, including reducing costs and working capital, reviewing alternatives for under-utilized assets, and selectively investing in our businesses to promote growth opportunities.
