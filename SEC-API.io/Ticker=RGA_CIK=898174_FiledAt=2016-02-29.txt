 Item 1. BUSINESS 

A. 

Overview 

Reinsurance Group of America, Incorporated (&#8220;RGA&#8221;) is an insurance holding company that was formed on December 31, 1992. The consolidated financial statements herein include the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of RGA and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned (collectively, the &#8220;Company&#8221;). 

The Company has grown to become a leading global provider of traditional and non-traditional life and health reinsurance with operations in the United States, Latin America, Canada, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia. Reinsurance is an arrangement under which an insurance company, the &#8220;reinsurer,&#8221; agrees to indemnify another insurance company, the &#8220;ceding company,&#8221; for all or a portion of the insurance and/or investment risks underwritten by the ceding company. Reinsurance is designed to (i) reduce the net amount at risk on individual risks, thereby enabling the ceding company to increase the volume of business it can underwrite, as well as increase the maximum risk it can underwrite on a single risk; (ii) stabilize operating results by leveling fluctuations in the ceding company&#8217;s loss experience; (iii) assist the ceding company in meeting applicable regulatory requirements; and (iv) enhance the ceding company&#8217;s financial strength and surplus position. 

The Company has geographic-based and business-based operational segments: U.S. and Latin America; Canada; Europe, Middle East and Africa; Asia Pacific; and Corporate and Other. Geographic-based operations are further segmented into traditional and non-traditional businesses. The Company&#8217;s segments primarily write reinsurance business that is wholly or partially retained in one or more of RGA&#8217;s reinsurance subsidiaries. See &#8220;Segments&#8221; for more information concerning the Company&#8217;s operating segments. 

Traditional Reinsurance 

Traditional reinsurance includes individual and group life and health, disability, and critical illness reinsurance. Life reinsurance primarily refers to reinsurance of individual or group-issued term, whole life, universal life, and joint and last survivor insurance policies. Health and disability reinsurance primarily refers to reinsurance of individual or group health policies. Critical illness reinsurance provides a benefit in the event of the diagnosis of a pre-defined critical illness. 

Traditional reinsurance is written on a facultative or automatic treaty basis. Facultative reinsurance is individually underwritten by the reinsurer for each policy to be reinsured, with the pricing and other terms established based upon rates negotiated in advance. Facultative reinsurance is normally purchased by ceding companies for medically impaired lives, unusual risks, or liabilities in excess of the binding limits specified in their automatic reinsurance treaties. 

An automatic reinsurance treaty provides that the ceding company will cede risks to a reinsurer on specified blocks of policies where the underlying policies meet the ceding company&#8217;s underwriting criteria. In contrast to facultative reinsurance, the reinsurer does not approve each individual policy being reinsured. Automatic reinsurance treaties generally provide that the reinsurer will be liable for a portion of the risk associated with the specified policies written by the ceding company. Automatic reinsurance treaties specify the ceding company&#8217;s binding limit, which is the maximum amount of risk on a given life that can be ceded automatically to the reinsurer and that the reinsurer must accept. The binding limit may be stated either as a multiple of the ceding company&#8217;s retention or as a stated dollar amount. 

Facultative and automatic reinsurance may be written as yearly renewable term, coinsurance, modified coinsurance or coinsurance with funds withheld. Under a yearly renewable term treaty, the reinsurer assumes primarily the mortality or morbidity risk. Under a coinsurance arrangement, depending upon the terms of the contract, the reinsurer may share in the risk of loss due to mortality or morbidity, lapses, and the investment risk, if any, inherent in the underlying policy. Modified coinsurance and coinsurance with funds withheld differs from coinsurance in that the assets supporting the reserves are retained by the ceding company. 

Generally, the amount of life and health reinsurance ceded is stated on an excess or a quota share basis. Reinsurance on an excess basis covers amounts in excess of an agreed-upon retention limit. Retention limits vary by ceding company and also may vary by the age or underwriting classification of the insured, the product, and other factors. Under quota share reinsurance, the ceding company states its retention in terms of a fixed percentage of the risk with the remainder to be ceded to one or more reinsurers up to the maximum binding limit. 

Reinsurance agreements, whether facultative or automatic, may include recapture rights, which permit the ceding company to reassume all or a portion of the risk formerly ceded to the reinsurer after an agreed-upon period of time (generally 10 years) or in some cases due to changes in the financial condition or ratings of the reinsurer. Recapture of business previously ceded does not affect premiums ceded prior to the recapture of such business, but would reduce premiums in subsequent periods. The potential adverse effects of recapture rights are mitigated by the following factors: (i) recapture rights vary by treaty and the risk of recapture is a factor that is considered when pricing a reinsurance agreement; (ii) ceding companies generally may exercise their recapture rights only to the extent they have increased their retention limits for the reinsured policies; and (iii) ceding companies generally must recapture all of the policies eligible for recapture under the agreement in a particular year if any are recaptured (which prevents 

a ceding company from recapturing only the most profitable policies). In addition, when a ceding company recaptures reinsured policies, the reinsurer releases the reserves it maintained to support the recaptured portion of the policies. 

Non-Traditional Reinsurance 

Non-traditional reinsurance includes longevity reinsurance, asset-intensive reinsurance, and financial reinsurance. 

Longevity Reinsurance 

In many countries, companies are increasingly interested in reducing their exposure to longevity risk related to the retirement benefits promised to staff. This concern comes from both the absolute size of the risk and also through the volatility that changes in life expectancy can have on their reported earnings. In addition, insurance companies that offer lifetime annuities are seeking ways to manage their current exposure, while also recognizing the potential to take on more risk from employers and individuals. 

The Company has entered into transactions on existing longevity business for clients in Europe and Canada. These have been arrangements with traditional insurance companies, as well as customized arrangements for banks dealing with pension schemes. In addition, the Company has acquired a closed block of longevity business in the U.S. 

Asset-Intensive Reinsurance 

Asset-intensive reinsurance refers to the full-risk coinsurance of annuities or reinsurance that has a significant investment component. Asset-intensive reinsurance allows the Company&#8217;s clients to take advantage of growth opportunities that might otherwise not be available due to restrictions on available capital or concerns about the size of the investment risk on their balance sheets. 

An ongoing partnership with clients is important with asset-intensive reinsurance because of the active management involved in this type of reinsurance. This active management includes investment decisions, investment and claims management, and the determination of non-guaranteed elements. Some examples of the reinsurance offered by asset-intensive reinsurance are: fixed deferred annuities, indexed annuities, unit-linked variable annuities, universal life corporate-owned life insurance and bank-owned life insurance, unit-linked variable life, immediate/payout annuities, whole life, disabled life reserves, and extended term insurance. 

Financial Reinsurance 

Financial reinsurance primarily involves assisting ceding companies in meeting applicable regulatory requirements by enhancing the ceding companies&#8217; financial strength and regulatory surplus position. Financial reinsurance transactions do not qualify as reinsurance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;), due to the low-risk nature of the transactions. These transactions are reported in accordance with deposit accounting guidelines. 

B. 

Corporate Structure 

RGA is an insurance holding company, the principal assets of which consist of the common stock of Reinsurance Company of Missouri, Incorporated (&#8220;RCM&#8221;), RGA Americas Reinsurance Company, Ltd. (&#8220;RGA Americas&#8221;), RGA Reinsurance Company (Barbados) Ltd. (&#8220;RGA Barbados&#8221;), RGA International Reinsurance Company Limited (&#8220;RGA International&#8221;) and RGA Reinsurance Company of Australia Limited ("RGA Australia") as well as several other subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned. Potential sources of funds for RGA to pay stockholder dividends and to fund debt service obligations are dividends and interest paid to RGA by its subsidiaries, securities maintained in its investment portfolio, and proceeds from securities offerings and borrowings. RCM&#8217;s primary sources of funds are dividend distributions paid by its subsidiary, RGA Reinsurance Company (&#8220;RGA Reinsurance&#8221;), whose principal source of funds is derived from current operations. RGA Americas&#8217; primary sources of funds are dividend distributions paid by its subsidiaries, RGA Life Reinsurance Company of Canada (&#8220;RGA Canada&#8221;), RGA Atlantic Reinsurance Company Ltd. (&#8220;RGA Atlantic&#8221;) and RGA Reinsurance Company of South Africa, Limited ("RGA South Africa"), whose principal source of funds is derived from current operations. Dividends paid by RGA&#8217;s reinsurance subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions of the respective governing bodies where each reinsurance subsidiary is domiciled. 

Ratings 

Insurer financial strength ratings, sometimes referred to as claims paying ratings, represent the opinions of rating agencies regarding the financial ability of an insurance company to meet its obligations under an insurance policy. The Company&#8217;s insurer financial strength ratings as of the date of this filing are listed in the table below for each rating agency that meets with the Company&#8217;s management on a regular basis. As of the date of this filing, all ratings listed below are on stable outlook.

A Moody&#8217;s Investors Service (&#8220;Moody&#8217;s&#8221;) insurer financial strength rating of &#8220;A1&#8221; (good) is the fifth highest rating out of twenty-one possible ratings and indicates that Moody&#8217;s believes the insurance company offers good financial security; however, elements may be present which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future. 

(3) 

A Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s (&#8220;S&#38;P&#8221;) insurer financial strength rating of &#8220;AA-&#8221; (very strong) is the fourth highest rating out of twenty-one possible ratings. According to S&#38;P&#8217;s rating scale, a rating of &#8220;AA-&#8221; means that, in S&#38;P&#8217;s opinion, the insurer has very strong financial security characteristics. 

The ability to write reinsurance partially depends on a reinsurer&#8217;s financial condition and its financial strength ratings. These ratings are based on a company&#8217;s ability to pay policyholder obligations and are not directed toward the protection of investors. A ratings downgrade could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s ability to compete. See Item 1A &#8211; &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; for more on the potential effects of a ratings downgrade.

RGA Reinsurance, RGA Americas, Aurora National, RGA Global and RGA International are also subject to regulations in the other jurisdictions in which they are licensed or authorized to do business. Insurance laws and regulations, among other things, establish minimum capital requirements and limit the amount of dividends, distributions, and intercompany payments affiliates can make without regulatory approval. Additionally, insurance laws and regulations impose restrictions on the amounts and types of investments that insurance companies may hold. In addition, new standards to be imposed upon European insurers by Solvency II, revisions to the insurance laws of Bermuda similar to Solvency II, changes to regulations in Canada and revisions 

to the insurance holding company laws in the U.S. and other jurisdictions could, in the near future, affect RGA Americas, RGA International, RGA Global, RGA Canada, RGA Reinsurance and other subsidiaries, and the clients of each to varying degrees. 

U.S. Regulation 

Insurance Regulation 

The insurance laws and regulations, as well as the level of supervisory authority that may be exercised by the various state insurance departments, vary by jurisdiction. These laws and regulations generally grant broad powers to supervisory agencies or regulators to examine and supervise insurance companies and insurance holding companies with respect to every significant aspect of the conduct of the insurance business. This includes the power to pre-approve the execution of approval or modification of contractual arrangements. These laws and regulations generally require insurance companies to meet certain solvency standards and asset tests, to maintain minimum standards of business conduct, and to file certain reports with regulatory authorities, including information concerning their capital structure, ownership, and financial condition; and subject insurers to potential assessments for amounts paid by guarantee funds. RGA Reinsurance, Chesterfield Re and RCM are subject to the state of Missouri&#8217;s adoption of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (&#8220;NAIC&#8221;) Model Audit Rule which requires an insurer to have an annual audit by an independent certified public accountant, provide an annual management report of internal control over financial reporting, file the resulting reports with the Director of Insurance and maintain an audit committee. Aurora National is subject to similar regulation by the State of California. Moreover, Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Acts in the United States permit the Missouri regulator to request and consider, in its regulation of the solvency of and capital standards for RGA Reinsurance, Chesterfield Re and RCM and the California regulator to request and consider, in its regulation of the solvency of and capital standards for Aurora National, information about the operations of other subsidiaries of RGA and the extent to which there may be deemed to exist contagion risk posed by those operations. In addition, RGA is subject of a supervisory college which involves regular meetings of the insurance regulators of the reinsurance entities of RGA. These regular meetings bring about additional questions and perhaps even limitations on some of the activities of the reinsurance company subsidiaries of RGA. 

RGA&#8217;s reinsurance subsidiaries are required to file statutory financial statements in each jurisdiction in which they are licensed and may be subject to periodic examinations by the insurance regulators of the jurisdictions in which each is licensed, authorized, or accredited. To date, none of the regulators&#8217; reports related to the Company&#8217;s periodic examinations have contained material adverse findings. 

Although some of the rates and policy terms of U.S. direct insurance agreements are regulated by state insurance departments, the rates, policy terms, and conditions of reinsurance agreements generally are not subject to regulation by any regulatory authority. The same is true outside of the U.S. In the U.S., however, the NAIC Model Law on Credit for Reinsurance, which has been adopted in most states, imposes certain requirements for an insurer to take reserve credit for risk ceded to a reinsurer. Generally, the reinsurer is required to be licensed or accredited in the insurer&#8217;s state of domicile, or post security for reserves transferred to the reinsurer in the form of letters of credit or assets placed in trust. The NAIC Life and Health Reinsurance Agreements Model Regulation, which has been passed in most states, imposes additional requirements for insurers to claim reserve credit for reinsurance ceded (excluding yearly renewable term reinsurance and non-proportional reinsurance). These requirements include bona fide risk transfer, an insolvency clause, written agreements, and filing of reinsurance agreements involving in force business, among other things. Outside of the U.S., rules for reinsurance and requirements for minimum risk transfer are less specific and are less likely to be published as rules, but nevertheless standards can be imposed to varying extents. 

U.S. Valuation of Life Policies Model Regulation (commonly referred to as Regulation XXX), implemented in the U.S. for various types of life insurance business, significantly increased the level of reserves that U.S. life insurance and life reinsurance companies must hold on their statutory financial statements for various types of life insurance business, primarily certain level premium term life products. The reserve levels required under Regulation XXX are normally in excess of reserves required under GAAP. In situations where primary insurers have reinsured business to reinsurers that are unlicensed and unaccredited in the U.S., the reinsurer must provide collateral equal to its reinsurance reserves in order for the ceding company to receive statutory financial statement credit. Reinsurers have historically utilized letters of credit for the benefit of the ceding company, or have placed assets in trust for the benefit of the ceding company, or have used other structures as the primary forms of collateral. 

RGA Reinsurance is the primary subsidiary of the Company subject to Regulation XXX. In order to manage the effect of Regulation XXX on its statutory financial statements, RGA Reinsurance has retroceded a majority of Regulation XXX reserves to unaffiliated and affiliated unlicensed reinsurers and special purpose reinsurers, or captives. RGA Reinsurance&#8217;s statutory capital may be significantly reduced if the unaffiliated or affiliated reinsurer is unable to provide the required collateral to support RGA Reinsurance&#8217;s statutory reserve credits and RGA Reinsurance cannot find an alternative source for the collateral. New NAIC requirements for life insurers using special purpose reinsures are now in place. While RGA Reinsurance&#8217;s current reserve financing arrangements using special purpose reinsurers or &#8220;captive reinsurers&#8221; are permitted to remain in place, the new rules will place limitations on RGA Reinsurance&#8217;s ability to utilize captive reinsurers to finance reserve growth related to future business. Such limitations could cause the Company to utilize alternative financing methods, which may be more expensive than financing methods used in the past. 

RGA Reinsurance, Chesterfield Re, Parkway Re, Rockwood Re, Castlewood Re and RCM prepare statutory financial statements in conformity with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the State of Missouri. Timberlake Re prepares statutory financial statements in conformity with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the State of South Carolina. Aurora National prepares its statutory financial statements in conformity with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the State of California. Each of these states require domestic insurance companies to prepare their statutory financial statements in accordance with the NAIC Accounting Practices and Procedures manual subject to any deviations permitted by each state&#8217;s insurance commissioner. The Company&#8217;s non-U.S. subsidiaries are subject to the regulations and reporting requirements of their respective countries of domicile. 

Based on the growth of the Company&#8217;s business and the pattern of reserve levels under Regulation XXX associated with term life business and other statutory reserve requirements, the amount of ceded reserve credits is expected to grow. This growth will require the Company to obtain additional letters of credit, put additional assets in trust, or utilize other funding mechanisms to support reserve credits. If the Company is unable to support the reserve credits, the regulatory capital levels of several of its subsidiaries may be significantly reduced, while the regulatory capital requirements for these subsidiaries would not change. The reduction in regulatory capital would not directly affect the Company&#8217;s consolidated shareholders&#8217; equity under GAAP; however, it could affect the Company&#8217;s ability to write new business and retain existing business. 

Affiliated captives are commonly used in the insurance industry to help manage statutory reserve and collateral requirements and are often domiciled in the same state as the insurance company that sponsors the captive. The NAIC has analyzed the insurance industry&#8217;s use of affiliated captive reinsurers to satisfy certain reserve requirements and has adopted measures to promote uniformity in both the approval and supervision of such reinsurers. New standards to address the use of captive reinurers have been introduced. There is a commitment to allowing current captives to continue in accordance with their currently approved plans. State insurance regulators that regulate the Company&#8217;s domestic insurance companies have placed restrictions on the use of newly established captive reinsurers which pose to make them less effective. Depending on how the new standards are ultimately applied and whether additional restrictions are introduced, the Company&#8217;s ability to reinsure certain products, maintain risk based capital ratios and deploy excess capital could be adversely affected. As a result, the Company may need to alter the type and volume of business it reinsures, increase prices on those products, raise additional capital to support higher regulatory reserves or implement higher cost strategies, all of which could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s competitive position and its results of operations. 

More changes in the use and regulation of captives may also be adopted, but it is too early to predict the extent of any changes that may be made. Accordingly, the Company is reevaluating and anticipates adjusting its strategy of using captives to enhance its capital efficiency and competitive position while it monitors the regulations related to captives and any proposed changes in such regulations. The Company cannot estimate the impact of discontinuing or altering its captive strategy in response to potential regulatory changes due to many unknown variables, such as the cost and availability of alternative capital, potential changes in regulatory reserving requirements under a principle-based reserving approach, which would likely reduce required collateral, changes in acceptable collateral for statutory reserves, the introduction of the &#8220;certified reinsurer&#8221; laws and regulations in certain United States jurisdictions where the Company operates, the potential for increased pricing of products offered by the Company and the potential change in mix of products sold and/or offered by the Company and/or its clients. 

In the United States, the introduction of the certified reinsurer has provided an alternative way to manage collateral requirements. In 2014, RGA Americas was designated as a certified reinsurer by the Missouri Department of Insurance, Financial Institutions and Professional Registration (&#8220;MDI&#8221;). This designation allows the Company to retrocede business to RGA Americas in lieu of using captives for collateral requirements. 

Reinsurers may place assets in trust to satisfy collateral requirements for certain treaties. In addition, the Company holds securities in trust to satisfy collateral requirements under certain third-party reinsurance treaties. Under certain conditions, the Company may be obligated to move reinsurance from one subsidiary of RGA to another subsidiary or make payments under a given treaty. These conditions include change in control or ratings of the subsidiary, insolvency, nonperformance under a treaty, or loss of the subsidiary&#8217;s reinsurance license. If the Company is ever required to perform under these obligations, the risk to the consolidated company under the reinsurance treaties would not change; however, additional capital may be required due to the change in jurisdiction of the subsidiary reinsuring the business and may create a strain on liquidity, possibly causing a reduction in dividend payments or hampering the Company&#8217;s ability to write new business or retain existing business. 

Capital Requirements 

Risk-Based Capital (&#8220;RBC&#8221;) guidelines promulgated by the NAIC are applicable to RGA Reinsurance, RCM, Aurora National and Chesterfield Re, and identify minimum capital requirements based upon business levels and asset mix. RGA Reinsurance, RCM, Aurora National and Chesterfield Re maintain capital levels in excess of the amounts required by the applicable guidelines. Timberlake Re, Parkway Re, Rockwood Re and Castlewood Re&#8217;s capital requirements are determined solely by their licensing orders issued by their states of domicile. Pursuant to its licensing order issued by the South Carolina Department of Insurance, Timberlake Re only calculates RBC as a means of demonstrating its ability to pay principal and interest on its surplus 

note issued to Timberlake Financial, L.L.C. ("Timberlake Financial"). It is not otherwise subject to the RBC guidelines. Similarly, Parkway Re, Rockwood Re and Castlewood Re are not subject to the requirements of the NAIC&#8217;s RBC guidelines. Regulations in international jurisdictions also require certain minimum capital levels, and subject the companies operating there to oversight by the applicable regulatory bodies. RGA&#8217;s subsidiaries meet the minimum capital requirements in their respective jurisdictions. The Company cannot predict the effect that any proposed or future legislation or rulemaking in the countries in which it operates may have on the financial condition or operations of the Company or its subsidiaries. 

Insurance Holding Company Regulations 

RGA Reinsurance, Chesterfield Re, Parkway Re, Rockwood Re, Castlewood Re and RCM are subject to regulation under the insurance and insurance holding company statutes of Missouri. Aurora National is subject to regulation under the insurance and insurance holding company statutes of California. These insurance holding company laws and regulations generally require insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries of insurance holding companies to register and file with the home state regulator, certain reports describing, among other information, their capital structure, ownership, financial condition, certain intercompany transactions, and general business operations. The insurance holding company statutes and regulations also require prior approval of, or in certain circumstances, prior notice to the home state regulator of certain material intercompany transfers of assets, as well as certain transactions between insurance companies, their parent companies and affiliates. 

Under current Missouri and California insurance laws and regulations, unless (i) certain filings are made with the home state regulator, (ii) certain requirements are met, including a public hearing, and (iii) approval or exemption is granted by the home state regulator, no person may acquire any voting security or security convertible into a voting security of an insurance holding company, such as RGA, which controls a domestic insurance company, or merge with such an insurance holding company, if as a result of such transaction such person would &#8220;control&#8221; the insurance holding company. &#8220;Control&#8221; is presumed to exist under Missouri law if a person directly or indirectly owns or controls 10% or more of the voting securities of another person. Revisions to the insurance holding company standards of Missouri and California require greater disclosure to regulators of matters within the RGA group of companies. 

Restrictions on Dividends and Distributions 

Current Missouri law, applicable to RCM, and its subsidiaries, RGA Reinsurance and Chesterfield Re, permits the payment of dividends or distributions which, together with dividends or distributions paid during the preceding twelve months, do not exceed the greater of (i) 10% of statutory capital and surplus as of the preceding December 31, or (ii) statutory net gain from operations for the preceding calendar year. Any proposed dividend in excess of this amount is considered an &#8220;extraordinary dividend&#8221; and may not be paid until it has been approved, or a 30-day waiting period has passed during which it has not been disapproved, by the Director of the MDI. Additionally, dividends may be paid only to the extent the insurer has unassigned surplus (as opposed to contributed surplus). Pursuant to these regulatory restrictions, the allowable dividends without prior approval in 2016 for RGA Reinsurance are approximately $150.3 million . Any dividends paid by RGA Reinsurance would be paid to RCM, which in turn has the ability to pay dividends to RGA. Chesterfield Re would pay dividends to its immediate parent Chesterfield Financial Holdings LLC, ("Chesterfield Financial"), which would in turn pay dividends to RCM, subject to the terms of the indenture for the embedded value securitization transaction, in which Chesterfield Financial cannot declare or pay any dividends so long as any private placement notes are outstanding. Chesterfield Re is also subject to certain requirements and restrictions on the payment of dividends pursuant to an agreement with its parent, Chesterfield Financial. The MDI allows RCM to pay a dividend to RGA to the extent RCM received the dividend from RGA Reinsurance, without limitation related to the level of unassigned surplus. Historically, RGA has not relied upon dividends from its subsidiaries to fund its obligations. However, the regulatory limitations and other restrictions described here could limit the Company&#8217;s financial flexibility in the future should it choose to or need to use subsidiary dividends as a funding source for its obligations. 

The California Insurance Holding Company Act defines an extraordinary dividend, consistent with the definition found in the Missouri Insurance Holding Company Act and imposes an identical restriction upon the ability of Aurora National to pay dividends to RGA Reinsurance. In contrast to both the Missouri and the California Insurance Holding Company Acts, the NAIC Model Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act defines an extraordinary dividend as a dividend or distribution which, together with dividends or distributions paid during the preceding twelve months, exceeds the lesser of (i) 10% of statutory capital and surplus as of the preceding December 31, or (ii) statutory net gain from operations for the preceding calendar year. The Company is unable to predict whether, when, or if, Missouri will enact a new measure for extraordinary dividends. 

Missouri insurance laws and regulations also require that the statutory surplus of Chesterfield Re, RCM and RGA Reinsurance following any dividend or distribution be reasonable in relation to their outstanding liabilities and adequate to meet their financial needs. The Director of the MDI may call for a rescission of the payment of a dividend or distribution by Chesterfield Re, RGA Reinsurance or RCM that would cause their statutory surplus to be inadequate under the standards of the Missouri insurance regulations. California insurance laws and regulations impose the same scheme on Aurora National as to the dividends or distributions that are made. 

Pursuant to the South Carolina Director of Insurance, Timberlake Re may declare dividends subject to a minimum Total Adjusted Capital threshold, as defined by the NAIC&#8217;s RBC regulation. As of December 31, 2015 , Timberlake Re met the minimum required threshold. Any dividends paid by Timberlake Re would be paid to Timberlake Financial, which in turn is subject to contractual limitations on the amount of dividends it can pay to RCM. 

Dividend payments from other subsidiaries are subject to the regulations in the country of domicile, which are generally based on their earnings and/or capital level. 

Default or Liquidation 

In the event that RGA defaults on any of its debt or other obligations, or becomes the subject of bankruptcy, liquidation, or reorganization proceedings, the creditors and stockholders of RGA will have no right to proceed against the assets of any of the subsidiaries of RGA. If any of RGA&#8217;s reinsurance subsidiaries were to be liquidated or dissolved, the liquidation or dissolution would be conducted in accordance with the rules and regulations of the appropriate governing body in the state or country of the subsidiary&#8217;s domicile. The creditors of any such reinsurance company, including, without limitation, holders of its reinsurance agreements and state guaranty associations (if applicable), would be entitled to payment in full from such assets before RGA, as a direct or indirect stockholder, would be entitled to receive any distributions or other payments from the remaining assets of the liquidated or dissolved subsidiary. 

Federal Regulation 

With enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act during 2010, discussions will continue in the Congress of the United States concerning the future of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, which exempts the &#8220;business of insurance&#8221; from most federal laws, including anti-trust laws, to the extent such business is subject to state regulation. With the McCarran-Ferguson Act exemption for the business of insurance, a reinsurer may set rate, underwriting and claims handling standards for its ceding company clients to follow. Judicial decisions narrowing the definition of what constitutes the &#8220;business of insurance&#8221; and repeal or modification of the McCarran-Ferguson Act may limit the ability of the Company, and RGA Reinsurance in particular, to share information with respect to matters such as rate setting, underwriting, and claims management. Likewise, discussions may again resume in the Congress of the United States concerning potential future regulation of insurance and reinsurance at the Federal level. It is not possible to predict the effect of such decisions or changes in the law on the operation of the Company, but it is now more likely than in the past that insurance or reinsurance may be regulated at the Federal level in the U.S. Additionally, new credit for reinsurance rules in the U.S. allowing for collateral reduction has the potential to allow foreign competitors to provide reinsurance to U.S. insurers with reduced collateral requirements. This may ultimately lower the cost at which RGA Reinsurance&#8217;s competitors are able to provide reinsurance to U.S. insurers. In addition, the vesting of authority in the U.S. Federal Reserve to review the solvency of certain financial institutions deemed systemically important could impose an additional layer of solvency regulation upon selected insurers and reinsurers. While it is not expected that any RGA entity would be deemed to be systemically important and become the subject to this additional scrutiny, three of RGA Reinsurance&#8217;s large U.S. clients have been given the designation subjecting the client&#8217;s reinsurance programs to scrutiny by the Federal Reserve. It is possible that more of RGA's clients will be given this designation leading to additional scrutiny of those client's reinsurance programs by the Federal Reserve. 

Environmental Considerations 

Federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations apply to the Company&#8217;s ownership and operation of real property. Inherent in owning and operating real property are the risks of hidden environmental liabilities and the costs of any required clean-up. Under the laws of certain states, contamination of a property may give rise to a lien on the property to secure recovery of the costs of clean-up. In several states, this lien has priority over the lien of an existing mortgage against such property. In addition, in some states and under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (&#8220;CERCLA&#8221;), the Company may be liable, in certain circumstances, as an &#8220;owner&#8221; or &#8220;operator,&#8221; for costs of cleaning-up releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances at a property mortgaged to it. The Company also risks environmental liability when it forecloses on a property mortgaged to it, although Federal legislation provides for a safe harbor from CERCLA liability for secured lenders that foreclose and sell the mortgaged real estate, provided that certain requirements are met. However, there are circumstances in which actions taken could still expose the Company to CERCLA liability. Application of various other federal and state environmental laws could also result in the imposition of liability on the Company for costs associated with environmental hazards. 

The Company routinely conducts environmental assessments prior to taking title to real estate through foreclosure on real estate collateralizing mortgages that it holds. Although unexpected environmental liabilities can always arise, the Company seeks to minimize this risk by undertaking these environmental assessments and complying with its internal procedures, and as a result, the Company believes that any costs associated with compliance with environmental laws and regulations or any clean-up of properties would not have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s results of operations. 

International Regulation 

RGA&#8217;s international insurance operations are principally regulated by insurance regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they are located or operate branch offices. The regulation includes minimum capital, solvency and governance requirements. The authority of RGA&#8217;s international operations to conduct business is subject to licensing requirements, inspections and approvals and these authorizations are subject to modification and revocation. Periodic examinations of the insurance company books and records, financial reporting requirements, risk management processes and governance procedures are among the techniques used by regulators to supervise RGA&#8217;s non-U.S. insurance businesses. The regulators of RGA&#8217;s non-U.S. insurance companies and the California Department of Insurance, are also invited to be part of the supervisory college held by the Missouri Department of Insurance, RGA&#8217;s group supervisor. 

Much like the adoption of Dodd-Frank in the U.S., regulators around the world are reviewing the causes of the 2008 - 2009 financial crisis and considering ways to avoid similar problems in the future. A group leading this effort is the Financial Stability Board (&#8220;FSB&#8221;). The FSB consists of representatives of national financial authorities of the G20 nations. The G20 and the FSB and related governmental bodies have developed proposals to address issues such as group supervision, capital and solvency standards, systemic economic risk, corporate governance, including executive compensation and many other related issues associated with the financial crisis. At the direction of the FSB, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (&#8220;IAIS&#8221;) is developing a model framework for the supervision of internationally active insurance groups (&#8220;IAIG&#8217;s&#8221;) that contemplates &#8220;group-wide supervision&#8221; across national boundaries. RGA anticipates that it may, in future years, be designated an IAIG bringing about requirements for RGA to conduct a group-wide risk and solvency assessment to monitor and manage its overall solvency. At this time RGA cannot predict what additional capital requirements, compliance costs or other burdens these requirements would impose on it, if adopted. There is also the potential for inconsistent or conflicting regulation of the RGA group of companies as lawmakers and regulators in multiple simultaneously pursue these initiatives. 

Additionally, RGA International, operating in the European Economic Area (&#8220;EEA&#8221;), is subject to the Solvency II measures developed by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority and will be required to abide by the evolving risk management practices, capital standards and disclosure requirements of the Solvency II framework. Additionally, the Company&#8217;s clients located in the EEA will need to abide by these standards in operating their insurance businesses, including the management of their ceded reinsurance. Currently, insurers and reinsurers located in the EEA are operating under Solvency II. The Company expects Solvency II to have a significant influence on not only the regulation of solvency measures applied to insurers and reinsurers operating within the EEA, but the Company also expects the solvency regulation measures to influence future regulatory structures of countries outside of the EEA, including China and Japan. Influences of the Solvency II - type framework are already present in the insurance regulation of Bermuda and currently influence the solvency measures imposed upon RGA Global and RGA Americas. 

New and proposed restrictions in many Asian countries on RGA&#8217;s ability to transfer data from one country to another also threaten to make its operations less efficient. Many of these restrictions either do not anticipate the processing of data for reinsurance purposes at all or place costly restrictions on the ability of a reinsurer to service its business by requiring processing to be done within the borders of the country in which the insured consumer resides. 

Additionally, requirements proposed or becoming effective in Indonesia and India limit the amount of insurance business that can be ceded to reinsurers not domiciled in those countries. These forced localization requirements have the impact of limiting the amount of reinsurance business RGA can conduct in those countries without the participation of a local reinsurer. 

RGA expects the scope and extent of regulation outside of the U.S., as well as group regulatory oversight generally, to continue to increase. 

Underwriting 

Automatic . The Company&#8217;s management determines whether to write automatic reinsurance business by considering many factors, including the types of risks to be covered; the ceding company&#8217;s retention limit and binding authority, product, and pricing assumptions; and the ceding company&#8217;s underwriting standards, financial strength and distribution systems. For automatic business, the Company ensures that the underwriting standards, procedures and guidelines of its ceding companies are priced appropriately and consistent with the Company&#8217;s expectations. To this end, the Company conducts periodic reviews of the ceding companies&#8217; underwriting and claims personnel and procedures. 

Facultative. &#32;The Company has developed underwriting policies, procedures and standards with the objective of controlling the quality of business written as well as its pricing. The Company&#8217;s underwriting process emphasizes close collaboration between its underwriting, actuarial, and administration departments. Management periodically updates these underwriting policies, procedures, and standards to account for changing industry conditions, market developments, and changes occurring in the field of medical technology. These policies, procedures, and standards are documented in electronic underwriting manuals made available to all the Company&#8217;s underwriters. The Company regularly performs internal reviews of both its underwriters and underwriting process. 

The Company&#8217;s management determines whether to accept facultative reinsurance business on a prospective insured by reviewing the application, medical information and other underwriting information appropriate to the age of the prospective insured and the face amount of the application. An assessment of medical and financial history follows with decisions based on underwriting knowledge, manual review and consultation with the Company&#8217;s medical directors as necessary. Many facultative applications involve individuals with multiple medical impairments, such as heart disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes, which require a complex underwriting/mortality assessment. The Company employs medical directors and medical consultants to assist its underwriters in making these assessments. 

Pricing 

Automatic and Facultative. &#32;The Company has pricing actuaries dedicated in every geographic market and in every product category who develop reinsurance treaty rates following the Company&#8217;s policies, procedures and standards. Biometric assumptions are based primarily on the Company&#8217;s own mortality, morbidity and persistency experience, reflecting industry and client-specific experience. Economic and asset-related pricing assumptions are based on current and long-term market conditions and are developed by actuarial and investment personnel with appropriate experience and expertise. Management has established a high-level oversight of the processes and results of these activities, which includes peer reviews in every market as well as centralized procedures and processes for reviewing and auditing pricing activities. 

Operations 

Generally, the Company&#8217;s business has been obtained directly, rather than through brokers. The Company has an experienced sales and marketing staff that works to provide responsive service and maintain existing relationships. 

The Company&#8217;s administration, auditing, valuation and finance departments are responsible for treaty compliance auditing, financial analysis of results, generation of internal management reports, and periodic audits of administrative and underwriting practices. A significant effort is focused on periodic audits of administrative and underwriting practices, and treaty compliance of clients. 

The Company&#8217;s claims departments review and verify reinsurance claims, obtain the information necessary to evaluate claims, and arrange for timely claims payments. Claims are subjected to a detailed review process to ensure that the risk was properly ceded, the claim complies with the contract provisions, and the ceding company is current in the payment of reinsurance premiums to the Company. In addition, the claims departments monitor both specific claims and the overall claims handling procedures of ceding companies. 

Customer Base 

The Company provides reinsurance products primarily to the largest life insurance companies in the world. In 2015 , the Company&#8217;s five largest clients generated approximately $1,894.3 million or 20.1% of the Company&#8217;s gross premiums. In addition, 19 other clients each generated annual gross premiums of $100.0 million or more, and the aggregate gross premiums from these clients represented approximately 34.0% of the Company&#8217;s gross premiums. No individual client generated 10% or more of the Company&#8217;s total gross premiums. For the purpose of this disclosure, companies that are within the same insurance holding company structure are combined. 

Competition 

Reinsurers compete on the basis of many factors, including financial strength, pricing and other terms and conditions of reinsurance agreements, reputation, service, and experience in the types of business underwritten. The Company&#8217;s competition includes other reinsurance companies as well as other providers of financial services. The Company believes that its primary competitors on a global basis are currently the following, or their affiliates: Munich Re, Swiss Re, Hannover Re and SCOR Global Re. In addition, the Company competes with Pacific Life Re, Prudential Financial and a number of other financial service providers on annuity block business. However, within the reinsurance industry, the competitors can change from year to year. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , the Company had 2,201 employees located throughout the world. None of these employees are represented by a labor union. 

&#160;

Segments 

The Company obtains substantially all of its revenues through reinsurance agreements that cover a portfolio of life and health insurance products, including term life, credit life, universal life, whole life, group life and health, joint and last survivor insurance, critical illness, disability, longevity as well as asset-intensive (e.g., annuities) and financial reinsurance. Generally, the Company, through various subsidiaries, has provided reinsurance for mortality, morbidity, and lapse risks associated with such products. With respect to asset-intensive products, the Company has also provided reinsurance for investment-related risks. 

The following table sets forth the Company&#8217;s premiums attributable to each of its segments for the periods indicated on both a gross assumed basis and net of premiums ceded to third parties:

Reinsurance business in force reflects the addition or acquisition of new life reinsurance business, offset by terminations (e.g., life and group contract terminations, lapses of underlying policies, deaths of insureds, and recapture), changes in foreign currency exchange, and any other changes in the amount of insurance in force. As a result of terminations and other changes, assumed in force amounts at risk of $439.4 billion, $428.4 billion, and $408.1 billion were released in 2015, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. 

Additional information regarding the operations of the Company&#8217;s segments and geographic operations is contained in Note 15 &#8211; &#8220;Segment Information&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

U.S. and Latin America Operations 

The U.S. and Latin America operations represented 56.3%, 54.7% and 55.5% of the Company&#8217;s net premiums in 2015, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. The U.S. and Latin America operations market traditional life and health reinsurance, reinsurance of asset-intensive products, and financial reinsurance, primarily to large U.S. life insurance companies. 

Traditional Reinsurance 

The U.S. and Latin America Traditional segment provides life and health reinsurance to domestic clients for a variety of products through yearly renewable term agreements, coinsurance, and modified coinsurance. This business has been accepted under many different rate scales, with rates often tailored to suit the underlying product and the needs of the ceding company. Premiums typically vary for smokers and non-smokers, males and females, and may include a preferred underwriting class discount. Reinsurance premiums are paid in accordance with the treaty, regardless of the premium mode for the underlying primary insurance. This business is made up of facultative and automatic treaty business. 

Automatic business is generated pursuant to treaties which generally require that the underlying policies meet the ceding company&#8217;s underwriting criteria, although in certain cases such policies may be rated substandard. In contrast to facultative reinsurance, reinsurers do not engage in underwriting assessments of each risk assumed through an automatic treaty. 

As the Company does not apply its underwriting standards to each policy ceded to it under automatic treaties, the U.S. and Latin America operations generally require ceding companies to retain a portion of the business written on an automatic basis, thereby increasing the ceding companies&#8217; incentives to underwrite risks with due care and, when appropriate, to contest claims diligently. 

The U.S. and Latin America facultative reinsurance operation involves the assessment of the risks inherent in (i) multiple impairments, such as heart disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes; (ii) cases involving large policy face amounts; and (iii) financial risk cases (i.e. cases involving policies disproportionately large in relation to the financial characteristics of the proposed insured). The U.S. and Latin America operations&#8217; marketing efforts have focused on developing facultative relationships with client companies because management believes facultative reinsurance represents a substantial segment of the reinsurance activity of many large insurance companies and also serves as an effective means of expanding the U.S. and Latin America operations&#8217; automatic business. In 2015, 2014 and 2013 , approximately 19.9%, 19.9%, and 20.3%, respectively, of the U.S. and Latin America gross premiums were written on a facultative basis. 

Only a portion of approved facultative applications ultimately result in reinsurance, as applicants for impaired risk policies often submit applications to several primary insurers, which in turn seek facultative reinsurance from several reinsurers. Ultimately, only one insurance company and one reinsurer are likely to obtain the business. The Company tracks the percentage of declined and placed facultative applications on a client-by-client basis and generally works with clients to seek to maintain such percentages at levels deemed acceptable. As the Company applies its underwriting standards to each application submitted to it facultatively, it generally does not require ceding companies to retain a portion of the underlying risk when business is written on a facultative basis. 

In addition, several of the Company&#8217;s U.S. and Latin America clients have purchased life insurance policies insuring the lives of their executives. These policies have generally been issued to fund deferred compensation plans and have been reinsured with the Company. The Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheets included interest-sensitive contract liabilities of $2.2 billion and $1.3 billion and policy loans of $1.5 billion &#32;and $1.3 billion &#32;as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively, associated with this business. 

Non-Traditional - Asset-Intensive Reinsurance 

The Company's U.S. and Latin America Asset-Intensive segment primarily concentrates on the investment risk within underlying annuities and corporate-owned life insurance policies. These reinsurance agreements are mostly structured as coinsurance, coinsurance with funds withheld, or modified coinsurance of primarily investment risk such that the Company recognizes profits or losses primarily from the spread between the investment earnings and the interest credited on the underlying annuity contract liabilities. Reinsurance of such business was reflected in interest-sensitive contract liabilities of approximately $10.5 billion and $10.7 billion as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. 

Annuities are normally limited by the size of the deposit from any single depositor. The Company also reinsures certain indexed annuities, variable annuity products that contain guaranteed minimum death or living benefits and corporate-owned life insurance products. Corporate-owned life insurance normally involves a large number of insureds associated with each deposit, and the Company&#8217;s underwriting guidelines limit the size of any single deposit. The individual policies associated with any single deposit are typically issued within pre-set guaranteed issue parameters. 

The Company primarily targets highly rated, financially secure companies as clients for asset-intensive business. These companies may wish to limit their own exposure to certain products. Ongoing asset/liability analysis is required for the management of asset-intensive business. The Company performs this analysis internally, in conjunction with asset/liability analysis performed by the ceding companies. 

Non-Traditional - Financial Reinsurance 

The Company&#8217;s U.S. and Latin America Financial Reinsurance segment assists ceding companies in meeting applicable regulatory requirements while enhancing their financial strength and regulatory surplus position. The Company commits cash or assumes regulatory insurance liabilities from the ceding companies. Generally, such amounts are offset by receivables from ceding companies that are repaid by the future profits from the reinsured block of business. The Company structures its financial reinsurance transactions so that the projected future profits of the underlying reinsured business significantly exceed the amount of regulatory surplus provided to the ceding company. 

The Company primarily targets highly rated insurance companies for financial reinsurance due to the credit risk associated with this business. A careful analysis is performed before providing any regulatory surplus enhancement to the ceding company. This analysis is intended to ensure that the Company understands the risks of the underlying insurance product and that the transaction has a high likelihood of being repaid through the future profits of the underlying business. If the future profits of the business are not sufficient to repay the Company or if the ceding company becomes financially distressed and is unable to make payments under the treaty, the Company may incur losses. A staff of actuaries and accountants track experience for each treaty on a quarterly basis in comparison to models of expected results. 

Customer Base 

The U.S. and Latin America operations market life reinsurance primarily to the largest U.S. life insurance companies. The Company estimates that approximately 85 of the top 100 U.S. life insurance companies, based on premiums, are clients. The treaties underlying this business generally are terminable by either party on 90 days written notice, but only with respect to future new business. Existing business generally is not terminable, unless the underlying policies terminate or are recaptured. In 2015 , the five largest clients generated approximately $1,760.9 million or 32.2% of U.S. and Latin America operation&#8217;s gross premiums. In addition, 43 other clients each generated annual gross premiums of $20.0 million or more, and the aggregate gross premiums from these clients represented approximately 57.5% of U.S. and Latin America operation&#8217;s gross premiums. For the purpose of this disclosure, companies that are within the same insurance holding company structure are combined. 

Canada Operations 

The Canada operations represented 10.2%, 11.2%, and 11.7% of the Company&#8217;s net premiums in 2015, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. The Company operates in Canada primarily through RGA Canada. RGA Canada employs its own underwriting, actuarial, claims, pricing, accounting, systems, marketing and administrative staff in offices located in Montreal and Toronto. 

Traditional Reinsurance 

&#32;In 2015 , the Canada Traditional Reinsurance segment assumed $38.6 billion &#32;in new business, predominately representing recurring new business, as opposed to in force transactions. Approximately 87.3% of the 2015 &#32;recurring new business was written on an automatic basis. 

RGA Canada is a leading life reinsurer in Canada, based on new individual life insurance production. It assists clients with capital management and mortality and morbidity risk management and is primarily engaged in individual life reinsurance, as well as creditor, group life and health, and living benefits (critical illness and disability) reinsurance, through yearly renewable term and coinsurance agreements. Creditor insurance covers the outstanding balance on personal, mortgage or commercial loans in the event of death, disability or critical illness and is generally shorter in duration than individual life insurance. 

The business is generally composed of facultative and automatic treaty business. Automatic business is generated pursuant to treaties which generally require that the underlying policies meet the ceding company&#8217;s underwriting criteria, although in certain cases such policies may be rated substandard. In contrast to facultative reinsurance, reinsurers do not engage in underwriting assessments of each risk assumed through an automatic treaty. 

RGA Canada generally requires ceding companies to retain a portion of the business written on an automatic basis, thereby increasing the ceding companies&#8217; incentives to underwrite risks with due care and, when appropriate, to contest claims diligently. 

Facultative reinsurance involves the assessment of the risks from a medical and financial perspective. RGA Canada is recognized as a leader in facultative reinsurance, and this has served to maintain a strong market share on automatic business. 

RGA Canada supports over half the companies active in the living benefits and in the group insurance markets. Solid claims management expertise and innovative product development capabilities support a growing share of these markets.

In addition, eight other clients each generated annual gross premiums of $20.0 million or more, and the aggregate gross premiums from these clients represented approximately 35.0% of Canada operation&#8217;s gross premiums.
