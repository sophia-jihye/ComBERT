Our Business Model 

&#160; 

Medicare-Related Health Insurance Plans 

&#160; 

We actively market the availability of Medicare-related health insurance plans through our Medicare ecommerce platforms ( www.eHealthMedicare.com, www.Medicare.com &#32;and &#32;www.PlanPrescriber.com ). Our Medicare ecommerce platforms and telephonic enrollment capabilities enable consumers to research, compare and purchase Medicare-related health insurance plans, including Medicare Advantage, Medicare Supplement and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans. To the extent that we assist in the sale of Medicare-related insurance plans as a health insurance agent, either online or telephonically, we generate revenue from commissions we receive from health insurance carriers. In the first plan year of a Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plan, after the health insurance carrier approves the application but during 

the effective year of the plan, we are paid a fixed commission that is prorated for the number of months remaining in the calendar year. Additionally, if the plan is the first Medicare Advantage or Medicare Part D prescription drug plan issued to the member, we may receive a higher commission rate that covers a full twelve-month period, regardless of the month the plan was effective. Beginning with and subsequent to the second plan year, we typically receive fixed, monthly commissions for Medicare Advantage plans and fixed, annual commissions for Medicare Part D prescription drug plans. We earn commission revenue for Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans for which we are the broker of record, typically until either the policy is cancelled or we otherwise do not remain the agent on the policy. Commission payments we receive for Medicare Supplement policies sold by us typically are a percentage of the premium on the policy and paid to us until either the policy is cancelled or we otherwise do not remain the agent on the policy. As a result, much of our Medicare commission revenue for a given financial reporting period relates to policies that we sold prior to the beginning of the period and is recurring in nature. Additionally, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plan pricing is approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, an agency of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, and is not subject to negotiation or discounting by health insurance carriers or our competitors. Similarly, Medicare Supplement plan pricing is set by the health insurance carrier and approved by state regulators and is not subject to negotiation or discounting by health insurance carriers or our competitors. 

&#160; 

Individual and Family, Small Business and Ancillary Health Insurance Plans 

&#160; 

We actively market the availability of individual and family, small business and ancillary health insurance plans through our ecommerce platforms ( www.eHealth.com and www.eHealthInsurance.com ), and generate revenue from commissions we receive from health insurance carriers whose health insurance plans are purchased through us, as well as commission override payments we receive for achieving sales volume thresholds or other objectives. Historically, the commission payments we receive for IFP, small business and ancillary health insurance plans we sold were a percentage of the premium our customers pay for those plans. Effective January 1, 2014, many carriers began paying our IFP health insurance commissions at a flat amount per member per month. Commission payments are typically made to us on a monthly basis until either the policy is cancelled or we otherwise do not remain the agent on the policy. As a result, much of our revenue for a given financial reporting period relates to policies that we sold prior to the beginning of the period and is recurring in nature. Additionally, health insurance pricing, which is set by the health insurance carrier and approved by state regulators, is not subject to negotiation or discounting by health insurance carriers or our competitors. 

&#160; 

Online Sponsorship and Advertising 

&#160; 

We generate revenue from our online sponsorship and advertising program that allows carriers to purchase advertising space in specific markets in a sponsorship area on our website and allows Medicare-related carriers to purchase advertising on a separate website developed, hosted and maintained by us. In return, we are typically paid a flat fee or, with respect to individual and family health insurance plans, a monthly fee and a performance-based fee based on metrics such as submitted health insurance applications. 

Technology Licensing &#160; 

&#160; 

We generate revenue from licensing the use of our health insurance ecommerce technology. Our technology platform enables health insurance carriers and agents to market and distribute health insurance plans online. Health insurance carriers or agents that license our technology typically pay us implementation fees and performance-based fees that are based on metrics such as submitted health insurance applications. 

&#160; 

Lead Referrals 

We generate revenue from referral fees paid to us based on Medicare-related and individual and family health insurance leads generated by our ecommerce platforms and our marketing activities that are delivered and sold to third parties. 

Additional financial information about our company is included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#32;of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

Industry Background 

&#160; 

The purchase and sale of health insurance has historically been a complex, time-consuming and paper-intensive process. This complexity can make it difficult to make informed health insurance decisions. In addition, the human error that arises from traditional paper-intensive distribution has historically resulted in a high number of incomplete and inaccurate applications being submitted to health insurance carriers. Incomplete and inaccurate paper applications often result in back- 

and-forth communications, delay and additional cost. The Internet&#8217;s convenient, information-rich and interactive nature offers the opportunity to provide consumers with more organized information, a broader choice of plans and a more efficient process than have typically been available from traditional health insurance distribution channels. 

&#160; 

Medicare is a federal program that provides persons sixty-five years of age and over, and some persons under the age of sixty-five who meet certain conditions, with hospital and medical insurance benefits. CMS, which administers this original Medicare program, also contracts with private health insurance carriers under the Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug programs for these health insurance carriers to provide health insurance and prescription drug benefits to Medicare-eligible individuals. Medicare Advantage plans replace original Medicare. Medicare Part D prescription drug plans provide prescription drug coverage that original Medicare does not provide. In addition, health insurance carriers offer Medicare Supplement health insurance plans, which help to pay health care costs not covered through original Medicare. Medicare-related insurance plans, including Medicare Advantage, Medicare Supplement and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans, are typically marketed and sold by insurance carriers, also known as plan sponsors, through a combination of dedicated internal sales representatives and licensed independent brokers and agents. CMS also offers plan information, comparison tools, call centers and online enrollment for Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans. 

Individual, family and small business health insurance has historically been sold by independent insurance agents and, to a lesser degree, directly by insurance companies. Most of these agents are self-employed or part of small agencies, and they typically service only their local communities. In addition, many of these agents sell health insurance from a limited number of insurance carriers (in some cases only one), resulting in a reduced selection of plans for the consumer. The implementation of health care reform and the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and related amendments in the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act has given rise to greater availability of health insurance over the Internet from various sources, including government-run health insurance exchanges and companies that offer health insurance in a manner similar to us. 

&#32; &#160; 

Health Care Reform 

In March 2010, the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and related amendments in the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act were signed into law. These health care reform laws contain provisions that have changed and will continue to change the health insurance industry in substantial ways. Among several other provisions, these laws and the regulations implementing them include a mandate requiring individuals to maintain health insurance or face tax penalties; a mandate that certain employers offer and contribute to their employees group health insurance coverage or face tax penalties if they do not do so; prohibitions against insurance companies using pre-existing health conditions as a reason to deny an application for health insurance; requirements for minimum individual and small business health insurance benefit levels, including prohibitions on lifetime coverage limits and limitations on annual coverage limits; medical loss ratio requirements that require each health insurance carrier to spend a certain percentage of their premium revenue on reimbursement for clinical services and activities that improve health care quality; establishment of state and/or federal health insurance exchanges to facilitate access to, and the purchase of, health insurance; an open enrollment period for the purchase of individual health insurance; Medicaid expansion so that a greater number of individuals will be insured under Medicaid programs; and subsidies and cost-sharing credits to make health insurance more affordable for those below certain income levels if they are eligible and purchase individual or small business health insurance through the state or federal health insurance exchange. While many aspects of health care reform became effective in 2014, health insurance carriers have been required as a part of health care reform to maintain medical loss ratios of eighty percent in their individual and family health insurance business since the beginning of 2011. Under health care reform an eighty-five percent medical loss ratio requirement for Medicare Advantage plans became effective in 2014. 

&#160; 

The initial open enrollment period under health care reform began in October 2013 and ended in March 2014 for coverage effective in 2014. Subsequent open enrollment periods for individual and family health insurance began on November 15, 2014 and ended on February 15, 2015 for coverage effective in 2015 and began on November 1, 2015 and ended on January 31, 2016 for coverage effective in 2016. Individuals and families cannot purchase individual and family health insurance outside the annual open enrollment period until the open enrollment period for the following year, unless they qualify for a special enrollment period as a result of certain events, such as losing employer-sponsored health insurance, moving to another state or becoming eligible or ineligible for a government subsidy for their health insurance. Moreover, in order to be eligible for a subsidy, qualified individuals must purchase subsidy-qualifying health plans, known as qualified health plans, through a government-run health insurance exchange during the open enrollment period or a special enrollment period. Recently a number of insurance carriers have indicated that they have seen higher medical utilization rates in their individual and family health insurance plan membership enrolled during the special enrollment period that has impacted these carriers&#8217; profitability. For this and other reasons, some carriers have notified the company that they are reducing or eliminating broker 

commissions on enrollments within the special enrollment period. CMS has tightened the requirements for individuals to qualify for enrollment during a special enrollment period starting in 2016, has eliminated a number of events that would make an individual eligible for such enrollment and has taken steps to enhance the special enrollment period eligibility verification process. 

&#32;During 2015, we renewed our agreement with CMS to allow us to enroll subsidy-eligible individuals in qualified health insurance plans over the Internet and through the government-run health insurance exchange operated by the Federal government in the 37 states where the federal government is operating all or some part of the health insurance exchange. Pursuant to the agreement as well as applicable law and regulations, we must satisfy a number of conditions and requirements to enroll subsidy eligible individuals in qualified health plans, and we may experience difficulty in satisfying them. Because a large number of individuals have become eligible for subsidies as a result of health care reform, if we are not able to maintain functioning relationships with government-run health insurance exchanges to be able to enroll subsidy-eligible individuals over the Internet, we will have greater difficulty competing with government-run health insurance exchanges for members, could lose existing members and would be unable to enroll as many new individual and family health insurance members. Recently CMS directed us to make changes to our process for enrolling subsidy-eligible individuals into qualified health plans through the federal health insurance exchange, including changes to the application form and process and to consumer disclosures provided on our website. These changes could impact the rate at which we are able to convert visitors to our website into submitted applications for qualified health plans during the next open enrollment period. 

While we have entered into relationships with state health insurance exchanges that are not part of the federal exchange to be able to enroll individuals into qualified health plans, those state health insurance exchanges have not adopted qualified health insurance plan enrollment processes for health insurance agents that are efficient or entirely online. As a result, we generally do not enroll individuals and families in qualified health plans in these states. 

&#160; 

Our Strategy 

&#160; 

Our objective is to continue to strengthen our position as the leading private online distribution platform for health insurance sold to individuals, families and small businesses and to enter new business areas where this platform may be leveraged. 

Key elements of our strategy are to: 

Offer the Best Consumer Experience. We believe that providing the best consumer experience increases market adoption of our services, builds our brand awareness, drives word-of-mouth referrals and improves our visitor-to-member conversion rates. We intend to continue to further develop an online experience that empowers consumers with the knowledge, choice and services they need to select and purchase health insurance plans that best meet their needs. 

Grow Our Medicare Opportunity and Make it a Year-Round Business. Our technology can be used to streamline and simplify the Medicare plan purchasing process. Our Medicare membership has expanded significantly since we entered the Medicare-related health insurance market, and we plan to continue investing for growth in this important area. We seek to enhance the technology behind our online and telephonic Medicare platforms and further develop demand generation programs in the Medicare market, which includes broadening our network of marketing partners and enhancing our Internet search engine algorithmic rankings for high-volume Medicare-related search terms. 

The majority of our Medicare-related health insurance enrollments historically took place during the Medicare annual enrollment period in the fourth quarter of each year. In 2015 we successfully increased our Medicare Advantage enrollments outside of the annual enrollment period to over half of our total annual Medicare Advantage enrollments and plan to further grow the contribution from non-annual enrollment period sales. If we are successful in doing so, we expect to increase Medicare-plan related sales and mitigate some of the traditional seasonality in the Medicare business. 

Increase Our Brand Awareness. We believe that building greater awareness of our brand is critical for our continued growth. A significant percentage of our website traffic is direct, and we intend to attempt to grow our direct website traffic by strengthening our brand awareness through a variety of marketing and public relations efforts. 

Extend Our Technology Leadership. We believe that our technology infrastructure and online platforms give us a significant competitive advantage for the distribution of Medicare-related, individual and family and small business health insurance. To extend our leadership position, we plan to continue to enhance our platforms and their capabilities to increase functionality, reliability, scalability and performance. 

Enhance Our Carrier Network and Product Portfolio. Our goal is to provide consumers with a selection of products to meet their health insurance needs and enhance and optimize the health insurance carriers and health insurance plans that we offer to consumers on our ecommerce platform, including our offerings of major medical health insurance and a broad variety of ancillary products. We seek to deepen our technology integration with health insurance carriers, allowing us to further streamline the sales and member fulfillment processes and increase revenue opportunities for us and health insurance carriers. We also seek to enter into relationships with carriers and government health insurance exchanges mandated as part of health care reform to be able to offer subsidy-eligible health insurance. 

Manage Our Individual and Family Health Insurance Plan Business for Profit Maximization. &#32;In March of 2015, we put in place a cost reduction program to better align our operating expenses with our outlook for the individual and family health insurance plan market and our individual and family health insurance plan membership. We plan to manage our individual and family health insurance plan business for profitability and invest profits that we expect to generate from this business into growing our Medicare-related health insurance plan business. At the same time, we expect to carefully monitor the regulatory and competitive environment in the individual and family health insurance plan market, and retain the flexibility to pursue membership growth in the future should we see an opportunity do so at attractive cost of acquisition levels. 

Diversify Our Revenue. &#32;We plan to continue to diversify our revenue by entering into new business areas where our technology, experience and relationships can be leveraged. 

&#160; 

Our Platforms and Technology 

&#160; 

Our ecommerce platforms organize and present voluminous and complex health insurance information in an objective format that empowers individuals, families and small businesses to research, analyze, compare and purchase a wide variety of health insurance plans. The plans we offer include Medicare-related health insurance, major medical individual and family health insurance coverage such as preferred provider organization, health maintenance organization and indemnity plans, health savings account-eligible insurance plans, and ancillary health insurance plans, which primarily consist of short-term, dental, life, vision and accident insurance plans. 

&#160; 

Elements of our platforms include: 

&#160; 

Online Rate Quoting and Comprehensive Plan Information. &#32;Our ecommerce platforms instantly provide consumers online rate quotes and comprehensive plan benefit information from a large number of health insurance carriers. After entering a minimal amount of relevant information on our website, our platforms allow consumers to instantly receive a list of applicable health insurance plans and rate and benefit information in an easy-to-understand format. The consumer can sort through the quoted plans based on price, health insurance carrier or deductible amount, or search the list of quoted plans to obtain a subset based on certain consumer preferences. Medicare-eligible individuals may also obtain annualized cost comparisons that include out-of-pocket estimates for their prescription drugs. 

&#160; 

Plan Comparison and Recommendations . We offer online comparison and recommendation tools that condense voluminous health insurance information. Our ecommerce platform enables consumers to compare and contrast health insurance plans in a side-by-side format based on plan characteristics such as price, plan type, deductible amount, co-payment amount and in-network and out-of-network benefits. Our Medicare plan comparison tool enables Medicare-eligible individuals to compare plan premiums, deductibles, out-of-pocket drug expenses, coverage limitations on medications and other aspects of Medicare plans. Our automated recommendation capability for individual and family health insurance presents a short series of questions and recommends health insurance plans based on the consumer&#8217;s input. 

&#160; 

Online Application and Enrollment Forms . Health insurance applications vary widely by carrier and state. Our proprietary graphical Application Designer Tool allows us to capture each individual and family health insurance application&#8217;s unique business rules and build a corresponding online application in XML format. Our online application process offers our consumers significant improvements over the traditional, paper-intensive application process. It employs dynamic business logic to help individuals and families complete application and enrollment forms correctly in real-time. This reduces delay resulting from application rework, a significant problem with traditional health insurance distribution, where incomplete applications are mailed back and forth between the consumer, the traditional agent and the carrier. We further simplify the enrollment process by accepting electronic signature and electronic payment from our consumers. 

&#160; 

Electronic Processing Interchange. Our Electronic Processing Interchange, or EPI, technology integrates our online application process with health insurance carriers&#8217; technology systems, enabling us to electronically deliver our consumers&#8217; applications to health insurance carriers. This expedites the application process by eliminating manual delivery and reducing the need for data entry and human review. Through EPI, we also receive alerts and data from carriers, such as notification of 

underwriting approval or a request from a carrier for a consumer&#8217;s medical records for underwriting purposes, which we then relay electronically to the consumer. These features of our service help prevent applications from becoming delayed or rejected through inactivity of the consumer or the carrier. 

&#160; 

Back Office Systems. Our proprietary back office customer relationship management systems enable us to provide a full range of customer service tasks in an efficient, highly scalable and personalized manner. Using these tools, we can track each consumer throughout the application process, obtain real-time updates from the carrier, generate automated emails specific to each consumer and access a cross-sell engine and dashboard to identify and track cross-sell opportunities. Our auto-email system is feature-rich with HTML capability, customizable merge tags, granular segmentation and tracking capability. 

&#160; 

Carrier Relationships 

&#160; 

We have developed strategic relationships with leading health insurance carriers in the United States, enabling us to offer thousands of health insurance plans online. We have relationships with a large number of Medicare-related, individual, family, small business and ancillary health insurance carriers, including large national carriers and well-established regional carriers. We typically enter into contractual agency relationships with health insurance carriers that are non-exclusive and terminable on short notice by either party for any reason. In addition, health insurance carriers often have the ability to terminate or amend our agreements unilaterally on short notice, including provisions in our agreements relating to our commission rates. The amendment or termination of an agreement we have with a health insurance carrier may adversely impact the commissions we are paid on health insurance plans that we have already sold through the carrier. 

&#160; 

Revenue derived from Humana represented approximately 21%, 23% and 23% of our total revenue in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. Revenue derived from carriers owned by Anthem represented approximately 12%, 11% and 9% of our total revenue in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. Revenue derived from carriers owned by UnitedHealthcare represented approximately 11%, 10% and 11% of our total revenue in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. Revenue derived from carriers owned by Aetna represented approximately 10%, 10% and 10% of our total revenue in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. 

&#160; 

Marketing 

&#160; 

We focus on building brand awareness, increasing website visitors and converting visitors into buyers. Our marketing initiatives are varied and numerous. They include: 

Direct Marketing . Our direct member acquisition channel consists of consumers who access our website addresses ( www.eHealth.com, www.eHealthInsurance.com, www.Medicare.com, &#32; www.eHealthMedicare.com &#32;and www .PlanPrescriber.com ) either directly or through algorithmic search listings on Internet search engines and directories. Our direct marketing programs include direct mail, email marketing, retargeting campaigns and television, radio and print advertising. 

Online Advertising. Our online advertising member acquisition channel consists of consumers who access our website or call centers through paid keyword search advertising from search engines such as Google, Bing and Yahoo!, as well as various Internet marketing programs such as display advertising. Our online advertising programs are delivered across all Internet-enabled devices, including desktop computers, tablet computers and smart phones. 

Marketing Partners . Our marketing partner member acquisition channel consists of consumers who access our website and call centers through a pay-for-performance network, comprised of hundreds of partners that drive consumers to our ecommerce platform and call centers. These partners include online advertisers and content providers that are specialists in paid and unpaid (algorithmic) search, as well as specialists in other types of Internet marketing; financial and online services partners in industries such as banking, insurance, mortgage and association partners; affiliate programs, including our marketing programs managed through Commission Junction; and off-line lead generators who specialize in traditional direct marketing channels, such as direct mail and television advertising. 

We generally compensate our marketing partners for referrals based on the consumer submitting a health insurance application on our platform, regardless of whether the consumer's application is approved by the health insurance carrier. If a marketing partner is licensed to sell health insurance, we may share a percentage of the commission revenue we earn from the health insurance carrier for each member referred by that partner. 

Technology and Content 

&#160; 

We have a technology and content team that is responsible for ongoing enhancements to the features and functionality of our ecommerce platform, which we believe are critical to maintaining our technology leadership position in the industry. A 

large number of our technology and content employees are located in our subsidiary in Xiamen, China. There are many risks associated with having an operation and doing business in China. Information regarding risks involving our operations in China is included in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors &#32;of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation and Compliance 

&#160; 

We distribute health insurance plans in all 50 states and in the District of Columbia. The health insurance industry is heavily regulated. In addition to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, each of these jurisdictions has its own rules and regulations pertaining to the offer and sale of health insurance plans, typically administered by a department of insurance. State insurance departments have administrative powers relating to, among other things: regulating premium prices; granting and revoking licenses to transact insurance business; approving individuals and entities to which, and circumstances under which, commissions can be paid; regulating advertising, marketing and trade practices; monitoring broker and agent conduct; and imposing continuing education requirements. We are required to maintain valid life and/or health agency and/or agent licenses in each jurisdiction in which we transact health insurance business. 

&#160; 

In addition to state regulations, we also are subject to regulations and guidelines issued by CMS that place a number of requirements on health insurance carriers and agents and brokers in connection with the marketing and sale of Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans. We are subject to similar requirements of state insurance departments with respect to our marketing and sale of Medicare Supplement plans. CMS and state insurance department regulations and guidelines include a number of prohibitions regarding the ability to contact Medicare-eligible individuals and place many restrictions on the marketing of Medicare-related plans. For example, our health insurance carrier partners are required to obtain CMS or state department of insurance approval of certain aspects of our platforms, call center scripts and other marketing materials we use to market Medicare-related plans. In addition, the laws and regulations applicable to the marketing and sale of Medicare-related plans are ambiguous, complex and, particularly with respect to regulations and guidance issued by CMS for Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans, change frequently. 

&#160; 

We are subject to various federal and state privacy and security laws, regulations and requirements. These laws govern our collection, use, disclosure, protection and maintenance of the individually-identifiable information that we collect from consumers. For example, we are subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA. HIPAA and regulations adopted pursuant to HIPPA require us to maintain the privacy of individually-identifiable health information that we collect on behalf of health insurance carriers, implement measures to safeguard such information and provide notification in the event of a breach in the privacy or confidentiality of such information. The use and disclosure of certain data that we collect from consumers is also regulated in some instances by other federal laws, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, or GLBA, and state statutes implementing GLBA, which generally require brokers to provide customers with notice regarding how their non-public personal health and financial information is used and the opportunity to &#8220;opt out&#8221; of certain disclosures before sharing such information with a third party, and which generally require safeguards for the protection of personal information. Violations of these federal and state privacy and security laws may result in significant liability and expense.

We rely on a combination of trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. We also have filed patent applications that relate to certain of our technology and business processes.

Competition 

&#160; 

The market for selling health insurance plans is highly competitive. Our competitors include government entities, including government-run health insurance exchanges established as a result of health care reform; health insurance carriers; other health insurance agents and brokers; and companies that use the Internet and other means to attract individuals interested in purchasing health insurance and generate revenue by referring these individuals to us or one of our competitors. 

Government. &#32; In connection with our marketing of Medicare related health insurance plans, we compete with the Federal government&#8217;s original Medicare program. CMS offers Medicare plan online enrollment, information, comparison tools, and has established call centers for the sale of Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans. CMS has regulatory authority over the Medicare Advantage program and can influence the competitiveness of Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans compared to the original Medicare program as well as the compensation that health insurance carriers are allowed to pay us. 

As a part of health care reform, each state was required to establish a health insurance exchange by October 2013 where individuals, families and small business can purchase health insurance. For states that are not operating a health insurance exchange, the federal government has implemented and is operating the exchange for that state. The Federally-Facilitated Marketplace, or FFM, operated some part of the health insurance exchange in 37 states during 2015. Among other things, the FFM and government exchanges in the states not served by the FFM have websites where individuals and businesses can shop for and purchase health insurance, and they also have offline customer support and enrollment capabilities. Qualified health insurance plans that individuals, and families must purchase in order to receive health care reform related financial assistance in the form of subsidies to purchase health insurance must be purchased through government health insurance exchanges. 

Government exchanges have invested significant amounts to raise consumer awareness and drive consumers to their health insurance marketplaces through Internet, television, radio and print advertising. In addition, government exchanges rank highly in algorithmic Internet search rankings for terms related to health insurance. Government exchange marketing efforts have resulted in significant competition and also have increased the cost of generating demand for individual and family health insurance online. We have entered into an agreement with CMS to allow us to enroll subsidy-eligible individuals in qualified health insurance plans over the Internet through the FFM. While we have entered into agreements with states that operate their own health insurance exchanges to be able to offer qualified health plans in those states, these states have not implemented qualified health insurance enrollment process for health insurance agents that are efficient or entirely online, and we generally do not enroll individuals in qualified health plans in those states. Notwithstanding our relationships with government-run health insurance exchanges to enroll individuals into qualified health plans through them, government-run health insurance exchanges are a significant source of competition given the large number of subsidy-eligible individuals that must purchase their health insurance through the exchanges to receive their subsidies and given that those individuals and families that we enroll through government exchanges establish a relationship with the government exchanges when we do so and may receive marketing directly from the government exchanges. 

Insurance carriers. Many health insurance carriers directly market and sell their plans to consumers through call centers and their own websites. Although we offer health insurance plans for many of these carriers, they also compete with us by offering their plans directly to consumers. Health insurance carriers have become more experienced in marketing their products directly to consumers both over the Internet and through more traditional channels, which has resulted in increased competition. 

Other agents and brokers. We compete with agents and brokers who offer and sell health insurance plans utilizing traditional offline distribution channels as well as the Internet. Our current competitors include the tens of thousands of local insurance agents across the United States who sell health insurance plans in their communities. A number of these agents operate websites and provide an online shopping experience for consumers interested in purchasing health insurance. In addition, a number of online health insurance agents like us generate demand over the Internet and sell health insurance to individuals over the Internet and using call centers. Some of these online agents have agreements with CMS, similar to us, that allow them to enroll subsidy-eligible individuals in qualified health insurance plans over the Internet in the states where the federal government is operating the health insurance exchange. As a result, we compete with these companies for subsidized business as well as for consumers who are not subsidy eligible. 

Internet marketers. &#32; There are many internet marketing companies that use the Internet to find consumers interested in purchasing health insurance and are compensated for referring those consumers to agents and health insurance carriers. We compete with internet marketing companies for individuals who are looking to purchase health insurance.

Seasonality 

&#160; 

Historically, the majority of our Medicare enrollments took place during the annual open enrollment period, which occurs during our fourth quarter. In 2015, we successfully increased our enrollments outside of the annual open enrollment period to over half of our total annual Medicare enrollments and plan to further grow the contribution from non-annual open enrollment period sales. This increases our total annual Medicare sales and also helps to mitigate some of the traditional seasonality in the Medicare business. Additionally, substantially all Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug policies renew on January 1 of each year, resulting in our recognizing substantially all Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plan annual renewal commission revenue in our first quarter. Accordingly, Medicare plan-related commission revenue is highest in our first quarter and lowest in our second and third quarters. 

The most recent open enrollment period for individual and family health insurance began on November 1, 2015 and ended on January 31, 2016 for coverage effective in 2016; the next annual open enrollment period is scheduled to run from November 1, 2016 through January 31, 2017 for coverage effective in 2017. Individuals and families generally will not be able 

to purchase individual and family health insurance outside of these open enrollment periods, unless they qualify for a special enrollment period by meeting certain qualifying events, such as losing employer-sponsored health insurance, moving to another state or becoming eligible or ineligible for a government subsidy for their health insurance, in which case they may purchase individual and family health insurance during the special enrollment period. The current special enrollment period began on February 1, 2016 and runs through October 31, 2016. As a result, we expect the number of applications submitted for individual and family health insurance will be highest during the first and fourth quarters of 2016 as a result of the annual open enrollment period and lowest during the second and third quarters of 2016, outside of the annual open enrollment period. 

Since a significant portion of our marketing and advertising expenses are driven by the number of health insurance applications submitted on our ecommerce platform, those expenses are influenced by seasonal submitted application patterns. As a result, we expect marketing and advertising expenses for individual and family health insurance will be highest during the first and fourth quarters of 2016 as a result of the annual open enrollment period and lowest during the second and third quarters of 2016, outside of the annual open enrollment period. Similarly, we expect marketing and advertising expenses for Medicare-related plans will be highest during the fourth quarters of 2016 as a result of the Medicare annual open enrollment period and lower during the first, second and third quarters of 2016, outside of the annual open enrollment period. 

Our net income (loss) in a given quarter is significantly impacted by the factors above. Accordingly, we expect our net income will be highest during our first quarter when we recognize substantially all of our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plan annual renewal commission revenue and our net income will be lowest (or net loss will be highest) during our fourth quarter when we incur a significant portion of our marketing and advertising expenses. 

This seasonality is subject to change in future periods, particularly in connection with any change in the timing of the annual open enrollment periods.

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 869 full-time employees, of which 31 were in marketing and advertising, 391 were in customer care and enrollment, 283 were in technology and content and 164 were in general and administrative. On March 11, 2015 we announced a strategic downsizing of the company's workforce in order to better align our expenses with our revenue. The reduction was equal to approximately 15% of the company's worldwide workforce. Information regarding the reduction in force is included in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors &#32;and Part II, Item 7, &#32;Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, &#32;of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union. As required under Chinese law, the employees in our Xiamen, China office established a labor union in January 2014. We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our employee relations to be good.
