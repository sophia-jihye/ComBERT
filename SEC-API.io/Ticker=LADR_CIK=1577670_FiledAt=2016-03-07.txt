 Item 1. Business 

Overview 

&#160; 

We are a leading commercial real estate finance company structured as an internally-managed REIT. We conduct our business through three commercial real estate-related business lines: loans, securities, and real estate investments. We believe that our in-house origination platform, ability to flexibly allocate capital among complementary product lines, credit-centric underwriting approach, access to diversified financing sources, and experienced management team position us well to deliver attractive returns on equity to our shareholders through economic and credit cycles. 

Our businesses, including conduit lending, balance sheet lending, securities investments, and real estate investments, provide for a stable base of net interest and rental income. We have originated $15.3 billion &#32;of commercial real estate loans from our inception through December 31, 2015 . During this timeframe, we also acquired $8.6 billion &#32;of investment grade-rated securities secured by first mortgage loans on commercial real estate and $1.3 billion &#32;of selected net leased and other real estate assets. 

As part of our commercial mortgage lending operations, we originate conduit loans, which are first mortgage loans on stabilized, income producing commercial real estate properties that we intend to make available for sale in commercial mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;CMBS&#8221;) securitizations. From our inception in October 2008 through December 31, 2015 , we originated $11.8 billion &#32;of conduit loans, $11.3 billion &#32;of which were sold into 37 CMBS securitizations, making us, by volume, the second largest non-bank contributor of loans to CMBS securitizations in the United States in such period. Our sales of loans into securitizations are generally accounted for as true sales, not financings, and we generally retain no ongoing interest in loans which we securitize. The securitization of conduit loans enables us to reinvest our equity capital into new loan originations or allocate it to other investments. 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had $5.9 billion &#32;in total assets and $1.5 billion &#32;of total equity. As of that date, our assets included $2.3 billion &#32;of loans, $2.4 billion &#32;of securities, and $834.8 million &#32;of real estate. 

We have a diversified and flexible financing strategy supporting our business operations, including significant committed term financing from leading financial institutions. As of December 31, 2015 , we had $4.3 billion &#32;of debt financing outstanding. This financing comprised $1.9 billion &#32;of financing from the Federal Home Loan Bank (the &#8220;FHLB&#8221;), $866.0 million &#32;committed secured term repurchase agreement financing, $394.7 million &#32;of other securities financing, $544.7 million &#32;of third-party, non-recourse mortgage debt, $319.6 million &#32;in aggregate principal amount of 7.375% &#32;senior notes due October 1, 2017 (the &#8220;2017 Notes&#8221;) and $300.0 million &#32;in aggregate principal amount of 5.875% &#32;senior notes due 2021 (the &#8220;2021 Notes,&#8221; and collectively with the 2017 Notes, the &#8220;Notes&#8221;). There were no &#32;borrowings outstanding under our Credit Agreement and our Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, as of December 31, 2015 , we had $1.4 billion &#32;of committed, undrawn funding capacity available, consisting of $50.0 million &#32;of availability under our $50.0 million &#32;Credit Facility, $380.4 million &#32;of undrawn committed FHLB financing and $919.0 million &#32;of other undrawn committed financings. As of December 31, 2015 , our debt-to-equity ratio was 2.9 :1.0, as we employ leverage prudently to maximize financial flexibility. 

&#160; 

Ladder was founded in October 2008. As of December 31, 2015 , we were capitalized by public investors, our management team and a group of leading global institutional investors, including affiliates of Alberta Investment Management Corp., GI Partners, Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System and TowerBrook Capital Partners. We have built our business to include 73 &#32;full-time industry professionals, including by hiring experienced personnel known to us in the commercial mortgage industry. Doing so has allowed us to maintain consistency in our culture and operations and to focus on strong credit practices and disciplined growth. 

We are led by a disciplined and highly aligned management team. As of December 31, 2015 , our management team and directors held interests in our Company comprising 11.2% &#32;of our total equity. On average, our management team members have 27 years of experience in the industry. Our management team includes Brian Harris, Chief Executive Officer; Michael Mazzei, President; Pamela McCormack, Chief Strategy Officer and General Counsel; Marc Fox, Chief Financial Officer; Thomas Harney, Head of Merchant Banking &#38; Capital Markets; and Robert Perelman, Head of Asset Management. 

We are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;). As such, we will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on that portion of our net income that is distributed to shareholders if we distribute at least 90% of our taxable income and comply with certain other requirements. 

Recent Developments 

FHLB Financing 

&#160; 

On January 20, 2016, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (the &#8220;FHFA&#8217;&#8217;), regulator of the FHLB, published a final rule in the Federal Register amending its regulation regarding the eligibility of captive insurance companies for FHLB membership. The final rule was effective February 19, 2016. 

According to the final rule, Ladder&#8217;s captive insurance company subsidiary, Tuebor Captive Insurance Company LLC (&#8220;Tuebor&#8221;), may remain a member of the FHLB through February 19, 2021 (the &#8220;Transition Period&#8221;). During the Transition Period, Tuebor is eligible to continue to draw new additional advances, extend the maturities of existing advances, and pay off outstanding advances on the same terms as non-captive insurance company FHLB members with two exceptions: 

1) 

New advances (including any existing advances that are extended during the Transition Period) will have maturity dates on or before February 19, 2021, and 

2) 

The FHLB will make new advances to Tuebor subject to a requirement that Tuebor&#8217;s total outstanding advances do not exceed forty percent of Tuebor&#8217;s total assets. 

Tuebor has executed new advances since the effective date of the new rule in the ordinary course of business. 

FHLB advances amounted to 43.4% &#32;of the Company&#8217;s outstanding debt obligations as of December 31, 2015. The Company does not anticipate that the FHFA&#8217;s final regulation will materially impact its operations as it will continue to access FHLB advances during the five-year Transition Period and it has multiple, diverse funding sources for financing its portfolio in the future. In the latter stages of the five-year Transition Period, the Company expects to adjust its financing activities by gradually making greater use of alternative sources of funding of types currently used by the Company including secured and unsecured borrowings from banks and other counterparties, the issuance of corporate bonds and equity, and the securitization or sale of assets. Future moves to alternative funding sources could result in higher or lower advance rates from secured funding sources but also the incurrence of higher funding and operating costs than would have been incurred had FHLB funding continued to be available. In addition, the Company may find it more difficult to obtain committed secured funding for multiple year terms as it has been able to obtain from the FHLB. See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and capital resources.&#8221; 

The Transition Period allows time for events to occur that may impact Tuebor&#8217;s long-term membership in the FHLB, including further regulatory changes, the enactment of legislation, or the filing of litigation challenging the validity of the final rule. During this period, a combination of these external events and/or Tuebor&#8217;s own actions could result in the emergence of feasible alternative approaches for it to retain its FHLB membership. 

There is no assurance that the FHFA or the FHLB may not take actions that could adversely impact Tuebor&#8217;s membership in the FHLB and continuing access to new or existing advances prior to February 19, 2021. 

Stock Dividend and Distribution of Accumulated Earnings and Profits 

On January 21, 2016 , we paid an aggregate of $15.5 million &#32;in cash to our Class A shareholders, accrued for dividends payable on unvested restricted stock of $0.5 million &#32;and issued 5,607,762 &#32;shares of our Class A common stock, equivalent to $64.1 million , in connection with the fourth quarter 2015 dividend of $1.45 &#32;per share. The total number of shares of Class A common stock distributed pursuant to the fourth quarter 2015 dividend was determined based on shareholder elections and the volume weighted average price of $11.43 &#32;per share of Class A common stock on the New York Stock Exchange for the three trading days after January 8, 2016 , the date that election forms were due. In connection with the dividend, we also issued 4,468,031 &#32;shares of our Class B common stock and each of Series REIT and Series TRS of LCFH, issued 10,075,793 &#32;Series LP units corresponding to these Class A and Class B shares. We believe that the total value of our 2015 dividends was sufficient to fully distribute our 2015 taxable income and our accumulated earnings and profits. 

Borrowings under Credit Agreement 

On January 20, 2016, the Company executed an amendment and extension of its credit agreement with one of its multiple committed financing counterparties, extending the maximum term of the credit agreement to April 24, 2016. 

Senior Unsecured Notes 

During the period from January 1, 2016 through March 4, 2016 , the Company retired $20.6 million &#32;of principal of the 2017 Notes for a repurchase price of $20.2 million &#32;recognizing a $0.2 million &#32;net gain on extinguishment of debt after recognizing $(0.2) million &#32;of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the retired debt. The remaining $298.9 million &#32;in aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes is due October 2, 2017. 

During the period from January 1, 2016 through March 4, 2016 , the Company retired $21.7 million &#32;of principal of the 2021 Notes for a repurchase price of $17.9 million &#32;recognizing a $3.5 million &#32;net gain on extinguishment of debt after recognizing $(0.3) million &#32;of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the retired debt. The remaining $278.3 million &#32;in aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes is due August 1, 2021. 

Revolving Credit Facility 

&#160; 

On February 26, 2016 , the Company executed an amendment of its revolving credit facility, providing for, among other things, increasing the maximum funding capacity of the facility to $143.0 million . 

Stock Repurchases 

During the period from January 1, 2016 through March 4, 2016 , the Company repurchased 151,588 &#32;shares of Class A common stock for an aggregate price of $1.6 million &#32;or an average of $10.57 &#32;per share. As of March 4, 2016 , the Company has a remaining amount available for repurchase of $47.4 million .

We invest in the following types of assets: 

&#160; 

Loans 

&#160; 

Conduit First Mortgage Loans. &#160; We originate conduit loans, which are first mortgage loans that are secured by cash-flowing commercial real estate and are available for sale to securitizations. These first mortgage loans are typically structured with fixed interest rates and generally have five- to ten-year terms. Our loans are directly originated by an internal team that has longstanding and strong relationships with borrowers and mortgage brokers throughout the United States. We follow a rigorous investment process, which begins with an initial due diligence review; continues through a comprehensive legal and underwriting process incorporating multiple internal and external checks and balances; and culminates in approval or disapproval of each prospective investment by our Investment Committee. Conduit first mortgage loans in excess of $50.0 million also require approval of our board of directors&#8217; Risk and Underwriting Committee. 

&#160; 

Although our primary intent is to sell our conduit first mortgage loans to CMBS trusts, we generally seek to maintain the flexibility to keep them on our balance sheet or otherwise sell them as whole loans to third-party institutional investors. From our inception in 2008 through December 31, 2015 , we have originated and funded $11.8 billion &#32;of conduit first mortgage loans and securitized $11.3 billion &#32;of such mortgage loans in 37 &#32;separate transactions, including two &#32;securitizations in 2010 , three &#32;securitizations in 2011 , six &#32;securitizations in 2012 , six &#32;securitizations in 2013 , ten &#32;securitizations in 2014 &#32;and ten &#32;securitizations in 2015 . We generally securitize our loans together with certain financial institutions, which to date have included affiliates of Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, UBS Securities LLC and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, and we have also completed two single-asset securitizations. During the years ended &#32; December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , conduit first mortgage loans remained on our balance sheet for a weighted average of 60 , 45 and 67 &#32;days prior to securitization, respectively. As of December 31, 2015 , we held 35 &#32;first mortgage loans that were substantially available for contribution into a securitization with an aggregate book value of $571.8 million . Based on the loan balances and the &#8220;as-is&#8221; third-party Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (&#8220;FIRREA&#8221;) appraised values at origination, the weighted average loan- to-value ratio of this portfolio was 59.4% &#32;at December 31, 2015 . The Company holds its conduit loans in its taxable REIT subsidiary (&#8220;TRS&#8221;). 

&#160; 

Balance Sheet First Mortgage Loans. &#160; We also originate and invest in balance sheet first mortgage loans secured by commercial real estate properties that are undergoing transition, including lease-up, sell-out, and renovation or repositioning. These mortgage loans are structured to fit the needs and business plans of the property owners, and generally have London Interbank Offered Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;) based floating rates and terms (including extension options) ranging from one to five years. Balance sheet first mortgage loans are originated, underwritten, approved and funded using the same comprehensive legal and underwriting approach, process and personnel used to originate our conduit first mortgage loans. Balance sheet first mortgage loans in excess of $20.0 million also require the approval of our board of directors&#8217; Risk and Underwriting Committee. 

We generally seek to hold our balance sheet first mortgage loans for investment. These investments have been typically repaid at or prior to maturity (including by being refinanced by us into a new conduit first mortgage loan upon property stabilization). As of December 31, 2015 , we held a portfolio of 67 &#32;balance sheet first mortgage loans with an aggregate book value of $1.5 billion . Based on the loan balances and the &#8220;as-is&#8221; third-party FIRREA appraised values at origination, the weighted average loan-to-value ratio of this portfolio was 67.6% &#32;at December 31, 2015 . 

&#160; 

Other Commercial Real Estate-Related Loans. &#160; We selectively invest in note purchase financings, subordinated debt, mezzanine debt and other structured finance products related to commercial real estate that are generally held for investment. As of December 31, 2015 , we held a portfolio of 40 &#32;other commercial real estate-related loans with an aggregate book value of $285.5 million . Based on the loan balance and the &#8220;as-is&#8221; third-party FIRREA appraised values at origination, the weighted average loan-to-value ratio of the portfolio was 68.7% &#32;at December 31, 2015 . 

&#160; 

The following charts set forth our total outstanding conduit first mortgage loans, balance sheet first mortgage loans and other commercial real estate-related loans as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and a breakdown of our loan portfolio by loan size and geographic location and asset type of the underlying real estate. 

&#160; 

Securities 

&#160; 

CMBS Investments. &#160; We invest in CMBS secured by first mortgage loans on commercial real estate and own predominantly AAA-rated securities. These investments provide a stable and attractive base of net interest income and help us manage our liquidity. We have significant in-house expertise in the evaluation and trading of CMBS, due in part to our experience in originating and underwriting mortgage loans that comprise assets within CMBS trusts, as well as our experience in structuring CMBS transactions. AAA-rated CMBS investments in excess of $50.0 million and all other securities positions in excess of $26.0 million require the approval of our board of directors&#8217; Risk and Underwriting Committee. As of December 31, 2015 , the estimated fair value of our portfolio of CMBS investments totaled $2.3 billion &#32;in 167 &#32;CUSIPs ( $14.0 million &#32;average investment per CUSIP). As of that date, 98.5% &#32;of our CMBS investments were rated investment grade by Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s Ratings Group (&#8220;Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s&#8221;), Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, Inc. (&#8220;Moody&#8217;s&#8221;) or Fitch Ratings Inc. (&#8220;Fitch&#8221;), consisting of 87% &#32;AAA/Aaa-rated securities and 11.5% &#32;of other investment grade-rated securities, including 9% &#32;rated AA/Aa, 0.9% &#32;rated A/A and 1.6% &#32;rated BBB/Baa. In the future, we may invest in CMBS securities or other securities that are unrated. As of December 31, 2015 , our CMBS investments had a weighted average duration of 3.2 years. The commercial real estate collateral underlying our CMBS investment portfolio is located throughout the United States. As of December 31, 2015 , by property count and market value, respectively, 48.8% &#32;and 68.5% &#32;of the collateral underlying our CMBS investment portfolio was distributed throughout the top 25 metropolitan statistical areas (&#8220;MSAs&#8221;) in the United States, with 3.5% &#32;and 29.6% &#32;of the collateral located in the New York-Newark-Edison MSA, and the concentrations in each of the remaining top 24 MSAs ranging from 0.3% &#32;to 7.8% &#32;by property count and 0.2% &#32;to 11.0% &#32;by market value. 

&#160; 

U.S. Agency Securities Investments. &#160; Our U.S. Agency Securities portfolio consists of securities for which the principal and interest payments are guaranteed by a U.S. government agency, such as the Government National Mortgage Association (&#8220;Ginnie Mae&#8221;), or by a government-sponsored enterprise (a &#8220;GSE&#8221;), such as the Federal National Mortgage Association (&#8220;Fannie Mae&#8221;) or Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (&#8220;Freddie Mac&#8221;). In addition, these securities are secured by first mortgage loans on commercial real estate. As of December 31, 2015 , the estimated fair value of our portfolio of U.S. Agency Securities was $71.3 million &#32;in 33 CUSIPs ( $2.2 million &#32;average investment per CUSIP), with a weighted average duration of 6.9 years. The commercial real estate collateral underlying our U.S. Agency Securities portfolio is located throughout the United States. As of December 31, 2015 , by market value 17.6% &#32;and 64.5% &#32;of the collateral underlying our U.S. Agency Securities, excluding the collateral underlying our Agency interest-only securities, was located in California &#32;and New York , respectively, with no other state having a concentration greater than 10.0%. By property count, New York &#32;represented 44.8% &#32;and California &#32;represented 32.8% &#32;of such collateral, with no other state&#8217;s concentration greater than 10.0%. While the specific geographic concentration of our Agency interest-only securities portfolio as of December 31, 2015 &#32;is not obtainable, risk relating to any such possible concentration is mitigated by the interest payments of these securities being guaranteed by a U.S. government agency or a GSE. 

&#160; 

Real Estate 

&#160; 

Commercial Real Estate Properties. &#160; As of December 31, 2015 , we owned 98 &#32;single tenant net leased properties with an aggregate book value of $545.4 million . These properties are fully leased on a net basis where the tenant is generally responsible for payment of real estate taxes, property, building and general liability insurance and property and building maintenance expenses. As of December 31, 2015 , our net leased properties comprised a total of 4.0 million &#32;square feet and had a 100% &#32;occupancy rate, an average age since construction of 8.4 years and a weighted average remaining lease term of 16.1 years. 

&#160; 

In addition, as of December 31, 2015 , we owned 29 &#32;other properties with an aggregate book value of $218.4 million .

For further details regarding our portfolio of commercial real estate properties, including state of operation, see &#8220;Properties.&#8221; 

Residential Real Estate. &#160; We sold 88 &#32;condominium units at Veer Towers in Las Vegas, NV, during the year ended &#32; December 31, 2015 , generating aggregate gains on sale of $16.5 million . We intend to sell the remaining units over time.

&#160; 

We sold 99 &#32;condominium units at Terrazas River Park Village in Miami, FL, during the year ended &#32; December 31, 2015 , generating aggregate gains on sale of $7.0 million . We intend to sell the remaining units over time.

As of December 31, 2015 , 14 &#32;condominium units were under contract for sale with a book value of $3.2 million . As of December 31, 2015 , the remaining condominium units we hold were 78.6% &#32;rented and occupied. During the year ended &#32; December 31, 2015 , the Company recorded $3.5 million &#32;of rental income from the condominium units. 

The Company holds these residential condominium units in its TRS. 

Other Investments 

&#160; 

Institutional Bridge Loan Partnership. &#160; In 2011, we established an institutional partnership (&#8220;LCRIP I&#8221;) with a Canadian sovereign pension fund to invest in first mortgage bridge loans that meet predefined criteria. Our partner owns 90% of the limited partnership interest, and we own the remaining 10% &#32;on a pari passu basis and act as general partner. We retain discretion over which loans to present to LCRIP I and our partner retains the discretion to accept or reject individual loans. As the general partner, we have engaged our advisory entity to manage the assets of LCRIP I and earn management fees and incentive fees from LCRIP I. In addition, we are entitled to retain origination fees of up to 1% on loans that we sell to LCRIP I and on a case-by-case basis as approved by our partner, may retain certain exit fees. During the quarter ended June 30, 2015, the last loan held by LCRIP I was repaid. LCRIP I will continue in existence until the fifth anniversary of the date of its closing, April 15, 2016. As of December 31, 2015 , the book value of our investment in LCRIP I was $48,771 . 

&#160; 

Unconsolidated Joint Venture. &#160; In connection with the origination of a loan in April 2012, we received a 25% &#32;equity kicker with the right to convert upon a capital event. On March 22, 2013, we refinanced the loan, and we converted our equity kicker interest into a 25% &#32;limited liability company membership interest in Grace Lake JV, LLC (&#8220;Grace Lake LLC&#8221;). As of December 31, 2015 , Grace Lake LLC owned an office building campus with a carrying value of $65.2 million , which is net of accumulated depreciation of $16.1 million , that is financed by $73.6 million &#32;of long-term debt. Debt of Grace Lake LLC is nonrecourse to the limited liability company members, except for customary nonrecourse carve-outs for certain actions and environmental liability. As of December 31, 2015 , the book value of our investment in Grace Lake LLC was $2.9 million . 

&#160; 

Unconsolidated Joint Venture. &#160; On August 7, 2015 , the Company entered into a joint venture, 24 Second Avenue Holdings LLC (&#8220;24 Second Avenue&#8221;) with an operating partner to invest in a condominium development located at 24 Second Avenue, New York, NY. The Company contributed $31.1 million &#32;for a 73.8% &#32;interest, with the operating partner holding the remaining 26.2% &#32;interest. The Company is entitled to income allocations and distributions based upon its membership interest of 73.8% &#32;until the Company achieves a 1.70x profit multiple, after which, ultimately, income is allocated and distributed 50% to the Company and 50% to the operating partner. As of December 31, 2015 , the book value of our investment in 24 Second Avenue was $30.9 million . 

FHLB Stock. Tuebor is a member of the FHLB. Each member of the FHLB must purchase and hold FHLB stock as a condition of initial and continuing membership, in proportion to their borrowings from the FHLB and levels of certain assets. Members may need to purchase additional stock to comply with these capital requirements from time to time. FHLB stock is redeemable by Tuebor upon five (5) years&#8217; prior written notice, subject to certain restrictions and limitations. Under certain conditions, the FHLB may also, at its sole discretion, repurchase FHLB stock from its members. 

Our Financing Strategies 

&#160; 

Our financing strategies are critical to the success and growth of our business. We manage our financing to complement our asset composition and to diversify our exposure across multiple capital markets and counterparties. 

&#160; 

We fund our investments in commercial real estate loans and securities through multiple sources, including the $611.6 million of gross cash proceeds we raised in our initial equity private placement beginning in October 2008, the $257.4 million of gross cash proceeds we raised in our follow-on equity private placement in the third quarter of 2011, proceeds from the issuance of $325.0 million of 2017 Notes in 2012, the $238.5 million &#32;of net proceeds from the issuance of Class A common stock in 2014, proceeds from the issuance of $300.0 million of 2021 Notes in 2014, current and future earnings and cash flow from operations, existing debt facilities, and other borrowing programs in which we participate. 

&#160; 

We finance our portfolio of commercial real estate loans using committed term facilities provided by multiple financial institutions, with total commitments of $1.5 billion &#32;at December 31, 2015 , a $50.0 million &#32;Credit Agreement, a $75.0 million &#32;Revolving Credit Facility and through our FHLB membership. As of December 31, 2015 , there was $704.1 million &#32;outstanding under the committed term facilities. We finance our securities portfolio, including CMBS and U.S. Agency Securities, through our FHLB membership, a $300.0 million &#32;committed term master repurchase agreement from a leading domestic financial institution and uncommitted master repurchase agreements with numerous counterparties. As of December 31, 2015 , we had total outstanding balances of $556.6 million &#32;under all securities master repurchase agreements. We finance our real estate investments with nonrecourse first mortgage loans. As of December 31, 2015 , we had outstanding balances of $544.7 million &#32;on these nonrecourse mortgage loans. 

In addition to the amounts outstanding on our other facilities, we had $1.9 billion &#32;of borrowings from the FHLB outstanding at December 31, 2015 . As of December 31, 2015 , we also had a $50.0 million &#32;Credit Agreement, with no &#32;borrowings outstanding, a $75.0 million &#32;Revolving Credit Facility, with no &#32;borrowings outstanding, and $619.6 million &#32;of Notes issued and outstanding. See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Liquidity and capital resources&#8221; and Note 7, Debt Obligations &#32;in our combined consolidated financial statements for the year ended &#32; December 31, 2015 &#32;included elsewhere in this Annual &#32;Report for more information about our financing arrangements. 

&#160; 

We enter into interest rate and credit spread derivative contracts to mitigate our exposure to changes in interest rates and credit spreads. We generally seek to hedge the interest rate risk on the financing of assets that have a duration longer than five years, including newly-originated conduit first mortgage loans, securities in our CMBS portfolio if long enough in duration, and most of our U.S. Agency Securities portfolio. We monitor our asset profile and our hedge positions to manage our interest rate and credit spread exposures, and we seek to match fund our assets according to the liquidity characteristics and expected holding periods of our assets. 

&#160; 

We seek to maintain a debt-to-equity ratio of 3.0:1.0 or below. We expect this ratio to fluctuate during the course of a fiscal year due to the normal course of business in our conduit lending operations, in which we generally securitize our inventory of conduit loans at intervals, and also because of changes in our asset mix, due in part to such securitizations. As of December 31, 2015 , our debt-to-equity ratio was 2.9 :1.0. We believe that our predominantly senior secured assets and our moderate leverage provide financial flexibility to be able to capitalize on attractive market opportunities as they arise. 

&#160; 

From time to time, we may add financing counterparties that we believe will complement our business, although the agreements governing our indebtedness may limit our ability and the ability of our present and future subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness. Our amended and restated charter and by-laws do not impose any threshold limits on our ability to use leverage. 

Investment Process 

Origination 

Our team of originators is responsible for sourcing and directly originating new commercial first mortgage loans from the brokerage community and directly from real estate owners, operators, developers and investors. The extensive industry experience of our management team and origination team have enabled us to build a strong network of mortgage brokers and direct borrowers throughout the commercial real estate community in the United States. 

We seek to align our interests and those of our originators by awarding our originators annual discretionary bonuses that are closely correlated with loan performance and realized profits, rather than loan volumes or other metrics. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , we paid $11.8 million &#32;in discretionary bonuses to originators. 

Credit and Underwriting 

Our underwriting and credit process commences upon receipt of a potential borrower&#8217;s executed loan application and non-refundable deposit. 

Our underwriters conduct a thorough due diligence process for each prospective investment. The team coordinates in-house and third-party due diligence for each prospective loan as part of a checklist-based process that is designed to ensure that each loan receives a systematic evaluation. Elements of the underwriting process generally include: 

Cash Flow Analysis. We create an estimated cash flow analysis and underwriting model for each prospective investment. Creation of the cash flow analysis generally draws on an assessment of current and historical data related to the property&#8217;s rent roll, operating expenses, net operating income, leasing cost, and capital expenditures. Underwriting is expected to evaluate and factor in assumptions regarding current market rents, vacancy rates, operating expenses, tenant improvements, leasing commissions, replacement reserves, renewal probabilities and concession packages based on observable conditions in the subject property&#8217;s sub-market at the time of underwriting. The cash flow analysis may also rely upon third-party environmental and engineering reports to estimate the cost to repair or remediate any identified environmental and/or property-level deficiencies. The final underwritten cash flow analysis is used to estimate the property&#8217;s overall value and its ability to produce cash flow to service the proposed loan. 

Borrower Analysis. Careful attention is also paid to the proposed borrower, including an analysis based on available information of its credit history, financial standing, existing portfolio and sponsor exposure to leverage and contingent liabilities, capacity and capability to manage and lease the collateral, depth of organization, knowledge of the local market, and understanding of the proposed product type. We also generally commission and review a third party background check of our prospective borrower and sponsor. 

Site Inspection. A Ladder underwriter typically conducts a physical site inspection of each property. The site inspection gives the underwriter insights into the local market and the property&#8217;s positioning within it, confirms that tenants are in-place, and generally helps to ensure that the property has the characteristics, qualities, and potential value represented by the borrower. 

Legal Due Diligence. Our in-house transaction management team, comprised of experienced attorneys, manages, negotiates, structures and closes all transactions and completes legal due diligence on each property, borrower, and sponsor, including the evaluation of documents such as leases, title, title insurance, opinion letters, tenant estoppels, organizational documents, and other agreements and documents related to the property or the loan. &#32; 

Third-party Appraisal. We generally commission an appraisal from a Member of the Appraisal Institute to provide an independent opinion of value as well as additional supporting property and market data. Appraisals generally include detailed data on recent property sales, local rents, vacancy rates, supply, absorption, demographics and employment, as well as a detailed projected cash flow and valuation analysis. We typically use the independent appraiser&#8217;s valuation to calculate ratios such as loan-to-value and loan-to-stabilized-value ratio, as well as to serve as an independent source to which the in-house cash flow and valuation model can be compared. 

Third-party Engineering Report. We generally engage an approved licensed engineer to complete property condition/engineering reports, and a seismic report for applicable properties. The engineering report is intended to identify any issues with respect to the safety and soundness of a property that may warrant further investigation, and provide estimates of ongoing replacement reserves, overall replacement cost, and the cost to bring a property into good repair. 

Third-party Environmental Report. We also generally engage an approved environmental consulting firm to complete a Phase I Environmental Assessment to identify and evaluate potential environmental issues at the property, and may also order and review Phase II Environmental Assessments and/or Operations &#38; Maintenance plans if applicable. Environmental reports and supporting documentation are typically reviewed in-house as well as by our dedicated outside environmental counsel who prepares a summary report on each property. 

Third-party Insurance Review. A third-party insurance specialist reviews each prospective borrower&#8217;s existing insurance program to analyze the specific risk exposure of each property and to ensure that coverage is in compliance with our standard insurance requirements. Our transaction management team oversees this third-party review and makes the conclusions of their analysis available to the underwriting team. 

A credit memorandum is prepared to summarize the results of the underwriting and due diligence process for the consideration of the Investment Committee. We thoroughly document the due diligence process up to and including the credit memorandum and maintain an organized digital archive of our work. 

Transaction Management 

The transaction management team is generally responsible for coordinating and managing outside counsel, working directly with originators, underwriters and borrowers to manage, structure, negotiate and close all transactions, including the securitization of our loans. The transaction management team plays an integral role in the legal underwriting of each property, consults with outside counsel on significant business, credit and/or legal issues, and facilitates the funding and closing of all investments and dispositions. The transaction management team also supports asset management and investment realization activities, including coordination of post-closing issues and assistance with loan sales, financings, refinancing and repayments. 

Investment Committee Approval 

All investments require approval from our Investment Committee, comprised of Brian Harris, CEO; Michael Mazzei, President; and Pamela McCormack, Chief Strategy Officer and General Counsel. The Investment Committee generally requires each investment to be fully described in a comprehensive Investment Committee memorandum that identifies the investment, the due diligence conducted and the findings, as well as all identified related risks and mitigants. The Investment Committee meets regularly to ensure that all investments are fully vetted prior to issuance of Investment Committee approval. 

In addition to Investment Committee approval, the Risk and Underwriting Committee of our board of directors approves all investments above certain thresholds, which are currently set at $50.0 million for fixed-rate loans and AAA-rated securities, and lower levels for all other types of investments. 

Financing 

Prior to securitization or other disposition, or in the case of balance sheet loans, maturity, we finance most of the loans we originate using our multiple committed term facilities from leading financial institutions and our membership in the FHLB. Our finance team endeavors to match the characteristics and expected holding periods of the assets being financed with the characteristics of the financing options available and our short and long term cash needs in determining the appropriate financing approaches to be applied. The approaches we apply to financing our assets are a key component of our asset/liability risk management strategy with respect to managing liquidity risk. These approaches, supplemented by the use of hedging primarily via the use of standard derivative instruments, facilitate the prudent management of our interest rate and credit spread exposures. 

Asset Management 

The asset management team, together with our third-party servicers, monitors the credit performance of our investment portfolio, working closely with borrowers and/or their partners to monitor performance of our collateral assets and overseeing our real estate portfolio. Asset management focuses on careful asset specific and market surveillance, active enforcement of loan and security rights, and regular review of potential disposition strategies. Loan modifications, asset recapitalizations and other necessary variations to a borrower&#8217;s or partner&#8217;s business plan or budget will generally be vetted through the asset management team with a recommended course of action presented to the Investment Committee for approval. 

Specific responsibilities of the asset management team include: 

&#8226; 

coordinating cash processing and cash management for collections and distributions through lock box accounts that are set up to trap all cash flow from a property; 

&#8226; 

monitoring tax and insurance administration to ensure timely payments to appropriate authorities and maintenance or placement of applicable insurance coverages; 

&#8226; 

assisting with escrow analysis to maintain appropriate balances in required accounts; 

&#8226; 

monitoring UCC administration for continued compliance with lien laws in various jurisdictions; 

&#8226; 

assisting with reserve and draw management from pre-funded accounts including monitoring draw requests for legitimacy and budget accuracy; 

&#8226; 

coordinating and conducting site inspections and surveillance activities including periodic analysis of financial statements; 

&#8226; 

reviewing rent rolls and operating statements; 

&#8226; 

reviewing available information for any material variances; and 

&#8226; 

completing and updating asset summary reviews and providing active portfolio management reporting to ensure that borrowers remain compliant with the terms of their loans and remain on target for established budgets and business plans. 

Disposition and Distribution 

Our securitization team works with our transaction management and underwriting teams to realize our disposition strategy of selling our conduit first mortgage loans into CMBS securitization trusts. We typically partner with other leading financial institutions to contribute loans to multi-asset securitizations. We have also led single asset securitizations on single loans we have originated. 

From time to time, our registered broker-dealer subsidiary, Ladder Capital Securities LLC (&#8220;LCS&#8221;), may act as a co-manager for the underwriting syndicate of public and private CMBS securitizations where an affiliate of LCS is contributing collateral to the CMBS deal as a loan seller. In such instances, LCS, as a co-manager, will participate in the underwriting syndicate, on a best efforts basis, to structure and arrange the bond issuance and participate in the associated investor meetings and road shows. LCS generally does not receive any allocation of securities in these offerings for distribution to investor accounts and, as such, has not participated in the direct sale of any CMBS to institutional and/or retail investors. LCS did not participate in any securitizations during the year ended December 31, 2015 . 

In addition, Ladder has from time to time purchased predominantly AAA-rated CMBS from securitizations into which we have sold conduit first mortgage loans, generally as one of several loan contributors. In such instances, however, we have not participated as a co-manager in the underwriting syndicates. As of December 31, 2015 , we owned $31.5 million &#32;of such CMBS, representing less than 0.3% &#32;of the $11.4 billion &#32;of CMBS issued by the related securitization trusts. As with our other CMBS investments, we purchased these securities in both primary and secondary market transactions over time. 

In addition to contributing conduit loans into CMBS securitization trusts, we also maintain the flexibility to keep such loans on our balance sheet or sell them as whole loans to third-party institutional investors. Balance sheet loans that are refinanced by us into a new conduit first mortgage loan upon property stabilization and intended for securitization are re-underwritten and structured by our origination, underwriting and transaction management teams. 

Our asset management team also manages sales of our real property and works with our trading and finance teams on sales of securities. 

Competition 

The commercial real estate finance markets are highly competitive. We face competition for lending and investment opportunities from a variety of institutional lenders and investors and many other market participants, including specialty finance companies, other REITs, commercial banks and thrift institutions, investment banks, insurance companies, hedge funds and other financial institutions. Many of these competitors enjoy competitive advantages over us, including greater name recognition, established lending relationships with customers, financial resources, and access to capital. 

We compete on the basis of relationships, product offering, loan structure, terms, pricing and customer service. Our success depends on our ability to maintain and capitalize on relationships with borrowers and brokers, offer attractive loan products, remain competitive in pricing and terms, and provide superior service. 

Taxation 

We and certain of our subsidiaries intend to be subject to tax as REITs under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code, commencing with the taxable years ending December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2016, respectively. To qualify as REITs, we must make qualifying distributions to shareholders and satisfy, on a continuing basis, through actual investment and operating results, certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, stock ownership and other REIT requirements. If we fail to qualify as REITs, and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we will be subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes and may be precluded from qualifying as REITs for the subsequent four taxable years following the year in which we lost our REIT qualification. The failure to qualify as REITs could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and amounts available for distribution to shareholders. 

We utilize TRSs to reduce the impact of the prohibited transaction tax and to avoid penalty for the holding of assets not qualifying as real estate assets for purposes of the REIT asset tests. Any income associated with a TRS is fully taxable because a TRS is subject to federal and state income taxes as a domestic C corporation based upon its net income. See &#8220;Risk factors&#8212;Risks related to our taxation as a REIT.&#8221; 

Regulation 

Our operations are subject, in certain instances, to supervision and regulation by state and U.S. federal governmental authorities and may be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries&#8217; businesses may rely on exemptions from various requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Investment Company Act, and the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (&#8220;ERISA&#8221;). These exemptions are sometimes highly complex and may in certain circumstances depend on compliance by third-parties who we do not control. 

Regulatory Reform 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;), which went into effect on July 21, 2010, is intended to make significant structural reforms to the financial services industry. For example, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, various federal agencies have promulgated, or are in the process of promulgating, regulations and rules with respect to various issues that affect securitizations, including: (i) a recently-adopted rule requiring that sponsors in securitizations retain 5% of the credit risk associated with securities they issue; (ii) requirements for additional disclosure; (iii) requirements for additional review and reporting (including revisions to Regulation AB under the Securities Act (&#8220;Regulation AB&#8221;); (iv) margin rules for swaps (including those used by securitizations) that will require the exchange of mark-to-market margin and possible initial margin and (v) certain restrictions designed to prohibit conflicts of interest. Other regulations have been and may ultimately be adopted. 

The risk retention rule that has been recently adopted (as it relates to CMBS) will take effect in December, 2016 and requires retention of at least 5% of the fair value of all securities issued in connection with a securitization for a certain period of time and, depending upon the party that will retain the risk, can be satisfied by (i) retention of a horizontal tranche (i.e., in one or more subordinate classes), (ii) retention of a vertical slice of the risk (interests in each class of securities issued in connection with the securitization) or (iii) a combination of vertical and horizontal strips. The risk (with respect to CMBS) must be retained by a sponsor (generally an issuer or certain mortgage loan originators) or, upon satisfaction of certain requirements, up to two third-party purchasers of interests in the securitization. 

The risk retention rules and other rules and regulations that have been adopted or may be adopted under the Dodd-Frank Act will alter the structure of securitizations in the future and could pose additional risks to or reduce or eliminate the economic benefits of our participation in future securitizations. For example, the margin rules will likely require securitizations to maintain liquidity facilities or other access to liquid assets to meet margin requirements. In addition, such rules and regulations could reduce or eliminate the economic benefits of securitization in general or discourage traditional issuers, underwriters, b-piece buyers or other participants from participating in future securitizations and affect the availability of securitization platforms into which we can contribute mortgage loans, which may require that we take on additional roles and risks in connection with effectuating securitizations of mortgage loans. 

Certain other recent and anticipated federal, state and municipal rules could also impact our business. These include (1) recent rules issued by the U.S. Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (&#8220;CFTC&#8221;) regarding commodity pool operator (&#8220;CPO&#8221;) and commodity trading advisor (&#8220;CTA&#8221;) registration and compliance obligations, (2) recent regulatory, reporting and compliance requirements applicable to swap dealers, security based swaps dealers and major swap participants under the Dodd-Frank Act, (3) recent Dodd-Frank Act regulations on derivative transactions, (4) changes to bank capital rules proposed by international regulators under the Fundamental Review of Trading Book (&#8220;FRTB&#8221;), which could require certain banks to maintain higher levels of capital when trading in securitization positions and (4) requirements of certain states and municipalities, such as California and New York City, that require placement agents who solicit funds from the retirement and public pension systems to register as lobbyists. Because some of the rules are not yet final or are in the process of being implemented, the full effect of the rules may not be known for some time. In addition, the SEC and other agencies continue to generate new rules. See also &#8220;Risk factors-Risks related to regulatory and compliance matters&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors-Risks related to hedging.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Regulation of Commercial Real Estate Lending Activities 

&#160; 

Although most states do not regulate commercial finance, certain states impose limitations on interest rates and other charges and on certain collection practices and creditor remedies, and require licensing of lenders and financiers and adequate disclosure of certain contract terms. We also are required to comply with certain provisions of, among other statutes and regulations, certain provisions of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act that are applicable to commercial loans, the USA PATRIOT Act, regulations promulgated by the Office of Foreign Asset Control and U.S. federal and state securities laws and regulations. 

Regulation as an Investment Adviser 

We conduct investment advisory activities in the United States through our subsidiaries, Ladder Capital Adviser LLC and LCR Income I GP LLC. Both of these entities are regulated by the SEC as registered investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the &#8220;Advisers Act&#8221;). A registered investment adviser is subject to U.S. federal and state laws and regulations primarily intended to benefit its clients. These laws and regulations include requirements relating to, among other things, fiduciary duties to clients, maintaining an effective compliance program, solicitation agreements, conflicts of interest, record keeping and reporting requirements, disclosure requirements, custody arrangements, limitations on agency cross and principal transactions between an investment adviser and its advisory clients and general anti-fraud prohibitions. In addition, these laws and regulations generally grant supervisory agencies and bodies broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict us from conducting our advisory activities in the event we fail to comply with those laws and regulations. Sanctions that may be imposed for a failure to comply with applicable legal requirements include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on our engaging in various advisory activities for specified periods of time, disgorgement, the revocation of registrations, and other censures and fines. 

We may become subject to additional regulatory and compliance burdens as our investment adviser subsidiaries expand their product offerings and investment platform. For example, if one of our investment adviser subsidiaries were to advise a registered investment company under the Investment Company Act, such registered investment company and our subsidiary that serves as its investment adviser would be subject to the Investment Company Act and the rules thereunder, which, among other things, regulate the relationship between a registered investment company and its investment adviser and prohibit or severely restrict principal transactions and joint transactions. This additional regulation could increase our compliance costs and create the potential for additional liabilities and penalties. 

In June 2010, the SEC approved Rule 206(4)-5 under the Advisers Act regarding &#8220;pay to play&#8221; practices by investment advisers involving campaign contributions and other payments to government clients and elected officials able to exert influence on such clients. The rule prohibits investment advisers from providing advisory services for compensation to a government client for two years, subject to very limited exceptions, after the investment adviser, its senior executives or its personnel involved in soliciting investments from government entities make contributions to certain candidates and officials in a position to influence the hiring of an investment adviser by such government client. Advisers are required to implement compliance policies designed, among other matters, to track contributions by certain of the adviser&#8217;s employees and engagement of third-parties that solicit government entities and to keep certain records in order to enable the SEC to determine compliance with the rule. In addition, there have been similar rules on a state-level regarding &#8220;pay to play&#8221; practices by investment advisers. 

Regulation as a Broker-Dealer 

We have a subsidiary, Ladder Capital Securities LLC, that is registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC and in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&#8220;FINRA&#8221;). This subsidiary, which from time to time co-manages the CMBS securitizations to which an affiliate contributes collateral as loan seller, is subject to regulations that cover all aspects of its business, including sales methods, trade practices, use and safekeeping of clients&#8217; funds and securities, the capital structure of the subsidiary, recordkeeping, the financing of clients&#8217; purchases and the conduct of directors, officers and employees. Violations of these regulations can result in the revocation of its broker-dealer license (which could result in our having to hire new licensed investment professionals before continuing certain operations), the imposition of censure or fines and the suspension or expulsion of the subsidiary, its officers or employees from FINRA. The subsidiary also may be required to maintain certain minimum net capital. Rule 15c3-1 of the Exchange Act specifies the minimum level of net capital a broker-dealer must maintain and also requires that a significant part of a broker-dealer&#8217;s assets be kept in relatively liquid form. The SEC and FINRA impose rules that require notification when net capital falls below certain predefined criteria, limit the ratio of subordinated debt to equity in the regulatory capital composition of a broker-dealer and constrain the ability of a broker-dealer to expand its business under certain circumstances. Additionally, the SEC&#8217;s uniform net capital rule imposes certain requirements that may have the effect of prohibiting a broker-dealer from distributing or withdrawing capital and requiring prior notice to the SEC for certain withdrawals of capital. 

Regulation as a Captive Insurance Company 

We maintain a captive insurance company, Tuebor Captive Insurance Company LLC (&#8220;Tuebor&#8221;) to provide coverage previously self insured by us, including nuclear, biological or chemical coverage, excess property coverage and excess errors and omissions coverage. It is regulated by the state of Michigan and is subject to regulations that cover all aspects of its business. Violations of these regulations can result in revocation of its authorization to do business as a captive insurer or result in censures or fines. The subsidiary is also subject to insurance laws of states other than Michigan (i.e., states where the insureds are located). See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Liquidity and capital resources.&#8221; 

Investment Company Act Exemption &#32; 

We intend to conduct our operations so that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries (including any series thereof) are required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. 

If we or any of our subsidiaries (including any series thereof) fail to qualify for and maintain an exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act, or an exclusion from the definition of an investment company, we could, among other things, be required either to (a) substantially change the manner in which we conduct our operations to avoid being required to register as an investment company, (b) effect sales of our assets in a manner that, or at a time when, we would not otherwise choose to do so, or (c) register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, any of which could have an adverse effect on us, our financial results, the sustainability of our business model or the value of our securities.

If we or any of our subsidiaries (including any series thereof) were required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, the registered entity would become subject to substantial regulation with respect to capital structure (including the ability to use leverage), management, operations, transactions with affiliated persons (as defined in the Investment Company Act), portfolio composition, including restrictions with respect to diversification and industry concentration, compliance with reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy disclosure and other rules and regulations that would significantly change its operation and we would not be able to conduct our business as described in this Annual Report. For example, because affiliate transactions are generally prohibited under the Investment Company Act, we would not be able to enter into certain transactions with any of our affiliates if we are required to register as an investment company, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business. 

If we were required to register us as an investment company but failed to do so, we would be prohibited from engaging in our business, and criminal and civil actions could be brought against us. In addition, our contracts would be unenforceable unless a court required enforcement, and a court could appoint a receiver to take control of us and liquidate our business. 

Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer which is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities, and owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of such issuer&#8217;s total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. Excluded from the term &#8220;investment securities,&#8221; among other things, are U.S. government securities and securities issued by majority-owned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies and are not relying on the exception from the definition of investment company for certain privately-offered investment vehicles set forth in Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act. 

We are organized as a holding company and conduct our businesses primarily through our majority-owned subsidiaries (including any series thereof). We intend to conduct our operations so that we do not come within the definition of an investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act because less than 40% of the value of our total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis will consist of &#8220;investment securities,&#8221; which excludes, among other things, U.S. government securities and securities issued by majority-owned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies and are not relying on the exception from the definition of investment company set forth in Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act. We will monitor our holdings to ensure continuing and ongoing compliance with this test. In addition, we believe that we will not be considered an investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act because we will not engage primarily, hold ourselves out as being engaged primarily, or propose to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Rather, we will be engaged primarily in the business of holding securities of our majority-owned subsidiaries (including any series thereof). 

&#160; 

We expect that certain of our subsidiaries (including any series thereof) may rely on the exclusion from the definition of an &#8220;investment company&#8221; under the Investment Company Act pursuant to Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act, which is available for entities &#8220;primarily engaged&#8221; in the business of &#8220;purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate.&#8221; This exclusion, as interpreted by the staff of the SEC, requires that an entity invest at least 55% of its assets in &#8220;qualifying real estate assets&#8221; and at least 80% of its assets in qualifying real estate assets and &#8220;real estate-related assets.&#8221; 

Although we reserve the right to modify our business methods at any time, as of December 31, 2015 , we expect each of our subsidiaries (including any series thereof) relying on Section 3(c)(5)(C) to primarily hold assets in one or more of the following categories, which are comprised primarily of &#8220;qualifying real estate assets&#8221;: commercial mortgage loans, investments in securities secured by first mortgage loans, and investments in selected net leased and other real estate assets. We expect each of our subsidiaries (including any series thereof) relying on Section 3(c)(5)(C) to rely on guidance published by the SEC or its staff or on our analyses of such guidance to determine which assets are qualifying real estate assets and real estate-related assets. To the extent that the SEC or its staff publishes new or different guidance with respect to these matters, we may be required to adjust our strategies accordingly. In addition, we may be limited in our ability to make certain investments and these limitations could result in a subsidiary holding assets we might wish to sell or selling assets we might wish to hold. 

Any of the Company or our subsidiaries (including any series thereof) may rely on the exemption provided by Section 3(c)(6) of the Investment Company Act to the extent that they primarily engage, directly or through majority-owned subsidiaries (including any series thereof), in the businesses described in Sections 3(c)(3), 3(c)(4) and 3(c)(5) of the Investment Company Act. The SEC staff has issued little interpretive guidance with respect to Section 3(c)(6) and any guidance published by the staff could require us to adjust our strategies accordingly. 

In 2011, the SEC solicited public comment on a wide range of issues relating to Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act, including the nature of the assets that qualify for purposes of the exemption and whether companies that are engaged in the business of acquiring mortgages and mortgage-related instruments should be regulated in a manner similar to investment companies. There can be no assurance that the laws and regulations governing the Investment Company Act status of such companies, including the SEC or its staff providing more specific or different guidance regarding Section 3(c)(5)(C), will not change in a manner that adversely affects our operations. 

Qualification for exclusion from the definition of an investment company under the Investment Company Act may limit our ability to make certain investments. In addition, complying with the tests for such exclusion may restrict the time at which we can acquire and sell assets. To the extent that the SEC or its staff provides more specific guidance regarding any of the matters bearing upon such exclusions, we may be required to adjust our strategies accordingly. Any additional guidance from the SEC or its staff could provide additional flexibility to us, or it could further inhibit our ability to pursue the strategies we have chosen. See &#8220;Risk factors&#8212;Risks related to our Investment Company Act exemption&#8212;Maintenance of our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act imposes significant limits on our operations.&#8221;
