 ITEM 1. &#160; &#8195; &#160; &#8195; &#160; &#8195; BUSINESS 

We are a clinical-stage gene therapy company focused on developing life-changing treatments for patients suffering from severe diseases of the central nervous system, or CNS. We focus on CNS diseases where we believe that an adeno-associated virus, or AAV, gene therapy approach that either increases or decreases the production of a specific protein can slow or reduce the symptoms experienced by patients, and therefore have a clinically meaningful impact. We have created a product engine that enables us to engineer, optimize, manufacture and deliver our AAV-based therapies that have the potential to provide durable efficacy following a single administration directly to the CNS. Our product engine has rapidly generated programs for five CNS indications, including advanced Parkinson's disease; a monogenic form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or a form of the disease caused by a single gene mutation; Friedreich's ataxia; Huntington's disease; and spinal muscular atrophy. Our most advanced clinical candidate, VY-AADC01, is being evaluated for the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease in an open-label, Phase 1b clinical trial with the goal of generating human proof-of-concept data in the fourth quarter of 2016. Our founders and members of our management team have extensive experience in drug discovery and development and have pioneered significant advances within the fields of AAV gene therapy and neuroscience. 

We believe that AAV gene therapy is a particularly attractive treatment approach for CNS diseases that are caused by well-defined genetic mutations. CNS diseases are a leading driver of global disease burden and represent the single largest biopharmaceutical market with estimated worldwide annual sa les of over $125 billion in 2014 , with the five CNS indications that we are currently targeting representing only a portion of this market. Due to the limited treatment options available for many CNS diseases, there remains a significant unmet medical need and an opportunity for AAV gene therapy to transform the lives of many patients with severe CNS diseases. Based upon clinical data generated to date, we believe that durable gene expression is achievable following a single administration of AAV gene therapy. Recent advances in delivery techniques allow for targeted delivery of AAV vectors, which are modified, non-replicating versions of AAV, to discrete regions of the CNS. In addition, AAV is believed to be safe, as no vector-related serious adverse events, or SAEs, have been reported in the more than 1,300 patients that we estimate have been treated with AAV gene therapy to date, including 200 patients treated for CNS indications. 

We have built a product engine that we believe positions us to be the leading company at the intersection of AAV gene therapy and severe CNS diseases. Our team of experts in the fields of AAV gene therapy and neuroscience first identifies and selects severe CNS diseases that are well-suited for treatment using AAV gene therapy. We then engineer and optimize AAV vectors for delivery to the targeted tissue or cells. Our manufacturing process employs an established system to enable production of high quality AAV vectors at commercial-scale. Finally, we leverage established routes of administration and advances in dosing techniques to optimize delivery of our AAV gene therapies directly to discrete regions of the brain or more broadly to the spinal cord region. 

Our most advanced clinical candidate, VY-AADC01, is being evaluated for the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease. The overall goal of treatment with VY-AADC01 is to restore advanced Parkinson's disease patients' responsiveness to levodopa, or L-Dopa, the longtime standard of care for controlling patients' symptoms at early stages of the disease. Human proof-of-concept data is being generated for VY-AADC01 in an open-label, Phase 1b clinical trial being conducted at two sites in the United States, the University of California, San Francisco, or UCSF , the initial trial site, and University of Pittsburgh, or UPMC . The main goals of this dose-escalation trial are to optimize vector delivery and dose, as well as to obtain further information on the safety profile of the treatment. Enrollment in the Phase 1b clinical trial is ongoing with the goal of generating human proof-of-concept data in the fourth quarter of 2016. 

Our four preclinical programs target severe CNS indications where loss or abnormal expression of a specific gene has been identified as the cause of the disease. Furthermore, based on preclinical data, we believe that we can successfully deliver the target gene to the appropriate tissue and cells in the CNS in order to increase or decrease expression of the target protein, as required for therapeutic efficacy. Several of our product candidates may be eligible for orphan drug designation or breakthrough therapy designation. 

&#160;

In February 2015, we entered into a strategic collaboration with Sanofi Genzyme, or Genzyme, to leverage our combined expertise and assets to develop AAV gene therapies for severe CNS diseases. Under the agreement, we received $65.0 million in upfront cash, a $30.0 million upfront equity investment and an in-kind commitment of $5.0 million, totaling $100 million. Additionally, we are eligible to receive up to $745 million in option and milestone payments while retaining U.S. commercial rights to most programs. 

Our pipeline of AAV gene therapy programs is summarized in the table below: 

Mission and Strategy 

Our mission is to become the world leader in AAV gene therapy for treating severe CNS diseases by developing transformative therapies. Our strategy to achieve this mission is to: 

&#183; 

Continually invest in our AAV product engine . &#160; We intend to further develop and enhance our product engine by focusing on (i) vector engineering and optimization; (ii) manufacturing; and (iii) dosing and delivery techniques. We plan to continue generating novel AAV vectors by engineering and optimizing vectors best suited to a targeted disease. We are building an onsite, state-of-the-art process research and development facility to enable the manufacturing of high quality AAV gene therapies. We expect to utilize established and novel techniques for dosing and delivery of our AAV gene therapies to the CNS. We plan to continually invest in our product engine to maintain our leadership in AAV gene therapy for CNS diseases. 

&#183; 

Establish a leadership position in commercial-scale, high quality AAV manufacturing. We believe that manufacturing capacity and expertise are critical to successfully treating patients using gene therapy, and we are committed to building a system with commercial capacity. Through our collaboration with MassBiologics, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, licensed manufacturer affiliated with the University of 

&#160;

Massachusetts Medical School, we are establishing a commercial-scale current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, compliant manufacturing capability. We initiated cGMP production activities at MassBiologics earlier this year . We are using the baculovirus AAV production system, a technology for producing AAV vectors at scale in insect-derived cells, originally invented and developed by several members of our current production team while at the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, which we continue to improve upon. We believe that having oversight over our own commercial manufacturing process is critical to ensuring quality product with commercial yields. 

&#183; 

Optimize and advance VY-AADC01 for the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease. Human proof-of-concept data is being generated for VY-AADC01 in an open-label, Phase 1b dose-escalation trial being conducted at two sites in the United States, UCSF , the initial trial site, and UPMC . Enrollment in the Phase 1b clinical trial is ongoing . As of October 2015, we disclosed eight patients had been treated , including five patients in the first cohort and three patients in the second cohort. In the second cohort, we increased the infusion volume to improve the coverage level achieved. The main goals of this trial are to optimize vector delivery and dosing, as well as to obtain further information on the safety profile of the treatment. More specifically, we are seeking to identify the infusion volume required to achieve ef fective coverage of the putamen, particularly the posterior putamen, the targeted region within the brain. Once we optimize for coverage, we expect to escalate the dose of VY-AADC01 to optimize for clinical benefit. 

&#183; 

Continue to build a pipeline of gene therapy programs focused on severe CNS diseases. Beyond our clinical-stage program for advanced Parkinson's disease, we have a deep and promising pipeline of AAV gene therapy programs in various stages of preclinical development. Our goal is to add at least one new pipeline program in the second quarter of 2016 and submit an Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, for one of our existing preclinical programs in 2017. We believe that our leadership position in AAV gene therapy for CNS diseases and our product engine provide us with the necessary capabilities to evaluate and capitalize on external opportunities. As such, we plan to opportunistically expand our pipeline through acquisition, in-licensing or other strategic transactions . 

&#183; 

Maintain and maximize the value of our commercialization rights. Under our collaboration with Genzyme, we have retained significant commercialization rights. As we advance clinical development of our product candidates and programs, we expect to continue to explore value-maximizing avenues, including building our own sales and marketing infrastructure or partnering with third parties, for commercialization. 

&#183; 

Continue to expand our intellectual property portfolio. We seek to have an industry leading intellectual property portfolio. To that end, we seek patent rights for various aspects of our programs, including vector engineering and construct design, our production process, and all features of our clinical products including compositions and methods of delivery. We expect to continue to expand our intellectual property portfolio by aggressively seeking patent rights for promising aspects of our product engine and product candidates. 

AAV Gene Therapy for CNS Diseases 

Gene therapy is an approach whereby gene expression is directly altered in patients to address the underlying cause or predominant manifestations of disease. We believe that the targeted nature of gene therapy may enable powerful treatment options, and provide these patients with meaningful and durable benefits. 

While AAV gene therapy can potentially be harnessed for multiple treatment methods, we are currently focused on gene replacement and gene knockdown approaches. Gene replacement is intended to restore the expression of a protein that is not expressed, expressed at abnormally low levels or functionally mutated with loss of function. Gene knockdown is intended to reduce the expression of a pathologically mutated protein that has detrimental effects. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Overview of AAV-Based Therapeutic Methods Currently Being Pursued by Voyager 

Our gene therapy approach uses AAV vectors which we believe are ideal vectors for gene therapy for several reasons: 

Broad Applicability. AAV is able to transduce, or transfer a therapeutic gene, into numerous cell types including target cells in the CNS. 

Safety. AAV is believed to be safe and is not known to cause any disease in humans. No vector-related SAEs have been reported in the more than 1,300 patients, including over 200 patients for CNS indications, treated with AAV gene therapy to date. 

Does Not Readily Integrate. AAV does not readily integrate into the genome of the target cell, reducing the potential for oncogenesis, or the induction of cancer. 

There are several important reasons why we believe that CNS diseases are well-suited for treatment with AAV gene therapy, including the following: 

Validated Targets. Many CNS diseases are caused by well-defined mutations in genes and these genes represent genetically validated drug targets for AAV gene therapy. 

Targeted Delivery. Advances in delivery techniques allow for direct delivery of AAV vectors to discrete regions in the brain or broader delivery throughout the spinal cord via the cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF. 

&#160; 

Durable Expression. Long-term gene expression may be achievable in the CNS following one-time dosing and transfer of the therapeutic gene with an AAV vector. Cells in the CNS are terminally differentiated, or no longer divide, eliminating the potential for cell division to dilute expression of the therapeutic gene. Repeated or continual dosing with direct injection of drugs into the CNS is complex, therefore a one-time AAV gene therapy has significant advantages. 

Immune Privileged Site. There is a reduced risk of harmful immune response due to localized delivery in a self-contained system. 

&#160;

While we are currently focused on gene replacement and gene knockdown approaches, we are also actively exploring additional potential treatment methods that can utilize an AAV vector, including the direct delivery of monoclonal antibodies to the CNS, as well as gene editing to correct or delete a gene in the cell genome. 

The Voyager Product Engine 

We have built a product engine that we believe positions us to be the leading company at the intersection of AAV gene therapy and severe CNS diseases. Our team of experts in the fields of AAV gene therapy and neuroscience first identifies and selects severe CNS diseases that are well-suited for treatment using AAV gene therapy. We then apply our expertise in AAV vector engineering and optimization, process research and development, manufacturing, dosing and direct CNS delivery to generate a specific AAV gene therapy for a target disease. We believe that optimizing each of these parameters is a key factor for overall program success. We expect that our current and future pipeline programs will make use of technological advances generated with our product engine. 

Disease Selection 

We assess potential product programs based upon the following criteria: 

Unmet Need. There is a significant unmet medical need for the indication and substantial commercial potential. 

Target Validation. There is strong evidence that expression of a specific gene, or lack thereof, is causing, or critical to, the disease state. 

Delivery Using AAV. There is strong evidence supporting the ability to target the relevant tissue and cells using an AAV vector to achieve sufficient target gene expression. 

Clinical Readouts. The clinical impact of an AAV gene therapy can be clearly measured, including through well-accepted clinical endpoints and the use of both existing and novel biomarkers. 

Scalability of Manufacturing. Sufficient AAV vector to supply late-stage clinical development and commercialization can be manufactured. 

In addition to the criteria above, we also look for groups of diseases where our knowledge can be transferred. For instance, we believe that some of the delivery parameters and imaging techniques that are employed in our VY-AADC01 program can be applied to AAV gene therapy delivery for Huntington's disease or other diseases where direct, targeted delivery to the brain is warranted. Likewise, we anticipate that our programs for a monogenic form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, Friedreich's ataxia and spinal muscular atrophy, or SMA, will all utilize injection into the CSF within the spinal column to achieve broad transgene expression in and around the spinal cord. 

Vector Engineering and Optimization 

We are engineering and optimizing AAV vectors that we believe are best suited for each of our programs. The key components of an AAV vector include: (i) the capsid, or the outer viral protein shell that encloses the target DNA, which includes the promoter and the therapeutic gene; (ii) the therapeutic gene, or transgene; and (iii) the promoter, or the DNA sequence that drives the expression of the transgene. 

Members of our team have co-discovered many of the known naturally occurring AAV capsids and have also created promising genetically engineered AAV capsids. Genetically engineered capsids have yielded vectors with desirable properties, such as higher biological potency and enhanced tissue specificity. We believe that there is an opportunity to further optimize AAV capsids to confer desired characteristics relating to properties such as tissue specificity and immunogenicity. We have a significant effort dedicated to designing and screening for novel AAV 

&#160;

capsids using a number of different scientific approaches. We believe that the information generated by this work will enhance our ability to rationally design AAV capsids with specific properties for particular therapeutic applications. 

We completed a non-human primate study that directly compared transgene expression and distribution in the spinal cord across seven different AAV capsids. The capsids were delivered via injection into the CSF within the spinal column and the specific transgene delivered by all the capsids was FXN. Levels of FXN expression were measured at multiple regions of the spinal cord, including the cervical, thoracic and lumbar regions. As shown in the figure below, meaningful differences in the level and distribution of FXN expression were seen across the AAV capsids that were compared. In this study, the levels of FXN expression were highest with AAV2, AAV5 and AAVDJ, and lowest with AAV9. Additionally, FXN expression was normalized as a fold increase relative to FXN expression in a human brain reference sample. Fold increase is a measure describing how much a quantity increases from a baseline value to a final value. For example, a baseline value of 30 and a final value of 60 corresponds to a fold change of two, or a two-fold increase. Fold increase is used as a reporting measure to emphasize the increase itself as opposed to the absolute values. 

C apsid Comparison Study Showed Substantial Differences in Transgene Expression of the Spinal Cord of Non-Human Primates 

With respect to the target DNA delivered through AAV gene therapy, we are selecting promoters that we believe have the appropriate activity and tissue selectively for our specific gene therapy programs. We are also designing transgenes to provide optimal expression once delivered to the targeted cells. 

Manufacturing at Commercial Quality and Scale 

The ability to produce high quality AAV vectors at commercial-scale is a critical success factor in AAV gene therapy. While at the NIH, m embers of our current production team invented and developed a baculovirus AAV 

&#160;

production system, which we use and have continued to improve. This system has a number of attributes that enable high quality commercial-scale manufacturing, including: 

High Yield. A single manufacturing run at 500-liter scale can yield many thousands of doses of an AAV gene therapy. 

High Purity. A relatively high percentage of AAV vectors contain the therapeutic DNA, reducing the number of empty capsids compared to alternative manufacturing approaches. In addition, the baculovirus system eliminates the risk of introducing mammalian cell derived impurities. 

Scalability. This process is reproducible at volumes ranging from 0.02 liters to 500 liters. 

Promising Regulatory Framework. Although to date no gene therapy product has been approved in the United States, products manufactured with the baculovirus system include the AAV gene therapy, Glybera, which is approved in Europe, and the marketed vaccines Flublok and Cervarix. 

We are building a state-of-the-art process research and development production facility for manufacturing research-grade AAV vectors onsite at our Cambridge, Massachusetts headquarters and a cGMP, commercial-scale AAV manufacturing capability through our collaboration with MassBiologics, in Fall River, Massachusetts, both of which will employ our baculovirus production system. 

Optimized Delivery and Route of Administration 

Identifying the optimal route of administration and delivery parameters for AAV gene therapy, such as infusion volume, flow rate, vector concentration and dose and formulation for a specific disease, are critical to achieving safe and effective levels of transgene expression in the targeted location in the CNS. We aim to develop clinically feasible protocols that yield reproducible results across patients. For our current pipeline programs, we are either pursuing direct injection into the brain, called intraparenchymal injection (advanced Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease) or injection into the CSF within the cerebrospinal space, called intrathecal injection (Friedreich's ataxia, SMA and a monogenic form of ALS). 

Intraparenchymal Injection to the Brain. In the development of VY-AADC01 for the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease, we are using the ClearPoint System to provide real-time, intra-operative, magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, as well as state-of-the-art infusion technologies. The ClearPoint System assists the physician in visualizing the delivery of VY-AADC01 to the putamen and to avoid specific blood vessels during the surgical procedure, with the goal of reducing the risk of hemorrhages. The surgical approach that we are using is similar to the approach used for deep brain stimulation, or DBS, a marketed device-based treatment for advanced Parkinson's disease. In multiple clinical trials to date, a similar delivery technique was used to successfully deliver AAV gene therapy to the brains of patients with Parkinson's disease. We believe that the delivery knowledge gained from our VY-AADC01 program can be applied to AAV gene therapy delivery for Huntington's disease.

&#160; 

Intrathecal Injection to the Spinal Cord. For spinal cord disorders, including monogenic ALS, Friedreich's ataxia and SMA, we believe that intrathecal injection is the optimal route of administration to achieve broad transgene expression throughout the relevant cells in the spinal cord and sensory pathways. Preclinical studies completed by us and others have demonstrated that intrathecal delivery of AAV vectors can effectively transfer the therapeutic genes to relevant cells in all regions of the spinal cord, as well as in the sensory pathways. Currently, intrathecal injection is commonly used for the delivery of various types of medications, including those to treat pain and infections.

Overview of Our Pipeline 

We have leveraged our product engine to assemble a pipeline of novel AAV gene therapies for the treatment of severe CNS diseases with high unmet medical need. Depending on the disease, our current AAV gene therapies will use either a gene replacement or gene knockdown approach. Our goal is to address the underlying cause or the predominant manifestations of a specific disease by significantly increasing or decreasing expression of the relevant proteins at targeted sites within the CNS. Several of our product candidates may be eligible for orphan drug designation or breakthrough therapy designation.

Advanced Parkinson's Disease Program: VY-AADC01 

Disease Overview 

Parkinson's disease is a progressive and debilitating adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder. Individuals who develop the disease are on average over 60 years of age. The cardinal clinical features of Parkinson's disease include bradykinesia, or slow movements, rigidity, rest tremor and loss of balance. While the underlying cause of Parkinson's disease is unknown, the depletion of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the region of the brain called the putamen leads to the debilitating motor symptoms associated with the disease. The prevalence of Parkinson's disease is estimated to be 700,000 patients in the United States and 7 to 10 million patients worldwide according to a 2010 article from Neuroepidemiology and the Parkinson's Disease Foundation, respectively. Due to the aging of the population in the developed world, we believe that the prevalence of Parkinson's disease will increase. It is estimated that up to 15% of the prevalent population with Parkinson's disease, or approximately 100,000 patients in the United States, have motor fluctuations that are refractory, or not well-controlled, with L-Dopa, the current mainstay of therapy, and thus may be candidates for gene therapy. These are typically patients who have progressed to an advanced stage of the disease. 

The progressive motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease are due to the death of neurons in the substantia nigra region of the brain. Neurons in the substantia nigra express the enzyme aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase, or AADC, which is responsible for the conversion of L-Dopa into dopamine, and are also responsible for the release of dopamine into the putamen, particularly the posterior putamen, which is a region of the brain that plays a significant role in motor function and control. While Parkinson's disease causes neurons in the substantia nigra to die, the neurons in the putamen remain intact, but do not normally express AADC. We believe that an AAV gene therapy approach that allows for the 

&#160;

delivery of AADC directly to the neurons in the putamen, enabling the targeted neurons to convert L-Dopa into dopamine, is an attractive therapeutic strategy for advanced Parkinson's disease. 

While symptomatic treatments exist, there are currently no therapies that effectively slow or reverse the progression of Parkinson's disease. The beneficial effects of L-Dopa on the symptoms of Parkinson's disease were discovered over 50 years ago and treatment with L-Dopa remains the standard of care for patients today. In the first several years after patients' diagnosis, sometimes referred to as the honeymoon period, patients' motor symptoms are generally well-controlled with L-Dopa treatment. However, as the disease progresses, patients become less responsive to L-Dopa. Despite increases in the amount and frequency of dosing of L-Dopa, patients with advanced forms of the disease experience longer periods o f reduced mobility, termed off-t ime, when their medication is ineffective, increased episodes of dyskinesias, or involuntary muscle movements, due to too much drug and shorter periods of on - time when their medication is effective. These motor fluctuatio ns and increased periods of off- time are associated with disability and a dramatically reduced quality of life. A s shown in the figure below, on-time decreases, while off- time and dyskinesias increase as patients progress from the honeymoon period into later stages of Parkinson's disease. 

Overview of Progression of Parkinson's Disease (PD) 

While L-Dopa and other pharmacological approaches to augmenting dopamine provide symptomatic benefit during early stages of Parkinson's disease, there are relatively limited treatment options for patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. There are two FDA approved therapies used to specifically treat advanced Parkinson's disease patients with medically refractive motor fluctuations. The first, DBS, requires the implantation of an electrical stimulation device in the body, which is connected to electrodes that are placed into the brain. The second, marketed as DUODOPA in Europe and DUOPA in the United States, requires the surgical placement of a tube into the intestine so that medication is delivered by a pump that resides outside the body, which patients must carry with them. 

Only a relatively small portion of eligible Parkinson's disease patients receive DBS or DUODOPA/DUOPA. In 2014, we estimate d that only approximately 6,000 patients worldwide received DBS and approximately 3,500 patients in Europe received DUODOPA/DUOPA. DUOPA received FDA approval in early 2015. We believe that the need for indwelling hardware and the maintenance associated with each of these approaches are significant deterrents for many 

&#160;

potential patients. Given the size of the addressable patient population with advanced Parkinson's disease and the limitations of the currently available treatment options for these patients, we believe that a significant unmet medical need exists for new treatment options. 

Our Treatment Approach: Turn Back the Clock 

We are developing VY-AADC01, an AAV gene therapy product candidate, for the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease. VY-AADC01 is comprised of the AAV2 capsid, which has been used in multiple AAV gene therapy clinical trials for a number of different diseases, and the cytomegalovirus promoter that drives expression of the AADC transgene. VY-AADC01 is intended to deliver the AADC gene directly into the putamen. Our approach bypasses the dying neurons of the substantia nigra, allowing for the conversion of L-Dopa into dopamine within the putamen. We believe that our approach has the potential to provide patients with clinically meaningful improvements in motor symptoms following a single administration. 

Our goal is to restore patients' responsiveness to L-Dopa following treatment with VY-AADC01 to "turn back the clock" on their disease such that the patients' motor symptoms are returned to a well-controlled state, consistent with the level of symptomatic benefit achieved from L-Dopa during the honeymoon period. Following treatment with VY-AADC01, patients with advanced Parkinson's disease will continue to take L-Dopa, but we believe that the required dose will be reduced. The continued administration of L-Dopa will provide a means to titrate dopamine production to further optimize symptomatic control. We believe our approach will increase the conversion of dopamine from L-Dopa in the putamen, resulting in a clinically meaningful improvement in motor symptoms following a single administration. 

Based upon VY-AADC01's proposed mechanism of action, we believe that if and when it is well-established as a safe and effective therapy for patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, there is the possibility that it could be evaluated as a treatment for patients with less advanced forms of the disease. 

Preclinical Studies 

Preclinical studies conducted by Krystof Bankiewicz, M.D., Ph.D., one of our co-founders, and his colleagues at UCSF evaluated the safety, efficacy and pharmacological activity of AAV2-AADC gene therapy, a gene therapy substantially similar to VY-AADC01, delivered directly to the putamen in a non-human primate model of Parkinson's disease. Overall, the procedure and vector were well-tolerated with no serious toxicity issues. 

Positron emission tomography, or PET, imaging with tracers specific for AADC activity demonstrated a significant and sustained increase of activity in the brain region where the vector had been delivered. Increased responsiveness to L-Dopa was also evidenced by significant behavioral improvements observed pre- and post-treatment with the gene therapy. In five animals, the mean improvement in behavior was determined at various doses of L-Dopa both one month before treatment, as a baseline measure for comparison purposes, and then again six months after treatment. A strong PET signal was observed in all five animals following treatment, confirming delivery of AADC into the putamen. Animals were significantly more sensitive to L-Dopa six months following treatment with the gene therapy when compared to baseline, as shown below.

* A result is considered to be statistically significant when the probability of the result occurring by random chance, rather than from the efficacy of the treatment, is sufficiently low. The conventional method for measuring the statistical significance of a result is known as the "p-value," which represents the probability that chance caused the result (e.g., a p-value = 0.001 means that there is a 0.1% or less probability that the difference between the control group and the treatment group is purely due to random chance). 

We believe that these results provide evidence that AADC is active and being expressed at levels sufficient to measure a clinical benefit. 

Two animals from this cohort were followed for up to eight years following a single administration of the gene therapy and sustained PET imaging signals for AADC and behavioral signs of efficacy were observed in these animals. 

The results of these preclinical studies provided support for the initiation of clinical trials. 

Phase 1 Clinical Trials 

In a completed open-label Phase 1 clinical trial conducted at UCSF, VY-AADC01 was delivered directly to the putamen of Parkinson's disease patients. The primary endpoints of this trial were safety and tolerability of VY-AADC01. These endpoints were met as VY-AADC01 was well-tolerated and no treatment related SAEs were reported. Furthermore, pharmacologic activity of VY-AADC01 was observed. This trial was completed prior to our involvement in the program, but used a version of VY-AADC01 that is also currently being used in the ongoing Phase 1b clinical trial. We are currently evaluating whether to use the same version of VY-AADC01 used in the ongoing Phase 1b clinical trial in future clinical trials, or to use a slightly modified version of VY-AADC01, which we believe will be found to be substantially similar to the version of VY-AADC01 being used in the ongoing Phase 1b trial. Based on our discussions with the FDA, we believe that we have a good understanding of what preclinical studies we will need to demonstrate comparability between the current version and the modified version of VY-AADC01. 

The Phase 1 clinical trial was conducted in a total of 10 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. Two doses of VY-AADC01 were tested, 9 &#215; 10 10 vector genomes, or vg, and 3 &#215; 10 11 vg, with five patients per dose cohort. The 

&#160;

infusion volume was 100&#181;l per putamen, or 200&#181;l per patient. Patients in both cohorts treated with VY-AADC01 showed modest improvements in motor fluctuations. At six months following treatment, off-time was observed to be reduced by an average of approximately three hours and a corresponding increase in on-time without dyskinesias was also observed. In addition, at six months following treatment, an approximately 30% improvement in on- and off-time measures using the Total Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, or UPDRS, a widely used rating scale that evaluates cognitive, functional, and motor deficits, as well as medication-related complications, was observed, as shown in the table below. 

Summary of UPDRS Results from Phase 1 Trial (1) &#160; 

(1) 

Christine et al, Neurology (2009), 73: 1662-1669. The row titled "Low-dose cohort" represents data from the five patients treated with 9 X 10 10 vg of VY-AADC01. The row titled "High-dose cohort" represents data from the five patients treated with 3 X 10 11 vg of VY-AADC01. The row titled "Combined cohorts" represents data from all ten patients treated with VY-AADC01. The data in the columns under the header "Off medications" represents periods during which patients' medications were not working as measured by a patient's total UPDRS score at baseline, before treatment with VY-AADC01, and at six months following treatment with VY-AADC01, along with percent change from baseline to six months and the corresponding p-value. The data in the columns under the header "On medications" represents periods during which patients' medications were working as measured by a patient's total UPDRS score at baseline, before treatment with VY-AADC01 and at six months following treatment with VY-AADC01, along with percent change from baseline to six months and the corresponding p-value. A result is considered to be statistically significant when the probability of the result occurring by random chance, rather than from the efficacy of the treatment, is sufficiently low. The conventional method for measuring the statistical significance of a result is known as the "p-value," which represents the probability that chance caused the result (e.g., a p-value = 0.001 means that there is a 0.1% or less probability that the difference between the control group and the treatment group is purely due to random chance). Because of the small size of this trial, the p-values may not be reliable or repeatable, and may not be duplicated in future trials. 

While no gene therapy related SAEs were reported, three patients experienced minor hemorrhages related to the surgical procedure. Two of the hemorrhages were asymptomatic, noticed only on imaging, and one was symptomatic with the patient making an almost complete recovery. Nevertheless, the stereotactic injection protocol used in the surgical procedure was modified to avoid specific blood vessels and no further hemorrhages were reported. The implementation of real-time, intra-operative MRI guidance in the ongoing Phase 1b clinical trial is a significant advancement in vector delivery. 

The 10 patients were assessed clinically for up to four years after treatment and a durable, dose-dependent expression of AADC was observed. Patients treated with the low dose gene therapy were observed to have an increased PET signal, or uptake of the 18 fluoro-meta-tyrosine tracer, or 18 FMT, indicative of AADC expression and activity that persisted for up to four years. Patients treated with the high dose gene therapy were observed to have an increased PET signal that was greater on average when compared to the low dose cohort, which also persisted for up to four years.

Long-Term AADC Expression as Measured by PET Imaging in Patients Treated with High and Low Doses of AAV Gene Therapy in a Phase 1 Clinical Trial (1)

Mittermeyer et al, Human Gene Therapy (2012), 23: 377-381. The publisher for this copyrighted material is Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. publishers. Blue lines represent patients treated with the low dose and yellow lines represent patients treated with the high dose. 

A similar Phase 1 clinical trial was conducted at Jichi Medical University, or JMU, in Japan using the same vector that was used in the UCSF trial. The primary endpoints of this trial were safety and tolerability of the treatment. These endpoints were met as the treatment was well-tolerated and no treatment related SAEs were reported. Six patients were treated in this trial and an enhanced PET signal was observed in a subset of patients monitored 96 weeks following treatment. An open-label Phase 1/2 trial is currently being conducted at JMU. The primary endpoints of this trial are safety and tolerability of the treatment. This trial is using lower infusion volumes and doses compared to the ongoing Phase 1b trial . Importantly, the JMU trial is not using real-time, intra-operative MRI guidance. 

While the prior UCSF and JMU clinical results were encouraging and provided evidence of long-term AADC expression, the magnitude of the clinical benefits observed did not exceed placebo effects observed in previous surgical therapy trials in Parkinson's disease patients, and the UCSF and JMU trials were not blinded. Further, based on post-operative imaging and our current work using real-time, intra-operative MRI monitoring, we estimate that less than 10% of the putamen volume was covered by the infusion in these trials, which reflects suboptimal distribution of VY-AADC01 in the putamen. We believe that there is an opportunity to further optimize the delivery, dose and infusion volume of VY-AADC01 to substantially increase the coverage of the putamen in order to achieve a more substantial clinical benefit. 

Our Program Status 

In 2014, UCSF initiated an open-label Phase 1b clinical trial to optimize the development of VY-AADC01. The IND for the Phase 1b trial was filed by UCSF in July 2013 and was transferred to us in October 2015. We initiated the second trial site at UPMC in December 2015 . The primary endpoints of this trial are safety and tolerability of the treatment. This trial incorporates three key design features: 

&#160;

1) 

Use of the Clearpoint System to provide real-time, intra-operative MRI during surgery to assist the physician in visualizing the delivery of VY-AADC01 to the putamen and to avoid specific blood vessels during the surgical procedure, with the goal of reducing the risk of hemorrhages. 

2) 

Larger infusion volumes designed to increase coverage of the putamen with VY-AADC01. 

3) 

Higher doses of VY-AADC01 compared to the previously completed UCSF Phase 1 trial. 

Secondary endpoints of this trial, which will be used to assess the potential pharmacologic activity of VY-AADC01, include UPDRS, AADC PET imaging and a behavioral test using intravenous L-Dopa treatment to measure changes in a patients' sensitivity to L-Dopa. 

In this Phase 1b trial, up to 20 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease are expected be treated with VY-AADC01. A total of five patients in the first dose cohort, or Cohort 1, were treated with a VY-AADC01 concentration of 0.83 &#215; 10 12 vg per milliliter or 7.5 &#215; 10 11 vg dose using a 450&#181;l infusion volume per putamen, or 900&#181;l per patient, and no SAEs have been observed to date in Cohort 1 patients. As shown below, the average coverage of the overall putamen achieved in the first cohort was approximately 21% and the average coverage of the posterior putamen, which is reduced in dopamine content early on in Parkinson's disease, was approximately 20%. In the portion of the putamen covered by VY-AADC01, as determined by MRI, there was approximately a 30% average increase in the PET signal at six months after surgery compared to the baseline PET signal measured prior to surgery. An increased PET signal is indicative of increased AADC expression and activity. Importantly, the PET results from Cohort 1 confirmed the overlap of the MRI and PET signals seen in previous non-human primate studies. This data supports our hypothesis that AADC is expressed post-treatment in the same region of the brain where VY-AADC01 was visualized through the use of MRI during surgery. While the coverage in Cohort 1 improved relative to the below 10% coverage of the putamen that we estimated was achieved in the prior UCSF Phase 1 trial, we believe that the coverage needs to be further increased. No meaningful signals of efficacy have been observed in these patients to date. We are continuing to monitor the patients from Cohort 1. 

Prior to the initiation of the second cohort, or Cohort 2, a protocol amendment was submitted and approved by the FDA, which included an increase in the infusion volume to up to 900&#181;l per putamen, or 1,800&#181;l per patient, and allowed for the use of catheters with different step lengths, with the overall goal of further increasing coverage of the putamen, particularly the posterior putamen. Patients in Cohort 2 are being treated with a VY-AADC01 concentration of 0.83 &#215; 10 12 vg per milliliter or 1.5 &#215; 10 12 vg. The first patient, or Patient #6 overall, in Cohort 2 was treated in June 2015 and the coverage achieved in this patient was meaningfully improved relative to Cohort 1. The average coverage of the overall putamen achieved in Patient #6 was approximately 36% and the average coverage of the posterior putamen was approximately 46%. No SAEs were observed in Patient #6. The second patient in Cohort 2, Patient #7, was treated in July 2015. The coverage achieved in this patient was suboptimal due, we believe, to an exceptionally complex vasculature and resulting perivascular leakage, or leakage into the tissue surrounding the blood vessels. The average coverage of the overall putamen achieved in Patient #7 was approximately 25% and the average coverage of the posterior putamen was approximately 22%. Prolonged immobilization during surgery resulted in Patient #7 experiencing two SAEs, a pulmonary embolism, or blood clot in the lungs, and related heart arrhythmia, or irregular heartbeat. It was determined that these SAEs were related to the surgical procedure, not VY-AADC01. T he patient's symptoms associated wit h the SAEs have completely resolved, subject to continued monitoring an d treatment with an anti-coagula nt, which is anticipated to be discontinued. Patient #8 was treated in October 2015 and was the third patient treated in Cohort 2. The average coverage of the overall putamen achieved in Patient #8 was approximately 38% and the average coverage of the posterior putamen was approximately 32%. Enrollment in th e Phase 1b trial is ongoing and procedures are in place to address the risk mitigation of future pulmonary emboli by using a lower limb sequential compression device on all patients, in order to prevent deep vein thrombosis, which can lead to pulmonary emboli. Patient #8 was the first to be treated with a lower limb sequential compression device during the surgical procedure. 

&#160;

Summary of Coverage of Putamen 

Note: Average coverage percentages for Phase 1b include average coverage achieved in left and right putamen per patient. 

As anticipated given the increased volume administered, the coverage of the putamen achieved in Patient #6 was meaningfully better when compared to the coverage achieved in the five patients treated as part of Cohort 1 in the ongoing Phase 1b trial. A scheduled interim evaluation of Patient #6 was completed three months after treatment by a Parkinson's disease specialist. During this interim evaluation, a subset of efficacy measures were evaluated via patient diary and clinical exam, and were compared to the relevant baseline measures taken prior to treatment. As shown in the figure below, at three months following treatment, Patient #6 demonstrated an approximately four hour reduction in off-time with corresponding increases in on-time and sleep, as well as an approximately 11 point reduction, or 69% improvement, in UPDRS III score, the clinician-scored motor evaluation portion of UPDRS, while the patient was on L-Dopa. This compares to an average off-time reduction of two hours and an approximately 11% average improvement in UPDRS III score seen in Cohort 1 patients at three months after treatment. Furthermore, there was a nine point reduction, or an approximately 30% improvement, in UPDRS III score while Patient #6 was off L-Dopa. These improvements c oincided with an approximately 4 0% reduction in Patient #6's daily L-Dopa dose. While these interim results are clinically meaningful, they should be interpreted cautiously given that they are taken from a single patient at a relatively early time point from a non-placebo-controlled, open-label trial, and may not be consistent with the results obtained for all of Cohort 2 or the trial more generally. 

&#160;

Clinical Efficacy Measures for Patient #6 Pre-Treatment and Three Months Post-Treatment 

Once we are able to optimize for vector delivery and coverage, we then intend to increase and optimize the dose and concentration of VY-AADC01 used in this trial. 

ALS Program: VY-SOD101 

Disease Overview 

ALS is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that leads to muscle weakness and loss of mobility as well as impaired speech, swallowing and breathing, with many patients requiring ventilator support as the disease progresses. The age of onset of ALS is typically around 50 years. However, most ALS patients only live an average of three years after initial symptoms appear, and it is estimated that as many as 30,000 patients in the United States are living with the disease according to the ALS Association. Familial, or inherited, ALS accounts for approximately 10% of ALS cases according to a 2006 article published in Neuron , and an estimated 20% of familial ALS is caused by mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1, or SOD1, gene according to a study published in the European Neurological Journal . Therefore, there are an estimated 600 patients in the United States with ALS caused by mutations in the SOD1 gene. 

The normal function of the SOD1 protein is to break down toxic molecules. Mutations in SOD1 have been shown to lead to the formation of toxic aggregates of the mutated protein, resulting in the death of motor neurons. Patients with familial ALS caused by certain mutations in the SOD1 gene progress more rapidly than patients with other forms of ALS, although the reason for this more rapid progression is unknown. 

There is currently only one FDA-approved treatment for ALS, riluzole, which has been shown to have only modest efficacy, prolonging life by just a few months. 

Our Treatment Approach 

We believe that AAV gene therapy is an attractive approach to treat monogenic ALS. Since the SOD1 gene mutations that cause ALS are toxic gain-of-function mutations that result in the overexpression of toxic versions of the protein, we believe that we can employ an AAV gene therapy approach that targets the knockdown of SOD1. In addition, the target cells, motor neurons and astrocytes, or cells supporting the neurons, reside within and surrounding the spinal cord and brain stem, which we believe can be effectively targeted with AAV gene therapy through intrathecal injection. The goal of VY-SOD101 is to knock down expression of SOD1, thereby reducing the level of mutated protein in the target cells in the spinal cord and brain stem to preserve motor neurons, slow the progression of the disease and prolong ventilator-independent survival. 

We believe that there is also the potential to leverage our approach for the treatment of other genetically defined forms of ALS. 

&#160;

Preclinical Studies Targeting SOD1 for Monogenic ALS 

Results from preclinical studies conducted at The Ohio State University support targeting mutant SOD1 for the treatment of monogenic ALS. In a non-human primate model, significant knockdown of SOD1 expression was observed following intrathecal injection of an AAV vector carrying target DNA designed to inhibit SOD1 expression. As shown in the figure below, SOD1 protein levels were successfully knocked down by greater than 80%, on average, in three non-human primates. SOD1 protein levels were normalized in this study to &#223;-actin as a control. In addition, SOD1 expression in motor neurons was observed to be knocked down by 95%, on average, in this cohort compared to a control group. No side effects from the treatment were reported.

The knockdown of SOD1 has also been observed to provide a significant survival benefit in an animal model. As shown below, mice with a SOD1 mutation treated with an AAV vector to knock down expression of the SOD1 gene achieved median survival of 87 days longer compared to mice treated with a control vector.

&#160;

&#160; We believe the viability of our proposed delivery approach for VY-SOD101 is supported by our proof-of-principle work demonstrating successful AAV gene therapy delivery to the spinal cord of non-human primates through intrathecal injection. 

Our Program Status 

VY-SOD101 is in preclinical development. We are optimizing the transgene, the promoter, the capsid and the dosing paradigm for this program. 

Through our product engine efforts, we are constructing and optimizing the transgene, including the microRNA, or miRNA, cassette that will be inserted into an AAV vector to achieve targeted knockdown of SOD1 expression with RNA interference, or RNAi, a biological process in which RNA molecules inhibit gene expression. The miRNA cassette is being optimized with respect to a number of characteristics that affect specificity for the SOD1 target gene and knockdown potency. Beyond the miRNA cassette sequence, we are optimizing other design aspects of the transgene to improve the overall effectiveness of our approach. We have screened more than 100 RNAi sequences, each represented by a bar in the graph below, and have successfully identified multiple, highly-potent RNAi sequences targeting SOD1, as highlighted by the yellow bars in the figure below: 

Overview of miRNA Target Sequences for Knockdown of SOD1 

We have identified a number of potential lead candidates for the VY-SOD101 program and are in the process of completing the necessary experiments to evaluate these potential lead candidates based upon multiple criteria, including safety, overall level of transgene expression achieved, distribution of transgene expression and specific cell types transduced. 

In addition, we are evaluating intrathecal dosing paradigms for the best distribution and delivery to the relevant regions of the spinal cord and brain stem. We are studying parameters such as site of intrathecal administration, volume of administration and rate of infusion to identify the dosing paradigm that we believe will translate into an effective therapy in patients. 

We expect to use relevant animal models to select our lead candidate for this program. Once a lead candidate and intrathecal dosing paradigm are identified, we plan to complete a number of preclinical studies to evaluate the safety and pharmacology of our lead candidate, including studies in animal models and IND-enabling studies. We expect that the first clinical trial of VY-SOD101 will enroll ALS patients with relevant mutations in the SOD1 gene, bypassing the more traditional approach of enrolling healthy volunteers. 

Friedreich's Ataxia Program: VY-FXN01 

Disease Overview 

&#160;

Friedreich's ataxia is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease resulting in poor coordination of legs and arms, progressive loss of the ability to walk, generalized weakness, loss of sensation, scoliosis, diabetes and cardiomyopathy as well as impaired vision, hearing and speech. The typical age of onset is 10 to 12 years, and life expectancy is severely reduced with patients generally dying of neurological and cardiac complications between the ages of 35 and 45. According to the Friedreich's Ataxia Research Alliance, there are approximately 6,400 patients living with the disease in the United States and there are currently no FDA-approved treatments for the disease. 

Friedreich's ataxia patients have mutations of the FXN gene that reduce production of the frataxin protein, resulting in the degeneration of sensory pathways and a variety of debilitating symptoms. Friedreich's ataxia is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning that a person must obtain a defective copy of the FXN gene from both parents in order to develop the condition. One healthy copy of the FXN gene, or 50% of normal frataxin protein levels, is sufficient to prevent the disease phenotype. We believe that this will provide the approximate level of gene replacement necessary for successful treatment with an AAV gene therapy. 

Our Treatment Approach 

We believe that an AAV gene therapy approach that delivers a functional version of the FXN gene to the sensory pathways through intrathecal injection has the potential to improve the balance, ability to walk, sensory capability, coordination, strength and functional capacity of Friedreich's ataxia patients. Unlike in many genetic disorders, most Friedreich's ataxia patients normally produce very low levels of the frataxin protein, which although insufficient to prevent the disease, exposes the patient's immune system to frataxin. This reduces the likelihood that the FXN gene delivered with AAV gene therapy will trigger harmful immune response. 

Preclinical Studies 

We conducted preclinical studies in non-human primates and achieved high FXN expression levels within the target sensory ganglia, or clusters of neurons, along the entire length of the spinal region following intrathecal injection. As depicted in the figure below, FXN expression was normalized as a fold increase relative to FXN expression in a human brain reference sample. The levels of FXN expression observed using an AAVrh10 vector were, on average, greater than FXN levels present in normal human brain tissue. The increased levels of FXN were achieved across the entire length of the spinal region including the cervical, thoracic, lumbar and sacral levels. Relatively low, but measurable, levels of FXN expression were also observed in the cerebellar dentate nucleus, another area of the CNS that is often affected in Friedreich's ataxia, and that is often considered difficult to target therapeutically. 

FXN Expression in Sensory Ganglia Following Intrathecal Delivery in Non-Human Primates 

&#160;

Our Program Status 

VY-FXN01 is currently in preclinical development. We are in the process of completing a number of AAV capsid screening experiments to identify the capsid that we believe is optimal for the VY-FXN01 program. We are comparing capsids in non-human primates following intrathecal injection, and we are evaluating these capsids based upon multiple criteria including safety, overall level of transgene expression achieved, distribution of transgene expression and the specific cell types transduced. In addition, we are optimizing the promoter and specific characteristics of the FXN transgene that we expect to use for VY-FXN01. We also have a significant effort focused on better understanding the clinical course of Friedreich's ataxia and identifying potential clinical endpoints for future clinical trials. 

Once we identify a lead candidate for this program, we plan to complete a number of preclinical studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of our lead candidate, including studies in relevant animal models of Friedreich's ataxia and IND-enabling studies. We expect that the first clinical trial of VY-FXN01 will enroll Friedreich's ataxia patients, bypassing the more traditional approach of enrolling healthy volunteers. 

Huntington's Disease Program: VY-HTT01 

Disease Overview 

Huntington's disease is a fatal, inherited neurodegenerative disorder that results in the progressive decline of motor and cognitive functions and a range of behavioral and psychiatric disturbances, including depression. The average age of onset is 40, with patients typically dying approximately 17 to 20 years following diagnosis. According to Huntington's Disease Society of America, Huntington's disease affects approximately 30,000 patients in the United States. Huntington's disease is caused by mutations in the huntingtin, or HTT, gene. Huntington's disease is an autosomal dominant disorder, which means that an individual is at risk of inheriting the disease if only one parent is affected. While the exact function of the HTT gene in healthy individuals is unknown, it is essential for normal development before birth and mutations in the HTT gene ultimately lead to the production of abnormal intracellular huntingtin protein aggregates that cause neuronal cell death. Currently, there are no approved treatments targeting the underlying cause of the disease and only one drug, tetrabenazine, has been approved for the treatment of the specific motor symptoms of Huntington's disease. 

Our Treatment Approach 

We believe that AAV gene therapy is an attractive approach to treat Huntington's disease. Since HTT mutations that cause Huntington's disease are toxic gain-of-function mutations, we believe that we can employ an AAV gene therapy approach designed to knock down expression of the HTT gene. In addition, the targeted cells for treatment primarily reside in discrete regions of the brain, the striatum and the cortex, that can be targeted with AAV gene therapy delivered directly to these site-specific regions. The goal of VY-HTT01 is to knock down expression of the HTT gene, thereby reducing the level of mutated HTT protein in these brain regions and slowing the progression of the cognitive and motor symptoms associated with Huntington's disease. We believe that we can use the same surgical approach for this program that has been used for VY-AADC01 delivery to the brain, allowing us to leverage prior clinical experience. 

Preclinical Studies 

Our collaborators at Genzyme have completed significant preclinical work focused on AAV gene therapy for Huntington's disease. Genzyme's preclinical studies in a mouse model of Huntington's disease demonstrated the safety and efficacy of AAV gene therapy targeting the knockdown of the HTT gene in the CNS. 

As shown in the figure below, using an AAV vector delivered directly to the CNS, HTT gene expression was observed to be reduced by over 50%, on average, in the treatment group as compared to the control group. HTT protein levels were normalized in this study to &#61538; -Tubulin as a control. No signs of toxicity were reported.

In addition, a significant functional benefit was observed in the treatment group, as measured by the Porsolt Swim Test, which is commonly used to measure depressive behavior in mice. In the figure below, both normal, or wild type mice, and mice with the mutation, or YAC128, were evaluated following treatment with either an AAV vector targeting the knockdown of the HTT gene, labeled as AAV2/1-miRNA-Htt below, or a negative control vector, labeled as AAV2/1-Null below. As expected, knocking down HTT in the control mice was observed to have no functional impact.

Our Program Status 

VY-HTT01 is currently in preclinical development. Genzyme's Huntington's disease gene therapy program was combined with our efforts in connection with entering into our collaboration agreement in February 2015. We are optimizing the transgene, the capsid and the dosing paradigm for this program. 

Through our product engine efforts, we are constructing and optimizing the transgene, including the miRNA cassette that will be inserted into an AAV vector to achieve targeted knockdown of HTT expression with RNAi. We are optimizing the miRNA cassette with respect to a number of characteristics that affect specificity for the HTT target gene and knockdown potency. Beyond the miRNA cassette sequence, we are optimizing other design aspects of the transgene to improve the overall effectiveness of our approach. This work leverages the learnings from the VY-SOD101 program, as the miRNA cassettes designed are anticipated to be applicable to the VY-HTT01 program. We are also optimizing the promoter that we expect to use for VY-HTT01. 

In addition, we are in the process of confirming in non-human primate studies that the current lead capsid is optimal for the VY-HTT01 program. Capsids are being compared in non-human primates following direct injection into the striatum or intrathecal injection, and are being evaluated based upon multiple criteria, including safety, overall level of transgene expression achieved, distribution of transgene expression and the specific cell types transduced. 

We are evaluating direct injection into the striatum and intrathecal dosing paradigms for the best distribution and delivery to the relevant regions of the brain, the striatum and cortex. Parameters such as site of administration, volume of administration and rate of infusion are being studied to identify the dosing paradigm that we believe will translate into an effective therapy in patients. 

Once we identify a lead candidate and dosing paradigm for this program, we plan to complete a number of preclinical studies to evaluate the safety, pharmacology and efficacy of our lead candidate, including studies in relevant animal models and IND-enabling studies. We expect that the first clinical trial of VY-HTT01 will enroll Huntington's disease patients, bypassing the more traditional approach of enrolling healthy volunteers. 

SMA Program: VY-SMN101 

Disease Overview 

SMA is an inherited neuromuscular disease that results in progressive muscle weakness and paralysis. It is estimated that SMA affects approximately 10,000 patients in the United States according to the SMA Foundation. Patients with SMA may have difficulty sitting, standing, walking, eating and breathing, depending upon the severity of the disease. There are four primary types of SMA, with SMA type I being the most severe. SMA type I is the leading genetic cause of death in infancy and early childhood in the United States and accounts for approximately 50% of all SMA cases. Infants affected by SMA type I never sit or stand and usually die of respiratory failure before two years of age. SMA type II is of intermediate severity, with onset at approximately seven to 18 months of age and a slower progression compared to type I. Children with SMA type II will generally sit, but never stand. SMA type III is less severe, presenting at 18 months of age or later, and SMA type IV is a mild adult subtype generally presenting in patients between 20 and 30 years of age. There are currently no approved treatments for any type of SMA. 

SMA is caused primarily by mutations of the SMN1 gene, which eliminate full-length protein expression of the SMN1 gene. Clinical severity is related to the number of copies of the SMN2 gene, which is able to produce small amounts of functional protein. The precise role of the SMN protein in the pathogenesis of SMA is unknown. SMA is an autosomal recessive disorder. One healthy copy of the SMN1 gene, or 50% of normal SMN1 protein levels, is sufficient to prevent the disease phenotype. We believe this will provide the approximate level of gene replacement necessary for successful treatment with an AAV gene therapy. 

Our Treatment Approach 

&#160;

We believe that an AAV gene therapy that delivers a functional version of the SMN1 gene to the spinal cord and brainstem through intrathecal injection has the potential to prolong survival, increase the amount of time of independent respiration and improve clinical and electrophysiological measures of motor function in severe SMA patients. Unlike many genetic disorders, most SMA patients normally produce very low levels of the SMN1 protein, which although insufficient to prevent the disease, exposes the patient's immune system to the SMN1 protein. This reduces the likelihood that the SMN1 gene delivered with AAV gene therapy will trigger a harmful immune response. 

Preclinical Studies 

Our collaborators at Genzyme have completed significant preclinical work focused on AAV gene therapy for SMA. Preclinical animal model studies demonstrated the safety and efficacy of SMN1 gene replacement delivered directly into the CNS. 

Studies completed in a transgenic mouse model of SMA demonstrated that the SMN1 gene could be successfully delivered to the spinal cord in a vector dose-dependent fashion, as shown in the figure below. At the highest AAV dose tested, 5 &#215; 10 10 vg, or 5e10 vg, the average SMN1 expression observed in the lumbar region of the spinal cords of the treatment group was approximately 150% of the control group.

We believe the viability of our proposed delivery approach for VY-SMN101 is supported by our proof-of-principle work demonstrating successful AAV gene therapy delivery to the spinal cord of non-human primates through intrathecal injection. 

Our Program Status 

VY-SMN101 is currently in preclinical development. Genzyme's SMA gene therapy program was contributed to us in connection with entering into our collaboration agreement in February 2015. 

We are in the process of completing a number of AAV capsid screening experiments to identify the capsid that we believe is optimal for the VY-SMN101 program. We are screening capsids in non-human primates following intrathecal injection, and are evaluating based upon multiple criteria, including safety, overall level of transgene expression achieved, distribution of transgene expression and the specific cell types transduced. Genzyme has already optimized the promoter and transgene for VY-SMN101. 

Once we identify a lead candidate and dosing paradigm for this program, we plan to complete a number of preclinical studies to evaluate the safety, pharmacology and efficacy of our lead candidate, including studies in relevant animal models and IND-enabling studies. We expect that the first clinical trial of VY-SMN101 will enroll SMA patients, bypassing the more traditional approach of enrolling healthy volunteers. 

Future Programs 

We are evaluating additional severe CNS diseases that could be treated using AAV gene therapy through application of either a gene replacement or a gene knockdown approach. Beyond these approaches, we are also actively exploring additional potential treatment methods that can utilize an AAV vector, including the direct delivery of monoclonal antibodies to the CNS, as well as gene editing to correct or delete a gene in the cell genome. We believe that AAV-based delivery of antibodies to the CNS could be used to treat diseases such as frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease and that gene editing could be applied to a number of different genetic diseases.

Collaborations and License Agreements 

Genzyme Collaboration 

In February 2015, we entered into a strategic collaboration with Genzyme to leverage our combined expertise and assets to develop AAV gene therapies for CNS diseases. Under the agreement, we retained U.S. rights to VY-AADC01 and VY-FXN01, as well as at least co-commercialization rights to VY-HTT01 in the United States. VY-SOD101 is not included as part of the Genzyme collaboration and we retain unencumbered worldwide rights to this program. We have granted Genzyme an exclusive option to license, develop and commercialize (i) ex-U.S. rights to the following programs, which we refer to as the Split Territory Programs, VY-AADC01, VY-FXN01, a future program to be designated by Genzyme, or Future Program, and VY-HTT01 with an incremental option to co-commercialize VY-HTT01 in the United States, and (ii) worldwide rights to VY-SMN101. Genzyme's option for the Split Territory Programs and VY-SMN101 is triggered following the completion of the first proof-of-principle human clinical study, or POP Study, on a program-by-program basis. 

Prior to any option exercise by Genzyme, we will collaborate with Genzyme in the development of products under each Split Territory Program and VY-SMN101 pursuant to a written development plan and under the guidance of an alliance joint steering committee, comprised of an equal number of our employees and Genzyme employees. 

We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop products under each Split Territory Program and VY-SMN101 through completion of the applicable POP Study. During the development of our joint programs, our and Genzyme's activities are guided by a Development Advisory Committee, which we refer to as the DAC. The DAC may elect to utilize certain Genzyme technology relating to the VY-AADC01 program, the VY-HTT01 Program, or generally with the manufacture of Split Territory Program products. 

We will be solely responsible for all costs incurred in connection with the development of Split Territory Programs and VY-SMN101 products prior to option exercise, subject to the following: (i) Genzyme may agree to provide additional funds in return for agreed-upon payback or other agreed economic terms; (ii) we may request, and upon mutual agreement, Genzyme will provide in-kind services valued at up to $5.0 million; and (iii) expenses of certain activities under the VY-HTT01 development plan may be funded to the extent such activities are reimbursed through financial support that Genzyme may receive from a disease foundation group. 

Other than the VY-AADC01 program (for which a POP Study has already been commenced), if we do not initiate a POP Study for a given Split Territory Program by December 31, 2026 (or for the Future Program by the tenth anniversary of the date the Future Program is nominated by Genzyme), and Genzyme has not terminated this agreement with respect to such Collaboration program, then Genzyme shall be entitled, at its sole and exclusive remedy, to a credit of $10.0 million for each such program against other amounts payable by Genzyme under the Collaboration. However, if we do not initiate a POP Study by such date as a result of a regulatory delay or a force majeure event, such time period shall be extended for so long as such regulatory delay or force majeure event continues and we shall not be deemed to have failed to initiate a POP Study. 

Post-Option Exercise 

Upon Genzyme's exercise of its option to license a given product in a Split Territory Program, which we refer to as a Split Territory Licensed Product, we will have sole responsibility for the development of such Split Territory Licensed Product in the United States and Genzyme shall have sole responsibility for development of such Split Territory Licensed Product in the rest of the world. We and Genzyme will have shared responsibility for execution of ongoing development of such Split Territory Licensed Product that is not specific to either of our territories, including costs associated therewith. 

&#160;

A steering committee for each Program will review and approve a written plan and budget for each relevant program. In addition, all development activities to be undertaken with respect to each Split Territory Licensed Product by or on behalf of either party will be set forth in a written development plan. 

Genzyme shall have the sole right to develop VY-SMN101 worldwide. Genzyme shall be responsible for all of the development costs that occur after the option exercise date for VY-SMN101. 

Commercialization 

We shall be solely responsible, at our expense, for all commercialization activities relating to Split Territory Licensed Products in the United States. Genzyme shall be solely responsible, at its expense, for all commercialization activities relating to Split Territory Licensed Products in the rest of the world. If Genzyme has exercised the co-commercialization option, Genzyme will be the lead party responsible for all commercialization activities relating to the Huntington's disease product in the United States. If Genzyme has exercised its option to co-commercialize VY-HTT01 in the United States, commercialization activities that are undertaken for VY-HTT01 in the United States will be set forth in reasonable detail in a written commercialization plan. 

Genzyme shall be solely responsible, at its expense, for all commercialization activities relating to VY-SMN101 worldwide. Genzyme shall use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize VY-SMN101 in each major market specified in the agreement where Genzyme has obtained required governmental approvals 

Financial Terms 

We received $65.0 million in upfront cash, a $30.0 million upfront equity investment and an in-kind commitment of $5.0 million, totalling $100 million. If Genzyme exercises its option for a collaboration program, with the exception of VY-AADC01, Genzyme is required to make an option exercise payment of $20.0 million or $30.0 million for each program. In addition, Genzyme shall pay us up to $645 million across product programs upon the achievement of specified regulatory and commercial milestones. 

In addition, to the extent any Split Territory Licensed Product or the VY-SMN101 Product is commercialized, we are entitled to receive tiered royalty payments ranging from the mid-single digits to mid-teens based on a percentage of net sales. Genzyme is entitled to receive royalty payments from us related to sales of the Split Territory Licensed Products ranging from the low-single digits to mid-single digits, depending on whether we use Genzyme technology in a Split Territory Licensed Product or the VY-SMN101 Product. If Genzyme exercises its option to co-commercialize VY-HTT01 in the United States, we will share any profits or losses from VY-HTT01 product sales. 

Term And Termination; Remedies 

Our collaboration agreement with Genzyme will continue in effect until the later of (i) the expiration of the last to expire of the option rights and (ii) the expiration of all payment obligations unless sooner terminated by us or Genzyme. 

We and Genzyme have customary termination rights including the right to terminate for an uncured material breach of the agreement committed by the other party and Genzyme has the right to terminate for convenience. 

License Agreement with University of Massachusetts 

On January 30, 2014, we entered into a license agreement with the University of Massachusetts, or UMass, pursuant to which UMass granted us an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license to certain of its licensed patents to make, have made, use, offer for sale, sell, have sold and import certain licensed products in the field of human diseases that use gene therapy applications. Our license is subject to any rights that may be required to be granted to the 

&#160;

government of the United States, and UMass reserves the right to use the licensed patents for education and research and, with our consent, for non-commercial patient care, without the payment of any compensation to us. 

In consideration for rights granted to us under the agreement, we made an upfront payment of $200,000 to UMass. We are obligated to pay UMass (i) low-single digit royalty payments based on net sales of the licensed products, (ii) annual maintenance payments of $30,000, which are creditable against royalties payable in such period, (iii) minimum aggregate annual royalty payments that are creditable against royalties payable in such period, with the minimum aggregate amount payable being in the low-six digits for each of the first four years of this agreement and a minimum aggregate amount payable being in the mid-six digits for each year, thereafter, (iv) milestone payments of up to $1.8 million, per licensed product for the first five licensed products, based on the achievement of development and regulatory milestones and (v) a percentage of sublicensing income that decreases over time from low double digit percentages to a mid-single digit percentage. We also agreed to reimburse UMass approximately $678,000 for patent related expenses incurred by UMass as of the effective date of the agreement over a two year period. 

Under the agreement, we agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop licensed products and to introduce such licensed products into the commercial market, and further agreed to certain development milestones. 

The agreement will terminate on the date that is the later of (i) seven years after the first commercial sale of the last licensed product under the agreement or (ii) such time as there are no valid claims covering a licensed product. We have the right to terminate the agreement for any reason upon 90 days prior written notice, and we and UMass have the right to terminate the agreement if the other party fails to cure a written breach within 60 days of receiving written notice of such breach. 

MassBiologics and UMass Collaboration Agreement 

On October 20, 2014, we entered into a Collaboration Agreement with UMass and MassBiologics, pursuant to which we shall (i) fund certain projects that will be conducted by UMass or MassBiologics, (ii) fund certain educational programs of UMass, including post-doctoral research at our laboratories beginning in 2015 and an annual lecture series beginning in 2015 and (iii) collaborate with MassBiologics to establish scalable processes for manufacturing recombinant AAV vector products using cGMP. 

In November 2014, we agreed to the first project under this agreement whereby we will fund approximately $2.9 million over a 16-month period for certain research and development services performed by MassBiologics. The project commenced in January 2015. If the agreement is terminated for any reason, we are obligated to fund the remaining balance of the total price of all work completed and any other out of pocket costs incurred by MassBiologics. We and UMass and/or MassBiologics may agree to conduct other projects in the future, the terms of which will be agreed upon at such time. 

This agreement will remain in effect for a period of five years and automatically renews for additional one year periods. Either party has the right to terminate this agreement, once in each renewal period, for any reason upon providing the other party with 90 days written notice or in the event of a material breach of the agreement by the other party that is not cured within 60 days of written notice. 

We will own all intellectual property rights generated under this agreement, either by our employees, UMass and/or MassBiologics employees, or jointly by our employees and UMass and/or MassBiologics employees, that cover AAV materials. We and UMass and/or MassBiologics, as applicable, will jointly own any intellectual property rights generated under this agreement jointly by our employees and the employees of UMass and/or MassBiologics, as applicable, that do not cover AAV materials. 

L icense Agreement with REGENX 

&#160;

In May 2014, we entered into a license agreement with REGENXBIO Inc., formerly known as ReGenX Biosciences, LLC, or REGENX, for the development and commercialization of gene therapies to treat ALS, Friedreich's ataxia and Huntington's disease. Under this license agreement, REGENX granted us a non-exclusive worldwide license to make, have made and use its technology solely for internal research and preclinical development for the identification of specific vectors that could be commercialized. Following identification, we have an option to obtain a non-exclusive worldwide license under the licensed intellectual property to a single specified AAV vector to make, have made, use, import, sell and offer for sale licensed products using the selected vector, which can be exercised for each of ALS, Friedreich's ataxia, or Huntington's disease. 

Under the terms of this license agreement, we paid REGENX an upfront fee of $500,000, an extension fee of $100,000 and are required to make an annual maintenance fee in the five digits. If we exercise any or all of the commercial options by a specified date, we will be required to make upfront payments to REGENX of up to $1.5 million and to pay to REGENX an annual maintenance fee payment ranging from five digits to six digits depending on the number of disease indication options exercised. In addition, we will be required to pay to RENGENX up to $5.0 million in milestone fees per disease indication, mid- to high-single digit royalty percentages on net sales of licensed products, and low- to mid-single digit percentages of any sublicense fees that we receive from sublicensees for the licensed intellectual property rights. 

Our license agreement with REGENX will expire upon the expiration, lapse, abandonment, or invalidation of the last claim of the licensed intellectual property to expire, lapse, or become abandoned or unenforceable in all the countries of the world. The license agreement will automatically terminate if we do not exercise any commercial options within a specified time period after entering into the license agreement, which may be extended. We may terminate the license agreement upon a specified number of days prior written notice. REGENX may terminate the license agreement if we, our affiliates, or sublicensees experience insolvency, if we are more than a specified number of days late in paying money due under the license agreement, or, effective immediately, if we or our affiliates commence any action against REGENX or its licensors to declare or render any claim of the licensed patent rights invalid or unenforceable. Either party may terminate the license agreement for material breach that is not cured within a specified number of days. 

Competition 

The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense and dynamic competition to develop new technologies and proprietary therapies. Any product candidates that we successfully develop into products and commercialize may compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. While we believe that our product engine, product programs, product candidates and scientific expertise in the fields of gene therapy and neuroscience provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from various sources, including larger and better-funded pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as from academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. 

We are aware of several companies focused on developing gene therapies in various indications, including bluebird bio, Inc., Agilis Biotherapeutics, LLC, Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation, Asklepios BioPharmaceutical, Inc., Audentes Therapeutics, Inc., Avalanche Biotechnologies, Inc., Bamboo Therapeutics, Dimension Therapeutics, Inc., GenSight Biologies SA, NightstaRx Ltd, REGENX, uniQure NV, or uniQure, and Spark Therapeutics, Inc. as well as several companies addressing other methods for modifying genes and regulating gene expression. Any advances in gene therapy technology made by a competitor may be used to develop therapies that could compete against any of our product candidates. 

We expect that VY-AADC01 will compete with a variety of therapies currently marketed and in development for advanced Parkinson's disease, including DBS mark et ed by Medtronic plc, St. Jude Medical, Inc. and other medical device companies, DUOPA/Duodopa marketed by AbbVie Inc., as well as potentially AMT-090 or AAV-GDNF in development at uniQure NV, or uniQure, OXB-102/Prosavin in development at Oxford Biomedica plc, and ND0612H in development at NeuroDerm Ltd. 

We expect that our preclinical programs will compete with a variety of therapies in development, including: 

&#160;

&#183; 

VY-SOD101 for a monogenic form of ALS will potentially compete with IONIS-SOD1R x being developed by Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or I oni s, in collaboration with Biogen and Tirasemtiv being developed by Cytokinetics, Inc., or Cytokinetics; 

&#183; 

VY-FXN01 for Friedreich's ataxia will potentially compete with RG2833 being developed by BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc., AAV-FXN being developed by Annapurna Therapeuti c s, AAV-FXN being developed by Bamboo Therapeutics, and frataxin targeted gene therapy being developed by Agilis Biotherapeutics, LLC in collaboration with Intrexon Corporation and BB-FA being developed by BioBlast Pharma Ltd., or BioBlast; 

&#183; 

VY-HTT01 for Huntington's disease will potentially compete with IONIS -HTTR x being developed by I onis in collaboration with F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd., or Roche, gene editing approach being developed by Sangamo Biosciences, Inc. in collaboration with Shire plc, and another gene therapy being developed by uniQure; and 

&#183; 

VY-SMN101 for spinal muscular atrophy will potentially compete with AVXS-101 be ing developed by AveXis Inc., IONIS -SMN RX being developed by Ioni s and Biogen, LMI-070 being developed by Novartis AC, RO6885247 being developed by PTC Therapeutics, Inc. and Roche, BBrm02 being developed by BioBlast and CK-2127107 being developed by Cytokinetics in collaboration with Astellas Pharma US, Inc. 

In addition, companies that are currently engaged in gene therapy for non-CNS diseases could at any time decide to develop gene therapies for CNS diseases. 

Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of product candidates and commercializing those product candidates. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for product candidates and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors' product candidates may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any product candidate we may commercialize and may render our treatments obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our product candidates. 

Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and subject registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. 

We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new product candidates enter the market and advanced technologies become available. We expect any product candidates that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price, and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payers. 

Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their product candidates more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. 

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

Overview 

We strive to protect the proprietary technology, inventions, and to enhance improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business, including seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets and know-how relating to our proprietary technology platform, on continuing technological innovation and on in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain the strength of our position in the field of gene therapy that may be important for the development of our business. We additionally may rely on regulatory protection afforded through data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions where available. 

Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to: obtain and maintain patent and other protections for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the valid enforceable patents and intellectual property rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, having made, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable licenses, patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. In some cases, these rights may need to be enforced by third party licensors. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial products and methods of manufacturing the same. 

We have 28 patent applications pending in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. At least 20 patent applications have been filed and are pending in the United States and foreign jurisdictions by or on behalf of universities which have granted us exclusive license rights to the technology. To date, 25 patents have issued to our licensors which have granted us exclusive license rights to the technology. To date, 28 patents have issued to our licensors which have granted us non-exclusive license rights to the technology with 10 applications pending. Our policy is to file patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements to inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We seek United States and international patent protection for a variety of technologies, including: research tools and methods, methods for transferring genetic material into cells, AAV-based biological products, methods of designing novel AAV constructs, methods for treating diseases of interest and methods for manufacturing our AAV-based products. We also intend to seek patent protection or rely upon trade secret rights to protect other technologies that may be used to discover and validate targets and that may be used to identify and develop novel biological products. We seek protection, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements. We are a party to various other license agreements that give us rights to use specific technologies in our research and development.

To the extent that the valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3. A financial instrument&#8217;s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. &#160; 

Government Regulation 

Biological products, including gene therapy products, are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&#38;C Act, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act, and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. Both the FD&#38;C Act and the PHS Act and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, purity, potency, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, import, export, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biological products. FDA approval must be obtained before clinical testing of biological products, and each clinical study protocol for a gene therapy product is reviewed by the FDA and, in some instances, the NIH, through its RAC. FDA approval also must be obtained before marketing of biological products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and we may not be able to obtain the required regulatory approvals. 

Within the FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, regulates gene therapy products. CBER works closely with the NIH and its RAC, which makes recommendations to the NIH on gene therapy issues and engages in a public discussion of scientific, safety, ethical and societal issues related to proposed and ongoing gene therapy protocols. The FDA and the NIH have published guidance documents with respect to the development and submission of gene therapy protocols. The FDA also has published guidance documents related to, among other things, gene therapy products in general, their preclinical assessment, observing subjects involved in gene therapy studies for delayed adverse events, viral shedding, environmental assessments, potency testing, and chemistry, manufacturing and control information in gene therapy INDs. FDA guidance documents provide the agency's current thinking about a particular subject, but are not legally binding. 

U.S. Biological Products Development Process 

The process required by the FDA before a biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 

&#183; 

completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to good laboratory practice, or GLPs, and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations; 

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of an application for an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 

&#183; 

performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA's regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practice, or GCPs, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use; 

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials; 

&#183; 

satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product's identity, strength, quality and purity; 

&#160;

&#183; 

potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical study sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and 

&#183; 

FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA. 

Before testing any biological product candidate, including a gene therapy product, in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical trials, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. 

Where a gene therapy study is conducted at, or sponsored by, institutions receiving NIH funding for recombinant DNA research, prior to the submission of an IND to the FDA, a protocol and related documentation is submitted to and the study is registered with the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities, or OBA, pursuant to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules, or NIH Guidelines. Compliance with the NIH Guidelines is mandatory for investigators at institutions receiving NIH funds for research involving recombinant DNA, however many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. The NIH is responsible for convening the RAC, a federal advisory committee, that discusses protocols that raise novel or particularly important scientific, safety or ethical considerations at one of its quarterly public meetings. The OBA will notify the FDA of the RAC's decision regarding the necessity for full public review of a gene therapy protocol. RAC proceedings and reports are posted to the OBA website and may be accessed by the public. 

The clinical study sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing typically continues after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical study on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin. With gene therapy protocols, if the FDA allows the IND to proceed, but the RAC decides that full public review of the protocol is warranted, the FDA will request at the completion of its IND review that sponsors delay initiation of the protocol until after completion of the RAC review process. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, studies may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such studies. 

Clinical trials involve the administration of the biological product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the study sponsor's control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical study will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA's regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, each clinical study must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical study will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of study participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical study subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical study until completed. Clinical trials involving recombinant or synthetic (or both) nucleic acid molecules performed at or sponsored by an institution that receives any NIH funding for such research also must be reviewed by an institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees basic and clinical research conducted at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment. 

&#160;

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 

&#183; 

Phase 1. The biological product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. 

&#183; 

Phase 2. The biological product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. 

&#183; 

Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. 

Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. The FDA recommends that sponsors observe subjects for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events for a 15-year period, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by ten years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire, of trial subjects. 

During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA, the NIH and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor's initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 

Human gene therapy products are a new category of therapeutics. Because this is a relatively new and expanding area of novel therapeutic interventions, there can be no assurance as to the length of the study period, the number of patients the FDA will require to be enrolled in the studies in order to establish the safety, efficacy, purity and potency of human gene therapy products, or that the data generated in these studies will be acceptable to the FDA to support marketing approval. The NIH and the FDA have a publicly accessible database, the Genetic Modification Clinical Research Information System which includes information on gene transfer studies and serves as an electronic tool to facilitate the reporting and analysis of adverse events on these studies. 

Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act, emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be 

&#160;

conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 

U.S. Review and Approval Processes 

After the completion of clinical trials of a biological product, FDA approval of a BLA, must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biological product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human studies, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 

Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual product fee for biologics and an annual establishment fee on facilities used to manufacture prescription biologics. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. 

Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and potent, or effective, for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product's identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required. 

Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and GCP requirements. To assure cGMP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control. 

Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that usually describes all of the 

&#160;

specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. 

If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk management plan, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological product's safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. 

One of the performance goals agreed to by the FDA under the PDUFA is to review standard BLAs in 10 months from filing and priority BLAs in six months from filing, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date. 

Post-Approval Requirements 

Maintaining substantial compliance with applicable federal, state, and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products continues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP. We will rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of any products that we may commercialize. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products, include reporting of cGMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer's tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products. 

We also must comply with the FDA's advertising and promotion requirements, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product's approved labeling (known as "off-label use"), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, 

&#160;

restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 

Biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMPs and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. 

Orphan Drug Designation 

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 

If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same biological product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same biological product as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor's product for the same indication or disease. If a biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. 

Special FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs 

The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, accelerated approval, priority review and breakthrough therapy designation, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of biological products that are intended for the treatment of serious or life threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new biological products to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures. To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a biological product is intended to treat a serious or life threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. 

The FDA may give a priority review designation to biological products that offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. Most products that are eligible for fast track designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review. 

&#160;

In addition, biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the biological product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a biological product receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoint, and the biological product may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures. 

Moreover, under the provisions of the new Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, enacted in 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a "breakthrough therapy." A breakthrough therapy is defined as a biological product that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the biological product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Biological products designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. 

Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Furthermore, fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation, do not change the standards for approval and may not ultimately expedite the development or approval process. 

U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 

Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product's approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved biological product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA. 

A biological product can obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued "Written Request" for such a study. 

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or Affordable Care Act, signed into law on March 23, 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be similar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product. This amendment to the PHS Act attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which 

&#160;

requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical trial or trials, including clinical pharmacology trials and assessment of immunogenicity. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structure of biological products, as well as the process by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation that are still being worked out by the FDA. 

A reference biologic is granted twelve years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product. On February 4, 2015, President Obama released his proposed budget for fiscal year 2016 and proposed to cut this twelve-year period of exclusivity down to seven years. He also proposed to prohibit additional periods of exclusivity for brand biologics due to minor changes in product formulations, a practice often referred to as "evergreening." The first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against other biologics submitting under the abbreviated approval pathway for the lesser of (i) one year after the first commercial marketing, (ii) 18 months after approval if there is no legal challenge, (iii) 18 months after the resolution in the applicant's favor of a lawsuit challenging the biologics' patents if an application has been submitted or (iv) 42 months after the application has been approved if a lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period. 

Other Healthcare Laws 

Although we currently do not have any products on the market, we may be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states in which we conduct our business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations, many of which may become more applicable to us if our product candidates are approved and we begin commercialization. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. 

In addition, the Affordable Care Act intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. With regard to biopharmaceutical products, in addition to the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 included in the Affordable Care Act, among other things, the Affordable Care Act expanded and increased industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs and made changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare prescription drug benefit. We continue to evaluate the effect that the Affordable Care Act has on our business. In the coming years, additional legislative and regulatory changes could be made to governmental health programs that could significantly impact the biopharmaceutical industry and the success of our product candidates. The Affordable Care Act, as well as other federal, state and foreign healthcare reform measures that have been and may be adopted in the future, could harm our future revenues. 

Additional Regulation 

In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable 

&#160;

for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations. 

U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 

The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, to which we are subject, prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. 

Government Regulation Outside of the United States 

In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries. 

Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. 

If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 

Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement for Biopharmaceutical Products 

Sales of our products, when and if approved for marketing, will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state, and foreign government health care programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products, drugs and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our product candidates or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover our product candidates could reduce physician usage of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. 

Employees 

As of December 31 , 2015, we employed 52 full-time employees in the United States, including 42 in research and development and 10 in general and administrative. We have one part-time employee. Twenty-t hree of our employees have either an M.D. or a Ph.D. We have never had a work stoppage, and none of our employees is represented by a labor organization or under any collective-bargaining arrangements. We consider our employee relations to be good. 

Facilities 

&#160;

We lease our office and laboratory space, which consists of approximately 19,000 square feet located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Our lease expires in 2019. &#160; In January 2016, we signed an agreement to lease an additional facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts to support our continued growth. The additional facility will include laboratory and office space, and is projected to be ready for occupancy in early 2017. We believe our current office and laboratory space, combined with the new lease, is sufficient to meet our needs until the expiration of our leases.

In the future, we may become party to legal matters and claims arising in the ordinary course of business, the resolution of which we do not anticipate would have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows .
