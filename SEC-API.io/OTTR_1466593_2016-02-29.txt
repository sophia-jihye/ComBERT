 Item 1. BUSINESS &#160;

(a) General Development of Business 

&#160;

Otter Tail Power Company was incorporated in 1907 under the laws of the State of Minnesota. In 2001, the name was changed to &#8220;Otter Tail Corporation&#8221; to more accurately represent the broader scope of consolidated operations and the name Otter Tail Power Company (OTP) was retained for use by the electric utility. On July 1, 2009, Otter Tail Corporation completed a holding company reorganization whereby OTP, which had previously been operated as a division of Otter Tail Corporation, became a wholly owned subsidiary of the new parent holding company named Otter Tail Corporation (the Company). The new parent holding company was incorporated in June 2009 under the laws of the State of Minnesota in connection with the holding company reorganization. The Company&#8217;s executive offices are located at 215 South Cascade Street, P.O. Box 496, Fergus Falls, Minnesota 56538-0496 and 4334 18 th Avenue SW, Suite 200, P.O. Box 9156, Fargo, North Dakota 58106-9156. The Company&#8217;s telephone number is (866) 410-8780.

&#160;

The Company makes available free of charge at its website (www.ottertail.com) its annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, Forms 3, 4 and 5 filed on behalf of directors and executive officers and any amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Information on the Company&#8217;s website is not deemed to be incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

&#160;

Otter Tail Corporation and its subsidiaries conduct business primarily in the United States. The Company had approximately 2,005 full-time employees in its continuing operations at December 31, 2015. The Company&#8217;s businesses have been classified in three segments to be consistent with its business strategy and the reporting and review process used by the Company&#8217;s chief operating decision maker. The three segments are Electric, Manufacturing and Plastics.

&#160;

Over the last five years, the Company sold several businesses in execution of an announced strategy to realign its business portfolio to reduce its risk profile and dedicate a greater portion of its resources toward electric utility operations. In 2011, the Company sold Idaho Pacific Holdings, Inc., its Food Ingredient Processing business, and E.W. Wylie Corporation, its trucking company, which was included in its former Wind Energy segment. In January 2012, the Company sold the assets of Aviva Sports, Inc., a recreational equipment manufacturer. In February 2012, the Company sold DMS Health Technologies, Inc., its former Health Services segment business. In November 2012, the Company completed the sale of the assets of the Company&#8217;s wind tower company, and exited the wind tower manufacturing business. On February 8, 2013 the Company sold substantially all the assets of its dock and boatlift company. On February 28, 2015 the Company sold the assets of AEV, Inc., its former energy and electrical construction contractor headquartered in Moorhead, Minnesota, and on April 30, 2015 the Company sold Foley Company, its former water, wastewater, power and industrial construction contractor headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri. With the sale of these two companies in 2015 the Company eliminated its Construction segment.

&#160;

On September 1, 2015 the Company acquired the assets of Impulse Manufacturing Inc. (Impulse) of Dawsonville, Georgia for $30.8 million in cash, subject to a post-closing adjustment. Impulse, a full-service metal fabricator located 30 miles north of Atlanta, Georgia, recorded revenues of $27 million in 2014. Impulse offers a wide range of metal fabrication services ranging from simple laser cutting services and high volume stamping to complex weldments and assemblies for metal fabrication buyers and original equipment manufacturers. The newly acquired business will operate under the name BTD-Georgia.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; Electric includes the production, transmission, distribution and sale of electric energy in Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota by OTP. In addition, OTP is a participant in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. (MISO) markets. OTP&#8217;s operations have been the Company&#8217;s primary business since 1907. &#160;

&#183; Manufacturing consists of businesses in the following manufacturing activities: contract machining, metal parts stamping, fabrication and painting, and production of material and handling trays and horticultural containers. These businesses have manufacturing facilities in Georgia, Illinois and Minnesota and sell products primarily in the United States. &#160;

&#183; Plastics consists of businesses producing polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe at plants in North Dakota and Arizona. The PVC pipe is sold primarily in the upper Midwest and Southwest regions of the United States. &#160;

OTP is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company&#8217;s manufacturing and plastic pipe businesses are owned by its wholly owned subsidiary, Varistar Corporation (Varistar). The Company&#8217;s corporate operating costs include items such as corporate staff and overhead costs, the results of the Company&#8217;s captive insurance company and other items excluded from the measurement of operating segment performance that are not allocated to its subsidiary companies. Corporate assets consist primarily of cash, prepaid expenses, investments and fixed assets. Corporate is not an operating segment. Rather, it is added to operating segment totals to reconcile to totals on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements.

&#160;

The Company has lowered its overall risk by investing in rate base growth opportunities in its Electric segment and divesting certain nonelectric operating companies that no longer fit the Company&#8217;s portfolio criteria. This strategy has provided a more predictable earnings stream, improved the Company&#8217;s credit quality and preserved its ability to fund the dividend. The Company&#8217;s goal is to deliver annual growth in earnings per share between four to seven percent over the next several years, using 2013 non-GAAP earnings as the base for measurement. The growth is expected to come from the substantial increase in the Company&#8217;s regulated utility rate base and from planned increased earnings from existing capacity already in place at the Company&#8217;s manufacturing and plastic pipe businesses, as well as the 2015 acquisition of BTD-Georgia and the facilities expansion and addition of paint services at BTD&#8217;s Minnesota facilities, which will be completed in 2016. The Company will continue to review its business portfolio to see where additional opportunities exist to improve its risk profile, improve credit metrics and generate additional sources of cash to support the growth opportunities in its electric utility. The Company will also evaluate opportunities to allocate capital to potential acquisitions in its Manufacturing segment. Over time, the Company expects the electric utility business will provide approximately 75% to 85% of its overall earnings. The Company expects its manufacturing and plastic pipe businesses will provide 15% to 25% of its earnings, and will continue to be a fundamental part of its strategy. The actual mix of earnings from continuing operations in 2015 was 83% from the electric utility and 17% from the manufacturing and plastic pipe businesses, including unallocated corporate costs.

&#160;

In evaluating its portfolio of operating companies, the Company looks for the following characteristics:

&#160;

&#183; A threshold level of net earnings and a return on invested capital in excess of the Company&#8217;s weighted average cost of capital within three years of the acquisition. &#183; Is manufacturing centric with a sustainable competitive advantage. &#183; An ability to quickly adapt to changing economic cycles. &#183; A strong management team committed to operational excellence. &#160;

ELECTRIC 

&#160;

General 

&#160;

Electric includes OTP which is headquartered in Fergus Falls, Minnesota, and provides electricity to more than 130,000 customers in a service area encompassing 70,000 square miles of western Minnesota, eastern North Dakota and northeastern South Dakota. The Company derived 52%, 51% and 50% of its consolidated operating revenues and 80%, 76% and 66% of its consolidated operating income from the Electric segment for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

&#160;

The breakdown of retail electric revenues by state is as follows:

&#160;

State &#160; 2015 &#160; &#160; 2014 &#160; Minnesota &#160; &#160; 50.4 % &#160; &#160; 49.5 % North Dakota &#160; &#160; 40.6 &#160; &#160; &#160; 41.6 &#160; South Dakota &#160; &#160; 9.0 &#160; &#160; &#160; 8.9 &#160; Total &#160; &#160; 100.0 % &#160; &#160; 100.0 % &#160;

The territory served by OTP is predominantly agricultural. The aggregate population of OTP&#8217;s retail electric service area is approximately 230,000. In this service area of 421 communities and adjacent rural areas and farms, approximately 126,000 people live in communities having a population of more than 1,000, according to the 2010 census. The only communities served which have a population in excess of 10,000 are Jamestown, North Dakota (15,427); Bemidji, Minnesota (13,431); and Fergus Falls, Minnesota (13,138). As of December 31, 2015 OTP served 131,149 customers. Although there are relatively few large customers, sales to commercial and industrial customers are significant.

&#160;

The following table provides a breakdown of electric revenues by customer category. All other sources include gross wholesale sales from utility generation, net revenue from energy trading activity and sales to municipalities.

&#160;

Customer Category &#160; 2015 &#160; &#160; 2014 &#160; Commercial &#160; &#160; 35.4 % &#160; &#160; 37.3 % Residential &#160; &#160; 32.1 &#160; &#160; &#160; 32.3 &#160; Industrial &#160; &#160; 29.9 &#160; &#160; &#160; 25.3 &#160; All Other Sources &#160; &#160; 2.6 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5.1 &#160; Total &#160; &#160; 100.0 % &#160; &#160; 100.0 % &#160;

Wholesale electric energy kilowatt-hour (kwh) sales were 2.5% of total kwh sales for 2015 and 5.8% for 2014. Wholesale electric energy kwh sales decreased by 61.1% between the years while revenue per kwh sold decreased by 220.9%. Activity in the short-term energy market is subject to change based on a number of factors and it is difficult to predict the quantity of wholesale power sales or prices for wholesale power in the future.

&#160;

Capacity and Demand 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015 OTP&#8217;s owned net-plant dependable kilowatt (kW) capacity was:

&#160;

Baseload Plants &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Big Stone Plant &#160; &#160; 254,800 &#160; kW Coyote Station &#160; &#160; 151,000 &#160; &#160; Hoot Lake Plant &#160; &#160; 140,500 &#160; &#160; Total Baseload Net Plant &#160; &#160; 546,300 &#160; kW Combustion Turbine and Small Diesel Units &#160; &#160; 108,500 &#160; kW Hydroelectric Facilities &#160; &#160; 2,500 &#160; kW Owned Wind Facilities (rated at nameplate) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Luverne Wind Farm (33 turbines) &#160; &#160; 49,500 &#160; kW Ashtabula Wind Center (32 turbines) &#160; &#160; 48,000 &#160; &#160; Langdon Wind Center (27 turbines) &#160; &#160; 40,500 &#160; &#160; Total Owned Wind Facilities &#160; &#160; 138,000 &#160; kW &#160;

The baseload net plant capacity for Big Stone Plant and Coyote Station constitutes OTP&#8217;s ownership percentages of 53.9% and 35%, respectively. OTP owns 100% of the Hoot Lake Plant. During 2015, about 47% of OTP&#8217;s retail kwh sales were supplied from OTP generating plants with the balance supplied by purchased power.

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In addition to the owned facilities described above, OTP had the following purchased power agreements in place on December 31, 2015:

&#160;

Purchased Wind Power Agreements (rated at nameplate and greater than 2,000 kW) Ashtabula Wind III &#160; &#160; 62,400 &#160; kW Edgeley &#160; &#160; 21,000 &#160; &#160; Langdon &#160; &#160; 19,500 &#160; &#160; Total Purchased Wind &#160; &#160; 102,900 &#160; kW Purchase of Capacity (in excess of 1 year and 500 kW) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Purchase: Great River Energy 1 &#160; &#160; 100,000 &#160; kW 1 100,000 kW through May 2017, 25,000 kW June 2017 &#8211; May 2019, and 50,000 kW June 2019 &#8211; May 2021. 

&#160;

OTP has a direct control load management system which provides some flexibility to OTP to effect reductions of peak load. OTP also offers rates to customers which encourage off-peak usage.

&#160;

OTP&#8217;s capacity requirement is based on MISO Module E requirements. OTP is required to have sufficient Zonal Resource Credits to meet its monthly weather normalized forecast demand, plus a reserve obligation. OTP met its MISO obligation for the 2015-2016 MISO planning year. OTP generating capacity combined with additional capacity under purchased power agreements (as described above) and load management control capabilities is expected to meet 2016 system demand and MISO reserve requirements.

&#160;

Fuel Supply 

&#160;

Coal is the principal fuel burned at the Big Stone, Coyote and Hoot Lake generating plants. Coyote Station, a mine-mouth facility, burns North Dakota lignite coal. Hoot Lake Plant and Big Stone Plant burn western subbituminous coal.

&#160;

The following table shows the sources of energy used to generate OTP&#8217;s net output of electricity for 2015 and 2014:

OTP has the following primary coal supply agreements:

&#160;

Plant Coal Supplier Type of Coal Expiration Date Big Stone Plant Alpha Coal Sales Company, LLC Wyoming subbituminous December 31, 2017 Big Stone Plant Peabody COALSALES, LLC Wyoming subbituminous December 31, 2017 Coyote Station Dakota Westmoreland Corporation North Dakota lignite May 4, 2016 Coyote Station Coyote Creek Mining Company, L.L.C. North Dakota lignite December 31, 2040 Hoot Lake Plant Cloud Peak Energy Resources LLC Montana subbituminous December 31, 2023 &#160;

OTP&#8217;s anticipated coal needs for Big Stone are secured under contract through December 2017.

&#160;

The contract with Dakota Westmoreland Corporation expires on May 4, 2016. In October 2012, the Coyote Station owners, including OTP, entered into a lignite sales agreement (LSA) with Coyote Creek Mining Company, L.L.C. (CCMC), a subsidiary of The North American Coal Corporation, for the purchase of coal to meet the coal supply requirements of Coyote Station for the period beginning in May 2016 and ending in December 2040. The price per ton to be paid by the Coyote Station owners under the LSA will reflect the cost of production, along with an agreed profit and capital charge. The LSA provides for the Coyote Station owners to purchase the membership interests in CCMC in the event of certain early termination events and also at the end of the term of the LSA.

&#160;

OTP&#8217;s coal supply requirements for Hoot Lake Plant are secured under contract through December 2023.

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

It is OTP&#8217;s practice to maintain a minimum 30-day inventory (at full output) of coal at the Big Stone Plant, a 17-day inventory at Coyote Station and 32 days of inventory at Hoot Lake Plant.

&#160;

Railroad transportation services to the Big Stone Plant and Hoot Lake Plant are provided under a common carrier rate by the BNSF Railway. The common carrier rate is subject to a mileage-based methodology to assess a fuel surcharge. The basis for the fuel surcharge is the U.S. average price of retail on-highway diesel fuel. No coal transportation agreement is needed for Coyote Station due to its location next to a coal mine.

&#160;

The average cost of fuel consumed (including handling charges to the plant sites) per million British Thermal Units for the years 2015, 2014, and 2013 was $2.281, $2.036, and $2.031, respectively.

&#160;

General Regulation 

&#160;

OTP is subject to regulation of rates and other matters in each of the three states in which it operates and by the federal government for certain interstate operations.

&#160;

A breakdown of electric rate regulation by each jurisdiction is as follows:

&#160;

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2015 &#160; &#160; 2014 &#160; Rates &#160; Regulation &#160; % of Electric Revenues &#160; &#160; % of kwh Sales &#160; &#160; % of Electric Revenues &#160; &#160; % of kwh Sales &#160; MN Retail Sales &#160; MN Public Utilities Commission &#160; &#160; 47.2 % &#160; &#160; 52.0 % &#160; &#160; 44.9 % &#160; &#160; 46.8 % ND Retail Sales &#160; ND Public Service Commission &#160; &#160; 38.0 &#160; &#160; &#160; 38.7 &#160; &#160; &#160; 37.8 &#160; &#160; &#160; 38.8 &#160; SD Retail Sales &#160; SD Public Utilities Commission &#160; &#160; 8.5 &#160; &#160; &#160; 9.3 &#160; &#160; &#160; 8.1 &#160; &#160; &#160; 8.6 &#160; Transmission &#38; Wholesale &#160; Federal Energy Regulatory Commission &#160; &#160; 6.3 &#160; &#160; &#160; -- &#160; &#160; &#160; 9.2 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5.8 &#160; Total &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 100.0 % &#160; &#160; 100.0 % &#160; &#160; 100.0 % &#160; &#160; 100.0 % &#160;

OTP operates under approved retail electric tariffs in all three states it serves. OTP has an obligation to serve any customer requesting service within its assigned service territory. The pattern of electric usage can vary dramatically during a 24-hour period and from season to season. OTP&#8217;s tariffs are designed to recover the costs of providing electric service. To the extent that peak usage can be reduced or shifted to periods of lower usage, the cost to serve all customers is reduced. In order to shift usage from peak times, OTP has approved tariffs in all three states for residential demand control, general service time of use and time of day, real-time pricing, and controlled and interruptible service. Each of these specialized rates is designed to improve efficient use of OTP resources, while giving customers more control over their electric bill. OTP also has approved tariffs in its three service territories which allow qualifying customers to release and sell energy back to OTP when wholesale energy prices make such transactions desirable.

&#160;

With a few minor exceptions, OTP&#8217;s electric retail rate schedules provide for adjustments in rates based on the cost of fuel delivered to OTP&#8217;s generating plants, as well as for adjustments based on the cost of electric energy purchased by OTP. OTP also credits certain margins from wholesale sales to the fuel and purchased power adjustment. The adjustments for fuel and purchased power costs are presently based on a two month moving average in Minnesota and by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), a three month moving average in South Dakota and a four month moving average in North Dakota. These adjustments are applied to the next billing period after becoming applicable. These adjustments also include an over or under recovery mechanism, which is calculated on an annual basis in Minnesota and on a monthly basis in North Dakota and South Dakota.

&#160;

Below are descriptions of OTP&#8217;s major capital expenditure projects that have had, or will have, a significant impact on OTP&#8217;s revenue requirements, rates and alternative revenue recovery mechanisms, followed by summaries of the material regulations of each jurisdiction applicable to OTP&#8217;s electric operations, as well as any specific electric rate proceedings during the last three years with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC), the North Dakota Public Service Commission (NDPSC), the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission (SDPUC) and the FERC. The Company&#8217;s manufacturing and plastic pipe businesses are not subject to direct regulation by any of these agencies.

Major Capital Expenditure Projects 

&#160;

The Big Stone South &#8211; Brookings MVP and CapX2020 Project &#8212;This 345 kiloVolt (kV) transmission line, currently under construction, will extend approximately 70 miles between a proposed substation near Big Stone City, South Dakota and the Brookings County Substation near Brookings, South Dakota. OTP and Northern States Power &#8211; MN (NSP MN), a subsidiary of Xcel Energy Inc., jointly developed this project. MISO approved this project as a Multi-Value Project (MVP) under the MISO Open Access Transmission, Energy and Operating Reserve Markets Tariff (MISO Tariff) in December 2011. MVPs are designed to enable the region to comply with energy policy mandates and to address reliability and economic issues affecting multiple areas within the MISO region. The cost allocation is designed to ensure the costs of transmission projects with regional benefits are properly assigned to those who benefit. A Notice of Intent to Construct Facilities (NICF) was filed with the SDPUC on February 29, 2012. The SDPUC approved the certification for the northern portion of the route on April 9, 2013 and granted approval of a route permit for the southern portion of the line on February 18, 2014. On August 1, 2014 OTP and NSP MN entered into agreements to construct the project. This line is expected to be in service in fall 2017. Construction began on this line in the third quarter of 2015. OTP&#8217;s total capital investment in this project is expected to be approximately $97 million, which includes certain assets that will be owned 100% by OTP.

&#160;

The Big Stone South &#8211; Ellendale MVP &#8212;This is a proposed 345 kV transmission line that will extend 160 to 170 miles between a proposed substation near Big Stone City, South Dakota and a proposed substation near Ellendale, North Dakota. OTP is jointly developing this project with Montana-Dakota Utilities Co., a division of MDU Resources Group, Inc. (MDU). MISO approved this project as an MVP under the MISO Tariff in December 2011. OTP and MDU jointly filed an NICF with the SDPUC in March of 2012. On August 25, 2013 the NDPSC granted Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity to OTP and MDU for ten miles of the proposed line to be built in North Dakota. On July 10, 2014 the NDPSC approved a Certificate of Corridor Compatibility and a route permit for the North Dakota section of the proposed line. On August 22, 2014 the SDPUC issued an order approving the route permit for the South Dakota section of the proposed line. A route permit amendment to shift a portion of the route in North Dakota was approved by the NDPSC on December 16, 2015. On June 12, 2015 OTP and MDU entered into agreements to construct the project. This project is expected to be completed in 2019. OTP&#8217;s total capital investment in this project is expected to be approximately $153 million, which includes certain assets that will be owned 100% by OTP.

&#160;

Capacity Expansion 2020 (CapX2020) Transmission Line Projects &#8212;CapX2020 is a joint initiative of eleven investor-owned, cooperative, and municipal utilities in Minnesota and the surrounding region to upgrade and expand the electric transmission grid to ensure continued reliable and affordable service.

&#160;

Fargo&#8211;Monticello 345 kV CapX2020 Project (the Fargo Project) &#8212;OTP has invested approximately $81 million and has a 14.2% ownership interest in the jointly-owned assets of this 240-mile transmission line, and owns 100% of certain assets of the project. The final phase of this project was energized on April 2, 2015.

&#160;

Brookings&#8211;Southeast Twin Cities 345 kV CapX2020 Project (the Brookings Project) &#8212;OTP has invested approximately $26 million and has a 4.8% ownership interest in this 250-mile transmission line. The MISO granted unconditional approval of the Brookings Project as an MVP under the MISO Tariff in December 2011. The final segments of this line were energized on March 26, 2015.

&#160;

Recovery of OTP&#8217;s major transmission investments is through the MISO Tariff (several as MVPs) and, currently, Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota Transmission Cost Recovery (TCR) Riders.

&#160;

Big Stone Plant Air Quality Control System (AQCS) &#8212;The South Dakota Department of Environmental and Natural Resources determined the Big Stone Plant is subject to Best-Available Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA), based on air dispersion modeling indicating that Big Stone Plant&#8217;s emissions reasonably contribute to visibility impairment in national parks and wilderness areas in Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota and Michigan. OTP completed construction and testing of the BART-compliant AQCS at Big Stone Plant in the fourth quarter of 2015 and placed the AQCS into commercial operation on December 29, 2015. The capitalized cost of the project as of December 31, 2015 was approximately $367 million (OTP&#8217;s 53.9% share was approximately $198 million).

Big Stone II Project &#8212;On June 30, 2005 OTP and a coalition of six other electric providers entered into several agreements for the development of a second electric generating unit, named Big Stone II, at the site of the existing Big Stone Plant near Milbank, South Dakota. On September 11, 2009 OTP announced its withdrawal&#8212;both as a participating utility and as the project&#8217;s lead developer&#8212;from Big Stone II. On November 2, 2009, the remaining Big Stone II participants announced the cancellation of the Big Stone II project. Recovery in Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota of amounts OTP had invested in the Big Stone II project at the time of its withdrawal is discussed below under the respective jurisdictional sections of this report.

Minnesota 

&#160;

Under the Minnesota Public Utilities Act, OTP is subject to the jurisdiction of the MPUC with respect to rates, issuance of securities, depreciation rates, public utility services, construction of major utility facilities, establishment of exclusive assigned service areas, contracts and arrangements with subsidiaries and other affiliated interests, and other matters. The MPUC has the authority to assess the need for large energy facilities and to issue or deny certificates of need, after public hearings, within one year of an application to construct such a facility.

&#160;

Pursuant to the Minnesota Power Plant Siting Act, the MPUC has authority to select or designate sites in Minnesota for new electric power generating plants (50,000 kW or more) and routes for transmission lines (100 kV or more) in an orderly manner compatible with environmental preservation and the efficient use of resources, and to certify such sites and routes as to environmental compatibility after an environmental impact study has been conducted by the Minnesota Department of Commerce (MNDOC) and the Office of Administrative Hearings has conducted contested case hearings.

&#160;

The Minnesota Division of Energy Resources, part of the MNDOC, is responsible for investigating all matters subject to the jurisdiction of the MNDOC or the MPUC, and for the enforcement of MPUC orders. Among other things, the MNDOC is authorized to collect and analyze data on energy including the consumption of energy, develop recommendations as to energy policies for the governor and the legislature of Minnesota and evaluate policies governing the establishment of rates and prices for energy as related to energy conservation. The MNDOC also has the power, in the event of energy shortage or for a long-term basis, to prepare and adopt regulations to conserve and allocate energy.

&#160;

2010 General Rate Case &#8212;OTP&#8217;s most recent general rate increase in Minnesota of approximately $5.0 million, or 1.6%, was granted by the MPUC in an order issued on April 25, 2011 and effective October 1, 2011. Pursuant to the order, OTP&#8217;s allowed rate of return on rate base was set at 8.61%, and its allowed rate of return on equity was set at 10.74%.

&#160;

2016 General Rate Case 

On February 16, 2016 OTP filed a request with the MPUC for an increase in revenue recoverable under general rates in Minnesota. In its filing, OTP requested an increase in annual revenue of approximately $19.3 million, or 9.8%, based on an allowed rate of return on rate base of 8.07% and an allowed rate of return on equity of 10.4%, based on an equity ratio of 52.5% of total capital. Through this rate case proceeding, OTP is proposing to recover, in base rates, revenue currently subject to recovery under Minnesota TCR and Environmental Cost Recovery (ECR) riders.

&#160;

Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) &#8212;Minnesota law requires utilities to submit to the MPUC for approval a 15-year advance IRP. A resource plan is a set of resource options a utility could use to meet the service needs of its customers over a forecast period, including an explanation of the utility&#8217;s supply and demand circumstances, and the extent to which each resource option would be used to meet those service needs. The MPUC&#8217;s findings of fact and conclusions regarding resource plans shall be considered prima facie evidence, subject to rebuttal, in Certificate of Need (CON) hearings, rate reviews and other proceedings. Typically, the filings are submitted every two years.

&#160;

In the MPUC order approving the 2011-2025 IRP in February 2012, OTP was required to submit a base-load diversification study specifically focused on evaluating retirement and repower options for the Hoot Lake Plant. In an order dated March 25, 2013 the MPUC approved OTP&#8217;s recommendations that Hoot Lake Plant add pollution-control equipment at a cost of approximately $10.0 million to comply with United States Environmental Protection Agency&#8217;s (EPA) mercury and air toxics standards by 2015 and discontinue burning coal by May 31, 2021.

&#160;

On December 2, 2013 OTP filed its 2014-2028 IRP with the MPUC. Copies of the 2014-2028 IRP were provided to both the NDPSC and SDPUC. On December 5, 2014 the MPUC issued an order approving OTP&#8217;s 2014-2028 IRP filing, which included the following items:

&#160;

&#183; Authorization to add up to 300 megawatts (MW) of wind between 2017 and 2021 if it is cost effective and does not negatively impact OTP&#8217;s electric system operation. &#183; Construction of solar generation sufficient to comply with the Minnesota Solar Energy Standard by 2020. &#183; Confirmation of a 1.5% energy savings goal, as filed in OTP&#8217;s triennial Minnesota Conservation Improvement Program (MNCIP) plan. &#183; Authorization to obtain 200 MW, subject to need, of intermediate natural gas generation in the 2019-2021 timeframe. &#160;

On June 29, 2015 OTP requested the MPUC grant a six-month extension to June 1, 2016 for filing its 2016-2030 IRP to allow OTP time to model compliance with final rules on proposed standards of performance for carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants published by the EPA on October 23, 2015 and to incorporate planned wind and natural gas-fired generation additions. On September 14, 2015 the MPUC granted OTP&#8217;s request for a six-month extension.

Renewable Energy Standards, Conservation, Renewable Resource Riders &#8212;Minnesota law favors conservation over the addition of new resources. In addition, Minnesota law requires the use of renewable resources where new supplies are needed, unless the utility proves that a renewable energy facility is not in the public interest. An existing environmental externality law requires the MPUC, to the extent practicable, to quantify the environmental costs associated with each method of electricity generation, and to use such monetized values in evaluating generation resources. The MPUC must disallow any nonrenewable rate base additions (whether within or outside of the state) or any related rate recovery, and may not approve any nonrenewable energy facility in an IRP, unless the utility proves that a renewable energy facility is not in the public interest. The state has prioritized the acceptability of new generation with wind and solar ranked first and coal and nuclear ranked fifth, the lowest ranking. The MPUC&#8217;s current estimate of the range of costs of future CO 2 regulation to be used in modeling analyses for resource plans is $9 to $34/ton of CO 2 commencing in 2019. The MPUC is required to annually update these estimates.

&#160;

Minnesota has a renewable energy standard which requires OTP to generate or procure sufficient renewable generation such that the following percentages of total retail electric sales to Minnesota customers come from qualifying renewable sources: 17% by 2016; 20% by 2020 and 25% by 2025. In addition, Minnesota law requires 1.5% of total Minnesota electric sales by public utilities to be supplied by solar energy by 2020. Under certain circumstances and after consideration of costs and reliability issues, the MPUC may modify or delay implementation of the standards. OTP has acquired sufficient renewable resources to currently comply with Minnesota renewable energy standards. OTP is evaluating potential options for maintaining compliance and meeting the solar energy standard. OTP&#8217;s projected capital expenditures include $56 million for a solar project in 2019. OTP&#8217;s compliance with the Minnesota renewable energy standard will be measured through the Midwest Renewable Energy Tracking System.

&#160;

Under the Next Generation Energy Act of 2007, an automatic adjustment mechanism was established to allow Minnesota electric utilities to recover investments and costs incurred to satisfy the requirements of the renewable energy standard. The MPUC is authorized to approve a rate schedule rider to enable utilities to recover the costs of qualifying renewable energy projects that supply renewable energy to Minnesota customers. Cost recovery for qualifying renewable energy projects can be authorized outside of a rate case proceeding, provided that such renewable projects have received previous MPUC approval. Renewable resource costs eligible for recovery may include return on investment, depreciation, operation and maintenance costs, taxes, renewable energy delivery costs and other related expenses.

&#160;

The costs for three major wind farms previously approved by the MPUC for recovery through OTP&#8217;s Minnesota Renewable Resource Adjustment (MNRRA) were moved to base rates as of October 1, 2011 under the MPUC&#8217;s April 25, 2011 general rate case order with the exception of the remaining balance of the MNRRA regulatory asset. OTP continued to collect the remaining regulatory asset balance through April 30, 2013, when the balance was near zero. On April 4, 2013 the MPUC authorized that any remaining unrecovered balance be retained as a regulatory asset to be recovered in OTP&#8217;s next general rate case.

&#160;

Minnesota Conservation Improvement Programs &#8212;Under Minnesota law, every regulated public utility that furnishes electric service must make annual investments and expenditures in energy conservation improvements, or make a contribution to the state's energy and conservation account, in an amount equal to at least 1.5% of its gross operating revenues from service provided in Minnesota.

&#160;

The MNDOC may require a utility to make investments and expenditures in energy conservation improvements whenever it finds that the improvement will result in energy savings at a total cost to the utility less than the cost to the utility to produce or purchase an equivalent amount of a new supply of energy. Such MNDOC orders can be appealed to the MPUC. Investments made pursuant to such orders generally are recoverable costs in rate cases, even though ownership of the improvement may belong to the property owner rather than the utility. OTP recovers conservation related costs not included in base rates under the MNCIP through the use of an annual recovery mechanism approved by the MPUC.

&#160;

In December 2012, the MPUC ordered a change in the MNCIP cost recovery methodology used by OTP from a percentage of a customer&#8217;s bill to an amount per kwh consumed. On January 1, 2013 OTP&#8217;s MNCIP surcharge decreased from 3.8% of the customer&#8217;s bill to $0.00142 per kwh, which equates to approximately 1.9% of a customer&#8217;s bill. On October 10, 2013 the MPUC approved OTP&#8217;s 2012 financial incentive request for $2.7 million as well as its request for an updated surcharge rate to be implemented on November 1, 2013. OTP recognized $3.9 million in MNCIP financial incentives in 2013 related to the results of its conservation improvement programs in Minnesota in 2013. On September 26, 2014 the MPUC approved OTP&#8217;s 2013 financial incentive request for $4.0 million, an updated surcharge rate to be effective October 1, 2014, as well as a change to the carrying charge to be equal to the short term cost of debt set in OTP&#8217;s most recent general rate case.

&#160;

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

OTP recognized a financial incentive for 2014 of $3.0 million due, in part, to the MPUC lowering the MNCIP financial incentive from approximately $0.09 per kwh saved for 2013-2015 to $0.07 per kwh saved for 2014-2016. Additionally, OTP saved approximately 2 million less kwhs in 2014 compared with 2013 under conservation improvement programs in Minnesota. On July 9, 2015 the MPUC granted approval of OTP&#8217;s 2014 financial incentive of $3.0 million along with an updated surcharge with an effective date of October 1, 2015. Based on results from the 2015 MNCIP program year, OTP has recognized a financial incentive of $4.2 million. The 2015 MNCIP program resulted in approximately a 39% increase in energy savings compared to 2014 program results.

&#160;

Transmission Cost Recovery Rider &#8212;The Minnesota Public Utilities Act (the Act) provides a mechanism for automatic adjustment outside of a general rate proceeding to recover the costs of new transmission facilities that have been previously approved by the MPUC in a CON proceeding, certified by the MPUC as a Minnesota priority transmission project, made to transmit the electricity generated from renewable generation sources ultimately used to provide service to the utility's retail customers, or exempt from the requirement to obtain a Minnesota CON. The MPUC may also authorize cost recovery via such TCR riders for charges incurred by a utility under a federally approved tariff that accrue from other transmission owners&#8217; regionally planned transmission projects that have been determined by the MISO to benefit the utility or integrated transmission system. The Act also authorizes TCR riders to recover the costs of new transmission facilities approved by the regulatory commission of the state in which the new transmission facilities are to be constructed, to the extent approval is required by the laws of that state, and determined by the MISO to benefit the utility or integrated transmission system. Such TCR riders allow a return on investment at the level approved in a utility&#8217;s last general rate case. Additionally, following approval of the rate schedule, the MPUC may approve annual rate adjustments filed pursuant to the rate schedule.

&#160;

MISO regional cost allocation allows OTP to recover some of the costs of its transmission investment from other MISO customers. On March 26, 2012 the MPUC approved an update to OTP&#8217;s Minnesota TCR rider along with an all-in method for MISO regional cost allocations in which OTP&#8217;s retail customers would be responsible for the entire investment OTP made in transmission facilities that qualify for regional cost allocation under the MISO Tariff, with an offsetting credit for revenues received from other MISO utilities under the MISO Tariff for projects included in the TCR. OTP&#8217;s updated Minnesota TCR rider went into effect April 1, 2012.

&#160;

OTP filed an annual update to its Minnesota TCR rider on February 7, 2013 to include three new projects as well as updated costs associated with existing projects. In a written order issued on March 10, 2014, the MPUC approved OTP&#8217;s 2013 TCR rider update but found capitalized internal costs, costs in excess of CON estimates and a carrying charge ineligible for recovery through the TCR rider. These items were removed from OTP&#8217;s Minnesota TCR rider effective March 1, 2014. OTP will be allowed to seek recovery of the capitalized internal costs and costs in excess of CON estimates in a future rate case. In response to the MPUC&#8217;s approval of OTP&#8217;s annual TCR update, OTP submitted a compliance filing in April 2014 reflecting the TCR rider revenue requirements changes relating to the MPUC&#8217;s ruling and requesting no rate change be implemented at the time. The MPUC approved OTP&#8217;s compliance filing on June 19, 2014. On February 18, 2015 the MPUC approved OTP&#8217;s 2014 TCR rider annual update with an effective date of March 1, 2015. OTP filed an annual update to its Minnesota TCR rider on September 30, 2015 requesting revenue recovery of approximately $7.2 million with a proposed effective date of April 1, 2016. A supplemental filing to the update was made on December 21, 2015 to address an issue surrounding the proration of accumulated deferred income taxes.

&#160;

Environmental Cost Recovery (ECR) Rider &#8212;On December 18, 2013 the MPUC granted approval of OTP&#8217;s Minnesota ECR rider for recovery of OTP&#8217;s Minnesota jurisdictional share of the revenue requirements of its investment in the Big Stone Plant AQCS effective January 1, 2014. The ECR rider recoverable revenue requirements include a current return on the project&#8217;s Construction Work in Progress (CWIP) balance at the level approved in OTP&#8217;s most recent general rate case. OTP filed its 2014 annual update on July 31, 2014, requesting a $4.1 million annual increase in the rider from $6.1 million to $10.2 million. The MPUC approved OTP&#8217;s ECR rider annual update request on November 24, 2014, effective December 1, 2014. Because the effective date was two months behind the anticipated implementation date for the updated rate and a portion of the requested increase had been collected under the initial rate, the approved updated rate is based on a revenue requirement of $9.8 million. OTP filed its 2015 annual update on July 31, 2015, with a request to keep the same rate in place. On December 21, 2015 OTP filed a supplemental filing with updated financial information.

&#160;

Reagent Costs and Emission Allowances &#8212;On July 31, 2014 OTP filed a request with the MPUC to revise its Fuel Clause Adjustment (FCA) rider in Minnesota to include recovery of reagent and emission allowance costs. On March 12, 2015 the MPUC denied OTP&#8217;s request to revise its FCA rider to include recovery of these costs. These costs will be reviewed in OTP&#8217;s 2016 general rate case in Minnesota and considered for recovery either through the FCA rider or general rates. These costs are currently being expensed as incurred.

&#160;

Big Stone II Project Cost Recovery &#8212;OTP requested recovery of the Minnesota portion of its Big Stone II development costs over a five-year period as part of its general rate case filed in Minnesota on April 2, 2010. In a written order issued on April 25, 2011, the MPUC authorized recovery of the Minnesota portion of Big Stone II generation development costs from Minnesota ratepayers over a 60-month recovery period which began on October 1, 2011. The amount of Big Stone II

&#160;

&#160; 12 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

generation costs incurred by OTP that were deemed recoverable from Minnesota ratepayers as part of the rates established in that proceeding was $3.2 million. Because OTP was not allowed to earn a return on these deferred costs over the 60-month recovery period, the recoverable amount of $3.2 million was discounted to its present value of $2.8 million using OTP&#8217;s incremental borrowing rate, in accordance with ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations (ASC 980) accounting requirements. Transmission-related project costs of $3.2 million remained in CWIP as active project costs at the time of the order.

&#160;

Approximately $0.4 million of the total Minnesota jurisdictional share of Big Stone II transmission costs were transferred to the Big Stone South - Brookings MVP transmission line project in the first quarter of 2013. The remaining transmission costs, along with accumulated allowance for equity funds used during construction (AFUDC), were transferred from CWIP to a regulatory asset account in May 2013, based on recovery granted in the April 25, 2011 order. Because OTP was not allowed to earn a return on these deferred costs over their anticipated recovery period, the recoverable amount of approximately $3.5 million was discounted to its present value using OTP&#8217;s incremental borrowing rate. In May 2013, OTP recorded a charge of $0.7 million related to the discount in accordance with ASC 980 accounting requirements. In June 2014, OTP recorded an additional discount of $0.3 million to reflect changes in the end date of the anticipated recovery period from September 2020 to December 2022. In accordance with ASC 980, OTP continues to monitor the assumptions used in the discounting of the Minnesota Big Stone II Transmission costs. A reversal of $0.2 million of the discount previously recorded was made in December 2015 to reflect updated information.

&#160;

Capital Structure Petition &#8212;Minnesota law requires an annual filing of a capital structure petition with the MPUC. In this filing the MPUC reviews and approves the capital structure for OTP. Once the petition is approved, OTP may issue securities without further petition or approval, provided the issuance is consistent with the purposes and amounts set forth in the approved capital structure petition. The MPUC approved OTP&#8217;s most recent capital structure petition on July 10, 2015, which is in effect until the MPUC issues a new capital structure order for 2016. OTP is required to file its 2016 capital structure petition no later than May 1, 2016.

&#160;

North Dakota 

&#160;

OTP is subject to the jurisdiction of the NDPSC with respect to rates, services, certain issuances of securities, construction of major utility facilities and other matters. The NDPSC periodically performs audits of gas and electric utilities over which it has rate setting jurisdiction to determine the reasonableness of overall rate levels. In the past, these audits have occasionally resulted in settlement agreements adjusting rate levels for OTP.

&#160;

The North Dakota Energy Conversion and Transmission Facility Siting Act grants the NDPSC the authority to approve sites in North Dakota for large electric generating facilities and high voltage transmission lines. This Act is similar to the Minnesota Power Plant Siting Act described above and applies to proposed wind energy electric power generating plants exceeding 500 kW of electricity, non-wind energy electric power generating plants exceeding 50,000 kW and transmission lines with a design in excess of 115 kV. OTP is required to submit a ten-year plan to the NDPSC biennially.

&#160;

The NDPSC reserves the right to review the issuance of stocks, bonds, notes and other evidence of indebtedness of a public utility. However, the issuance by a public utility of securities registered with the SEC is expressly exempted from review by the NDPSC under North Dakota state law.

&#160;

General Rates &#8212;OTP&#8217;s most recent general rate increase in North Dakota of $3.6 million, or approximately 3.0%, was granted by the NDPSC in an order issued on November 25, 2009 and effective December 2009. Pursuant to the order, OTP&#8217;s allowed rate of return on rate base was set at 8.62%, and its allowed rate of return on equity was set at 10.75%.

&#160;

Renewable Resource Adjustment &#8212;OTP has a North Dakota Renewable Resource Adjustment (NDRRA) which enables OTP to recover the North Dakota share of its investments in renewable energy facilities it owns in North Dakota. This rider allows OTP to recover costs associated with new renewable energy projects as they are completed with a return on investment at the level approved in OTP's most recent general rate case. On March 21, 2012 the NDPSC approved an update to OTP&#8217;s NDRRA effective April 1, 2012. The updated NDRRA recovered $9.9 million over the period April 1, 2012 through March 31, 2013. On December 28, 2012 OTP submitted an annual update to the NDRRA with a proposed effective date of April 1, 2013. The update resulted in a rate reduction, so the NDPSC did not issue an order suspending the rate change. Consequently, pursuant to statute, OTP was allowed to implement updated rates effective April 1, 2013 with the NDPSC granting subsequent approval of the updated rates on July 10, 2013. The NDPSC approved OTP&#8217;s 2013 annual update to the NDRRA on March 12, 2014 with an effective date of April 1, 2014, which resulted in a 13.5% reduction in the NDRRA rate. The NDPSC approved OTP&#8217;s 2014 annual update to the NDRRA, including a change in rate design from an amount per kwh consumed to a percentage of a customer&#8217;s bill, on March 25, 2015 with an effective date of April 1, 2015. In each instance the NDRRA rates have been based on a return on investment at the rate of return approved in OTP&#8217;s last general rate case. OTP submitted its 2015 annual update to the NDRRA rider rate on December 31, 2015 with a requested implementation date of April 1, 2016.

Transmission Cost Recovery Rider &#8212;North Dakota law provides a mechanism for automatic adjustment outside of a general rate proceeding to recover jurisdictional capital and operating costs incurred by a public utility for new or modified electric transmission facilities. For qualifying projects, the law authorizes a current return on CWIP and a return on investment at the level approved in the utility's most recent general rate case. On August 31, 2012 OTP filed its annual update to the North Dakota TCR rider rate to reflect updated cost information associated with projects currently in the rider, as well as proposing to include costs associated with ten additional projects for recovery within the rider. The NDPSC approved the annual update on December 12, 2012 with an effective date of January 1, 2013. The NDPSC approved OTP&#8217;s 2013 annual update to its TCR rider rate on December 30, 2013 with an effective date of January 1, 2014. The NDPSC approved OTP&#8217;s 2014 annual update to its TCR rider rate on December 17, 2014 with an effective date of January 1, 2015. On August 31, 2015 OTP filed its 2015 annual update to its North Dakota TCR rider rate requesting recovery of approximately $10.2 million for 2016 compared with $8.5 million for 2015, including costs assessed by the MISO as well as new costs from the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) that OTP will incur beginning January 1, 2016. These new costs are associated with OTP&#8217;s load connected to the transmission system of Central Power Electric Cooperative (CPEC) that will become subject to SPP transmission-related charges when CPEC transmission assets are added to the SPP. The NDPSC approved OTP&#8217;s 2015 annual update to its TCR rider rate on December 16, 2015 with an effective date of January 1, 2016.

&#160;

Environmental Cost Recovery Rider &#8212; On February 8, 2013 OTP filed a request with the NDPSC for an ECR rider to recover OTP&#8217;s North Dakota jurisdictional share of the revenue requirements associated with its investment in the Big Stone Plant AQCS. On December 18, 2013 the NDPSC approved OTP&#8217;s North Dakota ECR rider based on revenue requirements through the 2013 calendar year and thereafter, with rates effective for bills rendered on or after January 1, 2014. The ECR provides for a current return on CWIP and a return on investment at the level approved in OTP&#8217;s most recent general rate case. On March 31, 2014 OTP filed an annual update to its North Dakota ECR rider rate. The update included a request to increase the ECR rider rate from 4.319% of base rates to 7.531% of base rates. The NDPSC approved OTP&#8217;s 2014 ECR rider annual update request on July 10, 2014 with an August 1, 2014 implementation date. On March 31, 2015 OTP filed its annual update to the ECR. This update included a request to increase the ECR rider rate from 7.531% of base rates to 9.193% of base rates. The NDPSC approved the annual update on June 17, 2015 with an effective date of July 1, 2015, along with the approval of recovery of OTP&#8217;s North Dakota jurisdictional share of Hoot Lake Plant Mercury and Air Toxic Standards (MATS) project costs.

&#160;

Reagent Costs and Emission Allowances &#8212;On July 31, 2014 OTP filed a request with the NDPSC to revise its FCA rider in North Dakota to include recovery of new reagent and emission allowance costs. On February 25, 2015 the NDPSC approved recovery of these costs through modification of the ECR rider, instead of recovery through the FCA as OTP had proposed. The ECR rider reagent and emissions allowance charge became effective May 1, 2015.

&#160;

Big Stone II Project &#8212;In an order issued June 25, 2010, the NDPSC authorized recovery of Big Stone II development costs from North Dakota ratepayers. The North Dakota&#8217;s jurisdictional share of Big Stone II generation costs incurred by OTP was $4.1 million. OTP included in its total recovery amount a carrying charge of approximately $0.3 million on the North Dakota share of Big Stone II generation costs based on OTP&#8217;s average 2009 AFUDC rate of 7.65%. Because OTP would not earn a return on these deferred costs over the 36-month recovery period, the recoverable amount of $4.3 million was discounted to its then present value of $3.9 million using OTP&#8217;s incremental borrowing rate, in accordance with ASC 980 accounting requirements. The North Dakota portion of Big Stone II generation costs was recovered over a 36-month period which began on August 1, 2010.

&#160;

The North Dakota jurisdictional share of Big Stone II costs incurred by OTP related to transmission was $1.1 million. Approximately $0.3 million of the total North Dakota jurisdictional share of Big Stone II transmission costs were transferred to the Big Stone South - Brookings MVP during the first quarter of 2013. On July 30, 2013 the NDPSC approved OTP&#8217;s request to continue the Big Stone II cost recovery rates for an additional eight months through March 31, 2014 to recover the remaining North Dakota share of Big Stone II transmission-related costs plus accrued AFUDC totaling $1.0 million. As of April 1, 2014 North Dakota customer&#8217;s bills no longer include a charge for the North Dakota share of Big Stone II costs.

&#160;

South Dakota 

&#160;

Under the South Dakota Public Utilities Act, OTP is subject to the jurisdiction of the SDPUC with respect to rates, public utility services, construction of major utility facilities, establishment of assigned service areas and other matters. Under the South Dakota Energy Facility Permit Act, the SDPUC has the authority to approve sites in South Dakota for large energy conversion facilities (100,000 kW or more) and transmission lines with a design of 115 kV or more.

&#160;

2010 General Rate Case &#8212;OTP&#8217;s most recent general rate increase in South Dakota of approximately $643,000 or approximately 2.32% was granted by the SDPUC in an order issued on April 21, 2011 and effective with bills rendered on and after June 1, 2011. Pursuant to the order, OTP&#8217;s allowed rate of return on rate base was set at 8.50%.

Transmission Cost Recovery Rider &#8212;South Dakota law provides a mechanism for automatic adjustment outside of a general rate proceeding to recover jurisdictional capital and operating costs incurred by a public utility for new or modified electric transmission facilities. The SDPUC approved OTP&#8217;s 2012 annual update to its South Dakota TCR on April 23, 2013 with an effective date of May 1, 2013. The SDPUC approved OTP&#8217;s 2013 annual update on February 18, 2014 with an effective date of March 1, 2014. The SDPUC approved OTP&#8217;s 2014 annual update on February 13, 2015 with an effective date of March 1, 2015. OTP filed its 2015 annual update on October 30, 2015 with a proposed effective date of March 1, 2016. A supplemental filing was made on February 3, 2016 to true-up the filing to include the impact of bonus depreciation elected for 2015, the inclusion of a deferred tax asset relating to a net operating loss and the proration of accumulated deferred income taxes.

&#160;

Environmental Cost Recovery Rider &#8212;On November 25, 2014 the SDPUC approved OTP&#8217;s ECR rider request to recover OTP&#8217;s South Dakota jurisdictional share of revenue requirements associated with its investment in the Big Stone Plant AQCS and Hoot Lake Plant MATS projects, with an effective date of December 1, 2014. On August 31, 2015 OTP filed its annual update to the South Dakota ECR requesting recovery of approximately $2.7 million in annual revenue. The SDPUC approved the request in their order dated October 15, 2015 with an effective date of November 1, 2015.

&#160;

Reagent Costs and Emission Allowances &#8212;On August 1, 2014 OTP filed a request with the SDPUC to revise its FCA rider in South Dakota to include recovery of reagent and emission allowance costs. On September 16, 2014 the SDPUC approved OTP&#8217;s request to include recovery of these costs in its South Dakota FCA rider.

&#160;

Big Stone II Project &#8212;OTP requested recovery of the South Dakota portion of its Big Stone II development costs over a five-year period as part of its general rate case filed in South Dakota on August 20, 2010. In the first quarter of 2011, the SDPUC approved recovery of the South Dakota portion of Big Stone II generation development costs totaling approximately $1.0 million from South Dakota ratepayers over a ten-year period beginning in February 2011 with the implementation of interim rates. OTP is allowed to earn a return on the amount subject to recovery over the ten-year recovery period. Therefore, the South Dakota settlement amount is not discounted. OTP transferred the South Dakota portion of the remaining Big Stone II transmission costs to CWIP, with such costs subject to AFUDC and recovery in future FERC-approved MISO rates or retail rates. On July 31, 2012 the SDPUC approved the transfer of the Big Stone II transmission route permits to OTP.

&#160;

A portion of the Big Stone II transmission costs were transferred out of CWIP in February 2013 to be included within the Big Stone South - Brookings MVP. On March 28, 2013 OTP filed a petition with the SDPUC requesting deferred accounting for the remaining unrecovered Big Stone II transmission costs until OTP&#8217;s next South Dakota general rate case. The petition was approved by the SDPUC on April 23, 2013 and in May 2013 OTP transferred the remaining $0.2 million South Dakota jurisdictional portion of unrecovered Big Stone II transmission costs plus accumulated AFUDC from CWIP to the Big Stone II Unrecovered Project Costs &#8211; South Dakota regulatory asset accounts.

&#160;

Energy Efficiency Plan (EEP) &#8212;The SDPUC has encouraged all investor-owned utilities in South Dakota to be part of an Energy Efficiency Partnership to significantly reduce energy use. The plan is being implemented with program costs, carrying costs and a financial incentive being recovered through an approved rider.

&#160;

On June 18, 2013 the SDPUC approved OTP&#8217;s request for a 2012 financial incentive of $84,000 along with an increased surcharge adjustment that became effective July 1, 2013. On November 5, 2013, the SDPUC approved OTP&#8217;s EEP updates for 2014-2015. On December 3, 2013, the SDPUC voted to amend the approval previously given and require OTP to come before the Commission if the overall plan budget would exceed 10%, rather than the previously approved 30%.

&#160;

On May 1, 2014 OTP filed a request with the SDPUC for approval of updates to its EEP based on 2013 results. On August 26, 2014 the SDPUC issued a written order approving the maximum available incentive payment limited to 30% of the budget amount provided in the EEP, or $84,000. In addition to the incentive payment approval, the SDPUC approved OTP&#8217;s proposal to leave the South Dakota Energy Efficiency Adjustment Rider at $0.00103/kwh.

&#160;

On May 1, 2015 OTP filed its 2014 South Dakota EEP Status Report, financial incentive and surcharge adjustment along with a request for approval of an incentive of $105,000 and EEP surcharge increase to $0.00152/kwh. On July 14, 2015 the SDPUC issued a written order approving OTP&#8217;s 2014 EEP Status Report, incentive and surcharge increases. Based on 2015 program results, OTP has recognized $105,000 in revenue for the 2015 EEP financial incentive.

FERC 

&#160;

Wholesale power sales and transmission rates are subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC under the Federal Power Act of 1935, as amended. The FERC is an independent agency with jurisdiction over rates for wholesale electricity sales, transmission and sale of electric energy in interstate commerce, interconnection of facilities, and accounting policies and practices. Filed rates are effective after a one day suspension period, subject to ultimate approval by the FERC.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Multi-Value Transmission Projects &#8212;On December 16, 2010 the FERC approved the cost allocation for a new classification of projects in the MISO region called MVPs. MVPs are designed to enable the region to comply with energy policy mandates and to address reliability and economic issues affecting multiple transmission zones within the MISO region. The cost allocation is designed to ensure that the costs of transmission projects with regional benefits are properly assigned to those who benefit. On October 20, 2011 the FERC reaffirmed the MVP cost allocation on rehearing.

&#160;

Effective January 1, 2012, the FERC authorized OTP to recover 100% of prudently incurred CWIP and Abandoned Plant Recovery on two projects approved by MISO as MVPs in MISO&#8217;s 2011 Transmission Expansion Plan: the Big Stone South &#8211; Brookings MVP and the Big Stone South &#8211; Ellendale MVP.

&#160;

On November 12, 2013 a group of industrial customers and other stakeholders filed a complaint with the FERC seeking to reduce the return on equity (ROE) component of the transmission rates that MISO transmission owners, including OTP, may collect under the MISO Tariff. The complainants are seeking to reduce the current 12.38% ROE used in MISO&#8217;s transmission rates to a proposed 9.15%. A group of MISO transmission owners have filed responses to the complaint, defending the current ROE and seeking dismissal of the complaint. On October 16, 2014 the FERC issued an order finding that the current MISO ROE may be unjust and unreasonable and setting the issue for hearing, subject to the outcome of settlement discussion. Settlement discussions did not resolve the dispute and the FERC set the proceeding to a Track II Hearing which occurred in August 2015. An initial decision by the presiding administrative law judge was issued on December 22, 2015 finding that the MISO transmission owners&#8217; ROE should be 10.32%. The FERC decision is anticipated in the fall of 2016. On November 6, 2014 a group of MISO transmission owners, including OTP, filed for a FERC incentive of an additional 50-basis points for Regional Transmission Organization participation (RTO Adder). On January 5, 2015 the FERC granted the request, deferring collection of the RTO Adder until the resolution of the ROE complaint proceeding.

&#160;

On February 12, 2015 another group of stakeholders filed a complaint with the FERC seeking to reduce the ROE component of the transmission rates that MISO transmission owners, including OTP, may collect under the MISO Tariff from the current 12.38% to a proposed 8.67%. A group of MISO transmission owners have filed responses to the complaint, defending the current ROE and seeking dismissal of the complaint. The initial decision by the presiding administrative law judge is scheduled to be issued in the summer of 2016. A FERC decision is not expected until 2017.

NAEMA 

&#160;

OTP is a member of the North American Energy Marketers Association (NAEMA) which is an independent, non-profit trade association representing entities involved in the marketing of energy or in providing services to the energy industry. NAEMA has over 150 members with operations in 48 states and Canada. NAEMA was formed as a successor organization of the Power and Energy Market (PEM) of the Mid-Continent Area Power Pool (MAPP) in recognition that PEM had outgrown the MAPP region. Power pool sales are conducted continuously through NAEMA in accordance with schedules filed by NAEMA with the FERC. 

North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) 

&#160;

NERC is an international regulatory authority, subject to oversight by the FERC and governmental authorities in Canada, whose mission is to assure the reliability of the bulk power system in North America. As an owner and operator within the bulk power system, OTP is required to comply with NERC reliability standards, including cybersecurity. In November of 2014, the FERC approved NERC&#8217;s critical infrastructure and protection standards.

&#160;

Midwest Reliability Organization (MRO) 

&#160;

OTP is a member of the MRO. The MRO is a non-profit organization dedicated to ensuring the reliability and security of the bulk power system in the north central region of North America, including parts of both the United States and Canada. MRO began operations in 2005 and is one of eight regional entities in North America operating under authority from regulators in the United States and Canada through a delegation agreement with the NERC. The MRO is responsible for: (1) developing and implementing reliability standards, (2) enforcing compliance with those standards, (3) providing seasonal and long-term assessments of the bulk power system&#8217;s ability to meet demand for electricity, and (4) providing an appeals and dispute resolution process.

&#160;

The MRO region covers roughly one million square miles spanning the provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba, the states of North Dakota, Minnesota, Nebraska and the majority of the territory in the states of South Dakota, Iowa and Wisconsin. The region includes more than 130 organizations that are involved in the production and delivery of power to more than 20 million people. These organizations include municipal utilities, cooperatives, investor-owned utilities, a federal power marketing agency, Canadian Crown Corporations, independent power producers and others who have interests in the reliability of the bulk power system. MRO assumed the reliability functions of the MAPP and Mid-America Interconnected Network, both former voluntary regional reliability councils.

MISO 

&#160;

OTP is a member of the MISO. As the transmission provider and security coordinator for the region, the MISO seeks to optimize the efficiency of the interconnected system, provide regional solutions to regional planning needs and minimize risk to reliability through its security coordination, long-term regional planning, market monitoring, scheduling and tariff administration functions. The MISO covers a broad region containing all or parts of 15 states and the Canadian province of Manitoba. The MISO has operational control of OTP&#8217;s transmission facilities above 100 kV, but OTP continues to own and maintain its transmission assets.

&#160;

Through the MISO Energy Markets, MISO seeks to develop options for energy supply, increase utilization of transmission assets, optimize the use of energy resources across a wider region and provide greater visibility of data. MISO aims to facilitate a more cost-effective and efficient use of the wholesale bulk electric system.

&#160;

The MISO Ancillary Services Market (ASM) facilitates the provision of Regulation, Spinning Reserve and Supplemental Reserves. The ASM integrates the procurement and use of regulation and contingency reserves with the existing Energy Market. OTP has actively participated in the market since its commencement.

&#160;

Other 

&#160;

OTP is subject to various federal laws, including the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (which are intended to promote the conservation of energy and the development and use of alternative energy sources) and the Energy Policy Act of 2005.

&#160;

Competition, Deregulation and Legislation 

&#160;

Electric sales are subject to competition in some areas from municipally owned systems, rural electric cooperatives and, in certain respects, from on-site generators and cogenerators. Electricity also competes with other forms of energy. The degree of competition may vary from time to time depending on relative costs and supplies of other forms of energy.

&#160;

The Company believes OTP is well positioned to be successful in a competitive environment. A comparison of OTP&#8217;s electric retail rates to the rates of other investor-owned utilities, cooperatives and municipals in the states OTP serves indicates OTP&#8217;s rates are competitive.

&#160;

Legislative and regulatory activity could affect operations in the future. OTP cannot predict the timing or substance of any future legislation or regulation. The Company does not expect retail competition to come to the states of Minnesota, North Dakota or South Dakota in the foreseeable future. There has been no legislative action regarding electric retail choice in any of the states where OTP operates. The Minnesota legislature has in the past considered legislation that, if passed, would have limited the Company&#8217;s ability to maintain and grow its nonelectric businesses.

&#160;

OTP is unable to predict the impact on its operations resulting from future regulatory activities, from future legislation or from future taxes that may be imposed on the source or use of energy.

&#160;

Environmental Regulation 

&#160;

Impact of Environmental Laws &#8212;OTP&#8217;s existing generating plants are subject to stringent federal and state standards and regulations regarding, among other things, air, water and solid waste pollution. In the five years ended December 31, 2015 OTP invested approximately $214 million in environmental control facilities. The 2016 and 2017 construction budgets include approximately $3 million and $2 million, respectively, for environmental equipment for existing facilities.

&#160;

Air Quality - Criteria Pollutants &#8212;Pursuant to the CAA, the EPA has promulgated national primary and secondary standards for certain air pollutants.

&#160;

The primary fuels burned by OTP&#8217;s steam generating plants are North Dakota lignite coal and western subbituminous coal. Electrostatic precipitators have been installed at the principal units at the Hoot Lake Plant. Hoot Lake Plant Unit 1, which is the smallest of the three coal-fired units at Hoot Lake Plant, was retired as of December 31, 2005. The Hoot Lake Plant is currently operating within all presently applicable federal and state air quality and emission standards.

&#160;

The South Dakota Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) issued a Title V Operating Permit to the Big Stone Plant on June 9, 2009, allowing for operation. The Big Stone Plant continues to operate under Title V permit provisions. The Big Stone Plant is currently operating within all presently applicable federal and state air quality and emission standards.

&#160;

&#160; 17 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The Coyote Station is equipped with sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) removal equipment. The removal equipment&#8212;referred to as a dry scrubber&#8212;consists of a spray dryer, followed by a fabric filter, and is designed to desulfurize hot gases from the stack. The fabric filter collects spray dryer residue along with the fly ash. The Coyote Station is currently operating within all presently applicable federal and state air quality and emission standards.

&#160;

The CAA, in addressing acid deposition, imposed requirements on power plants in an effort to reduce national emissions of SO 2 and nitrogen oxides (NO x ).

&#160;

The national Acid Rain Program SO 2 emission reduction goals are achieved through a market based system under which power plants are allocated &#34;emissions allowances&#34; that require plants to either reduce their SO 2 emissions or acquire allowances from others to achieve compliance. Each allowance is an authorization to emit one ton of SO 2 . SO 2 emission requirements are currently being met by all of OTP&#8217;s generating facilities without the need to acquire additional allowances for compliance with the acid deposition provisions of the CAA.

&#160;

The national Acid Rain Program NO x emission reduction goals are achieved by imposing mandatory emissions standards on individual sources. All of OTP&#8217;s generating facilities met the NO x standards during 2015.

&#160;

On July 8, 2011 the EPA released the final Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR). The rule requires SO 2 and NO x emission reductions in 23 primarily eastern states in order to allow downwind states to achieve national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). A number of states and industry representatives challenged the rule. On December 30, 2011 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit granted motions to stay CSAPR pending the court's resolution of the petitions for review. The D.C. Circuit issued an order on August 21, 2012 vacating CSAPR. The United States sought Supreme Court review of the D.C. Circuit&#8217;s decision vacating CSAPR, and the Supreme Court granted review. On April 29, 2014 the U.S. Supreme Court issued its opinion, reversing the August 21, 2012 decision of the D.C. Circuit that had vacated CSAPR. CSAPR was remanded to the D.C. Circuit for further proceedings where, on July 26, 2014, the United States moved to lift the previously&#8211;entered stay. The EPA's motion asked the D.C. Circuit to implement CSAPR's Phase 1 emission budgets beginning January 1, 2015 for the annual SO 2 and NO x programs with stricter Phase 2 budgets beginning in 2017. The D.C. Circuit granted the EPA&#8217;s motion on October 23, 2014. On December 3, 2014 the EPA issued an interim final rule that tolls the original CSAPR deadlines by three years, such that the CSAPR program began in 2015. Remaining arguments to CSAPR were heard before the D.C. Circuit on February 25, 2015, and on July 28, 2015 the D.C. Circuit remanded certain states emissions budgets back to EPA, but rejected all remaining challenges to the rule.

&#160;

The CSAPR rule applies to OTP&#8217;s Solway gas peaking plant and the Hoot Lake coal-fired plant in Minnesota. Hoot Lake Plant may be required to purchase SO 2 allowances to continue operating at historical levels. Minnesota is considered a Group 2 state for SO 2 compliance along with Alabama, Georgia, Kansas, Nebraska, South Carolina and Texas. Any SO 2 allowances that need to be obtained for Hoot Lake Plant will need to be from an entity in a Group 2 state. However, due to reduced dispatch of Hoot Lake Plant in 2015 and early 2016 due to power market conditions, and a decline in Group 2 SO 2 allowance prices throughout 2015, the impact of the CSAPR rule is anticipated to be minimal.

&#160;

On December 3, 2015 the EPA proposed an update to the CSAPR addressing the D.C. Circuit remand and to address interstate emission transport with respect to the more recent 2008 ozone NAAQS. The proposed updated controls do not apply to Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota.

&#160;

On October 1, 2015 the EPA announced that it has tightened the primary and secondary NAAQS for ozone from 75 parts per billion (ppb) to 70 ppb. This is at the upper end of the range of which the EPA had proposed, which was 65 to 70 ppb. The EPA plans to use 2014-2016 air quality data to make final determinations of whether areas are in attainment with the new standard by October 1, 2017. It appears that the states in which OTP operates will not have any nonattainment areas at the 70 ppb level. Nonattainment areas are required to meet the standard in the 2020 to 2037 timeframe, with deadlines depending on the severity of an area's ozone problem. During the fourth quarter of 2015 several parties filed petitions for review in the D.C. Circuit challenging the rule and that litigation is now pending.

&#160;

In June 2010, the EPA established a new primary NAAQS for SO 2 at a level of 75 ppb on a 1-hour average. Designations for this standard are proceeding under several different pathways. For certain large sources as defined by 2012 emissions, including Big Stone and Coyote, the EPA entered into a consent decree with the Sierra Club/NRDC on March 2, 2015 that requires the EPA to promulgate final designations near those sources by July 2, 2016. The EPA will primarily use modeling analyses submitted by States and stakeholders to determine designations. Numerous other sources, including Hoot Lake Plant, are covered by the EPA's final Data Requirements Rule (DRR) that was finalized in August of 2015. The DRR will require states to provide either modeling or monitoring data to adequately characterize SO 2 emissions surrounding those sources. Under the modeling pathway for the DRR, states are required to submit results to the EPA by January 13, 2017.

Air Quality &#8211; Hazardous Air Pollutants &#8212;On December 16, 2011 the EPA signed a final rule to reduce mercury and other air toxics emissions from power plants known as the MATS rule. The final rule became effective on April 16, 2012, and plants had until April 16, 2015 to comply. However, the EPA encouraged state permitting authorities to broadly grant a one-year compliance extension to plants that need additional time to install controls. The DENR granted Big Stone Plant a one-year compliance extension in August 2013. The EPA is also providing a pathway for reliability-critical units to obtain an additional year to achieve compliance; however, the EPA has indicated that it believes there will be few, if any situations, in which this pathway is needed. OTP's affected units are meeting the requirements by installing the AQCS system at Big Stone, by upgrading the electrostatic precipitators on Hoot Lake Units 2 and 3, and by installing activated carbon injection on all units. Emissions monitoring equipment and/or stack testing is being used to verify compliance with the standards. Numerous petitions were filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit challenging the MATS rule. On April 15, 2014 the Court denied all petitions for review. Certain parties filed petitions for certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court. On November 25, 2014 the U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari limited to the single question of whether the EPA unreasonably refused to consider costs in determining whether it is appropriate to regulate hazardous air pollutants emitted by electric utilities. On June 29, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court found that the EPA unreasonably refused to consider cost - including the cost of compliance - before deciding whether the MATS regulation was appropriate and necessary. The case was remanded to the D.C. Circuit for further proceedings, and on December 15, 2015 the Court decided to remand MATS to the EPA to address the Supreme Court decision, but not to vacate the rule during the remand. In the remand order, the Court noted that the EPA has said that it is on track to issue a revised &#34;appropriate and necessary&#34; finding by April 15, 2016. Because no stay of the rule was obtained, MATS continues to govern pending resolution of the remand. On December 1, 2015 the EPA proposed a supplemental finding that included a consideration of costs that supported an &#8220;appropriate and necessary&#8221; finding and has committed to issuing its revised finding by April 15, 2016.

&#160;

Air Quality &#8211; EPA New Source Review Enforcement Initiative &#8212;In 1998 the EPA announced its New Source Review Enforcement Initiative targeting coal-fired utilities, petroleum refineries, pulp and paper mills and other industries for alleged violations of the EPA&#8217;s New Source Review rules. These rules require owners or operators that construct new major sources or make major modifications to existing sources to obtain permits and install air pollution control equipment at affected facilities. Pursuant to the Initiative, the EPA is attempting to determine if emission sources violated certain provisions of the CAA by making major modifications to their facilities without installing state-of-the-art pollution controls. OTP has not received any recent requests from the EPA, pursuant to Section 114(a) of the CAA, to provide information relative to past operation and capital construction projects at its coal-fired plants

&#160;

Air Quality &#8211; Regional Haze Program &#8212;The EPA promulgated the Regional Haze Rule in 1999, and on June 15, 2005 the EPA provided final guidelines for conducting BART determinations under the rule. The Regional Haze Rule requires emissions reductions from BART-eligible sources that are deemed to contribute to visibility impairment in Class I air quality areas. Big Stone Plant is BART eligible, and the South Dakota DENR determined that the plant is subject to emission reduction requirements based on the modeled contribution of the plant emissions to visibility impairment in downwind Class I air quality areas. Based on the South Dakota DENR's BART determination and the final South Dakota Regional Haze State Implementation Plan (SIP) approved by the EPA on March 29, 2012, Big Stone was required to install Selective Catalytic Reduction and separated over-fire air to reduce NO x emissions, dry flue gas desulfurization to reduce SO 2 emissions, and a new baghouse for particulate matter control. The deadline for Big Stone Plant to install and operate the BART compliant air quality control system was as expeditiously as practicable, but not later than five years after the EPA&#8217;s final approval of May 29, 2012. The AQCS equipment was placed into commercial operation on December 29, 2015.

&#160;

The North Dakota Regional Haze SIP requires that Coyote Station reduce its NO x emissions. On March 14, 2011 the North Dakota Department of Health (NDDOH) issued a construction permit to Coyote Station requiring installation of control equipment to limit its NO x emissions to 0.5 pounds per million Btu as calculated on a 30-day rolling average basis beginning on July 1, 2018. The project is planned for installation during a spring 2016 outage. On March 1, 2012 the EPA signed a final rule for partial approval of the North Dakota SIP that included the NO x emission rate permit conditions for Coyote Station as proposed by the NDDOH. The rule became effective on May 7, 2012.

&#160;

Air Quality &#8211; Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Regulation &#8212;Combustion of fossil fuels for the generation of electricity is a considerable stationary source of CO 2 emissions in the United States and globally. OTP is an owner or part-owner of three baseload, coal-fired electricity generating plants and three fuel-oil or natural gas-fired combustion turbine peaking plants with a combined net dependable capacity of 656 MW. In 2015 these plants emitted approximately 2.2 million tons of CO 2. 

&#160;

In April 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision that determined that the EPA has authority to regulate CO 2 and other GHGs from automobiles as &#8220;air pollutants&#8221; under the CAA. The EPA thereafter conducted a rulemaking to determine whether GHG emissions contribute to climate change &#8220;which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.&#8221; While this case addressed a provision of the CAA related to emissions from motor vehicles, a parallel provision of the CAA applies to stationary sources such as electric generators; according to the EPA, that parallel provision would be automatically triggered once the EPA began regulating motor vehicle GHG emissions. The first step in the EPA rulemaking process was the publication of an endangerment finding in the December 15, 2009 Federal Register where the EPA found

&#160;

&#160; 19 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

that CO 2 and five other GHGs &#8211; methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride &#8211; threaten public health and the environment.

&#160;

The EPA&#8217;s endangerment findings did not in and of themselves impose any emission reduction requirements but rather authorized the EPA to finalize the GHG standards for new light-duty vehicles as part of the joint rulemaking with the Department of Transportation. These standards applied to motor vehicles as of January 2011, which the EPA determined made GHGs &#8220;subject to regulation&#8221; under the CAA. According to the EPA, this triggered the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Title V operating permits programs for stationary sources of GHGs.

&#160;

On June 6, 2010 the EPA published a final &#8220;tailoring rule&#8221; that phases in application of its PSD and Title V programs to GHG emission sources, including power plants. The PSD program applies to existing sources if there is a physical change or change in the method of operation of the facility that results in a significant net emissions increase of any pollutant. As a result, PSD does not apply on a set timeline as is the case with other regulatory programs, but is triggered depending on what activities take place at a major source. If triggered, the owner or operator of an affected facility must undergo a review which requires, among other things, the identification and implementation of best-available control technology (BACT) for the regulated air pollutants for which there is a significant net emissions increase, and an analysis of the ambient air quality impacts of the facility.

&#160;

In June 2012 the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit upheld most of the EPA&#8217;s rules regarding the regulation of GHGs under the CAA, including the tailoring rule. However, in October 2013 the U.S. Supreme Court granted a petition for a writ of certiorari to review the question of whether the regulation of new motor vehicle GHG emissions does in fact automatically trigger PSD and Title V regulation of GHGs for stationary sources. On June 23, 2014 the U.S. Supreme Court issued its decision that, in summary, held the EPA exceeded its statutory authority and may not require a PSD or Title V permit based solely on GHG emissions. However, the U.S. Supreme Court also said the EPA could continue to require that PSD permits for sources otherwise subject to PSD based on emissions of conventional pollutants, contain limitations on GHG emissions based on the application of BACT. The EPA revised its regulations to implement this ruling. OTP does not anticipate making modifications that would trigger PSD requirements at any of its facilities or undertaking construction of a new unit that might trigger PSD.

&#160;

The EPA developed New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for GHGs from new and existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. On October 23, 2015 the EPA published the final NSPS under section 111(b) of the CAA that requires certain new units (as well as modified and reconstructed units) to meet CO 2 emission standards. New natural gas combustion turbines are required to meet a standard of 1,000 lbs of CO 2 per gross megawatt hour averaged over a 12 month period if they meet the definition of a baseload unit. New natural gas combined cycle units are anticipated to fit into this category. Simple cycle combustion turbines are regulated in a non-baseload category that is required to meet a heat input based standard that can be met by burning clean fuels such as natural gas.

&#160;

The EPA also published GHG performance standards for existing sources under CAA Section 111(d) (111(d) Standard). A 111(d) Standard, unlike those set under CAA Section 111(b), applies to existing sources of a pollutant. Under Section 111(d), the EPA promulgates emission guidelines, and the states are then given a period of time to develop plans to implement the standard. The EPA reviews each state-developed standard and then approves it if the state&#8217;s plan comports with the federal emission guidelines; if the state does not submit a plan or the EPA finds that the plan is inadequate, the EPA will prescribe a plan for that state.

&#160;

For both new and existing sources, the EPA must develop a &#8220;standard of performance,&#8221; which is defined as:

&#160;

&#8230;a standard for emissions of air pollutants which reflects the degree of emission limitation achievable through the application of the best system of emission reduction which (taking into account the cost of achieving such reduction and any non-air quality health and environmental impact and energy requirements) the [EPA] Administrator determines has been adequately demonstrated.

&#160;

For existing sources, Section 111(d) also requires the EPA to consider, &#8220;among other factors, remaining useful lives of the sources in the category of sources to which such standard applies.&#8221;

&#160;

On June 18, 2014 the EPA published proposed Section 111(d) emission guidelines for existing fossil fuel-fired power plants, termed the Clean Power Plan (CPP). The CPP proposed state-specific rate-based goals for CO 2 emissions from the power sector, as well as guidelines for states to follow in developing plans to achieve the goals. An interim goal was proposed to be achieved on average over the ten year period of 2020-2029, and a final goal in 2030 and each year thereafter. The EPA used a formula that relies on four building blocks to determine the state-specific goal: (1) a six percent heat rate improvement at each coal plant, (2) increased reliance on natural gas combined cycle units, (3) a renewable energy target, and (4) demand side energy efficiency savings. Specific to OTP, EPA's proposed formula created substantially different targets for North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota, primarily due to the EPA's second building block that envisioned redispatching natural gas combined cycle units to a 70% capacity factor.

&#160;

&#160; 20 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

On October 23, 2015 the EPA published the final CPP. The final rule delayed the start of the interim goal period to 2022 and used a different formula to calculate state goals that resulted in a narrower range of state-specific targets. The EPA formula relied on only three building blocks in the final rule: (1) a heat rate improvement at each coal plant, (2) increased reliance on natural gas combined cycle units, and (3) increased deployment of renewable energy. These building blocks were applied to each grid interconnection that resulted in final national uniform emission rate standards of 1,305 pounds of CO 2 per net megawatt hour for coal plants and 771 pounds of CO 2 per net megawatt hour for natural gas combined cycle plants. These uniform rates were applied on a weighted average basis to the affected units of each state, resulting in a much narrower range of goals in the final rule as compared to the proposed rule. The EPA then translated the rate goals into mass based goals that can be applied to existing sources, or if a state chooses, a mass based goal that applies to both existing sources and new sources. States must submit a final implementation plan or a request for a two year extension by September 6, 2016, with final plans due by September 6, 2018. OTP is actively reviewing how the CPP might impact its operations and is actively engaged with our state stakeholders in the plan development process in the relevant states.

&#160;

A number of states, utilities, and trade groups have filed petitions for review with the D.C. Circuit seeking to overturn the rule, and also moved to stay the rule. On January 14, 2016 the D.C. Circuit denied the stay motions, but expedited briefing so that briefing would be concluded in April and oral argument would occur in June 2016. Numerous petitioners then sought an emergency stay in the U.S. Supreme Court. On February 9, 2016 the U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay of the CPP pending disposition of the petitions for review in the D.C. Circuit and disposition of a petition for a writ of certiorari seeking review by the U.S. Supreme Court, if such a writ is sought. It is possible the D.C. Circuit may rule on the merits of the CPP in late 2016 or early 2017. If, and when, review will occur at the U.S. Supreme Court is not known at this time.

&#160;

Also on October 23, 2015, the EPA proposed model trading rules along with the proposed federal plan for states that do not have a fully approved state plan. The EPA proposed both a rate-based trading plan and a mass-based trading plan for the federal plan. The EPA indicated it intends to finalize a single plan type, but accepted comments on this concept as well as several other aspects. A state program that adheres to the model trading rule provisions specified in the rulemaking would be presumptively approvable. The EPA intends to finalize the model trading rules in summer 2016 but will not issue a federal plan until it has formally determined a state has failed to comply with a deadline for plan submission.

&#160;

Several states and regional organizations have or will develop state-specific or regional legislative initiatives to reduce GHG emissions through mandatory programs. In 2007, the state of Minnesota passed legislation regarding renewable energy portfolio standards that requires retail electricity providers to obtain 25% of the electric energy sold to Minnesota customers from renewable sources by the year 2025. Additionally, in 2013 the state of Minnesota passed a provision that requires public utilities to generate or procure sufficient electricity generated by solar energy to serve its retail electricity customers in Minnesota so that by the end of 2020, at least 1.5% of the utility's total retail electric sales to retail customers in Minnesota is generated by solar energy. The Minnesota legislature set a January 1, 2008 deadline for the MPUC to establish an estimate of the likely range of costs of future CO 2 regulation on electricity generation. The legislation also set state targets for reducing fossil fuel use, included goals for reducing the state's output of GHGs, and restricted importing electricity that would contribute to statewide power sector CO 2 emission. The MPUC, in its order dated December 21, 2007, established an estimate of future CO 2 regulation costs at between $4/ton and $30/ton emitted in 2012 and after. Annual updates of the range are required. For 2015 the range is $9-$34/ton, and the applicable effective date to begin using CO 2 costs in resource planning decisions is 2019. Minnesota opened a new docket to investigate the environmental and socioeconomic costs of externalities associated with electricity generation. A final ruling in that case is not expected until late in 2016.

&#160;

The states of North Dakota and South Dakota currently have no proposed or pending legislation related to the regulation of GHG emissions, but North Dakota and South Dakota have 10% renewable energy objectives. OTP currently has sufficient renewable generation to meet the renewable energy objectives in both North Dakota and South Dakota.

&#160;

While the eventual outcome of proposed and pending climate change legislation and GHG regulation is unknown, OTP is taking steps to reduce its carbon footprint and mitigate levels of CO 2 emitted in the process of generating electricity for its customers through the following initiatives:

&#160;

&#183; Supply efficiency and reliability: OTP&#8217;s efforts to increase plant efficiency and add renewable energy to its resource mix have reduced its CO 2 intensity. Between 1985 and 2015 OTP decreased its overall system average CO 2 emissions intensity by approximately 38%. Further reductions are expected with the anticipated replacement of Hoot Lake Plant generation likely with natural gas in the 2020 timeframe. &#160;

&#183; Conservation: Since 1992 OTP has helped its customers conserve nearly 71 MW of demand and nearly 3.1 million cumulative megawatt-hours of electricity, which is roughly equivalent to the amount of electricity that 258,000 average homes would use in a year. OTP continues to educate customers about energy efficiency and demand-side management and to work with regulators to develop new programs. OTP&#8217;s 2014-2028 IRP calls for an additional 106 MW of conservation and demand-side management impacts by 2028. &#160;

&#160; 21 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; Renewable energy: Since 2002, OTP&#8217;s customers have been able to purchase 100% of their electricity from wind generation through OTP&#8217;s Tail Winds program. OTP has access to 102.9 MW of wind powered generation under power purchase agreements and owns 138 MW of wind powered generation. &#160;

&#183; Other: OTP is a participating member of the EPA&#8217;s sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6 ) Emission Reduction Partnership for Electric Power Systems program, which proactively is targeting a reduction in emissions of SF 6 , a potent GHG. SF 6 has a global-warming potential 23,900 times that of CO 2 . Methane has a global-warming potential over 20 times that of CO 2 . OTP participates in carbon sequestration research through the Plains CO 2 Reduction (PCOR) Partnership through the University of North Dakota&#8217;s Energy and Environmental Research Center. The PCOR Partnership is a collaborative effort of approximately 100 public and private sector stakeholders working toward a better understanding of the technical and economic feasibility of capturing and storing anthropogenic CO 2 emissions from stationary sources in central North America. &#160;

In late 2009, two federal circuit courts of appeal reversed dismissals of suits seeking federal common law liability for GHG emissions and remanded them to district court for trial. OTP was not a party to any of these suits, and does not have an indication that it will be the subject of such a lawsuit. The circuit court opinions, however, opened utility companies and other GHG emitters to these actions, which had previously been dismissed by the district courts as non-justiciable based on the political question doctrine. In 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court took review of one of these cases, while declining review of another. On June 20, 2011, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that states cannot invoke federal common law to force utilities to cut GHG emissions, which was in agreement with the position of utilities and the EPA.

&#160;

While the future financial impact of any proposed or pending climate change legislation, litigation, or regulation of GHG emissions is unknown at this time, any capital and operating costs incurred for additional pollution control equipment or CO 2 emission reduction measures, such as the cost of sequestration or purchasing allowances, or offset credits, or the imposition of a carbon tax or cap and trade program at the state or federal level could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s future results of operations, cash flows, and possibly financial condition, unless such costs could be recovered through regulated rates and/or future market prices for energy.

&#160;

Water Quality &#8212;The Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, and amendments thereto, provide for, among other things, the imposition of effluent limitations to regulate discharges of pollutants, including thermal discharges, into the waters of the United States, and the EPA has established effluent guidelines for the steam electric power generating industry. Discharges must also comply with state water quality standards.

&#160;

Effluent limits specific to Hoot Lake Plant and Coyote Station are incorporated into their National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits. Big Stone Plant is a zero discharge facility and therefore does not have a NPDES permit. The EPA announced its decision to proceed with further possible revisions to steam effluent guidelines on September 15, 2009, and published a proposed rulemaking on June 7, 2013. On November 3, 2015 the EPA published the final rule that sets technology-based effluent limitations on certain types of discharges. Generally, the final rule establishes new requirements for wastewater streams from wet flue gas desulfurization, fly ash transport, and bottom ash transport. This includes zero discharge requirements for fly ash and bottom ash transport water. OTP&#8217;s facilities either utilize dry ash handling or use transport water in a closed loop manner, and therefore OTP anticipates minimal impact from the rule.

&#160;

On May 9, 2014 the EPA Administrator signed a final rule implementing Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act establishing standards for cooling water intake structures for certain existing facilities. The final rule includes seven compliance options, plus a potential &#34;de minimis&#34; option that is not well defined. Although the impact of the Hoot Lake Plant intake structure has been extensively evaluated in two separate studies both of which showed minimal impact, OTP will need to have state agency discussions during the renewal of the Hoot Lake Plant NPDES permit to determine the appropriate path forward. Coyote Station will also need to provide various studies with their next NPDES permit renewal application, but minimal impact is anticipated since Coyote already uses closed-cycle cooling.

&#160;

OTP has all federal and state water permits presently necessary for the operation of the Coyote Station, the Big Stone Plant and the Hoot Lake Plant. OTP owns five small dams on the Otter Tail River, which are subject to FERC licensing requirements. A license for all five dams was issued on December 5, 1991. Total nameplate rating (manufacturer&#8217;s expected output) of the five dams is 3,450 kW.

&#160;

Solid Waste &#8212;Permits for disposal of ash and other solid wastes have been issued for the Coyote Station, the Big Stone Plant and the Hoot Lake Plant.

&#160;

On December 19, 2014 the EPA announced a final rule regulating coal combustion residuals (CCR) under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulating the disposal of coal ash generated from the combustion of coal by electric utilities under Subtitle D&#8217;s nonhazardous provisions. The final rule was published on April 17, 2015. The rule requires OTP to complete certain actions, such as installing additional groundwater monitoring wells and investigating whether existing surface impoundments meet defined location restrictions, in order to determine whether existing surface

&#160;

&#160; 22 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

impoundments should be retired or retrofitted with liners. OTP has not yet completed its actions, therefore, the cost impact of this rule will not be known until those actions are completed. Existing landfill cells can continue to operate as designed, but future expansions will require composite liner and leachate collection systems. Congress has sought to pass and is still considering legislation to modify the rule. Petitions for judicial review of the rule are currently pending in the D.C. Circuit Court. Thus, the future financial impact of this rule is unknown at this time.

&#160;

At the request of the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA), OTP has an ongoing investigation at its former, closed Hoot Lake Plant ash disposal sites. The MPCA continues to monitor site activities under its Voluntary Investigation and Cleanup (VIC) Program. OTP provided a revised focus feasibility study for remediation alternatives to the MPCA in October 2004. OTP and the MPCA have reached an agreement identifying the remediation technology and OTP completed the projects in 2006. The effectiveness of the remediation is under ongoing evaluation. OTP completed additional projects in 2014 and 2015 that removed the ash from two entire VIC areas and placed it in OTP&#8217;s permitted disposal area.

&#160;

The EPA has promulgated various solid and hazardous waste regulations and guidelines pursuant to, among other laws, the RCRA, the Solid Waste Disposal Act Amendments of 1980 and the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984, which provide for, among other things, the comprehensive control of various solid and hazardous wastes from generation to final disposal. The states of Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota have also adopted rules and regulations pertaining to solid and hazardous waste. To date, OTP has incurred no significant costs as a result of these laws. The future total impact on OTP of the various solid and hazardous waste statutes and regulations enacted by the federal government or the states of Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota now or in the future is unknown at this time.

&#160;

In 1980, the United States enacted the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as CERCLA or the Federal Superfund law, which was reauthorized and amended in 1986. In 1983, Minnesota adopted the Minnesota Environmental Response and Liability Act, commonly known as the Minnesota Superfund law. In 1988, South Dakota enacted the Regulated Substance Discharges Act, commonly known as the South Dakota Superfund law. In 1989, North Dakota enacted the Environmental Emergency Cost Recovery Act. Among other requirements, the federal and state acts establish environmental response funds to pay for remedial actions associated with the release or threatened release of certain regulated substances into the environment. These federal and state Superfund laws also establish liability for cleanup costs and damage to the environment resulting from such release or threatened release of regulated substances. The Minnesota Superfund law also creates liability for personal injury and economic loss under certain circumstances. OTP has not incurred any significant costs to date related to these laws. OTP is not presently named as a potentially responsible party under the federal or state Superfund laws.

&#160;

Capital Expenditures 

&#160;

OTP is continually expanding, replacing and improving its electric facilities. During 2015, approximately $136 million in cash was invested for additions and replacements to its electric utility properties. During the five years ended December 31, 2015 gross electric property additions, including construction work in progress, were approximately $610 million and gross retirements were approximately $86 million. OTP estimates that during the five-year period 2016-2020 it will invest approximately $858 million for electric construction, which includes $213 million for MVP transmission projects, $162 million for natural gas-fired generation to replace Hoot Lake Plant capacity and $190 million for renewable wind and solar energy generation projects. The remainder of the 2016-2020 anticipated capital expenditures is for asset replacements, additions and improvements across OTP&#8217;s generation, transmission, distribution and general plant. See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Requirements&#8221; section for further discussion.

&#160;

Franchises 

&#160;

At December 31, 2015 OTP had franchises to operate as an electric utility in substantially all of the incorporated municipalities it serves. All franchises are nonexclusive and generally were obtained for 20-year terms, with varying expiration dates. No franchises are required to serve unincorporated communities in any of the three states that OTP serves. OTP believes that its franchises will be renewed prior to expiration.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

At December 31, 2015 OTP had 651 equivalent full-time employees. A total of 394 OTP employees are represented by local unions of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers under two separate contracts expiring in the fall of 2016 and 2017. OTP has not experienced any strike, work stoppage or strike vote, and considers its present relations with employees to be good.

MANUFACTURING 

&#160;

General 

&#160;

Manufacturing consists of businesses engaged in the following activities: contract machining, metal parts stamping, fabrication and painting, and production of material handling trays and horticultural containers.

&#160;

The Company derived 28%, 27% and 28% of its consolidated operating revenues and 9%, 17% and 22% of its consolidated operating income from the Manufacturing segment for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Following is a brief description of each of these businesses:

&#160;

BTD Manufacturing, Inc. (BTD) , with headquarters located in Detroit Lakes, Minnesota, is a metal stamping and tool and die manufacturer that provides its services mainly to customers in the Midwest. BTD stamps, fabricates, welds, paints and laser cuts metal components according to manufacturers&#8217; specifications primarily for the recreational vehicle, agricultural, oil and gas, lawn and garden, industrial equipment, health and fitness and enclosure industries in its facilities in Detroit Lakes and Lakeville, Minnesota, Washington, Illinois and Dawsonville, Georgia. BTD&#8217;s Illinois facility also manufactures and fabricates parts for off-road equipment, mining machinery, oil fields and offshore oil rigs, wind industry components, broadcast antennae and farm equipment, and serves several major equipment manufacturers in the Peoria, Illinois area and nationwide, including Caterpillar, Komatsu and Gardner Denver.

&#160;

On September 1, 2015 Miller Welding and Iron Works, Inc. (BTD-Illinois), a wholly owned subsidiary of BTD, acquired the assets of Impulse Manufacturing Inc. (Impulse) of Dawsonville, Georgia for $30.8 million in cash, subject to a post-closing adjustment. The newly acquired business now operates under the name BTD-Georgia. BTD-Georgia, a full-service metal fabricator located 30 miles north of Atlanta, Georgia, recorded revenues of $27 million in 2014. BTD-Georgia offers a wide range of metal fabrication services ranging from simple laser cutting services and high volume stamping to complex weldments and assemblies for metal fabrication buyers and original equipment manufacturers.

&#160;

T.O. Plastics, Inc. (T.O. Plastics) , located in Otsego and Clearwater, Minnesota, manufactures and sells thermoformed products for the horticulture industry throughout the United States. In addition, T.O. Plastics produces products such as clamshell packing, blister packs, returnable pallets and handling trays for shipping and storing odd-shaped or difficult-to-handle parts for customers in the consumer products, food packaging, electronics, industrial and medical industries, among others. T.O. Plastics&#8217; Otsego thermoforming facility has an AIB International compliance rating for producing food-contact packaging materials in its operations.

&#160;

Product Distribution 

&#160;

The principal method for distribution of the manufacturing companies&#8217; products is by direct shipment to the customer by common carrier ground transportation. No single customer or product of the Company&#8217;s manufacturing companies accounts for over 10% of the Company&#8217;s consolidated revenue.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The various markets in which the Manufacturing segment entities compete are characterized by intense competition from both foreign and domestic manufacturers. These markets have many established manufacturers with broader product lines, greater distribution capabilities, greater capital resources, excess capacity, labor advantages and larger marketing, research and development staffs and facilities than the Company&#8217;s manufacturing entities.

&#160;

The Company believes the principal competitive factors in its Manufacturing segment are product performance, quality, price, technical innovation, cost effectiveness, customer service and breadth of product line. The Company&#8217;s manufacturing entities intend to continue to compete on the basis of high-performance products, innovative production technologies, cost-effective manufacturing techniques, close customer relations and support, and increasing product offerings.

&#160;

Raw Materials Supply 

&#160;

The companies in the Manufacturing segment use raw materials in the products they manufacture, including steel, aluminum and polystyrene and other plastics resins. Both pricing increases and availability of these raw materials are concerns of companies in the Manufacturing segment. The companies in the Manufacturing segment attempt to pass increases in the costs of these raw materials on to their customers. Increases in the costs of raw materials that cannot be passed on to customers could have a negative effect on profit margins in the Manufacturing segment. Additionally, a certain amount of residual material, scrap, is a by-product of many of the manufacturing and production processes used by the Company&#8217;s manufacturing companies. Declines in commodity prices for these scrap materials due to weakened demand or excess supply

&#160;

&#160; 24 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

can negatively impact the profitability of the Company&#8217;s manufacturing companies as it reduces their ability to mitigate the cost associated with excess material.

&#160;

Backlog 

&#160;

The Manufacturing segment has backlog in place to support 2016 revenues of approximately $134 million compared with $140 million one year ago.

&#160;

Capital Expenditures 

&#160;

Capital expenditures in the Manufacturing segment typically include additional investments in new manufacturing equipment or expenditures to replace worn-out manufacturing equipment. Capital expenditures may also be made for the purchase of land and buildings for plant expansion and for investments in management information systems. During 2015, cash expenditures for capital additions in the Manufacturing segment were approximately $20 million. Total capital expenditures for the Manufacturing segment during the five-year period 2016-2020 are estimated to be approximately $97 million.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

At December 31, 2015 the Manufacturing segment had 1,153 full-time employees. There were 1,026 full-time employees at BTD and its subsidiaries and 127 full-time employees at T.O. Plastics as of December 31, 2015.

&#160;

PLASTICS 

&#160;

General 

&#160;

Plastics consists of businesses producing PVC pipe at plants in North Dakota and Arizona. The Company derived 20%, 22% and 22% of its consolidated operating revenues and 19%, 20% and 25% of its consolidated operating income from the Plastics segment for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Following is a brief description of these businesses:

&#160;

Northern Pipe Products, Inc. (Northern Pipe) , located in Fargo, North Dakota, manufactures and sells PVC pipe for municipal water, rural water, wastewater, storm drainage systems and other uses in the northern, midwestern, south-central and western regions of the United States as well as central and western Canada.

&#160;

Vinyltech Corporation (Vinyltech) , located in Phoenix, Arizona, manufactures and sells PVC pipe for municipal water, wastewater, water reclamation systems and other uses in the western and south-central regions of the United States.

&#160;

Together these companies have the current capacity to produce approximately 300 million pounds of PVC pipe annually.

&#160;

Customers 

&#160;

PVC pipe products are marketed through a combination of independent sales representatives, company salespersons and customer service representatives. Customers for the PVC pipe products consist primarily of wholesalers and distributors throughout the northern, midwestern, south-central and western United States. The principal method for distribution of the PVC pipe companies&#8217; products is by common carrier ground transportation. No single customer of the PVC pipe companies accounts for over 10% of the Company&#8217;s consolidated revenue.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The plastic pipe industry is fragmented and competitive, due to the number of producers, the small number of raw material suppliers and the fungible nature of the product. Due to shipping costs, competition is usually regional, instead of national, in scope. The principal areas of competition are a combination of price, service, warranty, and product performance. Northern Pipe and Vinyltech compete not only against other plastic pipe manufacturers, but also ductile iron, steel, concrete and clay pipe producers. Pricing pressure will continue to affect operating margins in the future.

&#160;

Northern Pipe and Vinyltech intend to continue to compete on the basis of their high quality products, cost-effective production techniques and close customer relations and support.

&#160;

&#160; 25 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Manufacturing and Resin Supply 

&#160;

PVC pipe is manufactured through a process known as extrusion. During the production process, PVC compound (a dry powder-like substance) is introduced into an extrusion machine, where it is heated to a molten state and then forced through a sizing apparatus to produce the pipe. The newly extruded pipe is then pulled through a series of water cooling tanks, marked to identify the type of pipe and cut to finished lengths. Warehouse and outdoor storage facilities are used to store the finished product. Inventory is shipped from storage to distributors and customers by common carrier.

&#160;

The PVC resins are acquired in bulk and shipped to point of use by rail car. There are a limited number of third party vendors that supply the PVC resin used by Northern Pipe and Vinyltech. Two vendors provided approximately 96% and 98% of total resin purchases in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The supply of PVC resin may also be limited primarily due to manufacturing capacity and the limited availability of raw material components. A majority of U.S. resin production plants are located in the Gulf Coast region, which is subject to risk of damage to the plants and potential shutdown of resin production because of exposure to hurricanes that occur in that part of the United States. The loss of a key vendor, or any interruption or delay in the supply of PVC resin, could disrupt the ability of the Plastics segment to manufacture products, cause customers to cancel orders or require incurrence of additional expenses to obtain PVC resin from alternative sources, if such sources were available. Both Northern Pipe and Vinyltech believe they have good relationships with their key raw material vendors.

&#160;

Due to the commodity nature of PVC resin and PVC pipe and the dynamic supply and demand factors worldwide, historically the markets for both PVC resin and PVC pipe have been very cyclical with significant fluctuations in prices and gross margins.

&#160;

Capital Expenditures 

&#160;

Capital expenditures in the Plastics segment typically include investments in extrusion machines, land and buildings and management information systems. During 2015, cash expenditures for capital additions in the Plastics segment were approximately $4 million. Total capital expenditures for the five-year period 2016-2020 are estimated to be approximately $17 million to replace existing equipment.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

At December 31, 2015 the Plastics segment had 155 full-time employees. Northern Pipe had 90 full-time employees and Vinyltech had 65 full-time employees as of December 31, 2015.

&#160;
