Business Overview 

We are a leading mortgage real estate investment trust (or REIT) that is externally managed by Annaly Management Company LLC (or Manager). Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol &#8220;NLY&#8221;. Since our founding in 1997, we have strived to generate net income for distribution to our stockholders and preserve capital through the prudent selection 

&#160; and management of our investments. We own a portfolio of real estate related investments. We use our capital coupled with borrowed funds to invest in real estate related investments, earning the spread between the yield on our assets and the cost of our borrowings. 

Our business operations are primarily comprised of the following:

Description 

Annaly, the parent company 

Invests primarily in various types of Agency mortgage-backed securities and related derivatives to hedge these investments. Its portfolio also includes residential credit investments such as credit risk transfer securities and non-Agency mortgage-backed securities. 

Annaly Commercial Real Estate Group, Inc. (or ACREG ) 

&#160;

Wholly-owned subsidiary that specializes in originating or acquiring, financing and managing commercial loans and other commercial real estate debt, commercial mortgage-backed securities and other commercial real estate-related assets.

&#160;

We have made significant investments in our business as part of the diversification of our investment strategy. Our operating platform has expanded in support of our diversification strategy, and has included investments in systems, infrastructure and personnel. Our operating platform now supports our investments in Agency and residential credit assets, commercial real estate and corporate loans. The diversity of our investment alternatives provides us the flexibility to adapt to changes in market conditions and to take advantage of potential resulting opportunities. 

We believe that our business objectives are supported by our size and conservative financial posture relative to the industry, the extensive experience of our Manager&#8217;s employees, the diversity of our investment strategy, a comprehensive risk management approach, the availability and diversification of financing sources, our corporate structure and our operational efficiencies. 

&#160; Investment Strategy and Capital Allocation Policy 

Our principal business objectives are to generate net income for distribution to our stockholders from our investments and capital preservation. 

We seek to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns and preservation of capital over the long term through investment in a diversified portfolio of target assets. As part of our diversification strategy, in February 2016, our board of directors (or Board) made changes to the capital allocation policy. The updated policy allows us greater flexibility to generate attractive returns for our stockholders. Under our capital allocation policy, subject to oversight by our Board, we may allocate our investments within our target asset classes as we determine is appropriate from time to time. The following target assets have been approved for investment under our capital allocation policy.

Risk Appetite Statement 

We maintain a firm-wide risk appetite statement which defines the level and types of risk that we are willing to take in order to achieve our business objectives and reflects our risk management philosophy. Fundamentally, we will only engage in risk activities that are expected to enhance value for our stockholders based on our core expertise. Our activities focus on capital 

&#160; preservation and income generation through proactive portfolio management, supported by a conservative liquidity and leverage posture. 

Our risk appetite statement asserts the following key risk parameters to guide our investment management activities: 

&#160;

Risk Parameter 

Description 

Portfolio composition 

We will maintain a portfolio comprised of target assets approved by our Board and in accordance with our capital allocation policy. 

Leverage 

We will operate at an economic leverage ratio no greater than 10:1. 

Liquidity Risk 

We will seek to maintain an unencumbered asset portfolio sufficient to meet our liquidity needs under adverse market conditions. 

Interest rate risk 

We will seek to manage interest rate risk to protect the portfolio from adverse rate movements utilizing derivative instruments targeting both income and capital preservation. 

Credit Risk 

We will seek to manage credit risk by making investments which conform within our specific investment policy parameters and optimize risk-adjusted returns. 

Capital preservation 

We will seek to protect our capital base through disciplined risk management practices. 

Compliance 

We will comply with regulatory requirements needed to maintain our REIT status and our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Our Board has reviewed and approved the investment and operating policies and strategies established by our Manager and set forth in this Form 10-K. Our Board has the power to modify or waive these policies and strategies without the consent of the stockholders to the extent that our Board determines that the modification or waiver is in the best interests of our stockholders. Among other factors, developments in the market which affect our policies and strategies or which change our assessment of the market may cause our Board to revise our policies and strategies. 

We may seek to expand our capital base in order to further increase our ability to acquire new and different types of assets when the potential returns from new investments appear attractive relative to the targeted risk-adjusted returns. We may in the future acquire assets by offering our debt or equity securities in exchange for the assets. 

Target Assets 

Within the confines of the risk appetite statement, we seek to generate the highest risk-adjusted returns on capital invested, after consideration of the following: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; &#160; The amount, nature and variability of anticipated cash flows from the asset across a variety of interest rate, yield spread, financing cost, credit loss and prepayment scenarios; 

&#160; 

&#160;&#9679; The liquidity of the asset;

&#160;

&#160;&#9679; The ability to pledge the asset to secure collateralized borrowings;

&#160;

&#160;&#9679; When applicable, the credit of the underlying borrower;

&#160;

&#160;&#9679; The costs of financing, hedging and managing the asset;

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; &#160; The impact of the asset to our REIT compliance and our exemption from registration under 

&#160; the Investment Company Act; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; &#160; The capital requirements associated with the purchase and financing of the asset. &#160;

&#160;

The capital requirements associated with the purchase and financing of the asset. 

&#160;

We target the purchase and sale of the following assets as part of our investment strategy. Our targeted assets and asset acquisition strategy may change over time as market conditions change and as our business evolves. &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Targeted Asset Class 

&#160;

Description 

Residential 

&#160; 

&#160;

Agency mortgage-backed securities 

Our primary investments consist of Agency pass-through certificates, collateralized mortgage obligations (or CMOs) issued or guaranteed by Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae, and other securities such as interest-only securities and inverse floaters. These securities are backed by single-family or multi-family residences with loan maturities typically ranging from 15 to 40 years and may have fixed or floating coupons. 

&#160;

TBAs 

We purchase and sell TBAs which are forward contracts for Agency mortgage-backed securities. TBA contracts specify a few basic characteristics of the Agency mortgage-backed securities, such as the coupon rate, the issuer, term, and the approximate face value of the bonds to be delivered, with the actual bonds to be delivered only identified shortly before the TBA settlement date. 

&#160;

Agency debentures 

We invest in debt issued by Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae or the Federal Home Loan Banks. These debentures are not backed by collateral, but by the creditworthiness of the issuer. 

&#160;

Residential credit investments 

We invest in residential credit investments including: investments in single-family and multi-family privately-issued certificates that are not issued by one of the Agencies, securities backed by a pool of non-performing or re-performing loans, Agency risk sharing transactions issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and similarly structured transactions arranged by third party market participants. We may invest in individual residential loans and pools of loans. 

&#160;

Commercial 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; Commercial real estate 

Through our subsidiary ACREG, we originate and acquire commercial real estate debt including commercial mortgage loans, commercial mortgage-backed securities, B-notes, mezzanine loans, preferred equity and other commercial real estate-related debt investments. We also acquire real property for current cash flow, long-term appreciation and earnings growth. In implementing this strategy, we continually evaluate potential acquisition opportunities. These acquisitions may come through joint venture interests or from other equity investments. Although we continuously review our acquisition pipeline, there is not a specific metric that we apply to acquisitions that are under consideration, and our analysis may vary based on property type, transaction structure and other factors. 

&#160;

&#160; Corporate debt 

Through our subsidiary MML, we invest a small percentage of our assets directly in the ownership of corporate loans and debt securities for middle market companies. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

We believe that future interest rates and mortgage prepayment rates are very difficult to predict. &#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

ANNALY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Business 

&#160;

&#160;

Therefore, we seek to acquire assets which we believe will provide attractive returns over a broad range of interest rate and prepayment scenarios. 

Capital Structure and Financing 

Our capital structure is designed to offer an efficient complement of funding sources to generate positive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders while maintaining appropriate liquidity to support our business and meet our financial obligations under periods of market stress. To maintain our desired capital profile, we utilize a mix of debt and equity funding. Debt funding may include the use of repurchase agreements, Federal Home Loan Bank (or FHLB) advances, loans, securitizations, participation sold, lines of credit, asset backed commercial paper conduits, corporate bond issuance, mortgages payable or other liabilities. Equity capital primarily consists of common and preferred stock. 

We finance our Agency mortgage-backed securities and residential credit investments primarily with repurchase agreements. We also finance certain commercial real estate investments with repurchase agreements. We enter into repurchase agreements with national broker-dealers, commercial banks and other lenders that typically offer this type of financing. We enter into collateralized borrowings with financial institutions meeting internal credit standards and we monitor the financial condition of these institutions on a regular basis. We seek to diversify our exposure and limit concentrations by entering into repurchase agreements with multiple counterparties. At December 31, 2015, we had $56.2 billion of repurchase agreements outstanding. 

Additionally, our wholly owned subsidiary, RCap, provides direct access to bi-lateral and triparty funding as a FINRA member broker-dealer. As an eligible institution, RCap also raises funds through the General Collateral Finance Repo service offered by the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (or FICC), with FICC acting as the central counterparty. Since its inception in 2008, RCap has provided us greater depth and diversity of repurchase agreement funding while also limiting our counterparty exposure. 

Our borrowings pursuant to repurchase transactions include repurchase agreements that have maturities that extend beyond three years. To reduce our liquidity risk we maintain a laddered approach to our repurchase agreements and a conservative weighted average days to maturity. As of December 31, 2015, the weighted average days to maturity was 151 days. 

&#160; We maintain access to FHLB funding through our captive insurance subsidiary Truman Insurance Company LLC (or Truman). We finance eligible Agency, residential and commercial investments through the FHLB. While a recent Federal Housing Finance Agency (or FHFA) ruling requires captive insurance companies to terminate their FHLB membership, given the length of its membership Truman has been granted a five year sunset provision whereby its membership is scheduled to expire in February 2021. We believe our business objectives align well with the mission of the FHLB System. While there can be no assurances that such steps will be taken, we believe it would be appropriate for there to be legislative action to permit Truman and similar captive insurance subsidiaries to retain their membership status beyond the current sunset periods. 

We utilize diverse funding sources to finance our commercial investments. In addition to FHLB funding, we maintain bilateral borrowing facilities, securitization funding and, in the case of investments in commercial real estate, mortgage financing. 

We utilize leverage to enhance the risk-adjusted returns generated for our stockholders. We generally expect to maintain an economic leverage ratio of no greater than 10:1. This ratio varies from time to time based upon various factors, including our management&#8217;s opinion of the level of risk of our assets and liabilities, our liquidity position, our level of unused borrowing capacity, the availability of credit, over-collateralization levels required by lenders when we pledge assets to secure borrowings and, lastly, our assessment of domestic and international market conditions. Since the financial crisis beginning in 2007, we have maintained an economic leverage ratio below 8:1, which is generally lower than our leverage ratio had been prior to 2007. For purposes of calculating this ratio, our economic debt is equal to our repurchase agreements, other secured financing, convertible senior notes, securitized debt of consolidated VIEs, loan participation sold, mortgages payable and other forms of financing such as TBA dollar roll transactions (excluding liabilities that are non-recourse to us, subject to customary carveouts) as presented on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. 

Our target economic leverage ratio is determined under our capital management policy. Should our actual economic leverage ratio increase above the target level due to asset acquisition or market value fluctuations in assets, we would cease to acquire new assets. Our management would, at that time, present a plan to our Board to return to our target economic leverage ratio. 

The following table presents our leverage, economic leverage and capital ratios at December 31, 2015 and 2014.

Operating Platform 

We maintain a flexible and scalable operating platform to support the management and maintenance of our diverse asset portfolio. We have invested in our infrastructure to enhance resiliency, efficiency and leveragability while also ensuring coverage of our target assets. Our information technology applications span the portfolio life-cycle including pre-trade analysis, trade execution and capture, trade settlement and financing, and financial accounting and reporting. 

Technology applications also support our control functions including risk, middle and back-office functions. We have added breadth to our operating platform to accommodate diverse asset classes and drive automation based efficiencies. Our business operations include a centralized collateral management function that permits in-house settlement and self-clearing, thereby creating greater control and management of our collateral. Through technology, we have also incorporated exception based processing, critical data assurance and paperless workflows. Our infrastructure investment has driven operating efficiencies while we have expanded the platform. 

Risk Management 

Risk is a natural element of the business and related activities that we conduct. Effective risk management is of critical importance to the success of the firm. The objective of our risk management framework is to measure, monitor and manage the key risks to which we are subject. Our approach to risk management is comprehensive and has been designed to foster a holistic view of risk. For a full discussion of our risk management process and policies please refer to the section titled &#8220;Risk Management&#8221; of Part II. Item 7. &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221;. 

Management Agreement 

&#160;

We have entered into a management agreement with the Manager pursuant to which our management is conducted by the Manager through the authority delegated to it in the Management Agreement and pursuant to the policies established by our Board. The Management Agreement was effective as of July 1, 2013 and applicable for the entire 2013 calendar year and was amended on November 5, 2014 (the management agreement, as amended, is referred to as &#8220;Management Agreement&#8221;).

&#160; 

The Management Agreement provides for a two year term ending December 31, 2016 with automatic two-year renewals unless at least two-thirds of our independent directors or the holders of a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock elect to terminate the agreement in their sole discretion and for any or no reason. At any time during the term or any renewal term we may deliver to the Manager written notice of our intention to terminate the Management Agreement. We must designate a date not less than one year from the date of the notice on which the Management Agreement will terminate. The Management Agreement also provides that the Manager may terminate the Management Agreement by providing to us prior written notice of its intention to terminate the Management Agreement no less than one year prior to the date designated by the Manager on which the Manager would cease to provide services or such earlier date as determined by us in our sole discretion . 

Under the Management Agreement, the Manager, subject to the supervision and direction of our Board, is responsible for (i) the selection, purchase and sale of assets for our investment portfolio; (ii) recommending alternative forms of capital raising; (iii) supervising our financing and hedging activities; and (iv) day to day management functions. The Manager also performs such other supervisory and management services and activities relating to our assets and operations as may be appropriate. In exchange for the management services, we pay the Manager a monthly management fee in an amount equal to 1/12th of 1.05% of our stockholders&#8217; equity (as defined in the Management Agreement), and the Manager is responsible for providing personnel to manage us, and paying all compensation and benefit expenses associated with such personnel. All compensation and benefit expenses paid by us to individuals employed by our subsidiaries reduces the management fee. We do not pay the Manager any incentive fees. 

The Management Agreement provides that during the term of the Management Agreement and, in the event of termination of this Agreement by the Manager without cause, for a period of one year following such termination, the Manager will not, without our prior written consent, manage any REIT which engages in the management of mortgage-backed securities in any geographical region in which we operate. 

The Management Agreement may be amended or modified by agreement between us and the Manager. There is no termination fee for a termination of the Management Agreement by either us or the Manager.

&#160;

&#160;

If we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income that is distributed to our stockholders. Furthermore, substantially all of our assets, other than our taxable REIT subsidiaries, consist of qualified REIT real estate assets (of the type described in Section 856(c)(5) of the Code). &#160; we will compete with financial institutions, institutional investors, other lenders, government entities and certain other REITs. For a full discussion of the risks associated with competition see the &#8220;Risks Related to Our Investing, Portfolio Management and Financing Activities&#8221; section in Item 1A. &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; We regularly monitor our investments and the income from these investments and, to the extent we enter into hedging transactions, we monitor income from our hedging transactions as well, so as to ensure at all times that we maintain our qualification as a REIT and our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act. 

&#160;

&#160; Corporate Governance 

We strive to conduct our business in accordance with the highest ethical standards and in compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations. 

RCap is a member of FINRA and is subject to regulations of the securities business that include but are not limited to trade practices, use and safekeeping of funds and securities, capital structure, recordkeeping and conduct of directors, officers and employees. As a self-clearing, registered broker dealer, RCap is required to maintain minimum net capital by FINRA. RCap consistently operates with capital in excess of its regulatory capital requirements as defined by SEC Rule 15c3-1.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Our Board is composed of a majority of independent directors. Our Audit, Compensation, Nominating/Corporate Governance and Risk Committees are compose exclusively of independent directors. 

&#160;

Our independent directors annually select an independent director to serve as lead independent director. 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The financial services industry has been the subject of intense regulatory scrutiny in recent years. Financial institutions have been subject to increasing regulation and supervision in the U.S. In particular, the Dodd-Frank Act, which was enacted in July 2010, significantly altered the financial regulatory regime within which financial institutions operate. The implications of the Dodd-Frank Act for our business depend to a large extent on the rules that have been or will be adopted by the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC, the Securities and Exchange Commission (or SEC), the Commodity and Futures Trading Commission (or CFTC) and other agencies to implement the legislation, as well as the development of market practices and structures under the regime established by the legislation and the implementation of the rules. Other reforms have been adopted or are being considered by other regulators and policy makers worldwide. We will continue to assess our business, risk management, and compliance practices to conform to developments in the regulatory environment.

We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which sets forth the basic principles and guidelines for resolving various legal and ethical questions that may arise in the workplace and in the conduct of our business. This code is applicable to our directors, officers and employees as well as those of our Manager and subsidiaries. 

We have adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines which, in conjunction with the charters of our Board committees, provide the framework for the governance of our company. 

&#160;

We have procedures by which any employee, officer or director may raise, on a confidential basis, concerns about our company&#8217;s conduct, accounting, internal controls or auditing matters with the lead independent director, the independent directors, or the chair of the Audit Committee or through our company&#8217;s whistleblower phone hotline. 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Competition 

We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities and competition may limit our ability to acquire desirable investments in our target assets and could also affect the pricing of these securities. In acquiring our target assets, 

&#160; &#9679; We have an Insider Trading Policy that prohibits our directors, officers and employees, including employees of our Manager, as well as those of our Manager and subsidiaries from buying or selling our securities on the basis of material nonpublic information and prohibits communicating material nonpublic information about our company to others.

Additionally, our Insider Trading Policy prohibits our directors, officers and employees, including employees of our Manager, from (1) pledging our common or preferred stock as collateral for a loan or (2) engaging in any hedging transactions with respect to our equity securities held by them, which includes the purchase of any financial instrument (including forward contracts and zero cost collars) designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of such equity securities. 

&#160; 

Distributions 

In accordance with our requirement for maintaining REIT status, we will distribute to stockholders aggregate dividends equaling at least 90% of our REIT taxable income for each taxable year and will endeavor to distribute at least 100% of our REIT taxable income so as not to be subject to tax. Distributions of economic profits from our enterprise could be classified as return of capital due to differences between book and tax accounting rules. We may make additional returns of capital when the potential risk-adjusted returns from new investments fail to exceed our cost of capital. Subject to the limitations of applicable securities and state corporation laws, we can return capital by making purchases of our own capital stock or through payment of dividends.
