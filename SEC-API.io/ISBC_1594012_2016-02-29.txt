 ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS 

Investors Bancorp, Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a Delaware corporation incorporated in December 2013 to be the successor to Investors Bancorp, Inc. (&#8220;Old Investors Bancorp&#8221;) upon the completion of the mutual-to-stock conversion of Investors Bancorp, MHC in May 2014. Old Investors Bancorp was a Delaware corporation organized in January 1997 for the purpose of being a holding company for Investors Bank (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;), a New Jersey chartered savings bank. On October 11, 2005, Old Investors Bancorp completed its initial public stock offering in which it sold 131,649,089 shares, or 43.74% of its outstanding common stock, to subscribers in the offering, including 10,847,883 shares purchased by the Investors Bank Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the &#8220;ESOP&#8221;). Upon completion of the initial public offering, Investors Bancorp, MHC (the &#8220;MHC&#8221;), Old Investors Bancorp's New Jersey chartered mutual holding company parent, held 165,353,151 shares, or 54.94% of Old Investors Bancorp&#8217;s outstanding common stock (shares restated to include shares issued in a business combination subsequent to initial public offering). Additionally, Old Investors Bancorp contributed $5,163,000 in cash and issued 3,949,473 shares of common stock, or 1.32% of its outstanding shares, to the Investors Bank Charitable Foundation. 

In conjunction with the second step conversion, Investors Bancorp, MHC merged into Old Investors Bancorp (and ceased to exist), and Old Investors Bancorp subsequently merged into the Company and the Company became its successor under the name Investors Bancorp, Inc. The second step conversion was completed on May 7, 2014. The Company raised net proceeds of $2.15 billion by selling a total of 219,580,695 shares of common stock at $10.00 per share in the second step stock offering and issued 1,000,000 shares of common stock to the Investors Charitable Foundation. Concurrent with the completion of the stock offering, each share of Old Investors Bancorp common stock owned by public stockholders (stockholders other than Investors Bancorp, MHC) was exchanged for 2.55 shares of Company common stock. As a result of the conversion, all share information has been revised to reflect the 2.55- to- one exchange ratio. A total of 137,560,968 shares of Company common stock were issued in the exchange. The conversion was accounted for as a capital raising transaction by entities under common control. The historical financial results of Investors Bancorp, MHC are immaterial to the results of the Company and therefore upon completion of the conversion, the net assets of Investors Bancorp, MHC were merged into the Company and are reflected as an increase to stockholders' equity. In addition, the second step conversion resulted in the accelerated vesting of all outstanding stock awards as of the conversion date. The withholding of shares for payment of taxes with respect to these awards resulted in treasury stock of 1,101,694 shares. 

The Company is subject to regulation as a bank holding company by the Federal Reserve Board. Our primary business has been that of owning the common stock of the Bank and a loan to the ESOP. Investors Bancorp, Inc., as the holding company of Investors Bank, is authorized to pursue other business activities permitted by applicable laws and regulations for bank holding companies. At December 31, 2015 , our consolidated assets totaled $20.89 billion &#32;and our consolidated deposits totaled $14.06 billion . 

Investors Bancorp neither owns nor leases any property, but instead uses the premises, equipment and furniture of the Bank. At the present time, the Company employs as officers only certain persons who are also officers of the Bank and uses the support staff of the Bank from time to time. These persons are not separately compensated by Investors Bancorp. Investors Bancorp may hire additional employees, as appropriate, to the extent it expands its business in the future. 

Investors Bank is a New Jersey-chartered savings bank headquartered in Short Hills, New Jersey. Originally founded in 1926 as a New Jersey-chartered mutual savings and loan association, it has grown through acquisitions and internal growth, including de novo branching. In 1992, the charter was converted to a mutual savings bank and in 1997 the charter was converted to a New Jersey-chartered stock savings bank. 

The Bank is in the business of attracting deposits from the public through its branch network and borrowing funds in the wholesale markets to originate loans and to invest in securities. The Bank originates multi-family loans, commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial ("C&#38;I") loans, one-to four- family residential mortgage loans secured by one- to four-family residential real estate, construction loans and consumer loans, the majority of which are home equity loans and home equity lines of credit. Securities, primarily mortgage-backed securities, U.S. Government and Federal Agency obligations, and other securities represented 15% of consolidated assets at December 31, 2015. The Bank offers a variety of deposit accounts and emphasizes quality customer service. The Bank is subject to comprehensive regulation and examination by the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance ("NJDBI"), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB"). 

The Company&#8217;s results of operations are dependent primarily on its net interest income, which is the difference between the interest earned on assets, primarily loans and securities portfolios, and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings. Earnings are significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions, particularly changes in market interest rates and U.S. Treasury yield curves, the impact of real estate in the Company's lending area, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. Net income is also affected by provision for loan losses, non-interest income, non-interest expense and income tax expense. Non-interest income includes fees and service charges; income on bank owned life insurance, or BOLI; net gain on loan transactions; net gain on securities transactions; impairment losses on investment securities; net gain on sale of other real estate owned and other income. Non-interest expense consists of compensation and fringe benefits; advertising and promotional expense; office occupancy and equipment expense; federal deposit insurance premiums; stationary, printing, supplies and telephone expense; professional fees; data processing fees service and other operating expenses. 

Investors Bancorp, Inc.'s electronic filings with the SEC, including the Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as amended, are made available at no cost in the Investor Relations section of the Company's website, www.myinvestorsbank.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company files such material with, or furnishes it to, the SEC. The Company's SEC filings are also available through the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. 

Our Business Strategy 

Since the initial public offering in 2005, we have transitioned from a wholesale thrift business to a retail commercial bank. This transition has been primarily accomplished by increasing the amount of our commercial loans and core deposits. Our transformation can be attributed to a number of factors, including organic growth, de novo branches, bank and branch acquisitions, as well as expanding our product offerings. We believe the attractive markets we operate in, namely, New Jersey and the greater New York metropolitan area, will continue to provide us with growth opportunities. Our primary focus is to build and develop profitable customer relationships across all lines of business, both consumer and commercial. 

Opportunities through Our Attractive Markets 

The markets we operate in are considered attractive banking markets within the United States, and we believe they will continue to provide us with opportunities to grow. We have expanded our franchise to include the suburbs of Philadelphia and the boroughs of New York City as well as Nassau and Suffolk Counties on Long Island. Additionally, we have strengthened our presence in our historic markets throughout New Jersey. We accomplished this expansion through de novo growth and select bank and branch acquisitions. As a result of this growth, Investors Bank is one of the largest New Jersey headquartered banking institutions as measured by both assets and deposits. The markets we operate in are desirable from an economic and demographic perspective as they are characterized by large and dense population centers, areas of high income households and centers of robust business and commercial activity. Our competition in these markets tends to be from out-of-state headquartered money centers and super-regional financial institutions and much smaller local community banks. We believe that as a locally headquartered institution, situated between these extremes, we can compete and capitalize on opportunities that exist in our market area. 

Many of the counties we serve are projected to experience moderate to strong population and household income growth through 2021. Though slower population growth is projected for some of the counties we serve, it is important to note that these counties are densely populated. All of the counties we serve have a strong mature market with median household incomes greater than $49,000. The household incomes in the counties we serve are all expected to increase in a range from 3.43% to11.22% through 2021. The December 2015 unemployment rates for New Jersey and New York were 5.1% and 4.8%, respectively, while the national rate was 5.0%. 

We face intense competition in making loans as well as attracting deposits in our market area. Our competition for loans and deposits comes principally from commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, credit unions and insurance companies. We face additional competition for deposits from short-term money market funds, brokerage firms and mutual funds. Some of our competitors offer products and services that we currently do not offer, such as trust services and private banking. As of June 30, 2015, the latest date for which statistics are available, our market share of deposits was 3.96% of total deposits in the State of New Jersey. 

&#160; 

Growing and Diversifying the Loan Portfolio 

Our business plan has been, and will continue to be, to grow and diversify our loan portfolio. We have accomplished the majority of this growth by focusing on originating more multi-family and commercial real estate loans in our market area through our New York City and New Jersey loan production offices. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we originated $2.08 billion in multi-family loans and $936.9 million in commercial real estate loans. We are focusing on growing our commercial loan portfolio because it helps to diversify the loan portfolio and reduces our credit and interest rate exposure to mortgage-backed securities and one- to four-family mortgages. 

To further diversify our loan portfolio we have increased commercial and industrial (&#8220;C&#38;I&#8221;) lending by building relationships with small to medium sized companies in our market area. We have hired a number of experienced C&#38;I lending teams, including a team specializing in the healthcare industry and a team of experienced lenders specializing in asset based lending. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we originated $930.8 million of C&#38;I loans. We have diversified our loan portfolio, as evidenced by the fact that commercial loans (including commercial real estate, multi-family, C&#38;I and construction loans) represent approximately 67% of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2015 as compared to December 31, 2011, when commercial loans were approximately 35% of total loans. Growing and diversifying our loan portfolio will continue to be a major focus of our business strategy going forward. 

Changing the Mix of Deposits 

We have focused on changing our deposit mix from certificates of deposit to core deposits (savings, checking and money market accounts). Core deposits are an attractive funding alternative because they are a more stable source of low cost funding and are less sensitive to changes in market interest rates. As of December 31, 2015, we had core deposits of $10.65 billion, representing approximately 76% of total deposits, compared to December 31, 2011 when core deposits were $4.02 billion, representing 55% of total deposits. In order to maintain these favorable results and trends, we will continue to invest in additional de novo branches, branch staff training and product development. Over the past few years we have developed a suite of commercial deposit and cash management products, designed to appeal to small business owners and non-profit organizations including electronic deposit services such as remote deposit capture. Mobile banking services have also been developed to serve our customers&#8217; needs and adapt to a changing environment. We will continue to enhance our web site and use social media as a way to stay connected to our customers. 

Our deposit business has become more diversified over the past few years as we attract more deposits from commercial entities, including most of the businesses that borrow from us. Investors Bank has become one of the largest depositories for government and municipal deposits in New Jersey, which provides us with an additional funding source. Our branch network, concentrated in markets with attractive demographics and a high density population will continue to provide us with opportunities to grow and improve our deposit base. 

Acquisitions 

A significant portion of our historic growth can be attributed to our acquisition strategy. Over the past several years we have completed eight bank or branch acquisitions. Although management evaluates a number of factors when considering an acquisition, we have maintained a fundamental focus on preserving tangible book value per share. Some of our most recent transactions have included the following acquisitions: 

&#8226; 

Gateway Community Financial Corp., completed January 2014 ($254.7 million of deposits and 4 branches in Gloucester County, New Jersey) 

&#8226; 

Roma Financial Corporation, completed December 2013 ($1.34 billion of deposits and 26 branches in the Philadelphia suburbs of New Jersey) 

&#8226; 

Marathon Banking Corporation, completed October 2012 ($777.5 million in deposits and 13 branches in Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, Manhattan and Long Island) 

&#8226; 

Brooklyn Federal Bancorp, completed January 2012 ($385.9 million in deposits and 5 branches in Brooklyn and Long Island) 

These acquisitions have provided us with the opportunity to grow our business, expand our geographic footprint and improve our financial performance. We intend to continue to evaluate potential acquisition opportunities that may present themselves in the future while maintaining the financial and pricing discipline that we have adhered to in the past. 

Capital Management 

Capital management is a key component of our business strategy. With the completion of the second step conversion, we raised net proceeds of $2.15 billion in equity. As of December 31, 2015 our tangible equity to asset ratio was 15.43% and our tangible book value per share was $9.97. We manage our capital through a combination of organic growth, acquisitions and stock repurchases and dividends. In March 2015 we received approval from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to commence a 5% buyback program prior to the one-year anniversary of the completion of our second step conversion and announced our first share repurchase program. Our second share repurchase program authorized an additional 10% buyback program. For the year ended December 31, 2015 we purchased 31.6 million shares. 

On September 28, 2012, we declared our first quarterly cash dividend of $0.02 per share as part of a dividend program for stockholders and have paid a dividend in every subsequent quarter. Our dividend payout ratio for the year ending December 31, 2015 was 45.45% which includes a special cash dividend of $.05 paid in February 2015. 

Involvement in Our Communities 

Investors Bank proudly promotes a higher quality of life in the communities it serves in New Jersey and New York through employee volunteer efforts and the Investors Charitable Foundation. Employees are continually encouraged to become leaders in their communities and use Investors Bank&#8217;s support to help others. Through the Charitable Foundation, established in 2005, Investors Bank has contributed or committed $20.3 million in donations to enrich the lives of New Jersey and New York citizens by supporting initiatives in the arts, education, youth development, affordable housing, and health and human services. 

Community involvement is one of the principal values of Investors Bank and provides our staff with a meaningful ability to help others. We believe these efforts contribute to creating a culture at Investors Bank that promotes high employee morale while enhancing the presence of Investors Bank in our local markets. 

Lending Activities 

Our loan portfolio is comprised of multi-family loans, commercial real estate loans, construction loans, commercial and industrial loans, residential mortgage loans and consumer and other loans. At December 31, 2015 , multi-family loans totaled $6.26 billion , or 37.0% &#32;of our total loan portfolio, commercial real estate loans totaled $3.83 billion , or 22.7 % of our total loan portfolio, commercial and industrial loans totaled $1.04 billion , or 6.2 % of our total loan portfolio and construction loans totaled $225.8 million , or 1.3 % of our total loan portfolio. Residential mortgage loans represented $5.04 billion , or 29.8 % of our total loans at December 31, 2015 . We also offer consumer loans, which consist primarily of home equity loans, home equity lines of credit and to a lesser degree, cash surrender value lending on life insurance contracts. At December 31, 2015 , consumer and other loans totaled $496.6 million , or 2.9 % of our total loan portfolio. 

Loan Portfolio Composition. &#32;The following table sets forth the composition of our loan portfolio by type of loan, including Purchased Credit-Impaired ("PCI") loans at the dates indicated. PCI loans are loans acquired at a discount that is due, in part, to credit quality and are initially recorded at fair value as determined by the present value of expected future cash flows with no valuation allowance reflected in the allowance for loan losses. Included in total loans below are PCI loans of $11.1 million, $17.8 million, $36.0 million, $6.7 million $0.9 million, respectively for the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011. Commercial loans are comprised of multi-family loans, commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans and construction loans. Our primary focus over recent years has been on the origination of commercial loans.

Multi-family Loans. &#32;At December 31, 2015 , $6.26 billion , or 37.0% &#32;of our total loan portfolio was comprised of multi-family loans. Our policy generally has been to originate multi-family loans in New York, New Jersey and surrounding states. The multi-family loans in our portfolio consist of both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans, which were originated at prevailing market rates. Multi-family loans are generally five to fifteen year term balloon loans amortized over fifteen to thirty years. The maximum loan-to-value ratio is 75% for multi-family loans. At December 31, 2015 , our largest multi-family loan was $49.5 million, which consists of an apartment building with 395 units and was performing in accordance with its contractual terms. 

We consider a number of factors when we originate multi-family loans. During the underwriting process we evaluate the business qualifications and financial condition of the borrower, including credit history, profitability of the property being financed, as well as the value and condition of the mortgaged property securing the loan. When evaluating the business qualifications of the borrower, we consider the financial resources of the borrower, the borrower&#8217;s experience in owning or managing similar property 

and the borrower&#8217;s payment history with us and other financial institutions. In evaluating the property securing the loan, we consider the net operating income of the mortgaged property before debt service and depreciation, the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value of the mortgaged property and the debt service coverage ratio (the ratio of net operating income to debt service) to ensure it is at least 120% of the monthly debt service for apartment buildings. All multi-family loans are appraised by outside independent appraisers who have been approved by our Board of Directors. All borrowers are required to obtain title, fire and casualty insurance and, if warranted, flood insurance. 

Multi-family loans are generally lower credit risk than other types of commercial real estate lending due to the diversification of cash flows from multiple tenants to service the debt. However, loans secured by multi-family generally are larger than residential mortgage loans and can involve greater credit risk. Repayment of these loans depends to a large degree on the results of operations and management of the properties securing the loans and may be affected to a greater extent by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy in general. Accordingly, management annually reviews the performance of all multi-family loans in excess of $2.0 million. 

Commercial Real Estate Loans . At December 31, 2015 , $3.83 billion , or 22.7 % of our total loan portfolio was commercial real estate loans. We originate commercial real estate loans in New Jersey, New York and surrounding states, which are secured by industrial properties, retail buildings, office buildings and other commercial properties. Commercial real estate loans in our portfolio consist of both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans which were originated at prevailing market rates. Commercial real estate loans are generally five to fifteen year term balloon loans amortized over fifteen to thirty years. The maximum loan-to-value ratio is 70% for our commercial real estate loans. Included in commercial real estate loans are owner occupied commercial mortgage loans which totaled $625.7 million at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2015 , our largest commercial real estate loan was $39.6 million loan secured by a commercial retail property located in New Jersey and is performing in accordance with its contractual terms. 

We consider a number of factors when we originate commercial real estate loans. During the underwriting process we evaluate the business qualifications and financial condition of the borrower, including credit history, profitability of the property being financed, as well as the value and condition of the mortgaged property securing the loan. When evaluating the business qualifications of the borrower, we consider the financial resources of the borrower, the borrower&#8217;s experience in owning or managing similar property and the borrower&#8217;s payment history with us and other financial institutions. In evaluating the property securing the loan, we consider the net operating income of the mortgaged property before debt service and depreciation, the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value of the mortgaged property and the debt service coverage ratio (the ratio of net operating income to debt service) to ensure it is at least 130% for commercial income-producing properties. All commercial real estate loans are appraised by outside independent appraisers who have been approved by our Board of Directors. Personal guarantees are obtained from commercial real estate borrowers although we will consider waiving this requirement based upon the loan-to-value ratio of the proposed loan and other factors. All borrowers are required to obtain title, fire and casualty insurance and, if warranted, flood insurance. 

Loans secured by commercial real estate generally are larger than residential mortgage loans and can involve greater credit risk than residential and multi-family loans. Commercial real estate loans often involve large loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Repayment of these loans depends to a large degree on the results of operations and management of the properties securing the loans or the businesses conducted on such property, and may be affected to a greater extent by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy in general. Accordingly, management annually reviews the performance of all commercial real estate loans in excess of $1.0 million. 

Commercial and Industrial Loans. At December 31, 2015 , $1.04 billion , or 6.2 % of our total loan portfolio was commercial and industrial loans. We offer a wide range of credit facilities to commercial and industrial clients throughout our geographic footprint. Our credit offerings are lines of credit, term loans and letters of credit. The collateral for these types of loans can be comprised of real estate and/or a lien on the general assets, including inventory and receivables of the business and in many cases are further supported by a personal guarantee of the owner. For a real estate backed loan, the maximum loan to value limit is 75% and the underlying businesses will typically have at least a two year history. Other C&#38;I loans are collateralized by accounts receivable and inventory. As of December 31, 2015 asset based lending loans totaled $64.9 million. Included in the Company's commercial and industrial loans were $110.1 million of loans to Co-operative housing corporations and groups ("Co-Op loans"). At December 31, 2015 , our largest commercial and industrial loan was a $31.3 million loan to a large educational organization with the collateral representing a pledge of certain revenues. This loan is performing in accordance with its contractual terms. 

As the Company and its footprint have grown it has broadened its product offerings to create certain commercial and industrial lending subspecialties, including expanded lending to the healthcare industry. 

Construction Loans. At December 31, 2015 , we held $225.8 million &#32;in construction loans representing 1.3 % of our total loan portfolio. We offer loans directly to builders and developers on income-producing properties and residential for-sale housing 

units. Generally, construction loans are structured to be repaid over a three-year period and generally are made in amounts of up to 70% of the appraised value of the completed property, or the actual cost of the improvements. Funds are disbursed based on inspections in accordance with a schedule reflecting the completion of portions of the project. Construction financing for sold units requires an executed sales contract. 

At December 31, 2015 , the Bank&#8217;s largest construction loan was a $40.0 million note with an outstanding balance of $24.2 million on a 5-story multi unit apartment building located in New Jersey which was performing in accordance with contractual terms. 

Construction loans generally involve a greater degree of credit risk than either residential mortgage loans or other commercial loans. The risk of loss on a construction loan depends on the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property&#8217;s value when the construction is completed compared to the estimated cost of construction. For all loans, we use outside independent appraisers approved by our Board of Directors. We require all borrowers to obtain title insurance, fire and casualty insurance and, if warranted, flood insurance. A detailed plan and cost review by an outside engineering firm is required on loans in excess of $2.5 million. 

Residential Mortgage Loans. &#32;At December 31, 2015 , $5.04 billion &#32;or 29.8 %, of our loan portfolio consisted of residential mortgage loans. Residential mortgage loans are originated by our mortgage subsidiary, Investors Home Mortgage, for our loan portfolio and for sale to third parties. We also purchase mortgage loans from correspondent entities including other banks and mortgage bankers. Our agreements call for these correspondent entities to originate loans that adhere to our underwriting standards. In most cases, we acquire the loans with servicing rights. In addition, we occasionally purchase pools of mortgage loans in the secondary market on a &#8220;bulk purchase&#8221; basis from several well-established financial institutions after appropriate due diligence. While some of these financial institutions retain the servicing rights for loans they sell to us, when presented with the opportunity to purchase the servicing rights as part of the loan, we may decide to purchase the servicing rights. This decision is generally based on the price and other relevant factors. 

Generally, residential mortgage loans are originated in amounts up to 80% of the lesser of the appraised value or purchase price of the property to a maximum loan amount of $1,250,000. Loans over $1,250,000 require a lower loan-to-value ratio. Loans in excess of 80% of value require private mortgage insurance and cannot exceed $500,000. We will not make loans with a loan-to-value ratio in excess of 95% or 97% for programs to low or moderate-income borrowers. Fixed-rate mortgage loans are originated for terms of up to 30 years. Generally, all fixed-rate residential mortgage loans are underwritten according to Fannie Mae guidelines, policies and procedures. At December 31, 2015, we held $3.22 billion in fixed-rate residential mortgage loans which represented 64% of our residential mortgage loan portfolio. 

We also offer adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans, which adjust annually after three, five, seven or ten year initial fixed-rate periods. Our adjustable rate loans usually adjust to an index plus a margin, based on the weekly average yield on U.S. Treasuries adjusted to a constant maturity of one year. Annual caps of 2% per adjustment apply, with a lifetime maximum adjustment of 5% on most loans. Our adjustable-rate mortgage loans amortize over terms of up to 30 years. In addition, we hold in our loan portfolio interest-only, one-to four-family mortgage loans in which the borrower makes only interest payments for the first five, seven or ten years of the mortgage loan term. This feature results in future increases in the borrower&#8217;s contractually required payments due to the required amortization of the principal amount after the interest-only period. Borrowers were qualified using the loan rate at the date of origination and the fully amortized payment amount. While we hold these in our loan portfolio, we no longer originate interest only, residential mortgages. 

Adjustable-rate mortgage loans decrease the Bank&#8217;s risk associated with changes in market interest rates by periodically re-pricing, but involve other risks because, as interest rates increase, the underlying payments by the borrower increase, which increases the potential for default by the borrower. At the same time, the marketability of the underlying collateral may be adversely affected by higher interest rates or a decline in housing values. The maximum periodic and lifetime interest rate adjustments may limit the effectiveness of adjustable-rate mortgages during periods of rapidly rising interest rates. At December 31, 2015, we held $1.82 billion in adjustable-rate, residential mortgage loans, of which $172.2 million were interest-only, one- to four-family mortgages. Adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans represented 36% of our residential mortgage loan portfolio. 

To provide financing for low-and moderate-income home buyers, we also offer various loan programs, some of which include down payment assistance for home purchases. Through these programs, qualified individuals receive a reduced rate of interest on most of our loan programs and have their application fee refunded at closing, as well as other incentives if certain conditions are met. 

All residential mortgage loans we originate include a &#8220;due-on-sale&#8221; clause, which gives us the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable if the borrower sells or otherwise disposes of the real property that is subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid. All borrowers are required to obtain title insurance, fire and casualty insurance and, if warranted, flood insurance on properties securing real estate loans. 

Consumer and Other Loans. &#32;&#32;At December 31, 2015 , consumer and other loans totaled $496.6 million , or 2.9 % of our total loan portfolio. We offer consumer loans, most of which consist of home equity loans and home equity lines of credit. Home equity loans and home equity lines of credit are secured by residences primarily located in New Jersey and New York. The underwriting standards we use for home equity loans and home equity lines of credit include a determination of the applicant&#8217;s credit history, an assessment of the applicant&#8217;s ability to meet existing credit obligations, the payment on the proposed loan and the value of the collateral securing the loan. The combined (first and second mortgage liens) loan-to-value ratio for home equity loans and home equity lines of credit is generally limited to a maximum of 80%. Home equity loans are offered with fixed rates of interest, terms up to 30 years and to a maximum of $500,000. Home equity lines of credit have adjustable rates of interest, indexed to the prime rate, as reported in The Wall Street Journal . 

During 2014, we started to offer cash surrender value lending on life insurance contracts. At December 31, 2015 , cash surrender value loans totaled $76.0 million, or 15% of consumer and other loans. The underwriting on these loans allows a policy owner to borrow a minimum credit line of $65,000 up to $3,000,000. Acceptable credit history and FICO scores are reviewed along with the evaluation of the financial rating of the insurance carrier. 

Loan Originations and Purchases. &#32;The following table shows our loan originations, loan purchases and repayment activities with respect to our portfolio of loans receivable for the periods indicated. Origination, sale and repayment activities with respect to our loans-held-for-sale are excluded from the table.

Loan Approval Procedures and Authority. &#32;Our lending activities follow written, non-discriminatory underwriting standards and loan origination procedures approved by our Board of Directors. In the approval process for residential loans, we assess the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay the loan and the value of the property securing the loan. To assess the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay, we review the borrower&#8217;s income and expenses and employment and credit history. In the case of commercial loans we also review projected income, expenses and the viability of the project being financed. We generally require appraisals of all real property securing loans, except for home equity loans and home equity lines of credit, in which case we may use the tax-assessed value of the property securing such loan or a lesser form of valuation, such as a home value estimator or by a drive-by value estimated performed by an approved appraisal company. Appraisals are performed by independent licensed appraisers who are approved by 

our Board of Directors. We require borrowers, except for home equity loans and home equity lines of credit, to obtain title insurance. All real estate secured loans require fire and casualty insurance and, if warranted, flood insurance in amounts at least equals to the principal amount of the loan or the maximum amount available. 

Our loan approval policies and limits are reviewed periodically and submitted to our Board of Directors for approval. Approval limits are set based on the risk associated with each loan type, loan amount and aggregate loan balances of a borrower. The commercial loan committee consists of our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Lending Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Retail Banking Officer, Senior Vice President -CRE, Senior Vice President- Business Lending and Senior Vice President, Senior Business Lending Operations Manager. All residential mortgage loans, including home equity loans and home equity lines of credit require approval by authorized members of management. Residential mortgage loans which exceed certain dollar thresholds are required to be approved by three authorized members of management, one of whom must be an Executive Officer. 

Loans to One Borrower. &#32;The Bank&#8217;s regulatory limit on total loans to any one borrower or attributed to any one borrower is 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus. As of December 31, 2015 , the regulatory lending limit was $414.0 million. The Bank&#8217;s internal policy limit is $150.0 million, with the option to exceed that limit with the Board of Directors&#8217; ratification on total loans to a borrower or related borrowers. The Bank reviews these group exposures on a monthly basis. The Bank also sets additional limits on size of loans by loan type. At December 31, 2015 , the Bank&#8217;s largest relationship with an individual borrower and its related entities was $121.5 million commercial loans consisting of six shopping centers and one retail store. 

Asset Quality 

One of the Bank&#8217;s key operating objectives has been, and continues to be, maintaining a high level of asset quality. The Bank maintains sound credit standards for new loan originations and purchases. We do not originate or purchase sub-prime loans, negative amortization loans or option ARM loans. While our portfolio contains interest only and no income verification residential mortgage loans, we no longer originate or purchase these types of residential loan products. Included in residential and consumer loans for the period ended December 31, 2015 are $175.6 million interest only and $299.5 million in no income verification loans. The Bank does, however from time to time and for competitive purposes, originate commercial loans with limited interest only periods. Included in total commercial loans for the period ended December 31, 2015 are $843.3 million in interest only loans. In addition, the Bank uses proactive collection and workout processes in dealing with delinquent and problem loans. 

The underlying credit quality of our loan portfolio is dependent primarily on each borrower&#8217;s ability to continue to make required loan payments and, in the event a borrower is unable to continue to do so, the value of the collateral securing the loan, if any. A borrower&#8217;s ability to pay typically is dependent; in the case of one-to four-family mortgage loans and consumer loans, primarily on employment and other sources of income; in the case of multi-family and commercial real estate loans, on the cash flow generated by the property; in the case of C&#38;I loans, on the cash flows generated by the business, which in turn is impacted by general economic conditions. Other factors, such as unanticipated expenditures or changes in the financial markets, may also impact a borrower&#8217;s ability to pay. Collateral values, particularly real estate values, are also impacted by a variety of factors including general economic conditions, demographics, maintenance and collection or foreclosure delays. 

Purchased Credit-Impaired Loans. &#32; Purchased Credit-Impaired ("PCI") loans are loans acquired through acquisition or purchased at a discount that is due, in part, to credit quality. PCI loans are accounted for in accordance with ASC Subtopic 310-30 and are initially recorded at fair value (as determined by the present value of expected future cash flows) with no valuation allowance (i.e., the allowance for loan losses). The difference between the undiscounted cash flows expected at acquisition and the initial carrying amount (fair value) of the covered loans, or the &#8220;accretable yield,&#8221; is recognized as interest income utilizing the level-yield method over the life of the loans. Contractually required payments for interest and principal that exceed the undiscounted cash flows expected at acquisition, or the &#8220;non-accretable difference,&#8221; are not recognized as a yield adjustment, as a loss accrual or a valuation allowance. Reclassifications of the non-accretable difference to the accretable yield may occur subsequent to the loan acquisition dates due to increases in expected cash flows of the loans and results in an increase in yield on a prospective basis. 

Collection Procedures. &#32;We send system-generated reminder notices to start collection efforts when a loan becomes fifteen days past due. Subsequent late charge and delinquency notices are sent and the account is monitored on a regular basis thereafter. Direct contact with the borrower is attempted early in the collection process as a courtesy reminder and later to determine the reason for the delinquency and to safeguard our collateral. We provide the Board of Directors with a summary report of loans 30 days or more past due on a monthly basis. When a loan is more than 90 days past due, the credit file is reviewed and, if deemed necessary, information is updated or confirmed and collateral re-evaluated. We make every effort to contact the borrower and develop a plan of repayment to cure the delinquency. Loans are placed on non-accrual status when they are 90 days delinquent, but may be placed on non-accrual status earlier if the timely collection of principal and/or income is doubtful. When loans are placed on non-accrual status, unpaid accrued interest is fully reserved, and additional income is recognized in the period collected unless the ultimate collection of principal is considered doubtful. If our effort to cure the delinquency fails and a repayment plan 

is not in place, the file is referred to counsel for commencement of foreclosure or other collection efforts. We also own loans serviced by other entities and we monitor delinquencies on such loans using reports the servicers send to us. When we receive these past due reports, we review the data and contact the servicer to discuss the specific loans and the status of the collection process. We add the information from the servicer&#8217;s delinquent loan reports to our own delinquent reports. 

Our collection procedures for non mortgage related consumer and other loans include sending periodic late notices to a borrower once a loan is past due. We attempt to make direct contact with the borrower once a loan becomes 30 days past due. The Collection Manager reviews loans 60 days or more delinquent on a regular basis. If collection activity is unsuccessful after 90 days, we may refer the matter to our legal counsel for further collection efforts and/or we may charge-off the loan.

Non-Performing Assets. Non-performing assets include non-accrual loans, loans delinquent 90 days or more and still accruing interest, performing troubled debt restructurings and real estate owned, or REO, and excludes PCI loans. We did not have any loans delinquent 90 days or more and still accruing interest at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014. At December 31, 2015 , we had REO of $6.3 million consisting of 33 residential properties and 9 commercial properties. Non-accrual loans increased by $7.0 million to $115.4 million at December 31, 2015 &#32;from $108.4 million at December 31, 2014 . During 2015, the Company sold a pool of non-performing loans (including PCI loans) totaling $20.9 million on a bulk basis. During 2014, the Company sold a $26.0 million pool of non-performing and PCI loans on a bulk basis as well as a $6.4 million non performing loan on a stand alone basis. 

The ratio of non-accrual loans to total loans decreased to 0.68% &#32;at December 31, 2015 &#32;from 0.72% at December 31, 2014 . Our ratio of non-performing assets to total assets decreased to 0.69% &#32;at December 31, 2015 &#32;from 0.81% at December 31, 2014 . The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total non-accrual loans increased to 189.30% at December 31, 2015 &#32;from 184.83% at December 31, 2014 . For further discussion of our non-performing assets and non-performing loans and the allowance for loan losses, see Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221; The table below sets forth the amounts and categories of our non-performing assets excluding PCI loans at the dates indicated.

Non-accrual loans include troubled debt restructurings that are current but classified as non-accrual. These loans are comprised of 15 residential and consumer TDR loans totaling $3.4 million, 2 C&#38;I TDR loans for $2.2 million, 1 multi-family TDR loan for $1.0 million and 2 commercial real estate TDR loans totaling $240,000. In addition, there were 11 residential TDR loans totaling $3.3 million, 5 commercial real estate TDR loans totaling $2.3 million and 1 commercial and industrial TDR loans totaling $360,000 that were classified as non-accrual which were 30-89 days delinquent. 

(2) 

Non-accrual loans include troubled debt restructurings that are current but classified as non-accrual. These loans are comprised of 5 residential TDR loans totaling $1.5 million. In addition, there were 10 TDR residential loans totaling $2.9 million that were classified as non-accrual which were 30-89 days delinquent. 

(3) 

Non-accrual loans include troubled debt restructurings which are current but classified as non-accrual. Included in TDR loans, there was one multi-family loan for $2.3 million, 1 commercial loan for $620,000, one C&#38;I loan for $506,000 and 14 residential loans totaling $4.6 million. There were five TDR residential loans totaling $1.6 million which were 30-89 days delinquent classified as non-accrual. 

(4) 

There were 3 construction troubled debt restructuring loans totaling $6.9 million and 21 residential and consumer loans totaling $5.1 million which were current but classified as non-accrual as of December 31, 2012. 

(5) 

An $8.1 million construction loan that was 60-89 days delinquent at December 31, 2011 was classified as non-accrual. There were also 6 residential troubled debt restructurings totaling $3.0 million and 2 construction troubled debt restructurings totaling $8.6 million that were current as of December 31, 2011 but classified as non-accrual. 

At December 31, 2015 , there were $47.4 million of loans deemed trouble debt restructurings, of which $22.5 million were classified as accruing and $24.9 million were classified as non-accrual. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , interest income that would have been recorded had our non-accruing loans been current in accordance with their original terms amounted to $8.5 million. We recognized interest income of $2.7 million on such loans for the year ended December 31, 2015 . 

Real Estate Owned. Real estate we acquire as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate owned ("REO") until sold. When property is acquired it is recorded at fair value at the date of foreclosure less estimated costs to sell the property. Holding costs and declines in fair value result in charges to expense after acquisition. At December 31, 2015 , we had REO of $6.3 million consisting of 33 residential properties and 9 commercial properties. 

Classified Assets. Federal regulations provide that loans and other assets of lesser quality should be classified as &#8220;substandard,&#8221; &#8220;doubtful&#8221; or &#8220;loss&#8221; assets. An asset is considered &#8220;substandard&#8221; if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. &#8220;Substandard&#8221; assets include those characterized by the &#8220;distinct possibility&#8221; we will sustain &#8220;some loss&#8221; if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as &#8220;doubtful&#8221; have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified &#8220;substandard,&#8221; with the added characteristic the weaknesses present make &#8220;collection or liquidation in full,&#8221; on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, &#8220;highly questionable and improbable.&#8221; Assets classified as &#8220;loss&#8221; are those considered &#8220;uncollectible&#8221; and of such little value their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. We classify an asset as &#8220;special mention&#8221; if the asset has a potential weakness that warrants management&#8217;s close attention. While such assets are not impaired, management has concluded that if the potential weakness in the asset is not addressed, the value of the asset may deteriorate, adversely affecting the repayment of the asset. 

We are required to establish an allowance for loan losses in an amount that management considers prudent for loans classified substandard or doubtful, as well as for other problem loans. General allowances represent loss allowances, which have been 

established to recognize the inherent losses associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. When we classify problem assets as &#8220;loss,&#8221; we are required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100% of the amount of the asset so classified or to charge off such amount. Our determination as to the classification of our assets and the amount of our valuation allowances is subject to review by the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which can require that we establish additional general or specific loss allowances. 

We review the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. Not all classified assets constitute non-performing assets. 

Impaired Loans. The Company defines an impaired loan as a loan for which it is probable, based on current information, that the lender will not collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The Company evaluates commercial loans with an outstanding balance greater than $1.0 million and on non-accrual status, loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring (&#8220;TDR&#8221;), and other commercial loans with an outstanding balance greater than $1.0 million if management has specific information that it is probable they will not collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement for impairment. Impaired loans are individually evaluated to determine that the loan&#8217;s carrying value is not in excess of the fair value of the collateral or the present value of the expected future cash flows. Smaller balance homogeneous loans are evaluated for impairment collectively unless they are modified in a troubled debt restructure. Such loans include residential mortgage loans, consumer loans, and loans not meeting the Company&#8217;s definition of impaired, and are specifically excluded from impaired loans. At December 31, 2015 , loans meeting the Company&#8217;s definition of an impaired loan totaled $57.0 million. The allowance for loan losses related to loans classified as impaired at December 31, 2015 , amounted to $4.2 million. Interest income received during the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;on loans classified as impaired totaled $2.8 million. For further detail on our impaired loans, see Note 1 and Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#8221; 

Allowance for Loan Losses 

Our allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level necessary to absorb loan losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable. In determining the allowance for loan losses, management considers the losses inherent in our loan portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of loan activities, along with the general economic and real estate market conditions. A description of our methodology in establishing our allowance for loan losses is set forth in the section &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Critical Accounting Policies &#8212; Allowance for Loan Losses.&#8221; The allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2015 &#32;is maintained at a level that represents management&#8217;s best estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio. However, this analysis process is subjective, as it requires us to make estimates that are susceptible to revisions as more information becomes available. Although we believe we have established the allowance at levels to absorb probable and estimable losses, future additions may be necessary if economic or other conditions in the future differ from the current environment. 

As an integral part of their examination processes, the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation will periodically review our allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require us to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination.

Security Investments 

The Board of Directors has adopted our Investment Policy. This policy determines the types of securities in which we may invest. The Investment Policy is reviewed annually by management and changes to the policy are recommended to and subject to approval by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors delegates operational responsibility for the implementation of the Investment Policy to the Asset Liability Committee, which is primarily comprised of senior officers. While general investment strategies are developed by the Asset Liability Committee, the execution of specific actions rests primarily with our Treasurer. The Treasurer is responsible for ensuring the guidelines and requirements included in the Investment Policy are followed and all securities are considered prudent for investment. Investment transactions are reviewed and ratified by the Board of Directors at their regularly scheduled meetings. 

Our Investment Policy requires that investment transactions conform to Federal and New Jersey State investment regulations. Our investments purchased may include, but are not limited to, U.S. Treasury obligations, securities issued by various Federal Agencies, State and Municipal subdivisions, mortgage-backed securities, certain certificates of deposit of insured financial institutions, overnight and short-term loans to other banks, investment grade corporate debt instruments, and mutual funds. In addition, Investors Bancorp may invest in equity securities subject to certain limitations. 

The Investment Policy requires that securities transactions be conducted in a safe and sound manner. Purchase and sale decisions are based upon a thorough pre-purchase analysis of each security to determine it conforms to our overall asset/liability management objectives. The analysis must consider its effect on our risk-based capital measurement, prospects for yield and/or appreciation and other risk factors. 

At December 31, 2015 , our securities portfolio totaled $3.15 billion representing 15.1% of our total assets. Securities are classified as held-to-maturity or available-for-sale when purchased. At December 31, 2015 , $1.84 billion of our securities were classified as held-to-maturity and reported at amortized cost and $1.30 billion were classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value. 

Mortgage-Backed Securities. We purchase mortgage-backed pass through and collateralized mortgage obligation (&#8220;CMO&#8221;) securities insured or guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac (government-sponsored enterprises) and Ginnie Mae (government agency), and to a lesser extent, a variety of federal and state housing authorities (collectively referred to below as &#8220;agency-issued mortgage-backed securities&#8221;). At December 31, 2015 , agency-issued mortgage-backed securities including CMOs, totaled $3.06 billion, or 97.2%, of our total securities portfolio. 

Mortgage-backed pass through securities are created by pooling mortgages and issuing a security with an interest rate less than the interest rate on the underlying mortgages. Mortgage-backed pass through securities represent a participation interest in a pool of single-family or multi-family mortgages. As loan payments are made by the borrowers, the principal and interest portion of the payment is passed through to the investor as received. CMOs are also backed by mortgages; however, they differ from mortgage-backed pass through securities because the principal and interest payments of the underlying mortgages are financially engineered to be paid to the security holders of pre-determined classes or tranches of these securities at a faster or slower pace. The receipt of these principal and interest payments, which depends on the proposed average life for each class, is contingent on a prepayment speed assumption assigned to the underlying mortgages. Variances between the assumed payment speed and actual payments can significantly alter the average lives of such securities. To quantify and mitigate this risk, we undertake a payment analysis before purchasing these securities. We primarily invest in CMO classes or tranches in which the payments on the underlying mortgages are passed along at a pace fast enough to provide an average life of three to five years with no change in market interest rates. The issuers of such securities, as noted above, pool and sell participation interests in security form to investors such as Investors Bank and guarantee the payment of principal and interest. Mortgage-backed securities and CMOs generally yield less than the loans that underlie such securities because of the cost of payment guarantees and credit enhancements. However, mortgage-backed securities are usually more liquid than individual mortgage loans and may be used to collateralize borrowings and other liabilities. 

Mortgage-backed securities present a risk that actual prepayments may differ from estimated prepayments over the life of the security, which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or accretion of any discount relating to such instruments that can change the net yield on such securities. There is also reinvestment risk associated with the cash flows from such securities or if such securities are redeemed by the issuer. In addition, the fair value of such securities may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates. 

Our mortgage-backed securities portfolio had a weighted average yield of 1.91% for the year ended December 31, 2015 . The estimated fair value of our mortgage-backed securities at December 31, 2015 &#32;was $3.06 billion, which is $2.3 million more than the carrying value. The increase to the fair value is attributed to a decline to interest rates during 2015. 

We also may invest in securities issued by non-agency or private mortgage originators, provided those securities are rated AAA by nationally recognized rating agencies and satisfactorily pass an internal credit review at the time of purchase. The Company currently has no non-agency mortgage-backed securities in its portfolio. 

Corporate and Other Debt Securities. Our corporate and other debt securities portfolio consists of collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) backed by pooled trust preferred securities (TruPS), principally issued by banks and to a lesser extent insurance companies, real estate investment trusts, and collateralized debt obligations. The interest rates on these securities reset quarterly in relation to 3 month Libor rate. These securities have been classified in the held-to-maturity portfolio since their purchase. 

At December 31, 2015 , the trust preferred securities portfolio have an amortized cost of $35.1 million, or 1.12% of our total securities portfolio, and a fair value of $77.8 million with none of the securities in an unrealized loss position. Throughout the year we engage an independent valuation firm to assist us in valuing our TruPS portfolio and prepare our other-than temporary impairment, or OTTI, analysis. At December 31, 2015 , management deemed that the present value of projected cash flows for each security was greater than the book value and did not recognize any OTTI charges for the periods ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014. At December 31, 2013, the discounted cash flow projected for one of the Company's pooled trust preferred securities fell below its adjusted book value. Based on the review of underlying collateral, the credit of this security has continued to deteriorate and therefore the Company recorded net other-than-temporary impairment ("OTTI") charge of $977,000 &#32;for the year ended December 31, 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2015 the Company recognized a loss of $646,000 on a TruPS security which was entirely liquidated by its Trustee. 

In December 2013, regulatory agencies adopted a rule on the treatment of certain collateralized debt obligations backed by trust preferred securities to implement sections of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, known as the Volcker Rule. One of our securities backed by trust preferred securities issued by insurance companies was deemed to be a "covered fund" under the Volker Rule and the Company sold the security during 2014. The Company has no intent to sell the remaining securities, nor is it more likely than not that it would be required to sell these securities. 

We continue to closely monitor the performance of the securities we own as well as the events surrounding this segment of the market. We will continue to evaluate for other-than-temporary impairment, which could result in a future non-cash charge to earnings. 

Municipal Bonds . &#32;At December 31, 2015 , we had $43.1 million in municipal bonds which represents 1.4% of our total securities portfolio. These bonds are comprised of $38.3 million in short-term Bond Anticipation or Tax Anticipation notes and $4.8 million of longer term New Jersey Revenue Bonds. These purchases were made to diversify the securities portfolio and are designated as held to maturity. 

Government Sponsored Enterprises. &#32;At December 31, 2015 , debt securities issued by Government Sponsored Enterprises held in our security portfolio totaled $4.2 million representing less than 0.2% of our total securities portfolio. While these securities may generally provide lower yields than other securities in our securities portfolio; they are held for liquidity purposes, as collateral for certain borrowings, to achieve positive interest rate spreads with minimal administrative expense, and to lower our credit risk as a result of the guarantees provided by these issuers. 

Marketable Equity Securities. &#32;At December 31, 2015 , we had $6.5 million in equity securities representing 0.2% of our total securities portfolio. Equity securities are not insured or guaranteed investments and are affected by market interest rates and stock market fluctuations. Such investments (when held) are carried at their fair value and fluctuations in the fair value of such investments, including temporary declines in value, directly affect our net capital position.

Sources of Funds 

General. &#32;Deposits are the primary source of funds used for our lending and investment activities. Our strategy is to increase core deposit growth to fund these activities. In addition, we use a significant amount of borrowings, primarily advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (&#8220;FHLB&#8221;); to supplement cash flow needs, to lengthen the maturities of liabilities for interest rate risk management and to manage our cost of funds. Additional sources of funds include principal and interest payments from loans and securities, loan and security prepayments and maturities, repurchase agreements, brokered deposits, income on other earning assets and retained earnings. While cash flows from loans and securities payments can be relatively stable sources of funds, deposit inflows and outflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing interest rates, market conditions and levels of competition. 

Deposits. &#32;At December 31, 2015 , we held $14.06 billion &#32;in total deposits, representing 80% of our total liabilities. For several years, we revised our deposit strategy from one focused on attracting certificates of deposit to one focused on core deposits (savings, checking and money market accounts). The impact of these efforts has been a continuing shift in deposit mix to lower cost core products. We remain committed to our plan of attracting more core deposits because core deposits represent a more stable source of low cost funds and may be less sensitive to changes in market interest rates. At December 31, 2015 , we held $10.65 billion in core deposits, representing 75.7% of total deposits, of which $614.2 million are brokered money market deposits. At December 31, 2015 , $3.42 billion, or 24.3%, of our total deposit balances were certificates of deposit, which included $417.4 million of brokered certificates of deposits. 

We have a suite of commercial deposit products, designed to appeal to small business owners and non-profit organizations. The interest rates we pay, our maturity terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties are all reviewed on a periodic basis. Deposit rates and terms are based primarily on our current operating strategies, market rates, liquidity requirements, rates paid by competitors and growth goals. We also rely on personalized customer service, long-standing relationships with customers and an active marketing program to attract and retain deposits. 

The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in money market and other prevailing interest rates and competition. The variety of deposit accounts we offer allows us to respond to changes in consumer demands and to be competitive in obtaining deposit funds. Our ability to attract and maintain deposits and the rates we pay on deposits will continue to be significantly affected by market conditions. 

We intend to continue to invest in de novo branches and technology platforms, branch staff training and to aggressively market and advertise our core deposit products and will attempt to generate our deposits from a diverse client group within our primary market area. We remain focused on attracting deposits from consumers, businesses and municipalities which operate in our marketplace. 

The following table sets forth the distribution of total deposit accounts, by account type, at the dates indicated.

Supervision and Regulation 

General 

Investors Bank is a New Jersey-chartered savings bank, and its deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;) under the Deposit Insurance Fund (&#8220;DIF&#8221;). Investors Bank is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance (the &#8220;Commissioner&#8221;) as the issuer of its charter, and, as a non-member state chartered savings bank, by the FDIC as the deposit insurer and its primary federal regulator. Investors Bank must file reports with the Commissioner and the FDIC concerning its activities and financial condition, and it must obtain regulatory approval prior to entering into certain transactions, such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other depository institutions and opening or acquiring branch offices. The Commissioner and the FDIC each conduct periodic examinations to assess Investors Bank&#8217;s compliance with various regulatory requirements. This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which a savings bank may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the DIF and its depositors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. 

As a bank holding company controlling Investors Bank, Investors Bancorp, Inc. is subject to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (&#8220;BHCA&#8221;), and the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board under the BHCA and to the provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act of 1948 (the &#8220;New Jersey Banking Act&#8221;) and the regulations of the Commissioner under the New Jersey Banking Act applicable to bank holding companies. Investors Bancorp, Inc. is required to file reports with, and otherwise comply with the rules and regulations of, the Federal Reserve Board, the Commissioner and the FDIC. The Federal Reserve Board and the Commissioner conduct periodic examinations to assess the Company&#8217;s compliance with various regulatory requirements. Investors Bancorp, Inc. files certain reports with, and otherwise complies with, the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the federal securities laws and the listing requirements of NASDAQ. 

Any change in such laws and regulations, whether by the Commissioner, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board or through legislation, could have a material adverse impact on Investors Bank and Investors Bancorp, Inc. and their operations and stockholders. 

We are unable to predict these future changes or the effects, if any, that these changes could have on the business, revenues, and results of Investors Bank and its subsidiaries. 

The federal government has recently implemented and announced programs designed to bolster the capital of U.S. banks. Some of these programs have, and any future programs may, impose additional rules and regulations on us, some of which may affect the way we conduct our business and/or limit our ability to compete effectively. 

Federal and state banking laws also require us to take steps to protect consumers. Bank regulatory agencies are increasingly focusing attention on compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations. These laws include disclosures regarding truth in lending, truth in savings, funds availability, privacy protection under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, and prohibitions on discrimination in the provision of banking services. In addition, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;) is responsible for interpreting and enforcing a broad range of consumer protection laws governing the provision of deposit accounts and the making of loans, including the regulation of mortgage lending and servicing. For further discussion on consumer protection and the role of the CFPB, see &#8220;- Dodd-Frank Act.&#8221; 

We have incurred and may in the future incur additional costs in complying with these requirements. 

Dodd-Frank Act 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;), signed into law on July 21, 2010, made extensive changes to the laws regulating financial services firms. The Dodd-Frank Act also required significant rulemaking and mandates multiple studies that have resulted and are likely to continue to result in additional legislative and regulatory actions that will impact the operations of the Bank. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, federal bank regulatory agencies are required to draft and implement enhanced supervision, examination and capital and liquidity standards for depository institutions. The capital provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act include, among other things, changes to capital, leverage limits and limitations on the use of hybrid capital instruments. The Dodd-Frank Act also imposed new restrictions on investments and other activities by depository institutions, particularly with respect to derivatives activities and proprietary trading. The Dodd-Frank Act also gave federal bank regulatory agencies, such as the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, additional latitude to monitor the systemic safety of the financial system and take responsive action, which could include imposing restrictions on the business activities of the Bank. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act authorized the federal regulators to impose various new assessments and fees, which could increase the Bank&#8217;s operational costs. 

The Dodd-Frank Act required banks with total consolidated assets of more than $10 billion to conduct annual stress tests. The Dodd-Frank Act also required the FDIC, in coordination with federal financial regulatory agencies, to issue regulations establishing methodologies for stress testing that provide for at least three different sets of conditions, including baseline, adverse, and severely adverse. The regulations must also require banks to publish a summary of the results of the stress tests. In October 2012, the FDIC issued a final rule regarding annual stress tests requiring a bank subject to the rule to assess the quarterly impact of stress scenarios on the bank&#8217;s capital over a horizon of nine quarters. For institutions, such as Investors Bank, with total consolidated assets of more than $10 billion but less than $50 billion, the final rule delayed the implementation of stress testing until September 2013, with initial results to be submitted by March 31, 2014. The final rule also delayed the initial public disclosure requirement of stress test results until 2015 (disclosing the 2014 stress test results). 

The Bank has developed a process to comply with the stress testing requirements, which involves Senior Management, Risk Management, along with third-party consultants who assist in this process. The Risk Committee of the Board of Directors receives quarterly updates as to the progress and challenges in complying with this new regulatory requirement. We submitted our stress tests results by March 31, 2014, as required and published updated stress test results on June 26, 2015. The stress testing results affirmed the adequacy of the Bank&#8217;s capital, even under severe economic conditions. As the related methodologies and best practices for banks of Investors&#8217; size continue to evolve, the stress testing process requires significant investment and we continue to seek ways to maximize shareholder value from the process while complying with regulatory requirements. 

In addition, in December 2013 federal regulators adopted a final rule implementing the &#8220;Volcker Rule&#8221; enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Volcker Rule prohibits (subject to certain exceptions) banks and their affiliates from engaging in short-term proprietary trading in securities and derivatives and from investing in and sponsoring certain unregistered investment companies (including not only such things as hedge funds, commodity pools and private equity funds, but also a range of asset securitization structures that do not meet exemptive criteria in the final rules). The rules also require banks to develop compliance and control programs, including board of directors' oversight, appropriate for the size of the bank and the types and complexity of its activities. Investors Bank has complied with the provisions of the Volcker Rule and has developed a governance and control program to ensure appropriate oversight and on-going compliance. 

All federal prohibitions on the ability of financial institutions to pay interest on demand deposit accounts were repealed as part of the Dodd-Frank Act. As a result, beginning on July 21, 2011, financial institutions could commence offering interest on demand deposits to compete for clients. 

Our interest expense will increase and our net interest margin will decrease if we have to offer higher rates of interest than we currently offer on demand deposits to attract additional clients or maintain current clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Thus far, the change has not had a meaningful effect on our business. 

The Dodd-Frank Act also established the new federal CFPB. This agency is responsible for interpreting and enforcing a broad range of consumer protection laws (&#8220;Federal Consumer Financial Laws&#8221;) that govern the provision of deposit accounts and the making of loans, including the regulation of mortgage lending and servicing. This includes laws such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act. In 2012, the CFPB proposed an integrated disclosure in connection with mortgage origination that incorporates disclosure requirements under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and the Truth-in-Lending Act. The CFPB issued a final rule regarding the integrated disclosure in December 2013, and the disclosure requirement became effective in October 2015. 

In accordance with deadlines set by the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB issued final rules in January 2013 related to new mortgage servicing standards, and mortgage lending requirements that establish a &#8220;qualified mortgage&#8221; which will fulfill the Dodd-Frank Act requirement that mortgages be provided to borrowers with an ability to repay. These mortgage servicing and lending rules became effective in January 2014. These and other CFPB regulations will increase the Bank&#8217;s compliance expenses, and limit the terms under which the Bank can provide consumer financial products. 

Additionally the CFPB has the authority to take enforcement action against banks and other financial services companies that fail to satisfy the standards imposed by it. As an insured depository institution with total assets of more than $10 billion, the Bank is subject to CFPB supervision and examination of compliance with Federal Consumer Financial Laws. The Dodd-Frank Act also permits states to adopt stricter consumer protection laws and state attorneys general to enforce consumer protection rules issued by the CFPB. As a result of these aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Bank is operating in a consumer compliance environment that will be far less certain. Therefore, the Bank is likely to incur additional costs related to consumer protection compliance, including but not limited to potential costs associated with CFPB examinations, regulatory and enforcement actions and consumer-oriented litigation, which is likely to increase as a result of the consumer protection provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. 

In addition to creating the CFPB, the Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, directed changes in the way that institutions are assessed for deposit insurance, mandated the imposition of tougher consolidated capital requirements on holding companies, required originators of securitized loans to retain a percentage of the risk for the transferred loans, imposed regulatory rate-setting for certain debit card interchange fees, repealed restrictions on the payment of interest on commercial demand deposits and required reforms related to mortgage originations. At this time, it is difficult to predict the full extent to which the Dodd-Frank Act or the resulting regulations will impact the Bank&#8217;s business. However, compliance with certain of these new laws and regulations could result in restraints on, and additional costs to, our business. It is also difficult to predict the impact the Dodd-Frank Act will have on our competitors and on the financial services industry as a whole. In addition to the recent legislative and regulatory initiatives described above, competitive and industry factors could also adversely impact our results, the cost of our operations, our financial condition and our liquidity. 

New Jersey Banking Regulation 

Activity Powers. &#32;Investors Bank derives its lending, investment and other powers primarily from the applicable provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act and its related regulations. Under these laws and regulations, savings banks, including Investors Bank, generally may invest in: 

&#8226; 

real estate mortgages; 

&#8226; 

consumer and commercial loans; 

&#8226; 

specific types of debt securities, including certain corporate debt securities and obligations of federal, state and local governments and agencies; 

&#8226; 

certain types of corporate equity securities; and 

&#8226; 

certain other assets. 

A savings bank may also make investments pursuant to a &#8220;leeway&#8221; power, which permits investments not otherwise permitted by the New Jersey Banking Act, subject to certain restrictions imposed by the FDIC. &#8220;Leeway&#8221; investments must comply with a number of limitations on the individual and aggregate amounts of &#8220;leeway&#8221; investments. A savings bank may also exercise trust powers upon approval of the Commissioner. Lastly, New Jersey savings banks may exercise those powers, rights, benefits or privileges authorized for national banks or out-of-state banks or for federal or out-of-state savings banks or savings associations, provided that before exercising any such power, right, benefit or privilege, prior approval by the Commissioner by regulation or by specific authorization is required. The exercise of these lending, investment and activity powers are limited by federal law and the related regulations. See &#8220;Federal Banking Regulation &#8212; Activity Restrictions on State-Chartered Banks&#8221; below. 

Loans-to-One-Borrower Limitations. &#32;With certain specified exceptions, a New Jersey-chartered savings bank may not make loans or extend credit to a single borrower or to entities related to the borrower in an aggregate amount that would exceed 15% of the bank&#8217;s capital funds. A savings bank may lend an additional 10% of the bank&#8217;s capital funds if secured by collateral meeting the requirements of the New Jersey Banking Act and the National Bank Act. Investors Bank currently complies with applicable loans-to-one-borrower limitations. 

Dividends. &#32;Under the New Jersey Banking Act, a stock savings bank may declare and pay a dividend on its capital stock only to the extent that the payment of the dividend would not impair the capital stock of the savings bank. In addition, a stock savings bank may not pay a dividend unless the savings bank would, after the payment of the dividend, have a surplus of not less than 50% of its capital stock, or alternatively, the payment of the dividend would not reduce the surplus. Federal law may also limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by Investors Bank. See &#8220;&#8212; Federal Banking Regulation &#8212; Prompt Corrective Action&#8221; below. 

Minimum Capital Requirements. &#32;Regulations of the Commissioner impose on New Jersey-chartered depository institutions, including Investors Bank, minimum capital requirements similar to those imposed by the FDIC on insured state banks. See &#8220;&#8212; Federal Banking Regulation &#8212; Capital Requirements&#8221; below. 

Examination and Enforcement. &#32;The New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance may examine Investors Bank whenever it deems an examination advisable. The Department examines Investors Bank at least once every two years. The Commissioner may order any savings bank to discontinue any violation of law or unsafe or unsound business practice, and may direct any director, officer, attorney or employee of a savings bank engaged in an objectionable activity, after the Commissioner has ordered the activity to be terminated, to show cause at a hearing before the Commissioner why such person should not be removed. The Commissioner may also seek the appointment of receiver or conservator for a New Jersey saving bank under certain conditions. 

Federal Banking Regulation 

Capital Requirements. &#32; &#32; Federal regulations require FDIC-insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based assets of 8%, and a 4% Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. The existing capital requirements were effective January 1, 2015 and are the result of a final rule implementing regulatory amendments based on recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. 

For the purposes of the capital standards, common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders&#8217; equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;), up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Institutions that have not exercised the AOCI opt-out have AOCI incorporated into common equity Tier 1 capital (including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale-securities). Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations. 

In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50% is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one to four- family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100% is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150% is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0% to 600% is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors. 

In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement is being phased in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increasing each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019. 

In assessing an institution&#8217;s capital adequacy, the FDIC takes into consideration, not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where deemed necessary. 

The federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, have also adopted regulations to require an assessment of an institution&#8217;s exposure to declines in the economic value of a bank&#8217;s capital due to changes in interest rates when assessing the bank&#8217;s capital adequacy. Under such a risk assessment, examiners evaluate a bank&#8217;s capital for interest rate risk on a case-by-case basis, with consideration of both quantitative and qualitative factors. Institutions with significant interest rate risk may be required to hold additional capital. According to the agencies, applicable considerations include: 

&#8226; 

the quality of the bank&#8217;s interest rate risk management process; 

&#8226; 

the overall financial condition of the bank; and 

&#8226; 

the level of other risks at the bank for which capital is needed.

As of December 31, 2015 , both the Bank and the Company were considered &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; under applicable regulations. 

Activity Restrictions on State-Chartered Banks. &#32;Federal law and FDIC regulations generally limit the activities and investments of state-chartered FDIC insured banks and their subsidiaries to those permissible for national banks and their subsidiaries, unless such activities and investments are specifically exempted by law or consented to by the FDIC. 

Before making a new investment or engaging in a new activity that is not permissible for a national bank or otherwise permissible under federal law or FDIC regulations, an insured bank must seek approval from the FDIC to make such investment or engage in such activity. The FDIC will not approve the activity unless the bank meets its minimum capital requirements and the FDIC determines that the activity does not present a significant risk to the FDIC insurance funds. Certain activities of subsidiaries that are engaged in activities permitted for national banks only through a &#8220;financial subsidiary&#8221; are subject to additional restrictions. 

Federal law permits a state-chartered savings bank to engage, through financial subsidiaries, in any activity in which a national bank may engage through a financial subsidiary and on substantially the same terms and conditions. In general, the law permits a national bank that is well-capitalized and well-managed to conduct, through a financial subsidiary, any activity permitted for a financial holding company other than insurance underwriting, insurance investments or real estate development or merchant banking. The total assets of all such financial subsidiaries may not exceed the lesser of 45% of the bank&#8217;s total assets or $50 billion. The bank must have policies and procedures to assess the financial subsidiary&#8217;s risk and protect the bank from such risk and potential liability, must not consolidate the financial subsidiary&#8217;s assets with the bank&#8217;s and must exclude from its own assets and equity all equity investments, including retained earnings, in the financial subsidiary. State-chartered savings banks may retain subsidiaries in existence as of March 11, 2000 and may engage in activities that are not authorized under federal law. Although Investors Bank meets all conditions necessary to establish and engage in permitted activities through financial subsidiaries, it has not chosen to engage in such activities. 

Federal Home Loan Bank System. &#32;Investors Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank system, which consists of the regional Federal Home Loan Banks, each subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (&#8220;FHFA&#8221;). The Federal Home Loan Banks provide a central credit facility primarily for member thrift institutions as well as other entities involved in home mortgage lending. It is funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Banks make loans to members (i.e., advances) in accordance with policies and procedures, including collateral requirements, established by the respective Boards of Directors of the Federal Home Loan Banks. These policies and procedures are subject to the regulation and oversight of the FHFA. All long-term advances are required to provide funds for residential home financing. The FHFA has also established standards of community or investment service that members must meet to maintain access to such long-term advances. 

Investors Bank, as a member of the FHLB of New York is currently required to acquire and hold shares of FHLB Class B stock. The Class B stock has a par value of $100 per share and is redeemable upon five years notice, subject to certain conditions. The Class B stock has two subclasses, one for membership stock purchase requirements and the other for activity-based stock purchase requirements. The minimum stock investment requirement in the FHLB Class B stock is the sum of the membership stock purchase requirement, determined on an annual basis at the end of each calendar year, and the activity-based stock purchase requirement, determined on a daily basis. For Investors Bank, the membership stock purchase requirement is 0.15% of Mortgage-Related Assets, as defined by the FHLB, which consists principally of residential mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities, including CMOs, held by Investors Bank. The activity-based stock purchase requirement for Investors Bank is equal to the sum of: (1) 4.50% of outstanding borrowing from the FHLB; (2) 4.50% of the outstanding principal balance of Acquired Member Assets, as defined by the FHLB, and delivery commitments for Acquired Member Assets; (3) a specified dollar amount related to certain off-balance sheet items, for which Investors Bank is zero; and (4) a specified percentage ranging from 0 to 5% of the carrying value on the FHLB balance sheet of derivative contracts between the FHLB and its members, which for Investors Bank is also zero. The FHLB can adjust the specified percentages and dollar amount from time to time within the ranges established by the FHLB capital plan. At December 31, 2015, the amount of FHLB stock held by us satisfies these requirements. 

Safety and Soundness Standards. &#32;Pursuant to the requirements of FDICIA, as amended by the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994, each federal banking agency, including the FDIC, has adopted guidelines establishing general standards relating to matters such as internal controls, information and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings and compensation, fees and benefits. In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines. The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director, or principal stockholder. 

In addition, the FDIC adopted regulations to require a savings bank that is given notice by the FDIC that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan to the FDIC. If, after being so notified, a savings bank fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an accepted compliance plan, the FDIC may issue an order directing corrective and other actions of the types to which a significantly undercapitalized institution is subject under the &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; provisions of FDICIA. If a savings bank fails to comply with such an order, the FDIC may seek to enforce such an order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil monetary penalties. 

Enforcement. &#32;The FDIC has extensive enforcement authority over insured savings banks, including Investors Bank. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist orders and to remove directors and officers. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations and to unsafe or unsound practices. 

Prompt Corrective Action. &#32;Federal law establishes a system of prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions. The FDIC has adopted regulations to implement the prompt corrective action legislation. Those regulations were amended effective January 1, 2015 to incorporate the previously mentioned increased regulatory capital standards that were effective on the same date. An institution is deemed to be &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or greater. An institution is &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5% or greater. An institution is &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 4.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5%. An institution is deemed to be &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 3.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0%. An institution is considered to be &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%. 

Generally a receiver or conservator must be appointed for an institution that is &#8220;critically "undercapitalized&#8221; within specific time frames. The regulations also provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the FDIC within 45 days of the date a savings bank receives notice that it is undercapitalized,&#8221; &#8220;significantly "undercapitalized&#8221; or &#8220;critically undercapitalized.&#8221; Various restrictions, such as restrictions on capital distributions and growth, also apply to &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; institutions. The FDIC may also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors. 

Investors Bank was classified as &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; under the prompt corrective action framework as of December 31, 2015. 

Liquidity. Investors Bank maintains sufficient liquidity to ensure its safe and sound operation, in accordance with FDIC regulations. 

Deposit Insurance. Investors Bank is a member of the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is administered by the FDIC. Deposit accounts in Investors Bank are insured by the FDIC, up to a maximum of $250,000 for each separately insured depositor. 

The FDIC imposes an assessment for deposit insurance against all insured depository institutions. Each institution&#8217;s assessment is based on the perceived risk to the insurance fund of the institution, with institutions deemed riskiest paying higher assessments. The Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to revise its procedures to base assessments on average total assets less tangible capital, rather than deposits. The FDIC issued a final rule which implemented that directive effective April 1, 2011 and adjusted its assessment schedule so that it now ranges from 2.5 basis points to 45 basis points of average total assets less tangible capital. At the same time, the FDIC adopted a more comprehensive approach to evaluating, for assessment purposes, the risk presented by larger institutions such as Investors Bank. Small banks are assessed based on a risk classification determined by examination ratings, financial ratios and certain specified adjustments. However, beginning in 2011, large institutions (i.e., $10 billion more in assets) became subject to assessment based upon a more detailed scorecard approach involving (i) a performance score determined using forward-looking risk measures, including certain stress testing, and (ii) a loss severity score, which is designed to measure, based on modeling, potential loss to the FDIC insurance fund if the institution failed. The total score is converted to an assessment rate, subject to certain adjustments, with institutions deemed riskier paying higher assessments. In October 2012, the FDIC issued a final rule, effective March 1, 2013, which clarified and refined its large bank assessment formula. In October 2015, the FDIC issued a proposed rule that would impose an annual 4.5 basis point surcharge on institutions with assets of $10 billion or more. The surcharge would exist until the Deposit Insurance Fund ratio reaches 1.35% (which the FDIC estimates as eight calendar quarters). The proposed rule would implement a requirement of the Dodd-Frank Act that institutions with assets of $10 billion or more be responsible for increasing the Deposit Insurance Fund reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%. 

Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. We do not currently know of any practice, condition or violation that may lead to termination of our deposit insurance. 

In addition to the FDIC assessments, the Financing Corporation is authorized to impose and collect, with the approval of the FDIC, assessments for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the FICO in the 1980s to recapitalize the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The bonds issued by the FICO are due to mature in 2017 through 2019. For the quarter ended December 31, 2015, the annualized Financing Corporation assessment was equal to 0.60 basis points of total assets less tangible capital. 

Transactions with Affiliates of Investors Bank. Transactions between an insured bank, such as Investors Bank, and any of its affiliates are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and implementing regulations. An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the bank. Generally, a subsidiary of a bank that is not also a depository institution or financial subsidiary is not treated as an affiliate of the bank for purposes of Sections 23A and 23B. 

Section 23A: 

&#8226; 

limits the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10% of such bank&#8217;s capital stock and retained earnings, and limits all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20% of such capital stock and retained earnings; and 

&#8226; 

requires that all such transactions be on terms that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices. 

The term &#8220;covered transaction&#8221; includes the making of loans, purchase of assets, issuance of guarantees and other similar types of transactions. Further, most loans by a bank to any of its affiliates must be secured by collateral in amounts ranging from 100% to 130% of the loan amounts. In addition, any covered transaction by a bank with an affiliate and any purchase of assets or services by a bank from an affiliate must be on terms that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank, as those that would be provided to a non-affiliate. 

Prohibitions Against Tying Arrangements. Banks are subject to the prohibitions of 12 U.S.C. Section 1972 on certain tying arrangements. A depository institution is prohibited, subject to some exceptions, from extending credit to or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution. 

Privacy Standards. FDIC regulations require Investors Bank to disclose their privacy policy, including identifying with whom they share &#8220;non-public personal information,&#8221; to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship and annually thereafter. 

Investors Bank is also required to provide its customers with the ability to &#8220;opt-out&#8221; of having Investors Bank share their non-public personal information with unaffiliated third parties before they can disclose such information, subject to certain exceptions. 

In addition, in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Investors Bank must provide its customers with the ability to &#8220;opt-out&#8221; of having Investors Bank share their non-public personal information for marketing purposes with an affiliate or subsidiary before they can disclose such information. 

The FDIC and other federal banking agencies adopted guidelines establishing standards for safeguarding customer information. The guidelines describe the agencies&#8217; expectations for the creation, implementation and maintenance of an information security program, which would include administrative, technical and physical safeguards appropriate to the size and complexity of the institution and the nature and scope of its activities. The standards set forth in the guidelines are intended to insure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information, protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such records and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. 

Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws. All FDIC insured institutions have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income individuals and neighborhoods. In connection with its examination of a state chartered savings bank, the FDIC is required to assess the institution&#8217;s record of compliance with the CRA. Among other things, the current CRA regulations rates an institution based on its actual performance in meeting community needs. In particular, the current evaluation system focuses on three tests: 

&#8226; 

a lending test, to evaluate the institution&#8217;s record of making loans in its service areas; 

&#8226; 

an investment test, to evaluate the institution&#8217;s record of investing in community development projects, affordable housing, and programs benefiting low or moderate income individuals and/or census tracts and businesses; and 

&#8226; 

a service test, to evaluate the institution&#8217;s delivery of services through its branches, ATMs and other offices. 

An institution&#8217;s failure to comply with the provisions of the CRA could, at a minimum, result in regulatory restrictions on its activities. Investors Bank received a &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; CRA rating in our most recent publicly-available federal evaluation, which was conducted by the FDIC in August 2011. 

In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. The failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the FDIC, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice. 

Loans to a Bank&#8217;s Insiders 

Federal Regulation. A bank&#8217;s loans to its insiders &#8212; executive officers, directors, principal shareholders (any owner of 10% or more of its stock) and any of certain entities affiliated with any such persons (an insider&#8217;s related interest) are subject to the conditions and limitations imposed by Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and its implementing regulations. Under these restrictions, the aggregate amount of the loans to any insider and the insider&#8217;s related interests may not exceed the loans-to-one-borrower limit applicable to national banks, which is comparable to the loans-to-one-borrower limit applicable to Investors Bank. See &#8220;&#8212; New Jersey Banking Regulation &#8212; Loans-to-One Borrower Limitations.&#8221; All loans by a bank to all insiders and insiders&#8217; related interests in the aggregate may not exceed the bank&#8217;s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. With certain exceptions, loans to an executive officer, other than loans for the education of the officer&#8217;s children and certain loans secured by the officer&#8217;s residence, may not exceed the lesser of (1) $100,000 or (2) the greater of $25,000 or 2.5% of the bank&#8217;s unimpaired capital and surplus. Federal regulation also requires that any proposed loan to an insider or a related interest of that insider be approved in advance by a majority of the board of directors of the bank, with any interested directors not participating in the voting, if such loan, when aggregated with any existing loans to that insider and the insider&#8217;s related interests, would exceed either (1) $500,000 or (2) the greater of $25,000 or 5% of the bank&#8217;s unimpaired capital and surplus. 

Generally, loans to insiders must be made on substantially the same terms as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those that are prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons. An exception is made for extensions of credit made pursuant to a benefit or compensation plan of a bank that is widely available to employees of the bank and that does not give any preference to insiders of the bank over other employees of the bank. 

In addition, federal law prohibits extensions of credit to a bank&#8217;s insiders and their related interests by any other institution that has a correspondent banking relationship with the bank, unless such extension of credit is on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons and does not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. 

Extensions of credit to a savings bank&#8217;s executive officers are subject to specific limits based on the type of loans involved. Generally, loans are limited to $100,000, except for a mortgage loan secured by the officer&#8217;s residence and education loans for the officer&#8217;s children. 

New Jersey Regulation. The New Jersey Banking Act imposes conditions and limitations on loans and extensions of credit to directors and executive officers of a savings bank and to corporations and partnerships controlled by such persons, which are comparable in many respects to the conditions and limitations imposed on the loans and extensions of credit to insiders and their related interests under federal law, as discussed above. The New Jersey Banking Act also provides that a savings bank that is in compliance with federal law is deemed to be in compliance with such provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act. 

Federal Reserve System 

Under Federal Reserve Board regulations, Investors Bank is required to maintain non-interest earning reserves against its transaction accounts. The Federal Reserve Board regulations generally require that reserves of 3% must be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts over $15.2 million and up to $110.2 million, and 10% against that portion of total transaction accounts in excess of up to $110.2 million. The first $15.2 million of otherwise reservable balances are exempted from the reserve requirements. Investors Bank is in compliance with these requirements. These requirements are adjusted annually by the Federal Reserve Board. Required reserves must be maintained in the form of vault cash and/or an interest bearing account at a Federal Reserve Bank; or a pass-through account as defined by the Federal Reserve Board. 

Anti-Money Laundering and Customer Identification 

Investors Bank is subject to FDIC regulations implementing the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, or the USA PATRIOT Act. The USA PATRIOT Act gives the federal government powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing, and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. By way of amendments to the Bank Secrecy Act, Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act takes measures intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies. Further, certain provisions of Title III impose affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions, including banks, thrifts, brokers, dealers, credit unions, money transfer agents and parties registered under the Commodity Exchange Act. 

Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act and the related FDIC regulations require the: 

&#8226; 

Establishment of anti-money laundering compliance programs that includes policies, procedures, and internal controls; the appointment of an anti-money laundering compliance officer; an training program; and independent testing; 

&#8226; 

Make certain reports to FinCEN and law enforcement that are designated to assist in the detection and prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing activities; 

&#8226; 

Establishment of a program specifying procedures for obtaining and maintaining certain records from customers seeking to open new accounts, including verifying the identity of customers within a reasonable period of time; 

&#8226; 

Establishment of enhanced due diligence policies, procedures and controls designed to detect and report money-laundering, terrorist financing and other suspicious activity; 

&#8226; 

Monitoring account activity for suspicious transactions; and 

&#8226; 

Impose a heightened level of review for certain high risk customers or accounts. 

The USA PATRIOT Act also includes prohibitions on correspondent accounts for foreign shell banks and requires compliance with record keeping obligations with respect to correspondent accounts of foreign banks. Bank regulators are directed to consider a holding company&#8217;s effectiveness in combating money laundering when ruling on Federal Reserve Act and Bank Merger Act applications. 

The bank regulatory agencies have increased the regulatory scrutiny of the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering programs maintained by financial institutions. Significant penalties and fines, as well as other supervisory orders may be imposed on a financial institution for non-compliance with these requirements. In addition, the federal bank regulatory agencies must consider the effectiveness of financial institutions engaging in a merger transaction in combating money laundering activities. Investors Bank has adopted policies and procedures to comply with these requirements. 

Holding Company Regulation 

Federal Regulation. Bank holding companies, like Investors Bancorp, Inc. are subject to examination, regulation and periodic reporting under the Bank Holding Company Act, as administered by the Federal Reserve Board. Federal Reserve Board regulations imposed consolidated capital adequacy requirements on bank holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate consolidated capital requirements for depository institution holding companies that are no less stringent, both quantitatively and in terms of components of capital, than those applicable to institutions themselves. Among other things, that eliminated the inclusion of certain instruments from tier 1 capital, such as trust preferred securities, that were previously includable for bank holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act grandfathered instruments issued prior to May 19, 2010 by mutual holding companies and all bank holding companies of less than $15 billion in assets. The previously referenced final rules on regulatory capital, effective January 1, 2015, implemented the Dodd-Frank Act directive. The capital requirements applicable to Investors Bancorp, Inc. are now identical to those applying to the Bank. As of December 31, 2015, Investors Bancorp, Inc.&#8217;s regulatory capital ratios exceeded these minimum capital requirements. See &#8220;Regulatory Capital Compliance.&#8221; 

Regulations of the Federal Reserve Board provide that a bank holding company must serve as a source of strength to any of its subsidiary banks and must not conduct its activities in an unsafe or unsound manner. The Dodd-Frank Act codified the source of strength policy. Under the prompt corrective action provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, a bank holding company parent of an undercapitalized subsidiary bank would be directed to guarantee, within limitations, the capital restoration plan that is required of an undercapitalized bank. See &#8220;&#8212; Federal Banking Regulation &#8212; Prompt Corrective Action.&#8221; If an undercapitalized bank fails to file an acceptable capital restoration plan or fails to implement an accepted plan, the Federal Reserve Board may prohibit the bank holding company parent of the undercapitalized bank from paying any dividend or making any other form of capital distribution without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. 

In addition, Federal Reserve Board guidance sets forth the supervisory expectation that bank holding companies will inform and consult with Federal Reserve Board staff in advance of issuing a dividend that exceeds earnings for the quarter and should inform the Federal Reserve Board and should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce dividends if (i) net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends, (ii) prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with the bank holding company's capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition, or (iii) the bank holding company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. 

A bank holding company is required to give the Federal Reserve Board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, will be equal to 10% or more of the company&#8217;s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve Board order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve Board. Such notice and approval is not required for a bank holding company that is as &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; under applicable regulations of the Federal Reserve Board, that has received a composite &#8220;1&#8221; or &#8220;2&#8221; rating, as well as a &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; rating for management, at its most recent bank holding company examination by the Federal Reserve Board, and that is not the subject of any unresolved supervisory issues. 

As a bank holding company, Investors Bancorp is required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board to acquire all, or substantially all, of the assets of any bank or bank holding company. Prior Federal Reserve Board approval is also required for Investors Bancorp to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting securities of any bank or bank holding company if, after giving effect to such acquisition, it would, directly or indirectly, own or control more than 5% of any class of voting shares of such bank or bank holding company. 

In addition, a bank holding company that does not elect to be a financial holding company under federal regulations, is generally prohibited from engaging in, or acquiring direct or indirect control of any company engaged in non-banking activities. One of the principal exceptions to this prohibition is for activities found by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks. Some of the principal activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined by regulation to be closely related to banking are: 

&#8226; 

making or servicing loans; 

&#8226; 

performing certain data processing services; 

&#8226; 

providing discount brokerage services; or acting as fiduciary, investment or financial advisor; 

&#8226; 

leasing personal or real property; 

&#8226; 

making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare; and 

&#8226; 

acquiring a savings and loan association. 

A bank holding company that elects to be a financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature or incident to activities which are financial in nature. Investors Bancorp, Inc. has not elected to be a financial holding company, although it may seek to do so in the future. A bank holding company may elect to become a financial holding company if: 

&#8226; 

each of its depository institution subsidiaries is &#8220;well capitalized&#8221;; 

&#8226; 

each of its depository institution subsidiaries is &#8220;well managed&#8221;; 

&#8226; 

each of its depository institution subsidiaries has at least a &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; Community Reinvestment Act rating at its most recent examination; and 

&#8226; 

the bank holding company has filed a certification with the Federal Reserve Board stating that it elects to become a financial holding company. 

Under federal law, depository institutions are liable to the FDIC for losses suffered or anticipated by the FDIC in connection with the default of a commonly controlled depository institution, or for any assistance provided by the FDIC to such an institution in danger of default. This law would potentially be applicable to Investors Bancorp, Inc. if it ever acquired as a separate subsidiary a depository institution in addition to Investors Bank. 

The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, as amended by Section 613 of the Dodd-Frank Act, regulates interstate banking activities by establishing a framework for nationwide interstate banking and branching. As amended, this interstate banking and branching authority generally permits a bank in one state to establish a de novo branch at a location in another host state if state banks chartered in such host state would also be permitted to establish a branch at that location in the state. Under these amendments, Investors Bank is permitted to establish branch offices in other states in addition to our existing New Jersey and New York branch offices. 

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 eliminated most of the barriers to affiliations among banks, securities firms, insurance companies, and other financial companies previously imposed under federal banking laws if certain criteria are satisfied. Certain subsidiaries of well-capitalized and well-managed banks may be treated as &#8220;financial subsidiaries,&#8221; which are generally permitted to engage in activities that are financial in nature, including securities underwriting, dealing, and market making; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies; and activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be closely related to banking. 

New Jersey Regulation. Under the New Jersey Banking Act, a company owning or controlling a savings bank is regulated as a bank holding company. The New Jersey Banking Act defines the terms &#8220;company&#8221; and &#8220;bank holding company&#8221; as such terms are defined under the BHCA. Each bank holding company controlling a New Jersey-chartered bank or savings bank must file certain reports with the Commissioner and is subject to examination by the Commissioner. 

Acquisition of Investors Bancorp, Inc. Under federal law and under the New Jersey Banking Act, no person may acquire control of Investors Bancorp, Inc. or Investors Bank without first obtaining approval of such acquisition of control by the Federal Reserve Board and the Commissioner. See &#8220;Restrictions on the Acquisition of Investors Bancorp, Inc. and Investors Bank.&#8221; 

Federal Securities Laws. Investors Bancorp, Inc.&#8217;s common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Investors Bancorp, Inc. is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 

Investors Bancorp, Inc. common stock held by persons who are affiliates (generally officers, directors and principal stockholders) of Investors Bancorp, Inc. may not be resold without registration or unless sold in accordance with certain resale restrictions. If Investors Bancorp, Inc. meets specified current public information requirements, each affiliate of Investors Bancorp, Inc. is able to sell in the public market, without registration, a limited number of shares in any three-month period. 

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 . The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was enacted to address, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. 

As directed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are required to certify that our quarterly and annual reports do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact. The rules adopted by the SEC under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act have several requirements, including having these officers certify that: they are responsible for establishing, maintaining and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting; they have made certain disclosures to our auditors and the audit committee of the Board of Directors about our internal control over financial reporting; and they have included information in our quarterly and annual reports about their evaluation and whether there have been changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could materially affect internal control over financial reporting. 

We have existing policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with these regulations. 

Taxation 

Federal Taxation 

General. Investors Bancorp, Inc. and its subsidiaries are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. Investors Bancorp, Inc. and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. Investors Bancorp, Inc.&#8217;s 2013 federal tax return is currently under audit by the IRS. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to Investors Bancorp, Inc. or its subsidiaries. 

Method of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, Investors Bancorp, Inc. currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending December 31 for filing its federal and state income tax returns. 

Bad Debt Reserves. Historically, Investors Bank was subject to special provisions in the tax law regarding allowable bad debt tax deductions and related reserves. Tax law changes were enacted in 1996 pursuant to the Small Business Protection Act of 1996 (the &#8220;1996 Act&#8221;), which eliminated the use of the percentage of taxable income method for tax years after 1995 and required recapture into taxable income over a six-year period of all bad debt reserves accumulated after 1987. Investors Bank has fully recaptured its post-1987 reserve balance. Currently, Investors Bank uses the specific charge off method to account for bad debt deductions for income tax purposes. 

Taxable Distributions and Recapture. Prior to the 1996 Act, bad debt reserves created prior to January 1, 1988 (pre-base year reserves) were subject to recapture into taxable income if Investors Bank failed to meet certain thrift asset and definitional tests. As a result of the 1996 Act, bad debt reserves accumulated after 1987 are required to be recaptured into income over a six-year period. However, all pre-base year reserves are subject to recapture if Investors Bank makes certain non-dividend distributions, repurchases any of its stock, pays dividends in excess of tax earnings and profits, or ceases to maintain a bank charter. At December 31, 2015, our total federal pre-base year reserve was approximately $45.2 million. 

Alternative Minimum Tax. The Internal Revenue Code imposes an alternative minimum tax (&#8220;AMT&#8221;) at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences (&#8220;alternative minimum taxable income&#8221; or &#8220;AMTI&#8221;). The AMT is payable to the extent such AMTI is in excess of an exemption amount and the AMT exceeds the regular income tax. Net operating losses can offset no more than 90% of AMTI. Certain payments of AMT may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years. Investors Bancorp, Inc. and its subsidiaries have not been subject to the AMT and have no such amounts available as credits for carryover. 

Net Operating Loss Carryovers. A corporation may carry back net operating losses to the preceding two taxable years and forward to the succeeding 20 taxable years. On May 7, 2014, the second step conversion was completed. The new consolidated group resulting from the second step has the ability to carry back claims normally allowed under federal tax law to the old consolidated group. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had total federal net operating loss carryforwards of $8.8 million related to prior acquisitions. 

Corporate Dividends-Received Deduction . Investors Bancorp, Inc. may exclude from its federal taxable income 100% of dividends received from Investors Bank as a wholly owned subsidiary. The corporate dividends-received deduction is 80% when the dividend is received from a corporation having at least 20% of its stock owned by the recipient corporation. A 70% dividends-received deduction is available for dividends received from a corporation having less than 20% of its stock owned by the recipient corporation. 

&#160; 

State Taxation 

New Jersey State Taxation. Investors Bancorp, Inc. and its subsidiaries file separate New Jersey corporate business tax returns on an unconsolidated basis. Generally, the income of savings institutions in New Jersey, which is calculated based on federal taxable income, subject to certain adjustments, is subject to New Jersey tax. 

Investors Bancorp, Inc. is required to file a New Jersey income tax return and is generally subject to a state income tax at a 9% rate. If Investors Bancorp, Inc. meets certain requirements, it may be eligible to elect to be taxed as a New Jersey Investment Company, which would allow it to be taxed at a rate of 3.6%. At December 31, 2015, Investors Bancorp, Inc. did not meet the eligibility requirements to be taxed as a New Jersey Investment Company. 

New Jersey tax law does not and has not allowed for a taxpayer to file a tax return on a combined or consolidated basis with another member of the affiliated group where there is common ownership. However, under tax legislation, if the taxpayer cannot demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the tax filing discloses the true earnings of the taxpayer on its business carried on in the State of New Jersey, the New Jersey Director of the Division of Taxation may, at the director&#8217;s discretion, require the taxpayer to file a consolidated return for the entire operations of the affiliated group or controlled group, including its own operations and income. 

In connection with the Company&#8217;s second step conversion, a $20.0 million charitable contribution was made to the Investors Charitable Foundation, $10.0 million of which was made by Investors Bank and the remaining $10.0 million by Investors Bancorp, Inc. For Investors Bancorp, Inc., the excess contribution over the allowable deduction limit for the standalone entity may be carried forward to the succeeding 5 taxable years. Based on the entity&#8217;s standalone future state taxable income, a valuation allowance was established for the portion of the state tax benefit related to the contribution that is not more likely than not to be realized. 

New York State Taxation. In 2014, New York State enacted significant and comprehensive reforms to its corporate tax system that went into effect January 1, 2015. The new legislation resulted in significant changes to the method of calculating income taxes for banks, including changes to future period tax rates, rules relating to the sourcing of income, and the elimination of the banking corporation tax so that banking corporations will now be taxed under the State&#8217;s corporate franchise tax. The corporate franchise tax is based on the combined entire net income of the Company and its affiliates allocable and apportionable to New York State and taxed at a rate of 7.1%. At this time, the changes to the New York tax code has caused our effective tax rate to increase. The amount of such increase will depend on the amount of revenues that are sourced to New York State under the new legislation, which can be expected to fluctuate over time. In addition, the Company and its affiliates are subject to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (&#8220;MTA&#8221;) Surcharge allocable to business activities carried on in the Metropolitan Commuter Transportation District. The MTA surcharge for 2015 was 25.6% of a recomputed New York State franchise tax, calculated using a 9% tax rate on allocated and apportioned entire net income. Investors Bank is currently under audit with respect to its New York State combined franchise tax return for tax years 2013 and 2014. 

New York City Taxation. &#32;In 2015, New York City enacted provisions to its tax law to conform its corporate and banking tax laws to those of New York State, retroactive to January 1, 2015. The Company and its affiliates are subject to the new combined corporate tax for New York City calculated on a similar basis as the New York State franchise tax, subject to the New York City apportionment rules. While the majority of the Company&#8217;s entire net income is derived from outside of the New York City jurisdiction, the new sourcing rules enacted by the tax law provisions have increased the income apportioned to New York City and in turn, caused an increase to our effective tax rate. 

Delaware State Taxation. &#32;As a Delaware holding company not earning income in Delaware, Investors Bancorp, Inc. is exempted from Delaware corporate income tax but is required to file annual returns and pay annual fees and an annual franchise tax to the State of Delaware.
