&#8226; 

Approximately 60% &#32;of our new and incremental business backlog launching from 2016 to 2018 is for customers other than GM. In addition, we are working on $1.5 billion &#32;in quoted and emerging new business opportunities. These opportunities would allow us to continue the diversification and expansion of our customer base, product portfolio and global footprint. Substantially all of these opportunities are for customers other than GM and feature our advanced technology such as our EcoTrac &#174; Disconnecting AWD system and e-AAM &#8482; electric driveline systems technology. 

&#8226; 

We also continue to evaluate and consider strategic opportunities that will complement our core strengths and supplement our diversification strategies while providing future, profitable growth prospects. 

Achieve globalization by increasing our presence in global markets to support our customers ' &#32;platforms. 

&#8226; 

As our customers continue to design their products for global markets, they will continue to require global support from their suppliers. For this reason, it is critical that we maintain a global presence in these markets in order to remain competitive for new contracts. Over the past few years, we have significantly increased our installed capacity in cost competitive global markets to support current programs and future opportunities. Specific actions included expanding capacity in Brazil, China, Mexico, Poland, Thailand and the U.S. and constructing new facilities in Mexico and the U.S. 

&#8226; 

We expect our EcoTrac &#174; Disconnecting AWD products to support three global vehicle platforms by 2018, based on our new and incremental business backlog launching from 2016 to 2018. 

&#8226; 

Our joint venture (JV) with Hefei Automobile Axle Co., Ltd. (HAAC), a subsidiary of the JAC Group (Anhui Jianghuai Automotive Group Co., Ltd.), which includes 100% of HAAC's light commercial axle business, continues to be a strong advantage for building relationships with leading Chinese light truck manufacturers. We supply front and rear beam axles to several leading Chinese light truck manufacturers, including JAC and BAIC Foton. 

&#8226; 

More than half of our $725 million &#32;of new and incremental business backlog launching from 2016 to 2018 is for end use markets outside the U.S. and nearly all has been sourced to our manufacturing facilities outside the U.S. 

Achieve solid financial performance to build value for our key stakeholders . 

&#8226; 

Over the past five years, AAM ' s compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for sales has more than doubled the growth rate of the industry. Included in this sales growth is an increase of 10% in our non-GM sales in 2015. 

&#8226;

This includes having manufacturing and engineering facilities in Brazil, China, Germany, India, Mexico, Poland, Sweden, Thailand and the U.S. 

&#8226; 

As a result of our debt refinancing activities over the past few years, we reduced our weighted average interest cost, extended our debt maturities and improved debt covenant terms and conditions. In 2015, we took additional steps to reduce our long-term debt by voluntarily prepaying the remaining $135.9 million outstanding under our term facility, which included $2.8 million that was due in the fourth quarter of 2015. By taking advantage of favorable market conditions and paying down our term facility, we improved our flexibility to manage and grow our business and to support AAM's long-term strategic objectives. As of December 31, 2015, we had over $840 million in available liquidity and no significant debt maturities until 2019.

Industry Trends 

See Item 7, &#8220;Management's Discussion and Analysis - Industry Trends.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Productive Materials 

We believe that we have adequate sources of supply of productive materials and components for our manufacturing needs. Most raw materials (such as steel) and semi-processed or finished items (such as castings) are available within the geographical regions of our operating facilities from qualified sources in quantities sufficient for our needs. We currently have contracts with our steel suppliers that ensure continuity of supply to our principal operating facilities in North America. We also have validation and testing capabilities that enable us to strategically qualify steel sources on a global basis. As we continue to expand our global manufacturing footprint, we will rely on suppliers in local markets that have not yet proven their ability to meet our requirements. 

Research and Development (R&#38;D) 

We continue to invest in the development of new products, processes and systems to improve efficiency and flexibility in our operations and continue to deliver innovative new products, chassis modules and integrated driveline systems to our customers. 

In 2015 , R&#38;D spending, net of customer engineering, design and development recoveries, was $113.9 million &#32;as compared to $103.9 million &#32;in 2014 &#32;and $103.4 million &#32;in 2013 . The focus of this investment continues to be developing innovative driveline and drivetrain systems and related components for light trucks, passenger cars, SUVs, crossover vehicles and commercial vehicles in the global marketplace. Product development in this area includes power transfer units, transfer cases, driveline and transmission differentials, multi-piece driveshafts, constant velocity joints, torque transfer devices, chassis modules and front and rear drive axles. We continue to focus on electronic integration in our existing and future products to advance their performance. We also continue to support the development of hybrid and electric vehicle systems. Special emphasis is also placed on the development of products and systems that provide our customers with advancements in fuel efficiency and emissions reduction and improved performance metrics such as noise vibration harshness (NVH), power density and traction control improvements for safety and stability. Our efforts in these areas have resulted in the development of prototypes and various configurations of these driveline systems for several OEMs throughout the world. 

We have also developed and commercialized a disconnecting AWD system, which strengthens AAM's position as a leader in global driveline systems technology. AAM ' s EcoTrac &#174; &#32;Disconnecting AWD system is an industry-first technology that seamlessly engages AWD functionality while improving fuel efficiency and reducing CO 2 &#32;emissions. This system is now featured on the award-winning Jeep Cherokee and the Chrysler 200. 

AAM also develops and manufactures high-efficiency axle systems through the use of proprietary technologies to optimize product design and lubrication management, while also significantly reducing friction and improving fuel economy. Our high efficiency axles are featured on several premium OEM vehicles, including Cadillac, Mercedes-Benz and Jaguar. 

Our e-AAM subsidiary engineers and develops battery electric and hybrid driveline systems to be commercialized for passenger cars and crossover vehicles. These systems are designed to improve fuel efficiency by up to 30%, reduce CO 2 emissions and provide AWD capability with the additional benefit of improved vehicle stability when compared to traditional mechanical AWD systems. 

Through the development of our EcoTrac &#174; &#32;Disconnecting AWD system, our high efficiency axles and our 

e-AAM&#8482; hybrid and electric driveline systems, we have significantly improved fuel efficiency and ride and handling performance while reducing emissions for our customer's products. 

As our customers continue to focus on reducing vehicle weight through the use of aluminum or other conventional means, AAM is well positioned to offer innovative, industry-leading solutions, through proprietary technologies such as PowerLite &#174; &#32;axles, PowerDense &#174; &#32;gears and PowerFilm &#174; &#32;lubricant for passenger car, light truck and AWD applications. 

Backlog 

We typically enter into agreements with our customers to provide axles or other driveline or drivetrain products for the life of our customers' vehicle programs. Our new and incremental business includes awarded programs and incremental content and volume including customer requested engineering changes. Our backlog may be impacted by various assumptions, many of which are provided by our customers based on their long range production plans. These assumptions include future production volume estimates, changes in program launch timing and fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates. 

Our new and incremental business backlog is approximately $725 million &#32;for programs launching from 2016 to 2018. Approximately 75% &#32;of our new and incremental business backlog relates to RWD and AWD applications for passenger cars and crossover vehicles. More than half of our new and incremental business backlog will be for end use markets outside the U.S. and nearly all has been sourced to our non-U.S. manufacturing facilities. Approximately 60% &#32;of our new and incremental business backlog is for customers other than GM. 

Patents and Trademarks 

We maintain and have pending various U.S. and foreign patents, trademarks and other rights to intellectual property relating to our business, which we believe are appropriate to protect our interest in existing products, new inventions, manufacturing processes and product developments. We do not believe that any single patent or trademark is material to our business nor would expiration or invalidity of any patent or trademark have a material adverse effect on our business or our ability to compete . 

Cyclicality and Seasonality 

Our operations are cyclical because they are directly related to worldwide automotive production, which is also cyclical and dependent on general economic conditions and other factors. Our business is also moderately seasonal as our major OEM customers historically have an extended shutdown of operations (typically 1 to 2 weeks) in conjunction with their model year changeover and an approximate one-week shutdown in December. Accordingly, our quarterly results may reflect these trends. 

Environmental Matters 

We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws, regulations and ordinances, including those regulating air emissions, water discharge, waste management and environmental cleanup. We closely monitor our environmental conditions to ensure that we are in compliance with applicable laws, regulations and ordinances. We have made, and will continue to make, capital and other expenditures to comply with environmental requirements, including recurring administrative costs. Such expenditures were not significant in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 . 

Associates 

We employ approximately 13,050 &#32;associates on a global basis, including our joint venture affiliates, of which approximately 3,610 &#32;are employed in the U.S. Approximately 2,010 &#32;associates are represented by the UAW. Approximately 1,290 &#32;of our hourly associates at our Three Rivers Manufacturing Facility in Michigan are subject to a stand alone UAW agreement that expires September 13, 2017. An additional 720 &#32;associates at our MSP Industries Corporation and Colfor Manufacturing, Inc. subsidiaries are represented by the UAW under collective bargaining agreements that expire April 18, 2017 and June 8, 2018, respectively. In addition, approximately 130 &#32;associates at our Albion Automotive subsidiary in Scotland, approximately 3,480 &#32;associates at our Guanajuato Manufacturing Complex in Mexico and approximately 480 &#32;associates at our Arauc&#225;ria Manufacturing Facility in Brazil are represented by labor unions that are subject to collective bargaining agreements. The current collective bargaining agreement at Albion will expire on March 31, 2017. The collective bargaining agreements in Mexico and Brazil expire and are renegotiated annually.
