 Item 1. BUSINESS Company Overview 

Home BancShares, Inc. (&#147;Home BancShares&#148;, which may also be referred to in this document as &#147;we&#148;, &#147;us&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;) is a Conway, Arkansas headquartered bank holding company registered under the federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. The Company&#146;s common stock is traded through the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol &#147;HOMB&#148;. We are primarily engaged in providing a broad range of commercial and retail banking and related financial services to businesses, real estate developers and investors, individuals and municipalities through our wholly owned community bank subsidiary &#150; Centennial Bank (the &#147;Bank&#148;). The Bank has branch locations in Arkansas, Florida, South Alabama and a loan production office in New York City. Although the Company has a diversified loan portfolio, at December 31, 2015 and 2014, commercial real estate loans represented 60.0% and 57.2% of gross loans and 332.4% and 285.2% of total stockholders&#146; equity, respectively. The Company&#146;s total assets, total deposits, total revenue and net income for each of the past three years are as follows:

Our community banking team is built around experienced bankers with strong local relationships. The Company was formed in 1998 by an investor group led by John W. Allison, our Chairman, and Robert H. &#147;Bunny&#148; Adcock, Jr., our Vice Chairman. After obtaining a bank charter, we established First State Bank in Conway, Arkansas, in 1999. We acquired Community Bank, Bank of Mountain View and Centennial Bank in 2003, 2005 and 2008, respectively. Home BancShares and its founders were also involved in the formation of Twin City Bank and Marine Bank, both of which we acquired in 2005. During 2008 and 2009, we merged all of our banks into one charter and adopted Centennial Bank as the common name. In 2010, we acquired six banks in Florida through Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#147;FDIC&#148;) assisted transactions with loss share, including Old Southern Bank, Key West Bank, Coastal Community Bank, Bayside Savings Bank, Wakulla Bank and Gulf State Community Bank. In 2012, we acquired three banks headquartered in Florida including Vision Bank, Premier Bank and Heritage Bank of Florida (&#147;Heritage&#148;). Heritage was acquired through an FDIC-assisted transaction without loss share. In 2013, we acquired Liberty Bancshares, Inc. headquartered in Jonesboro, Arkansas. During 2014, we acquired Florida Traditions Bank headquartered in Dade City, Florida and Broward Financial Holdings, Inc. headquartered in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. During 2015, we acquired Doral Bank&#146;s Florida Panhandle operations (&#147;Doral Florida&#148;), a pool of national commercial real estate loans, and Florida Business BancGroup, Inc., headquartered in Tampa, Florida. In connection with the acquisition of the pool of national commercial real estate loans, we opened a loan production office in New York City and created Centennial Commercial Finance Group (&#147;Centennial CFG&#148;). 

We believe many individuals and businesses prefer banking with a locally managed community bank capable of providing flexibility and quick decisions. The execution of our community banking strategy has allowed us to rapidly build our network of banking operations through acquisitions. The following are the financial details concerning our acquisitions during the previous five years. 

Acquisition of Vision Bank &#150; On February 16, 2012, Centennial Bank completed the acquisition of operating assets and liabilities of Vision Bank, a Florida state-chartered bank with its principal office located in Panama City, Florida (&#147;Vision&#148;), pursuant to a Purchase and Assumption Agreement (the &#147;Vision Agreement&#148;), dated November 16, 2011, between the Company, Centennial, Park National Corporation, parent company of Vision (&#147;Park&#148;), and Vision. As a result of the acquisition, the Company had an opportunity to increase its deposit base and reduce transaction costs. The Company also reduced costs through economies of scale. 

&#160;

Prior to the acquisition, Vision conducted banking business from 17 banking offices, including eight locations in Baldwin County, Alabama, and nine locations in the Florida Panhandle counties of Bay, Gulf, Okaloosa, Santa Rosa and Walton. Including the effects of the purchase accounting adjustments, Centennial Bank acquired approximately $529.5 million in assets, approximately $340.3 million in performing loans including loan discounts and approximately $524.4 million of deposits. 

See Note 2 &#147;Business Combinations&#148; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 for an additional discussion regarding the acquisition of Vision Bank. 

FDIC Acquisition of Heritage Bank &#150; On November 2, 2012, Centennial Bank acquired all the deposits and substantially all the assets of Heritage Bank from the FDIC. This transaction did not include any non-performing loans or other real estate owned of Heritage. In connection with the Heritage acquisition, Centennial Bank opted to not enter into a loss-sharing agreement with the FDIC. 

Prior to the acquisition, Heritage operated three banking offices located in Tampa, Lutz and Wesley Chapel, Florida. Including the effects of the purchase accounting adjustments, Centennial Bank acquired approximately $224.8 million in assets plus a cash settlement to balance the transaction, approximately $92.6 million in performing loans including loan discounts and approximately $219.5 million of deposits. 

See Note 2 &#147;Business Combinations&#148; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 for an additional discussion regarding the acquisition of Heritage Bank. 

Acquisition of Premier Bank &#150; On December 1, 2012, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Premier Bank (&#147;Premier&#148;), a Florida state-chartered bank with its principal office located in Tallahassee, Florida, pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement (the &#147;Premier Agreement&#148;) with Premier Bank Holding Company, a Florida corporation and bank holding company (&#147;PBHC&#148;), dated August 14, 2012. The Company then merged Premier with and into Centennial Bank. The Company paid a purchase price to PBHC of $1,415,000 for the Premier acquisition. 

The Premier acquisition was conducted in accordance with the provisions of Section 363 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the &#147;Bankruptcy Code&#148;) pursuant to a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code filed by PBHC with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Florida (the &#147;Bankruptcy Court&#148;) on August 14, 2012. The sale of Premier by PBHC was subject to certain bidding procedures approved by the Bankruptcy Court. No qualifying competing bids were received. The Bankruptcy Court entered a final order on November 29, 2012 approving the sale of Premier to the Company pursuant to and in accordance with the Premier Agreement. 

Prior to the acquisition, Premier conducted banking business from six locations in the Florida panhandle cities of Tallahassee (five) and Quincy (one). Including the effects of the purchase accounting adjustments, Centennial Bank acquired approximately $264.8 million in assets, approximately $138.1 million in loans including loan discounts and approximately $246.3 million of deposits. 

See Note 2 &#147;Business Combinations&#148; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 for an additional discussion regarding the acquisition of Premier Bank. 

&#160;

Acquisition of Liberty Bancshares, Inc. &#150; On October 24, 2013, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Liberty Bancshares, Inc. (&#147;Liberty&#148;), parent company of Liberty Bank of Arkansas (&#147;Liberty Bank&#148;), and merged Liberty Bank into Centennial Bank. Under the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#147;Liberty Agreement&#148;) dated June 25, 2013 among Home BancShares, Centennial Bank, Liberty, Liberty Bank and an acquisition subsidiary of Home BancShares, the shareholders of Liberty received approximately $290.1 million of the Company&#146;s common stock valued at the time of the closing, plus approximately $30.0 million in cash, in exchange for all outstanding shares of Liberty common stock. Home BancShares also repurchased all of Liberty&#146;s SBLF preferred stock held by the U.S. Treasury shortly after the closing. The merger significantly increased the Company&#146;s deposit market share in Arkansas making it the second largest bank holding company headquartered in Arkansas. 

Prior to the acquisition, Liberty operated 46 banking offices located in Northeast Arkansas, Northwest Arkansas and Western Arkansas. Including the effects of the purchase accounting adjustments, Centennial Bank acquired approximately $2.82 billion in assets, approximately $1.73 billion in loans including loan discounts and approximately $2.13 billion of deposits. 

See Note 2 &#147;Business Combinations&#148; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for an additional discussion regarding the acquisition of Liberty Bank. 

Acquisition of Florida Traditions Bank &#150; On July 17, 2014, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Florida Traditions Bank (&#147;Traditions&#148;) and merged Traditions into Centennial Bank. Under the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#147;Traditions Agreement&#148;) dated April 25, 2014, by and among Home BancShares, Centennial Bank, and Traditions, the shareholders of Traditions received approximately $39.5 million of the Company&#146;s common stock valued at the time of closing, in exchange for all outstanding shares of Traditions common stock. 

Prior to the acquisition, Traditions operated eight banking locations in Central Florida, including its main office in Dade City, Florida. Including the effects of the purchase accounting adjustments, Traditions had $310.5 million in total assets, $241.6 million in loans after $8.5 million of loan discounts, and $267.3 million in deposits. 

The transaction was accretive to the Company&#146;s book value per common share and tangible book value per common share. 

See Note 2 &#147;Business Combinations&#148; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for an additional discussion regarding the acquisition of Traditions. 

Acquisition of Broward Financial Holdings, Inc. &#150; On October 23, 2014, the Company completed its acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Broward Financial Holdings, Inc. (&#147;Broward&#148;), parent company of Broward Bank of Commerce (&#147;Broward Bank&#148;), and merged Broward Bank into Centennial Bank. Under the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#147;Broward Agreement&#148;) dated July 30, 2014 by and among Home BancShares, Centennial Bank, Broward, Broward Bank and an acquisition subsidiary of Home BancShares, the shareholders of Broward received approximately $30.2 million of the Company&#146;s common stock valued as of the closing date, plus $3.3 million in cash, in exchange for all outstanding shares of Broward common stock. The Company has also agreed to pay the Broward shareholders at an undetermined date up to approximately $751,000 in additional consideration. The amount and timing of the additional payment, if any, will depend on future payments received or losses incurred by Centennial Bank from certain current Broward Bank loans. At December 31, 2014, the Company had recorded a fair value of zero for the potential additional consideration. 

Prior to the acquisition, Broward Bank operated two banking locations in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Including the effects of the purchase accounting adjustments, Broward had approximately $184.4 million in total assets, $121.1 million in total loans after $3.0 million of loan discounts, and $134.2 million in deposits. 

As of the acquisition date, Broward&#146;s common equity totaled $20.4 million and the Company paid a purchase price to the Broward shareholders of approximately $33.6 million for the Broward acquisition. As a result, the Company paid a multiple of 1.62 of Broward&#146;s book value per share and tangible book value per share. 

See Note 2 &#147;Business Combinations&#148; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for an additional discussion regarding the acquisition of Broward. 

&#160;

Acquisition of Doral Bank&#146;s Florida Panhandle operations &#150; On February 27, 2015, the Company&#146;s banking subsidiary, Centennial, acquired all the deposits and substantially all the assets of Doral Bank&#146;s Florida Panhandle operations (&#147;Doral Florida&#148;) through an alliance agreement with Popular who was the successful lead bidder with the FDIC on the failed Doral Bank of San Juan, Puerto Rico. Including the effects of the purchase accounting adjustments, the acquisition provided the Company with loans of approximately $37.9 million net of loan discounts, deposits of approximately $467.6 million, plus a $428.2 million cash settlement to balance the transaction. There is no loss-share with the FDIC in the acquired assets. 

Prior to the acquisition, Doral Florida operated five branch locations in Panama City, Panama City Beach and Pensacola, Florida plus a loan production office in Tallahassee, Florida. At the time of acquisition, Centennial operated 29 branch locations in the Florida Panhandle. As a result, the Company closed all five branch locations during the July 2015 systems conversion and returned the facilities back to the FDIC. 

See Note 2 &#147;Business Combinations&#148; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for an additional discussion regarding the acquisition of Doral Florida. 

Acquisition of Pool of National Commercial Real Estate Loans &#150; On April 1, 2015, the Company&#146;s wholly-owned bank subsidiary, Centennial, entered into an agreement with AM PR LLC, an affiliate of J.C. Flowers &#38; Co. (collectively, the &#147;Seller&#148;) to purchase a pool of national commercial real estate loans totaling approximately $289.1 million for a purchase price of 99% of the total principal value of the acquired loans. The purchase of the loans was completed on April 1, 2015. The acquired loans were originated by the former Doral Bank within its Doral Property Finance portfolio (&#147;DPF Portfolio&#148;) and were transferred to the Seller by Banco Popular of Puerto Rico (&#147;Popular&#148;) upon its acquisition of the assets and liabilities of Doral Bank from the FDIC, as receiver for the failed Doral Bank. This pool of loans is now housed in a division of Centennial known as the Centennial CFG. The Centennial CFG is responsible for servicing the acquired loan pool and originating new loan production. 

In connection with this acquisition of loans, the Company opened a loan production office on April 23, 2015 in New York City. Through the loan production office, Centennial CFG plans to build out a national lending platform focusing on commercial real estate plus commercial and industrial loans. 

See Note 2 &#147;Business Combinations&#148; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for an additional discussion regarding the acquisition of pool of national commercial real estate loans. 

Acquisition of Florida Business BancGroup, Inc. &#150; On October 1, 2015, the Company completed its acquisition of Florida Business BancGroup, Inc. (&#147;FBBI&#148;), parent company of Bay Cities Bank (&#147;Bay Cities&#148;). The Company paid a purchase price to the FBBI shareholders of $104.1 million for the FBBI acquisition. Under the terms of the agreement, shareholders of FBBI received 2,079,854 shares of its common stock valued at approximately $83.8 million as of October 1, 2015, plus approximately $20.3 million in cash in exchange for all outstanding shares of FBBI common stock. A portion of the cash consideration, $2.0 million, has been placed into escrow, and FBBI shareholders will have a contingent right to receive their pro-rata portions of such amount. The amount, if any, of such escrowed funds to be released to FBBI shareholders will depend upon the amount of losses that HBI incurs in the two years following the completion of the merger related to two class action lawsuits that are pending against Bay Cities. 

FBBI formerly operated six branch locations and a loan production office in the Tampa Bay area and in Sarasota, Florida. Including the effects of any purchase accounting adjustments, as of October 1, 2015, FBBI had approximately $564.5 million in total assets, $408.3 million in loans after $14.1 million of loan discounts, and $472.0 million in deposits.

Our Growth Strategy 

Our goals are to achieve growth in earnings per share and to create and build stockholder value. Our growth strategy entails the following: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Strategic acquisitions &#150; Strategic acquisitions have been a significant component of our historical growth strategy, and we believe properly priced bank acquisitions can continue to be a large part of our growth strategy. In the near term, our principal acquisition focus will be to continue to expand our presence in Arkansas, Florida and Alabama and into other contiguous markets through pursuing both non-FDIC-assisted and FDIC-assisted bank acquisitions, although we may expand into other areas if attractive financial opportunities in other market areas arise. We are continually evaluating potential bank acquisitions to determine what is in the best interests of our Company. Our goals in making these decisions are to maximize the return to our shareholders and to enhance our franchise. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Organic growth &#150; We believe our current branch network provides us with the capacity to grow within our existing market areas. We also believe we are well positioned to attract new business and additional experienced personnel as a result of ongoing changes in our competitive markets. We believe the markets we entered into as a result of historical acquisitions provide us opportunities for organic growth as we now have a presence in several large markets where our market share has not previously been significant. Additionally, through the creation of Centennial CFG, we are building out a national lending platform focusing on commercial real estate plus commercial and industrial loans and have plans to open a deposit-only branch location in New York City in 2016. Overall, we expect the organic loan growth we experienced in 2015 to continue in all of our markets as the economic environment has improved. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; De novo branching &#150; As opportunities arise, we will evaluate new (commonly referred to as de novo ) branches in our current markets and in other attractive market areas. During 2015, no de novo branches were opened. We will continue to evaluate opportunities during 2016 in our contiguous markets and make those decisions on a case by case basis in the best interest of the shareholders. Community Banking Philosophy 

Our community banking philosophy consists of four basic principles: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; manage our community banking franchise with experienced bankers and community bank boards who are empowered to make customer-related decisions quickly; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; provide exceptional service and develop strong customer relationships; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; pursue the business relationships of our local boards of directors, executive officers, stockholders, and customers to actively promote our community bank; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; maintain our commitment to the communities we serve by supporting civic and nonprofit organizations. These principles, which make up our community banking philosophy, are the driving force for our business. As we streamlined our legacy business into an efficient banking network and have integrated new acquisitions, we have preserved lending authority with local management in most cases by using community bank boards that maintain an integral connection to the communities we serve. These community bank boards are generally empowered with lending authority of up to $6.0 million in their respective geographic areas. This allows us to capitalize on the strong relationships that these individuals and our local bank officers have in their respective communities to maintain and grow our business. Through experienced and empowered local bankers and board members, we are committed to maintaining a community banking experience for our customers. 

&#160;

Operating Goals 

Our operating goals focus on maintaining strong credit quality, increasing profitability, finding experienced bankers, and maintaining a &#147;fortress&#148; balance sheet: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Maintain strong credit quality &#150; Credit quality is our first priority. We employ a set of credit standards designed to ensure the proper management of credit risk. Our management team plays an active role in monitoring compliance with these credit standards in the different communities served by Centennial Bank. We have a centralized loan review process, which we believe enables us to take prompt action on potential problem loans. During the past few years we have taken an aggressive approach to resolving problem loans, including those problem loans acquired in the FDIC-assisted and non-FDIC-assisted acquisitions. We are committed to maintaining high credit quality standards. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Continue to improve profitability &#150; We will continue to strive to improve our profitability and achieve high performance ratios as we continue to utilize the available capacity of branches and employees. During 2015, we acquired Doral Florida and FBBI and converted them into our operating systems. In addition, upon conversion, we closed all five Doral Florida branch locations as we already operated 29 branch locations in the Florida Panhandle. These conversions and closures will provide tremendous opportunities for improved profitably as a result of cost savings because of the economies of scale for the combined companies. Additionally, during 2015, we created Centennial CFG who is building out a national lending platform focusing on commercial real estate plus commercial and industrial loans. As we work out the problem loans in our special assets department, we plan to emphasize business development and relationship enhancement in lending and retail areas in these newly acquired markets. Our core efficiency ratio has improved from 59.4% for the year ended 2008 to 39.5% for the year ended 2015. Core efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing non-interest expense less amortization of core deposit intangibles by the sum of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis and non-interest income excluding non-fundamental items such as merger expenses and/or gain and losses. These improvements in operating efficiency are being driven by, among other factors, increasing revenue from organic loan growth, improving our cost savings from the acquisitions, implementing our efficiency study initiatives, streamlining the processes in our lending and retail operations and improving our purchasing power. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Attract and motivate experienced bankers &#150; We believe a major factor in our success has been our ability to attract and motivate bankers who have experience in and knowledge of their local communities. Historically, our hiring and retaining experienced relationship bankers has been integral to our ability to grow quickly when entering new markets. Specifically, as a result of the creation of Centennial CFG, we were able to hire a group of experienced lenders with knowledge of the New York business climate and national commercial lending platforms, which presents us with a tremendous opportunity for loan growth. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Maintain a &#147;fortress&#148; balance sheet &#150; We intend to maintain a strong balance sheet through a focus on four key governing principles: (1) maintain solid asset quality; (2) remain well-capitalized; (3) pursue high performance metrics including return on tangible equity (ROTE), return on assets (ROA), efficiency ratio and net interest margin; and (4) retain liquidity at the bank holding company level that can be utilized should attractive acquisition opportunities be identified or for internal capital needs. We strive to maintain capital levels above the regulatory capital requirements through our focus on these governing principles, which historically has allowed us to take advantage of acquisition opportunities as they become available without the need for additional capital. Our Market Areas 

As of December 31, 2015, we conducted business principally through 79 branches in Arkansas, 61 branches in Florida, six branches in Alabama and a loan production office in New York City. Our branch footprint includes markets in which we are the deposit market share leader as well as markets where we believe we have opportunities for deposit market share growth. 

&#160;

Lending Activities 

We originate loans primarily secured by single and multi-family real estate, residential construction and commercial buildings. In addition, we make loans to small and medium-sized commercial businesses as well as to consumers for a variety of purposes. 

Our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2015, was comprised as follows:

&#160;

&#160; Real Estate &#150; Non-farm/Non-residential. Non-farm/non-residential real estate loans consist primarily of loans secured by income-producing properties, such as shopping/retail centers, hotel/motel properties, office buildings, and industrial/warehouse properties. Commercial lending on income-producing property typically involves higher loan principal amounts, and the repayment of these loans is dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the properties collateralizing the loans to cover operating expenses and debt service. This category of loans also includes specialized properties such as churches, marinas, and nursing homes. Additionally, we make commercial mortgage loans to entities to operate in these types of properties, and the repayment of these loans is dependent, in large part, on the cash flow generated by these entities in the operations of the business. Often, a secondary source of repayment will include the sale of the subject collateral. When this is the case, it is generally our practice to obtain an independent appraisal of this collateral within the Interagency Appraisal and Evaluation Guidelines. 

Real Estate &#150; Construction/Land Development. This category of loans includes loans to residential and commercial developers to purchase raw land and to develop this land into residential and commercial land developments. In addition, this category includes construction loans for all of the types of real estate loans made by the Bank, including both commercial and residential. These loans are generally secured by a first lien on the real estate being purchased or developed. Often, the primary source of repayment will be the sale of the subject collateral. When this is the case, it is generally our practice to obtain an independent appraisal of this collateral within the Interagency Appraisal and Evaluation Guidelines. 

Real Estate &#150; Residential. Our residential mortgage loan program primarily originates loans to individuals for the purchase of residential property. We generally do not retain long-term, fixed-rate residential real estate loans in our portfolio due to interest rate and collateral risks. Residential mortgage loans to individuals retained in our loan portfolio primarily consisted of approximately 36.9% owner occupied 1-4 family properties and approximately 43.3% non-owner occupied 1-4 family properties (rental) as of December 31, 2015. The primary source of repayment for these loans is generally the income and/or assets of the individual to whom the loan is made. Often, a secondary source of repayment will include the sale of the subject collateral. When this is the case, it is generally our practice to obtain an independent appraisal of this collateral within the Interagency Appraisal and Evaluation Guidelines. 

&#160;

Consumer. While our focus is on service to small and medium-sized businesses, we also make a variety of loans to individuals for personal, family and household purposes, including secured and unsecured installment and term loans. The primary source of repayment for these loans is generally the income and/or assets of the individual to whom the loan is made. When secured, we may independently assess the value of the collateral using a third-party valuation source. 

Commercial and Industrial. Our commercial and industrial loan portfolio primarily consisted of 53.2% inventory/accounts receivable (&#147;AR&#148;) financing, 21.8% equipment/vehicle financing and 25.0% other, including letters of credit at less than 1%, as of December 31, 2015. This category includes loans to smaller business ventures, credit lines for working capital and short-term inventory financing, for example. These loans are typically secured by the assets of the business, and are supplemented by personal guaranties of the principals and often mortgages on the principals&#146; primary residences. The primary source of repayment may be conversion of the assets into cash flow, as in inventory and accounts receivable, or may be cash flow generated by operations, as in equipment/vehicle financing. Assessing the value of inventory can involve many factors including, but not limited to, type, age, condition, level of conversion and marketability, and can involve applying a discount factor or obtaining an independent valuation, based on the assessment of the above factors. Assessing the value of accounts receivable can involve many factors including, but not limited to, concentration, aging, and industry, and can involve applying a discount factor or obtaining an independent valuation, based on the assessment of the above factors. Assessing the value of equipment/vehicles may involve a third-party valuation source, where applicable. 

Credit Risks. The principal economic risk associated with each category of the loans that we make is the creditworthiness of the borrower and the ability of the borrower to repay the loan. General economic conditions and the strength of the services and retail market segments affect borrower creditworthiness. General factors affecting a commercial borrower&#146;s ability to repay include interest rates, inflation and the demand for the commercial borrower&#146;s products and services as well as other factors affecting a borrower&#146;s customers, suppliers and employees. 

Risks associated with real estate loans also include fluctuations in the value of real estate, new job creation trends, tenant vacancy rates, and in the case of commercial borrowers, the quality of the borrower&#146;s management. Consumer loan repayments depend upon the borrower&#146;s financial stability and are more likely to be adversely affected by divorce, job loss, illness and other personal hardships. 

Lending Policies. We have established common loan documentation procedures and policies, based on the type of loan, for our bank subsidiary. The board of directors periodically reviews these policies for validity. In addition, it has been and will continue to be our practice to attempt to independently verify information provided by our borrowers, including assets and income. We have not made loans similar to those commonly referred to as &#147;no doc&#148; or &#147;stated income&#148; loans. We focus on the primary and secondary methods of repayment, and prepare global cash flows where appropriate. There are legal restrictions on the dollar amount of loans available for each lending relationship. The Arkansas Banking Code provides that no loan relationship may exceed 20% of a bank&#146;s risk based capital, and we are in compliance with this restriction. In addition, we are not dependent upon any single lending relationship for an amount exceeding 10% of our revenues. As of December 31, 2015, the maximum amount outstanding to a single borrower was $137.7 million. As a community lender, we believe from time to time it is in our best interest to agree to modifications or restructurings. These modifications/restructurings can take the form of a reduction in interest rate, a move to interest-only from principal and interest payments, or a lengthening in the amortization period or any combination thereof. Occasionally, we will modify/restructure a single loan by splitting it into two loans following the interagency guidance involving the workout of commercial real estate loans. The loan representing the portion that is supported by the current cash flow of the borrower or project will remain on the Bank&#146;s books, while the new loan representing the portion that cannot be serviced by the current cash flow is charged-off. Furthermore, we may make an additional loan or loans to a borrower or related interest of a borrower who is past due more than 90 days. These circumstances will be very limited in nature, and when approved by the appropriate lending authority, will likely involve obtaining additional collateral that will improve the collectability of the overall relationship. It is our belief that judicious usage of these tools can improve the quality of our loan portfolio by providing our borrowers an improved probability of survival during difficult economic times. 

&#160;

Loan Approval Procedures. Our bank subsidiary has supplemented our common loan policies to establish its loan approval procedures as follows: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Individual Authorities. The board of directors of Centennial Bank establishes the authorization levels for individual loan officers on a case-by-case basis. Generally, the more experienced a loan officer, the higher the authorization level. The approval authority for individual loan officers ranges from $25,000 to $1.0 million for secured loans and from $1,000 to $100,000 for unsecured loans. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Officers&#146; Loan Committees . Our bank subsidiary also gives its Officers&#146; Loan Committees loan approval authority. Credits in excess of individual loan limits are submitted to the region&#146;s Officers&#146; Loan Committee. The Officers&#146; Loan Committee consists of members of the senior management team of that region and is chaired by that region&#146;s chief lending officer. The regional Officers&#146; Loan Committees have approval authority of up to $2.0 million secured and $500,000 unsecured. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Directors&#146; Loan Committee. Each region throughout our bank subsidiary has a Directors&#146; Loan Committee consisting of outside directors and senior lenders of that region. Generally, each region requires a majority of outside directors be present to establish a quorum. Generally, this committee is chaired either by the Regional Chief Lending Officer or the Regional President. The regional Directors&#146; Loan Committees have approval authority up to $6.0 million secured and $500,000 unsecured. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Executive Loan Committee &#150; The board of directors of Centennial Bank established the Executive Loan Committee consisting of three outside board members and members of executive management. This committee requires five voting members to establish a quorum, including at least two of the outside board members, and is chaired by the Chief Lending Officer of the Bank. The Executive Loan Committee has approval authority up to the in-house consolidated lending limit of $20.0 million. Currently, our board of directors has established an in-house consolidated lending limit of $20.0 million to any one borrowing relationship without obtaining the approval of both our Chairman and our director Richard H. Ashley. We have 20 separate relationships that exceed this in-house limit. 

Deposits and Other Sources of Funds 

Our principal source of funds for loans and investing in securities is core deposits. We offer a wide range of deposit services, including checking, savings, money market accounts and certificates of deposit. We obtain most of our deposits from individuals and small businesses, and municipalities in our market areas. We believe that the rates we offer for core deposits are competitive with those offered by other financial institutions in our market areas. Additionally, our policy also permits the acceptance of brokered deposits. Secondary sources of funding include advances from the Federal Home Loan Banks of Dallas, the Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window and other borrowings. These secondary sources enable us to borrow funds at rates and terms which, at times, are more beneficial to us. 

Other Banking Services 

Given customer demand for increased convenience and account access, we offer a range of products and services, including 24-hour internet banking, mobile banking and voice response information, cash management, overdraft protection, direct deposit, safe deposit boxes, United States savings bonds and automatic account transfers. We earn fees for most of these services. We also receive ATM transaction fees from transactions performed by our customers participating in a shared network of automated teller machines and a debit card system that our customers can use throughout the United States, as well as in other countries. 

&#160;

Insurance 

Centennial Insurance Agency, Inc. is an independent insurance agency, originally founded in 1959 and purchased July 1, 2000, by Centennial Bank. In connection with the 2013 purchase of Liberty, we acquired Town and Country Insurance. Shortly after the acquisition of Liberty we merged Town and Country Insurance into Centennial Insurance Agency. As a result, all of the offices in Arkansas operated as Centennial Insurance Agency, Inc. at December 31, 2014. On January 1, 2015, Centennial Insurance Agency sold the insurance book of business of the former Town and Country Insurance to Stephens Insurance, LLC of Little Rock. This disposal was completed at our book value with no gain or loss. The profitability on this book of business was immaterial. 

The offices of Centennial Insurance Agency are currently located in Jacksonville, Cabot and Conway, Arkansas. 

Centennial Insurance Agency writes policies for commercial and personal lines of business including insurance for property, casualty, life, health and employee benefits. It is subject to regulation by the Arkansas Insurance Department. 

Cook Insurance Agency, Inc. is an independent insurance agency, originally founded in 1913 and acquired November 19, 2010, by Centennial Bank during the FDIC acquisition of Gulf State Community Bank. Cook Insurance Agency writes policies for commercial and personal lines of business including life insurance. It is subject to regulation by the Florida Insurance Department. The offices of Cook Insurance Agency are located in Apalachicola and Crawfordville, Florida. 

The Company may merge the book of business of Cook Insurance Agency into the Centennial Insurance Agency at some point in the future. 

Trust Services 

The Centennial Bank trust department offers a broad array of trust services. These trust services, focusing primarily on personal trusts, corporate trusts and employee benefit trusts. 

Competition 

As of December 31, 2015, we conducted business through 146 branches in our primary market areas of Pulaski, Faulkner, Craighead, Lonoke, Pope, Washington, White, Benton, Greene, Sebastian, Baxter, Cleburne, Independence, Stone, Clay, Conway, Crawford, Johnson, Saline, Sharp and Yell Counties in Arkansas and Monroe, Hillsborough, Leon, Bay, Franklin, Gulf, Broward, Charlotte, Collier, Escambia, Orange, Osceola, Pasco, Polk, Walton, Calhoun, Gadsden, Hernando, Lake, Liberty, Okaloosa, Pinellas, Santa Rosa, Sarasota, Seminole, Wakulla, Counties in Florida and Baldwin County in Alabama. Many other commercial banks, savings institutions and credit unions have offices in our primary market areas. These institutions include many of the largest banks operating in Arkansas and Florida, including some of the largest banks in the country. Many of our competitors serve the same counties we do. Our competitors often have greater resources, have broader geographic markets, have higher lending limits, offer various services that we may not currently offer and may better afford and make broader use of media advertising, support services and electronic technology than we do. To offset these competitive disadvantages, we depend on our reputation as having greater personal service, consistency, and flexibility and the ability to make credit and other business decisions quickly. 

&#160;

Employees 

On December 31, 2015, we had 1,424 full-time equivalent employees. Except for any employees acquired in future acquisitions, we expect that our 2016 staffing levels will be slightly lower than those at year end 2015 as we continue to achieve efficiencies throughout our Company. We consider our employee relations to be good, and we have no collective bargaining agreements with any employees. 

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 

General 

We and our bank subsidiary are subject to extensive state and federal banking regulations that impose restrictions on and provide for general regulatory oversight of our company and its operations. These laws generally are intended to protect depositors, the deposit insurance fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#147;FDIC&#148;) and the banking system as a whole, and not stockholders. The following discussion describes the material elements of the regulatory framework that applies to us. 

Financial Regulatory Reform 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the &#147;Dodd-Frank Act&#148;) made extensive changes in the regulation of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act contains a comprehensive set of provisions designed to govern the practices and oversight of financial institutions and other participants in the financial markets. The act includes provisions that, among other things: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Centralized responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is responsible for implementing, examining, and enforcing compliance with federal consumer financial laws, including mortgage disclosure laws. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Created the Financial Stability Oversight Council that provides comprehensive monitoring to ensure the stability of our nation&#146;s financial system. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Provided mortgage reform provisions regarding a customer&#146;s ability to repay, restricting variable-rate lending by requiring that the ability to repay variable-rate loans be determined by using the maximum rate that will apply during the first five years of a variable-rate loan term, and making more loans subject to provisions for higher cost loans, new disclosures, and certain other revisions. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Changed the assessment base for federal deposit insurance from the amount of insured deposits to consolidated assets less tangible capital, eliminated the ceiling on the size of the Deposit Insurance Fund (&#147;DIF&#148;), and increased the floor on the size of the DIF, which generally will require an increase in the level of assessments for institutions with assets in excess of $10 billion. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Made permanent the $250,000 limit for federal deposit insurance and temporarily provided unlimited federal deposit insurance until January 1, 2013 for noninterest-bearing demand transaction accounts at all insured depository institutions. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Implemented corporate governance revisions, including with regard to executive compensation and proxy access by shareholders, which apply to all public companies, not just financial institutions. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Repealed the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits, thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transactions and other accounts. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Amended the Electronic Funds Transfer Act to, among other things, give the Federal Reserve the authority to establish rules regarding interchange fees charged for electronic debit transactions by payment card issuers having assets over $10 billion and to enforce a new statutory requirement that such fees be reasonable and proportional to the actual cost of a transaction to the issuer. &#160;

Many provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act have delayed effective dates, and the legislation requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new rules and regulations and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. These agencies are still in the process of promulgating the required regulations, and the studies and reports could potentially result in additional legislative or regulatory action. The substance and scope of these regulations therefore cannot be completely determined at this time. We expect our operating and compliance costs to continue to increase as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and implementing its regulations. 

Home BancShares 

We are a bank holding company registered under the federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the &#147;Bank Holding Company Act&#148;) and are subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve Board. The Bank Holding Company Act and other federal laws subject bank holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage, and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities, including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations. 

Acquisitions of Banks. The Bank Holding Company Act requires every bank holding company to obtain the Federal Reserve Board&#146;s prior approval before: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if, after the acquisition, the bank holding company will directly or indirectly own or control more than 5% of the bank&#146;s voting shares; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of any bank; or &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; merging or consolidating with any other bank holding company. Under the Bank Holding Company Act, if well-capitalized and well managed, we, as well as other bank holding companies located within the states in which we operate, may purchase a bank located outside of those states. Conversely, a well-capitalized and well managed bank holding company located outside of the states in which we operate may purchase a bank located inside those states. In each case, however, restrictions may be placed on the acquisition of a bank that has only been in existence for a limited amount of time or will result in specified concentrations of deposits. 

Permitted Activities. A bank holding company is generally permitted under the Bank Holding Company Act to engage in or acquire direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company engaged in the following activities: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; banking or managing or controlling banks; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; any activity that the Federal Reserve Board determines to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking. Activities that the Federal Reserve Board has found to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking include but are not limited to: factoring accounts receivable; making, acquiring, brokering or servicing loans and usual related activities; leasing personal or real property; operating a non-bank depository institution, such as a savings association; trust company functions; financial and investment advisory activities; conducting securities brokerage activities; underwriting and dealing in government obligations and money market instruments; providing specified management consulting and counseling activities; performing selected data processing services and support services; acting as agent or broker in selling credit life insurance and other types of insurance in connection with credit transactions; and performing selected insurance underwriting activities. 

Support of Subsidiary Institutions. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, we are required to act as a source of financial strength for our bank subsidiary and to commit resources to support the bank. Under current federal law, the Federal Reserve may require us to make capital injections into our bank subsidiary and may charge us with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices if we fail to commit resources to our bank subsidiary or if we undertake actions that the Federal Reserve believes might jeopardize our ability to commit resources to the bank. As a result, an obligation to support our bank subsidiary may be required at times when, without this requirement, we might not be inclined to provide it. 

&#160;

Safe and Sound Banking Practices. Bank holding companies are not permitted to engage in unsafe and unsound banking practices. The Federal Reserve Board&#146;s Regulation Y, for example, generally requires a holding company to give the Federal Reserve Board prior notice of any redemption or repurchase of its own equity securities, if the consideration to be paid, together with the consideration paid for any repurchases or redemptions in the preceding year, is equal to 10% or more of the company&#146;s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve Board may oppose the transaction if it believes that the transaction would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law or regulation. Depending upon the circumstances, the Federal Reserve Board could take the position that paying a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice. 

The Federal Reserve Board has broad authority to prohibit activities of bank holding companies and their non-banking subsidiaries which represent unsafe and unsound banking practices or which constitute violations of laws or regulations, and can assess civil money penalties for certain activities conducted on a knowing and reckless basis, if those activities caused a substantial loss to a depository institution. The penalties can be as high as $1 million for each day the activity continues. 

Annual Reporting; Examinations. We are required to file annual reports with the Federal Reserve Board, and such additional information as the Federal Reserve Board may require pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act. The Federal Reserve Board may examine a bank holding company or any of its subsidiaries, and charge the company for the cost of such examination. 

Capital Adequacy Requirements. The Federal Reserve Board has adopted a system using risk-based capital guidelines to evaluate the capital adequacy of bank holding companies having $500 million or more in assets on a consolidated basis. We currently have consolidated assets in excess of $500 million, and are therefore subject to the Federal Reserve Board&#146;s capital adequacy guidelines. 

Under the guidelines, specific categories of assets are assigned different risk weights, based generally on the perceived credit risk of the asset. These risk weights are multiplied by corresponding asset balances to determine a &#147;risk-weighted&#148; asset base. The guidelines in effect as of December 31, 2015 require a minimum total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% (of which at least 6.0% is required to consist of Tier 1 capital elements) and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10% (of which at least 8.0% is required to consist of Tier 1 capital elements) to be &#147;well-capitalized.&#148; Total capital is the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. As of December 31, 2015, our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 11.26% and our total risk-based capital ratio was 12.16%. Thus, as of December 31, 2015, we are considered well-capitalized for regulatory purposes. 

In addition to the risk-based capital guidelines, the Federal Reserve Board uses a leverage ratio as an additional tool to evaluate the capital adequacy of bank holding companies. The leverage ratio is a company&#146;s Tier 1 capital divided by its average total consolidated assets. Certain highly-rated bank holding companies may maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 3.0%, but other bank holding companies are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 4.0%. Well-capitalized is a leverage ratio in excess of 5%. As of December 31, 2015, our leverage ratio was 9.91%. 

The federal banking agencies&#146; risk-based and leverage ratios are minimum supervisory ratios generally applicable to banking organizations that meet certain specified criteria. The federal bank regulatory agencies may set capital requirements for a particular banking organization that are higher than the minimum ratios when circumstances warrant. Federal Reserve Board guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions, substantially above the minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets. 

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Act includes certain provisions concerning the capital regulations of the federal banking agencies. These provisions, often referred to as the &#147;Collins Amendment,&#148; are intended to subject bank holding companies to the same capital requirements as their bank subsidiaries and to eliminate or significantly reduce the use of hybrid capital instruments, especially trust preferred securities, as regulatory capital. Under the Collins Amendment, trust preferred securities issued before May 19, 2010 by a company, such as our Company, with total consolidated assets of less than $15 billion as of December 31, 2009, and treated as regulatory capital are grandfathered, but any such securities issued later are not eligible as regulatory capital. The Collins Amendment requires banking regulators to develop regulations setting minimum risk-based and leverage capital requirements for holding companies and banks on a consolidated basis that are no less stringent than the generally applicable requirements in effect for depository institutions under the prompt corrective action regulations discussed below. The banking regulators also must seek to make capital standards countercyclical so that the required levels of capital increase in times of economic expansion and decrease in times of economic contraction. 

In July 2013, the Federal Reserve Board and the other federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule to revise their risk-based and leverage capital requirements and their method for calculating risk-weighted assets to make them consistent with the agreements that were reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in &#147;Basel III: A Global Regulatory Framework for More Resilient Banks and Banking Systems&#148; and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rule applies to all depository institutions, bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $500 million or more and savings and loan holding companies (collectively, &#147;banking organizations&#148;). Among other things, the rule establishes a new common equity Tier 1 minimum capital requirement (4.5% of risk-weighted assets) and a higher minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital requirement (6% of risk-weighted assets) and assigns higher risk weightings (150%) to exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on non-accrual status and certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property. As of December 31, 2015, the Company&#146;s common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 10.50%. The final rule permanently grandfathers trust preferred securities and other non-qualifying capital instruments that were issued and outstanding as of May 19, 2010 in the Tier 1 capital of bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $15 billion as of December 31, 2009. The rule phases out of Tier 1 capital these non-qualifying capital instruments issued before May 19, 2010 by all other bank holding companies. The final rule also limits a banking organization&#146;s capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a &#147;capital conservation buffer&#148; of 2.5% of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, which is in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The final rule became effective for the Company and our bank subsidiary on January 1, 2015. The capital conservation buffer requirement will be phased in beginning January 1, 2016 and ending January 1, 2019, when the full capital conservation buffer requirement will be effective. As of December 31, 2015, our capital conservation buffer was zero. 

Subsidiary Bank 

General. Our bank subsidiary, Centennial Bank, is chartered as an Arkansas state bank and is a member of the Federal Reserve System, making it primarily subject to regulation and supervision by both the Federal Reserve Board and the Arkansas State Bank Department. In addition, our bank subsidiary is subject to various requirements and restrictions under federal and state law, including requirements to maintain reserves against deposits, restrictions on the types and amounts of loans that may be granted and the interest that they may charge, and limitations on the types of investments they may make and on the types of services they may offer. Various consumer laws and regulations also affect the operations of our bank subsidiary. 

Prompt Corrective Action. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 establishes a system of prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized financial institutions. Under this system, the federal banking regulators have established five capital categories (well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized) in which all institutions are placed. Federal banking regulators are required to take various mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions with respect to institutions in the three undercapitalized categories. The severity of the action depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed. The federal banking agencies have specified by regulation the relevant capital level for each category. 

&#160;

An institution that is categorized as undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to its appropriate federal banking agency. An undercapitalized institution is also generally prohibited from increasing its average total assets, making acquisitions, establishing any branches or engaging in any new line of business, except under an accepted capital restoration plan or with FDIC approval. The regulations also establish procedures for downgrading an institution to a lower capital category based on supervisory factors other than capital. 

The Basel III final rule issued by the federal bank regulatory agencies in July 2013 amended the prompt corrective action rules to incorporate a common equity Tier 1 capital requirement and to raise the capital requirements for certain capital categories. These rules are effective as of January 1, 2015. In order to be adequately capitalized for purposes of the prompt corrective action rules, a banking organization will be required to have at least an 8% total risk-based capital ratio, a 4% Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, a 4.5% common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and a 4% Tier 1 leverage ratio. To be well-capitalized, a banking organization will be required to have at least a 10% total risk-based capital ratio, an 6% Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, a 6.5% common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and a 5% Tier 1 leverage ratio. 

FDIC Insurance and Assessments . Centennial Bank&#146;s deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC&#146;s Deposit Insurance Fund (&#147;DIF&#148;). The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased the deposit coverage limit to $250,000 per depositor retroactive to January 1, 2008. 

The FDIC imposes an assessment against institutions for deposit insurance. This assessment is based primarily on the risk category of the institution and certain risk adjustments specified by the FDIC, with riskier institutions paying higher assessments. 

In October 2010, the FDIC adopted a new restoration program for the DIF to help bolster the DIF reserve ratio to 1.35% by September 30, 2020, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The plan provides that, at least semi-annually, the FDIC will update its loss and income projections for the DIF and, if needed, will increase or decrease assessment rates, following notice-and-comment rulemaking if required. 

On February 7, 2011, the FDIC approved a final rule implementing changes to the deposit insurance assessment system, as authorized by the Dodd-Frank Act, which became effective on April 1, 2011. The final rule, among other things, changed the assessment base for insured depository institutions from adjusted domestic deposits to the institution&#146;s average consolidated total assets during an assessment period less average tangible equity capital (Tier 1 capital) during that period. The rule revised the assessment rate schedule so that it ranges from 2.5 basis points for the least risky institutions to 45 basis points for the riskiest institutions. The rule also suspended indefinitely the requirement of the FDIC to pay dividends from the DIF when it reaches 1.5% of insured deposits. In lieu of the dividends, the FDIC adopted progressively lower assessment rate schedules when the reserve ratio exceeds 1.15%, 2.0% and 2.5%, respectively. 

Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended, the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. 

Community Reinvestment Act . The Community Reinvestment Act requires, in connection with examinations of financial institutions, that federal banking regulators evaluate the record of each financial institution in meeting the credit needs of its local community, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods. These facts are also considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility. Failure to adequately meet these criteria could impose additional requirements and limitations on our bank subsidiary. Additionally, we must publicly disclose the terms of various Community Reinvestment Act-related agreements. Our bank subsidiary received a &#147;satisfactory&#148; CRA rating from the Federal Reserve Bank during its last exam as published in our bank&#146;s CRA Public Evaluation. 

Other Regulations . Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by our bank subsidiary are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. 

&#160;

&#160;

Loans to Insiders. Sections 22(g) and (h) of the Federal Reserve Act and its implementing regulation, Regulation O, place restrictions on loans by a bank to executive officers, directors, and principal stockholders. Under Section 22(h), loans to a director, an executive officer and to a greater than 10% stockholder of a bank and certain of their related interests, or insiders, and insiders of affiliates, may not exceed, together with all other outstanding loans to such person and related interests, the bank&#146;s loans-to-one-borrower limit (generally equal to 15% of the institution&#146;s unimpaired capital and surplus). Section 22(h) also requires that loans to insiders and to insiders of affiliates be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons, unless the loans are made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that (i) is widely available to employees of the bank and (ii) does not give preference to insiders over other employees of the bank. Section 22(h) also requires prior Board of Director&#146;s approval for certain loans, and the aggregate amount of extensions of credit by a bank to all insiders cannot exceed the institution&#146;s unimpaired capital and surplus. Furthermore, Section 22(g) places additional restrictions on loans to executive officers. 

Capital Requirements. Our bank subsidiary is also subject to certain restrictions on the payment of dividends as a result of the requirement that it maintain adequate levels of capital in accordance with guidelines promulgated from time to time by applicable regulators. The regulating agencies consider a bank&#146;s capital levels when taking action on various types of applications and when conducting supervisory activities related to the safety and soundness of individual banks and the banking system. The Federal Reserve Bank monitors the capital adequacy of our bank subsidiary by using a combination of risk-based guidelines and leverage ratios. 

The FDIC Improvement Act. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, or &#147;FDICIA,&#148; made a number of reforms addressing the safety and soundness of the deposit insurance system, supervision of domestic and foreign depository institutions, and improvement of accounting standards. This statute also limited deposit insurance coverage, implemented changes in consumer protection laws and provided for least-cost resolution and prompt regulatory action with regard to troubled institutions. 

FDICIA requires every bank with total assets in excess of $500 million to have an annual independent audit made of the bank&#146;s financial statements by an independent public accountant to verify that the financial statements of the bank are presented fairly and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and comply with such other disclosure requirements as prescribed by the FDIC. FDICIA also places certain restrictions on activities of banks depending on their level of capital. 

The capital classification of a bank affects the frequency of examinations of the bank and impacts the ability of the bank to engage in certain activities and affects the deposit insurance premiums paid by such bank. Under FDICIA, the federal banking regulators are required to conduct a full-scope, on-site examination of every bank at least once every 12 months. 

Brokered Deposits. Under FDICIA, banks may be restricted in their ability to accept brokered deposits, depending on their capital classification. &#147;Well-capitalized&#148; banks are permitted to accept brokered deposits, but all banks that are not well-capitalized are not permitted to accept such deposits. The FDIC may, on a case-by-case basis, permit banks that are adequately capitalized to accept brokered deposits if the FDIC determines that acceptance of such deposits would not constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice with respect to the bank. 

Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Federal Home Loan Bank system, of which our bank subsidiary is a member, consists of regional FHLBs governed and regulated by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, or FHFA. The FHLBs serve as reserve or credit facilities for member institutions within their assigned regions. They are funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB system. They make loans (i.e., advances) to members in accordance with policies and procedures established by the FHLB and the Boards of Directors of each regional FHLB. 

As a system member, our bank subsidiary is entitled to borrow from the FHLB of its region and is required to own a certain amount of capital stock in the FHLB. Our bank subsidiary is in compliance with the stock ownership rules with respect to such advances, commitments and letters of credit and home mortgage loans and similar obligations. All loans, advances and other extensions of credit made by the FHLB to our bank subsidiary are secured by a portion of its respective loan portfolio, certain other investments and the capital stock of the FHLB held by such bank. 

&#160;

Mortgage Banking Operations . Our bank subsidiary is subject to the rules and regulations of FHA, VA, FNMA, FHLMC and GNMA with respect to originating, processing, selling and servicing mortgage loans and the issuance and sale of mortgage-backed securities. Those rules and regulations, among other things, prohibit discrimination and establish underwriting guidelines which include provisions for inspections and appraisals, require credit reports on prospective borrowers and fix maximum loan amounts, and, with respect to VA loans, fix maximum interest rates. Mortgage origination activities are subject to, among others, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Federal Truth-in-Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder which, among other things, prohibit discrimination and require the disclosure of certain basic information to mortgagors concerning credit terms and settlement costs. In addition, our bank subsidiary is subject to the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008, or SAFE Act, and the rules promulgated thereunder which, among other things, require residential mortgage loan originators who are employees of regulated financial institutions to be registered with the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry, a database created by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors and the American Association of Residential Mortgage Regulators to support the licensing of mortgage loan originators by the states. As part of this registration process, mortgage loan originators must furnish the Registry with certain information and fingerprints and undergo a criminal background check. Our bank subsidiary is also subject to regulation by the Arkansas State Bank Department, as applicable, with respect to, among other things, the establishment of maximum origination fees on certain types of mortgage loan products. 

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#147;CFPB&#148;) created by the Dodd-Frank Act took over responsibility for enforcing the principal federal consumer protection laws, such as the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and the Truth in Saving Act, among others, on July 21, 2011. Institutions that have assets of $10 billion or less, such as our bank subsidiary, will continue to be supervised and examined in this area by their primary federal regulators (in the case of our bank subsidiary, the Federal Reserve Board). However, the Dodd-Frank Act gives the CFPB expanded data collecting powers for fair lending purposes for both small business and mortgage loans, as well as expanded authority to prevent unfair, deceptive and abusive practices. 

In January 2013, the CFPB issued a series of final rules related to mortgage loan origination and mortgage loan servicing. In particular, on January 10, 2013, the CFPB issued a final rule implementing the ability-to-repay and qualified mortgage provisions of the Truth in Lending Act, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act (the &#147;QM Rule&#148;). The ability-to-repay provision requires creditors to make reasonable, good faith determinations that borrowers are able to repay their mortgages before extending the credit based on a number of factors and consideration of financial information about the borrower from reasonably reliable third-party documents. The lender is presumed to have satisfied the ability-to-repay requirements if the loan is a &#147;qualified mortgage,&#148; which meets certain requirements related to the loan&#146;s amortization, fees, payment terms and maturity as well as the borrower&#146;s debt-to-income ratio. The QM Rule became effective January 10, 2014. 

Payment of Dividends 

We are a legal entity separate and distinct from our bank subsidiary and other affiliated entities. The principal sources of our cash flow, including cash flow to pay dividends to our stockholders, are dividends that our bank subsidiary pays to us as its sole stockholder. Statutory and regulatory limitations apply to the dividends that our bank subsidiary can pay to us, as well as to the dividends we can pay to our stockholders. 

The policy of the Federal Reserve Board that a bank holding company should serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary bank also results in the position of the Federal Reserve Board that a bank holding company should not maintain a level of cash dividends to its stockholders that places undue pressure on the capital of its bank subsidiary or that can be funded only through additional borrowings or other arrangements that may undermine the bank holding company&#146;s ability to serve as such a source of strength. Our ability to pay dividends is also subject to the provisions of Arkansas law. 

&#160;

There are certain state-law limitations on the payment of dividends by our bank subsidiary. Centennial Bank, which is subject to Arkansas banking laws, may not declare or pay a dividend of 75% or more of the net profits of such bank after all taxes for the current year plus 75% of the retained net profits for the immediately preceding year without the prior approval of the Arkansas State Bank Commissioner. Members of the Federal Reserve System must also comply with the dividend restrictions with which a national bank would be required to comply. Among other things, these restrictions require that if losses have at any time been sustained by a bank equal to or exceeding its undivided profits then on hand, no dividend may be paid. Although we have regularly paid dividends on our common stock beginning with the second quarter of 2003, there can be no assurances that we will be able to pay dividends in the future under the applicable regulatory limitations. 

The payment of dividends by us, or by our bank subsidiary, may also be affected by other factors, such as the requirement to maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines. The federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institution&#146;s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. Under FDICIA, a depository institution may not pay any dividend if payment would result in the depository institution being undercapitalized. 

Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates 

We and our bank subsidiary are subject to Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. In general, Section 23A imposes limits on the amount of transactions between the bank and its affiliates, and also requires certain levels of collateral for loans to affiliated parties. It also limits the amount of advances to affiliates which are collateralized by the securities or obligations of the bank or its nonbanking affiliates. An affiliate of a bank is generally any company or entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the bank. 

Affiliate transactions are also subject to Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act which generally requires that certain other transactions between the bank and its affiliates be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank, as those prevailing at that time for comparable transactions with or involving other non-affiliated persons. 

The restrictions on loans to directors, executive officers, principal stockholders and their related interests (collectively, the &#147;insiders&#148;) contained in Sections 22(g) and (h) of the Federal Reserve Act and in its implementing regulation, Regulation O, also apply to all insured institutions and their subsidiaries and holding companies. Insiders are subject to enforcement actions for knowingly accepting loans in violation of applicable restrictions. 

Heightened Requirements for Bank Holding Companies with $10 Billion or More in Assets 

Various federal banking laws and regulations, including rules adopted by the Federal Reserve pursuant to the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act, impose heightened requirements on certain large banks and bank holding companies. Most of these rules apply primarily to bank holding companies with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets, but certain rules also apply to banks and bank holding companies with at least $10 billion in total consolidated assets. Following the fourth consecutive quarter (and any applicable phase-in period) where our or our bank subsidiary&#146;s total consolidated assets, as applicable, equal or exceed $10 billion, we or our bank subsidiary, as applicable, will, among other requirements: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; be required to perform annual stress tests as follows: In October 2012, as required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC published final rules regarding company-run stress testing. These rules require bank holding companies and banks with average total consolidated assets greater than $10 billion to conduct an annual company-run stress test of capital, consolidated earnings and losses under one base and at least two stress scenarios provided by the federal bank regulators. Neither we nor our bank subsidiary is currently subject to the stress testing requirements, but we expect that once we are subject to those requirements, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the Arkansas State Bank Department will consider our results as an important factor in evaluating our capital adequacy, and that of our bank subsidiary, in evaluating any proposed acquisitions and in determining whether any proposed dividends or stock repurchases by us or by our bank subsidiary may be an unsafe or unsound practice; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; be required to establish a dedicated risk committee of our board of directors responsible for overseeing our enterprise-wide risk management policies, which must be commensurate with our capital structure, risk profile, complexity, activities, size and other appropriate risk-related factors, and including as a member at least one risk management expert; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; calculate our FDIC deposit assessment base using the performance score and a loss-severity score system as follows: For institutions with $10 billion or more in assets, the FDIC uses a performance score and a loss-severity score that are used to calculate an initial assessment rate. In calculating these scores, the FDIC uses a bank&#146;s capital level and regulatory supervisory ratings and certain financial measures to assess an institution&#146;s ability to withstand asset-related stress and funding-related stress. The FDIC also has the ability to make discretionary adjustments to the total score based upon significant risk factors that are not adequately captured in the calculations. In addition to ordinary assessments described above, the FDIC has the ability to impose special assessments in certain instances; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; be examined for compliance with federal consumer protection laws primarily by the CFPB. Beginning on July 1 of the calendar year following the year in which our total consolidated assets pass the $10 billion threshold, we will also become subject to the so-called Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act relating to debit card interchange fees, called &#147;swipe fees.&#148; Under the Durbin Amendment and the Federal Reserve&#146;s implementing regulations, bank issuers who are not exempt may only receive an interchange fee from merchants that is reasonable and proportional to the cost of clearing the transaction. The maximum permissible interchange fee is equal to no more than 21 cents plus 5 basis points of the transaction value for many types of debit interchange transactions. A debit card issuer may also recover 1 cent per transaction for fraud prevention purposes if the issuer complies with certain fraud-related requirements required by the Federal Reserve. In addition, the Federal Reserve has rules governing routing and exclusivity that require issuers to offer two unaffiliated networks for routing transactions on each debit or prepaid product. Currently, we are exempt from the Durbin Amendment&#146;s limitations on interchange fees because we and our bank subsidiary have total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion. 

While neither we nor our bank subsidiary are currently subject to the above requirements, we have begun analyzing these rules to ensure we are prepared to comply with the rules if and when they become applicable to us. We believe they could become applicable to us as early as 2017. 

Incentive Compensation 

The Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal bank regulators and the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;SEC&#148;) to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least $1 billion in total assets that encourage inappropriate risks by providing an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits or that could lead to material financial loss to the entity. In addition, these regulators must establish regulations or guidelines requiring enhanced disclosure to regulators of incentive-based compensation arrangements. 

In June 2010, the Federal Reserve and FDIC issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization&#146;s incentive compensation arrangements should (1) provide incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk, (2) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management and (3) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization&#146;s board of directors. 

&#160;

In April 2011, the Federal Reserve, other federal banking agencies and the SEC jointly published proposed rulemaking designed to implement the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act prohibiting incentive compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking at a covered institution, which includes a bank or bank holding company with $1 billion or more of assets, such as the Company and our bank subsidiary. The proposed joint compensation regulations would require compensation practices consistent with the three principles discussed above. As of February 1, 2016, these regulations have not been finalized. Unless and until a final rule is adopted, we cannot fully determine whether compliance with such a rule will adversely affect the Company&#146;s or our bank subsidiary&#146;s ability to hire, retain and motivate our key employees. 

The Volcker Rule 

The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring hedge funds and private equity funds. The statutory provision is commonly called the &#147;Volcker Rule.&#148; In December 2013, federal regulators adopted final rules to implement the Volcker Rule that became effective in April 2014. The Federal Reserve, however, issued an order extending the period that institutions have to conform their activities to the requirements of the Volcker Rule to July 21, 2015. In addition, the Federal Reserve recently granted an additional extension until July 21, 2016 of the conformance period for banking entities to conform investments in and relationships with covered funds that were in place prior to December 31, 2013, and announced its intention to further extend this aspect of the conformance period until July 21, 2017. Banks with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, such as our bank, that do not engage in any covered activities, other than trading in certain government, agency, state or municipal obligations, do not have any significant compliance obligations under the rules implementing the Volcker Rule. We are continuing to evaluate the effects of the Volcker Rule on our business, but we do not currently anticipate that the Volcker Rule will have a material effect on our operations. 

Privacy 

Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, financial institutions are required to disclose their policies for collecting and protecting confidential information. Customers generally may prevent financial institutions from sharing nonpublic personal financial information with nonaffiliated third parties except under narrow circumstances, such as the processing of transactions requested by the consumer or when the financial institution is jointly sponsoring a product or service with a nonaffiliated third party. Additionally, financial institutions generally may not disclose consumer account numbers to any nonaffiliated third party for use in telemarketing, direct mail marketing or other marketing to consumers. We and our subsidiary have established policies and procedures to assure our compliance with all privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. 

Anti-Terrorism and Money Laundering Legislation 

Our bank subsidiary is subject to the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the &#147;USA PATRIOT Act&#148;), the Bank Secrecy Act and rules and regulations of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (the &#147;OFAC&#148;). These statutes and related rules and regulations impose requirements and limitations on specific financial transactions and account relationships intended to guard against money laundering and terrorism financing. Our bank subsidiary has established a customer identification program pursuant to Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act and the Bank Secrecy Act, and otherwise has implemented policies and procedures intended to comply with the foregoing rules. 

Proposed Legislation and Regulatory Action 

New regulations and statutes are regularly proposed that contain wide-ranging proposals for altering the structures, regulations and competitive relationships of financial institutions operating and doing business in the United States. We cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed regulation or statute will be adopted or the extent to which our business may be affected by any new regulation or statute. 

&#160;

Effect of Governmental Monetary Polices 

Our earnings are affected by domestic economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government and its agencies. The Federal Reserve Board&#146;s monetary policies have had, and are likely to continue to have, an important impact on the operating results of commercial banks through its power to implement national monetary policy in order, among other things, to curb inflation or combat a recession. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board affect the levels of bank loans, investments and deposits through its control over the issuance of United States government securities, its regulation of the discount rate applicable to banks and its influence over reserve requirements to which banks are subject. We cannot predict the nature or impact of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies.
