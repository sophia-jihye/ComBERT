 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY 

&#160; 

Overview and History 

&#160;

Our company, The First Bancshares, Inc. (&#8220;Company&#8221;) was incorporated on June 23, 1995 to serve as a bank holding company for The First, A National Banking Association (&#8220;The First&#8221;), headquartered in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. The First began operations on August 5, 1996 from our main office in the Oak Grove community, which is now included within the city of Hattiesburg. At year end, the First had 27 branches, one motor bank facility and four loan production offices in the states of Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana.

&#160;

We exited the recent recession with strong asset quality metrics compared to most of our peers, which we believe illustrates our historically disciplined underwriting and credit culture. As such, we benefited from our strength by taking advantage of growth opportunities when many of our peers were unable to do so. Since that time, we focused on growing earnings per share and increasing our tangible common equity and tangible book value per share. In addition, we returned to strong levels of loan growth by continuing to strengthen our relationships with existing clients and creating new relationships.

&#160;

In April 2013, we completed our first post-recession acquisition with the purchase of First National Bank of Baldwin County, which resulted in our strategic entry into the south Alabama market. Then in July 2014 we completed our acquisition of Bay Bank, previously headquartered in Mobile, Alabama. The conversion and integration of these acquisitions have been successful to date, and we are optimistic that this market will continue to contribute to our future growth and success. Also in 2014 we established a de novo branch in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and a loan production office in Slidell, Louisiana.

&#160;

We believe we are well-positioned to benefit from the post-Katrina rebuilding efforts along the Gulf Coast. In September 2011 we completed the purchase of eight branches required to be divested by another financial institution. Seven of these branches were located along the Mississippi Gulf Coast and one was in Louisiana.

&#160;

Our principal executive offices are located at 6480 U.S. Highway 98 West, Hattiesburg, Mississippi 39402, and our telephone number is (601) 268-8998. As of March 17, 2016, we had 295 full-time employees and 10 part-time employees.

&#160;

Market Areas and Recent Developments 

&#160;

In Mississippi, we serve the cities of Hattiesburg, Laurel, Purvis, Picayune, Pascagoula, Bay St. Louis, Wiggins, Gulfport, Biloxi, Long Beach, Diamondhead, and the surrounding areas of Lamar, Forrest, Jones, Pearl River, Jackson, Hancock, Stone and Harrison Counties. On December 14, 2015, we completed our acquisition of The Mortgage Connection, which included two loan production offices in Madison and Brandon, Mississippi. In Louisiana, we serve the city of Bogalusa in Washington Parish and Baton Rouge in East Baton Rouge Parish. As a result of the acquisitions of First National Bank of Baldwin County in 2013 and Bay Bank in 2014, we now serve the Baldwin County and Mobile County, Alabama markets with branches in the following cities: Foley, Daphne, Fairhope, Gulf Shores, Orange Beach, Mobile, Dauphin Island and Theodore. In total, The First operates 17 branches in Mississippi, 2 in Louisiana and 9 in Alabama. In addition, The First operates loan production offices in Bay Minette, Alabama, Slidell, Louisiana, and in Madison and Brandon, Mississippi.

Banking Services 

&#160; 

We strive to provide our customers with the breadth of products and services offered by large regional banks, while maintaining the timely response and personal service of a locally owned and managed bank. In addition to offering a full range of deposit services and commercial and personal loans, we have a mortgage division. The following is a description of the products and services we offer.

&#160; 

Deposit Services . We offer a full range of deposit services that are typically available in most banks and savings and loan associations, including checking accounts, NOW accounts, savings accounts, and other time deposits of various types, ranging from daily money market accounts to longer-term certificates of deposit. The transaction accounts and time certificates are tailored to our principal market area at rates competitive to those offered by other banks in the area. All deposit accounts are insured by the FDIC up to the maximum amount allowed by law. We solicit these accounts from individuals, businesses, associations and organizations, and governmental authorities. In addition, we offer certain retirement account services, such as Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs).

&#160; 

Loan Products . We offer a full range of commercial and personal loans. Commercial loans include both secured and unsecured loans for working capital (including loans secured by inventory and accounts receivable), business expansion (including acquisition of real estate and improvements), and purchase of equipment and machinery. Consumer loans include equity lines of credit and secured and unsecured loans for financing automobiles, home improvements, education, and personal investments. We also make real estate construction and acquisition loans. Our lending activities are subject to a variety of lending limits imposed by federal law. While differing limits apply in certain circumstances based on the type of loan or the nature of the borrower (including the borrower's relationship to the bank), in general we are subject to a loans-to-one-borrower limit of an amount equal to 15% of our unimpaired capital and surplus.

&#160; 

Mortgage Loan Division . We have a mortgage loan division which originates loans to purchase existing or construct new homes and to refinance existing mortgages.

&#160; 

Private Banking Division. We have a Private Banking Division, which offers financial services and wealth management services to individuals who meet certain criteria.

&#160; 

Other Services . Other bank services we offer include on-line internet banking services, voice response telephone inquiry service, commercial sweep accounts, cash management services, safe deposit boxes, travelers checks, direct deposit of payroll and social security checks, and automatic drafts for various accounts. We are associated with the Interlink, Plus, Pulse, Star, and Community Cash networks of automated teller machines that may be used by our customers throughout our market area and other regions. The First also offers VISA and MasterCard credit card services through a correspondent bank.

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160;

Our banking subsidiary The First generally competes with other financial institutions through the selection of banking products and services offered, the pricing of services, the level of service provided, the convenience and availability of services, and the degree of expertise and the personal manner in which services are offered. State law permits statewide branching by banks and savings institutions, and many financial institutions in our market area have branch networks. Consequently, commercial banking in Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana is highly competitive. Many large banking organizations currently operate in our market area, several of which are controlled by out-of-state ownership. In addition, competition between commercial banks and thrift institutions (savings institutions and credit unions) has been intensified significantly by the elimination of many previous distinctions between the various types of financial institutions and the expanded powers and increased activity of thrift institutions in areas of banking which previously had been the sole domain of commercial banks. Federal legislation, together with other regulatory changes by the primary regulators of the various financial institutions, has resulted in the almost total elimination of practical distinctions between a commercial bank and a thrift institution. Consequently, competition among financial institutions of all types is largely unlimited with respect to legal ability and authority to provide most financial services. Currently there are numerous other commercial banks, savings institutions, and credit unions operating in The First's primary service area.

&#160;

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We face increased competition from both federally-chartered and state-chartered financial and thrift institutions, as well as credit unions, consumer finance companies, insurance companies, and other institutions in the Company's market area. Some of these competitors are not subject to the same degree of regulation and restriction imposed upon the Company. Many of these competitors also have broader geographic markets and substantially greater resources and lending limits than the Company and offer certain services such as trust banking that the Company does not currently provide. In addition, many of these competitors have numerous branch offices located throughout the extended market areas of the Company that may provide these competitors with an advantage in geographic convenience that the Company does not have at present.

&#160;

We also compete with numerous financial and quasi-financial institutions for deposits and loans, including providers of financial services over the internet. Recent technology advances and other changes have allowed parties to effectuate financial transactions that previously required the involvement of banks. For example, consumers can maintain funds in brokerage accounts or mutual funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as &#8220;disintermediation,&#8221; could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. 

&#160;

Available Information 

&#160;

We make available free of charge, on or through our website www.thefirstbank.com , our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and other filings pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and amendments to such filings, as soon as reasonably practicable after each is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.

&#160;

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 

&#160;

The Company and The First are subject to state and federal banking laws and regulations which impose specific requirements or restrictions on and provide for general regulatory oversight with respect to virtually all aspects of our operations. These laws and regulations are generally intended to protect depositors, not shareholders. To the extent that the following summary describes statutory or regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions. Any change in applicable laws or regulations may have a material effect on the business and prospects of the Company. Beginning with the enactment of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 and following with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (&#34;FDICIA&#34;), and now most recently the sweeping Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;), numerous additional regulatory requirements have been placed on the banking industry in the past several years, and additional changes have been proposed. The operations of the Company and The First may be affected by legislative changes and the policies of various regulatory authorities. We are unable to predict the nature or the extent of the effect on our business and earnings that fiscal or monetary policies, economic control, or new federal or state legislation may have in the future.

&#160;

Bank Holding Company Regulation 

&#160;

The Company is subject to extensive regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;) pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the &#8220;Bank Holding Company Act&#8221;). The Company is also required to file certain reports with, and otherwise comply with the rules and regulations of the SEC under federal securities laws.

&#160;

Federal Regulation 

&#160;

The Company is registered with the Federal Reserve as a bank holding company and has elected to be treated as a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act. As such, the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to the supervision, examination and reporting requirements of the Bank Holding Company Act and the regulations of the Federal Reserve.

&#160;

The Bank Holding Company Act generally prohibits a corporation that owns a federally insured financial institution (&#8220;bank&#8221;) from engaging in activities other than banking, managing or controlling banks or other subsidiaries engaging in permissible activities. Also prohibited is acquiring or obtaining control of more than 5% of the voting interests of any company that engages in activities other than those activities determined by the Federal Reserve to be so closely related to banking, managing or controlling banks as to be proper incident thereto. In determining whether a particular activity is permissible, the Federal Reserve considers whether the performance of the activity can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public that outweigh possible adverse effects. Examples of activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be permissible are making, acquiring or servicing loans; leasing personal property; providing certain investment or financial advice; performing certain data processing services; acting as agent or broker in selling credit life insurance; and performing certain insurance underwriting activities. The Bank Holding Company Act does not place territorial limits on permissible bank-related activities of bank holding companies. Even with respect to permissible activities, however, the Federal Reserve has the power to order a holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or its control of any subsidiary when the Federal Reserve has reasonable cause to believe that continuation of such activity or control of such subsidiary would pose a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of any bank subsidiary of that holding company. The Bank Holding Company Act requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before it: (1) acquires ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if, after such acquisition, such bank holding company will own or control more than 5% of the voting shares of such bank, (2) or any of its non-bank subsidiaries acquire all of the assets of a bank, (3) merges with any other bank holding company, or (4) engages in permissible non-banking activities. In reviewing a proposed covered acquisition, the Federal Reserve considers a bank holding company&#8217;s financial, managerial and competitive posture. The future prospects of the companies and banks concerned and the convenience and needs of the community to be served are also considered. The Federal Reserve also reviews the indebtedness to be incurred by a bank holding company in connection with the proposed acquisition to ensure that the bank holding company can service such indebtedness without adversely affecting its ability, and the ability of its subsidiaries, to meet their respective regulatory capital requirements. The Bank Holding Company Act further requires that consummation of approved bank holding company or bank acquisitions or mergers must be delayed for a period of not less than 15 or more than 30 days following the date of Federal Reserve approval. During such 15 to 30-day period, the Department of Justice has the right to review the competitive aspects of the proposed transaction. The Department of Justice may file a lawsuit with the relevant United States Court of Appeals seeking an injunction against the proposed acquisition.

&#160;

As described above, the prior approval of the Federal Reserve must be obtained before the Company may acquire substantially all of the assets of any bank, or ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank, if, after such acquisition, it would own or control, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of the voting shares of such bank. The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (the &#8220;Riegle-Neal Act&#8221;) permits adequately capitalized and managed bank holding companies to acquire control of banks in any state, subject to federal regulatory approval, without regard to whether such a transaction is prohibited by the laws of any state. The Riegle-Neal Act further provides that a bank holding company may not, following an interstate acquisition, control more than 10% of nationwide insured deposits or 30% of deposits within any state in which the acquiring bank operates. States have the right to adopt legislation to lower the 30% limit, although no states within the Company&#8217;s current market area have done so. Additional provisions require that interstate activities conform to the Community Reinvestment Act, which is intended to encourage depository institutions to help meet the credit needs of the communities in which they operate, including low-and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound operations.

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) authorizes national and state banks to establish de novo branches in other states to the same extent a bank chartered in those states would be so permitted.

&#160;

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the &#8220;Financial Services Modernization Act&#8221;) established a comprehensive framework that permits affiliations among qualified bank holding companies, commercial banks, insurance companies, securities firms, and other financial service providers by revising and expanding the Bank Holding Company Act framework to permit a holding company to engage in a full range of financial activities through a financial holding company.

&#160;

Capital Requirements 

&#160;

General Risk-Based and Leverage-Based Capital Requirements 

&#160;

The Federal Reserve has adopted capital adequacy guidelines for use in its examination and regulation of bank holding companies and financial holding companies. The regulatory capital of a bank holding company or financial holding company under applicable federal capital adequacy guidelines is particularly important in the Federal Reserve&#8217;s evaluation of the overall safety and soundness of the bank holding company or financial holding company and are important factors considered by the Federal Reserve in evaluating any applications made by such holding company to the Federal Reserve. If regulatory capital falls below minimum guideline levels, a financial holding company may lose its status as a financial holding company and a bank holding company or bank may be denied approval to acquire or establish additional banks or non-bank businesses or to open additional facilities. Additionally, each bank subsidiary of a financial holding company as well as the holding company itself must be well capitalized and well managed as determined by the subsidiary bank&#8217;s primary federal regulator, which in the case of The First, is the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the &#8220;OCC&#8221;). To be considered well managed, the bank and holding company must have received at least a satisfactory composite rating and a satisfactory management rating at its most recent examination. The Federal Reserve rates bank holding companies through a confidential component and composite 1-5 rating system, with a composite rating of 1 being the highest rating and 5 being the lowest. This system is designed to help identify institutions requiring special attention. Financial institutions are assigned ratings based on evaluation and rating of their financial condition and operations. Components reviewed include capital adequacy, asset quality, management capability, the quality and level of earnings, the adequacy of liquidity and sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations. As of December 31, 2015, the Company and The First were both well capitalized and well managed.

&#160;

A financial holding company that becomes aware that it or a subsidiary bank has ceased to be well capitalized or well managed must notify the Federal Reserve and enter into an agreement to cure the identified deficiency. If the deficiency is not cured timely, the Federal Reserve Board may order the financial holding company to divest its banking operations. Alternatively, to avoid divestiture, a financial holding company may cease to engage in the financial holding company activities that are unrelated to banking or otherwise impermissible for a bank holding company.

&#160;

Below are measures of regulatory capital applicable to holding companies in 2015.

&#160;

&#160; &#160; Minimum &#160; &#160; Company at 12/31/2015 &#160; Tier 1 leverage capital ratio &#160; &#160; 4.00 % &#160; &#160; 8.66 % Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio &#160; &#160; 4.50 % &#160; &#160; 8.10 % Tier 1 capital ratio &#160; &#160; 6.00 % &#160; &#160; 11.09 % Total risk-based capital (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) &#160; &#160; 8.00 % &#160; &#160; 11.86 % &#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The essential difference between the leverage capital ratio and the risk-based capital ratios is that the latter identify and weight both balance sheet and off-balance sheet risks. Tier 1 capital generally includes common equity, retained earnings, qualifying minority interests (issued by consolidated depository institutions or foreign bank subsidiaries), accounts of consolidated subsidiaries and an amount of qualifying perpetual preferred stock, limited to 50% of Tier 1 capital. In calculating Tier 1 capital, goodwill and other disallowed intangibles and disallowed deferred tax assets and certain other assets are excluded. Tier 2 capital is a secondary component of risk-based capital, consisting primarily of perpetual preferred stock that may not be included as Tier 1 capital, mandatory convertible securities, certain types of subordinated debt and an amount of the allowance for loan losses (limited to 1.25% of risk weighted assets).

&#160;

The risk-based capital guidelines are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banks and bank holding companies, to take into account off-balance sheet exposure and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets. Under the risk-based capital guidelines, assets are assigned to one of four risk categories: 0%, 20%, 50% and 100%. For example, U.S. Treasury securities are assigned to the 0% risk category while most categories of loans are assigned to the 100% risk category. Off-balance sheet exposures such as standby letters of credit are risk-weighted and all or a portion thereof are included in risk-weighted assets based on an assessment of the relative risks that they present. The risk-weighted asset base is equal to the sum of the aggregate dollar values of assets and off-balance sheet items in each risk category, multiplied by the weight assigned to that category.

&#160;

Basel III Capital Requirements Effective January 1, 2015 

&#160; 

On July 2, 2013, the Company&#8217;s and The First&#8217;s primary federal regulators&#8212;the Federal Reserve Board and the OCC&#8212;adopted final rules implementing the Basel III framework, which substantially revises the leverage and risk-based capital requirements currently applicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions. These final rules are based on international capital accords of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the &#8220;Basel Committee&#8221;).

&#160;

The new rules address both the components of capital and other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions&#8217; regulatory capital ratios, as well as the risk weights and other issues affecting the denominator, replacing the existing Basel I-derived risk weighting approach with a more risk-sensitive approach based, in part, on the standardized approach in the Basel Committee&#8217;s 2004 &#8220;Basel II&#8221; capital accords. Regarding the denominator, under the final rules, the Company, among other items, will be required to increase the risk weights applied to certain high volatility commercial real estate loans and to certain loans past due. Additionally, the Company will be required to risk weight at 20% the conversion factors for commitments with an original maturity of one year or less that are not unconditionally cancellable at any time. Regarding the numerator under the final rules, NOLs and tax credits carried forward will be deducted from Tier 1 capital. Additionally, there are deductions and adjustments to capital for goodwill and other intangibles as well as deductions and adjustments to capital by the amount that the carrying value of certain assets exceeds 10% of capital. Examples of these assets are deferred tax assets, mortgage servicing rights, significant investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries, investments in certain capital instruments of financial entities and unrealized gains on cash flow hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive income arising from hedges not carried at fair market value on the balance sheet. Under the final rules, some banks, including The First, are given a one-time &#8220;opt out&#8221; in which they may elect to filter certain volatile accumulated other comprehensive income (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;) components from inclusion in regulatory capital. The AOCI opt-out election must be made on the institution&#8217;s first Call Report, FR Y-9C or FR Y-9SP, as applicable, filed after January 1, 2015. The Company and The First elected to opt out.

&#160;

The final rules established a new category of capital measure, Common Equity Tier 1 capital, which includes a limited number of capital instruments from the existing definition of Tier 1 Capital, as well as raised minimum thresholds for Tier 1 Leverage capital (100 basis points), and Tier 1 Risk-based capital (200 basis points). Additionally, the final rules introduced a capital conservation buffer of Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 Risk-based and Total Risk-based capital ratios above the minimum risk-based capital requirements. The buffer must be maintained to avoid limitations on capital distributions and limitations on discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. Each of the minimum capital ratios takes effect in 2015, with the capital conservation buffer set to be phased in beginning in 2016 and implemented in full by 2019. Based on estimated capital ratios using Basel III definitions, the Company and The First currently exceed all capital requirements of the new rule, including the fully phased-in conservation buffer.

Federal Reserve Oversight 

&#160;

The Company is required to give the Federal Reserve prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the Company&#8217;s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve may disapprove such a transaction if it determines that the proposed redemption or stock purchase would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice, would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve order or directive or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve.

&#160;

The Federal Reserve has issued its &#8220;Policy Statement on Cash Dividends Not Fully Covered by Earnings (the &#8220;Policy Statement&#8221;) which sets forth various guidelines that the Federal Reserve believes a bank holding company should follow in establishing its dividend policy. In general, the Federal Reserve stated that bank holding companies should pay dividends only out of current earnings. The Federal Reserve also stated that dividends should not be paid unless the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with its capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition.

&#160;

The Company is required to file annual and quarterly reports with the Federal Reserve, and such additional information as the Federal Reserve may require pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act. The Federal Reserve may examine a bank holding company or any of its subsidiaries.

&#160;

Additional Federal Regulatory Issues 

&#160;

In June 2010, the federal banking agencies issued joint guidance on executive compensation designed to help ensure that a banking organization&#8217;s incentive compensation policies do not encourage imprudent risk taking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of the organization. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act requires those agencies, along with the Commission, to adopt rules to require reporting of incentive compensation and to prohibit certain compensation arrangements. The federal banking agencies and the Commission proposed such rules in April 2011. In addition, in June 2012, the Commission issued final rules to implement the Dodd-Frank Act&#8217;s requirement that the Commission direct the national securities exchanges to adopt certain listing standards related to the compensation committee of a company&#8217;s board of directors as well as its compensation advisers.

&#160;

The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from The First. There are various restrictions that limit the ability of The First to finance, pay dividends or otherwise supply funds to the Company or other affiliates. In addition, subsidiary banks of holding companies are subject to certain restrictions under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act on any extension of credit to the bank holding company or any of its subsidiaries, on investments in the stock or other securities thereof and on the taking of such stock or securities as collateral for loans to any borrower. Further, a bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with extensions of credit, leases or sales of property, or furnishing of services.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Stress Testing 

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Act requires stress testing of certain bank holding companies and banks that have more than $10 billion but less than $50 billion of consolidated assets (&#8220;medium-sized companies&#8221;). Additional stress testing is required for banking organizations having $50 billion or more of assets. Because the consolidated assets of the Company and The First are less than these threshold levels, the stress test requirements are not applicable to the Company or to The First at present.

&#160;

Company Participation in Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives 

&#160;

The Congress, Treasury Department and the federal banking regulators, including the FDIC, have taken broad action since early September 2008 to address volatility in the U.S. banking system. In October 2008, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (&#8220;EESA&#8221;) was enacted. The EESA authorized the Treasury Department to purchase from financial institutions and their holding companies up to $700 billion in mortgage loans, mortgage-related securities and certain other financial instruments, including debt and equity securities issued by financial institutions and their holding companies in a troubled asset relief program (&#8220;TARP&#8221;). The purpose of TARP was to restore confidence and stability to the U.S. banking system and to encourage financial institutions to increase their lending to customers and to each other. The Treasury Department allocated $250 billion towards the TARP Capital Purchase Program (&#8220;CPP&#8221;), pursuant to which the Treasury Department purchased debt or equity securities from participating institutions. The TARP also included the Community Development Capital Initiative (&#8220;CDCI&#8221;), which was made available only to certified Community Development Financial Institutions (&#8220;CDFIs&#8221;) and imposed a lower dividend or interest rate, as applicable, than the CPP funding. Participants in the TARP are subject to executive compensation limits and are encouraged to expand their lending and mortgage loan modifications.

&#160;

On February 6, 2009, as part of the CPP, the Company entered into a Letter Agreement and Securities Purchase Agreement (collectively, the &#8220;Purchase Agreement&#8221;) with the Treasury Department, pursuant to which the Company sold (i) 5,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series UST (the &#8220;CPP Preferred Stock&#8221;) and (ii) a warrant (the &#8220;Warrant&#8221;) to purchase 54,705 shares of the Company&#8217;s Common Stock for an exercise price of $13.71 per share. On September 29, 2010, after successfully obtaining CDFI certification, the Company exited the CPP by refinancing its CPP funding into lower-cost CDCI funding and also accepted additional CDCI funding. In connection with this transaction, the Company retired its CPP Preferred Stock and issued to the Treasury Department 17,123 shares of the Company&#8217;s Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series CD (the &#8220;CDCI Preferred Stock&#8221;). Including refinanced funding and newly obtained funding, the Company&#8217;s total CDCI funding is $17,123,000.

&#160;

The CDCI Preferred Stock qualifies as Tier 1 capital and, provided that the Company maintains its CDFI eligibility and certification, is entitled to cumulative dividends at a rate of 2% per annum until 2018, and 9% per annum thereafter. The Warrant has a 10-year term and is immediately exercisable upon its issuance, and its exercise price is subject to anti-dilution adjustments.

&#160;

In order to benefit from the lower dividend rate associated with the CDCI Preferred Stock, the Company is required to maintain compliance with the eligibility requirements of the CDFI Program. These eligibility requirements include the following:

&#160;

&#183; The Company must have a primary mission of promoting community development, based on criteria set forth in 12 C.F.R. 1805.201(b)(1); &#160;

&#183; The Company must provide Financial Products, Development Services, and/or other similar financing as a predominant business activity in arm&#8217;s-length transactions, as provided in 12 C.F.R. 1805.201(b)(2); &#160;

&#183; The Company must serve a Target Market by serving one or more Investment Areas and/or Targeted Populations, substantially in the manner set forth in 12 C.F.R. 1805.201(b)(3); &#160;

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; The Company must provide Development Services in conjunction with its Financial Products, either directly, through an Affiliate, or through a contract with a third-party provider, as provided in 12 C.F.R. 1805.201(b)(4); &#160;

&#183; The Company must maintain accountability to residents of the applicable Investment Area(s) and/or Targeted Population(s) through representation on its governing Board of Directors or otherwise, as provided in 12 C.F.R. 1805.201(b)(5); and &#160;

&#183; The Company must remain a non-governmental entity which is not an agency or instrumentality of the United States of America, or any State or political subdivision thereof, as described in 12 C.F.R. 1805.201(b)(6) and within the meaning of any supplemental regulations or interpretations of 12 C.F.R. 1805.201(b)(6) or such supplemental regulations published by the Fund. &#160;

As used in the discussion above, the terms &#8220;Affiliate,&#8221; &#8220;Financial Products,&#8221; &#8220;Development Services,&#8221; &#8220;Target Market,&#8221; &#8220;Investment Area(s),&#8221; and &#8220;Targeted Population(s)&#8221; have the meanings ascribed to such terms in 12 C.F.R. 1805.104.

&#160;

American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009. The America Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009 (&#8220;ARRA&#8221;) contained expansive new restrictions on executive compensation for financial institutions and other companies participating in the TARP. These restrictions apply to us and are further detailed in implementing regulations found at 31 CFR Part 30. (Any reference to &#8220;ARRA&#8221; herein includes a reference to the implementing regulations.)

&#160;

ARRA prohibits bonus and similar payments to the most highly compensated employee of the Company. The prohibition does not apply to bonuses payable pursuant to &#8220;employment agreements&#8221; in effect prior to February 11, 2009. &#8220;Long-term&#8221; restricted stock is excluded from ARRA&#8217;s bonus prohibition, but only to the extent the value of the stock does not exceed one-third of the total amount of annual compensation of the employee receiving the stock, the stock does not &#8220;fully vest&#8221; until after all TARP-related obligations have been satisfied, and any other conditions which the Treasury may specify have been met.

&#160;

ARRA prohibits any payment to the principal executive officer, the principal financial officer, and any of the next eight most highly compensated employees upon departure from the Company for any reason for as long as any TARP-related obligations remain outstanding.

&#160;

Under ARRA TARP-participating companies are required to recover any bonus or other incentive payment paid to the principal executive officer, the principal financial officer, or any of the next 23 most highly compensated employees on the basis of materially inaccurate financial or other performance criteria.

&#160;

ARRA prohibits TARP participants from implementing any compensation plan that would encourage manipulation of the reported earnings of the Company in order to enhance the compensation of any of its employees.

&#160;

ARRA requires the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of any publicly-traded TARP-participating company to provide a written certification of compliance with the executive compensation restrictions in ARRA in the Company&#8217;s annual filings with the SEC beginning in 2010.

&#160;

ARRA requires each TARP-participating company to implement a company-wide policy regarding excessive or luxury expenditures, including excessive expenditures on entertainment or events, office and facility renovations, aviation or other transportation services.

&#160;

ARRA directs the Treasury to review bonuses, retention awards, and other compensation paid to the principal executive officer and the next four other highest paid executive officer of the Company and the next 20 most highly compensated employees of each company receiving TARP assistance before ARRA was enacted, and to &#8220;seek to negotiate&#8221; with the TARP recipient and affected employees for reimbursement if it finds any such payments were inconsistent with TARP or otherwise in conflict with the public interest.

&#160;

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

ARRA also prohibits the payment of tax gross-ups; required disclosures related to perquisite payments and the engagement, if any, by the TARP participant of a compensation consultant; and prohibits the deduction for tax purposes of executive compensation in excess of $500,000 for each applicable senior executive.

&#160;

These standards could change based on subsequent guidance issued by the Treasury or the Internal Revenue Service. As long as the Treasury continues to hold equity interests in the Company issued under the TARP, the Company will monitor its compensation arrangements and modify such compensation arrangements, agree to limit and limit its compensation deductions, and take such other actions as may be necessary to comply with the standards discussed above, as they may be modified from time to time. We do not anticipate that any material changes to the Company&#8217;s existing executive compensation structure will be required to comply with the executive compensation standards included in the TARP.

&#160; 

The First, A National Banking Association 

&#160;

The First operates as a national banking association incorporated under the laws of the United States and subject to examination by the OCC. Deposits in The First are insured by the FDIC up to a maximum amount (generally $250,000 per depositor, subject to aggregation rules). The OCC and the FDIC regulate or monitor virtually all areas of The First&#8217;s operations, including security devices and procedures, adequacy of capitalization and loan loss reserves, loans, investments, borrowings, deposits, mergers, issuances of securities, payment of dividends, interest rates payable on deposits, interest rates or fees chargeable on loans, establishment of branches, corporate reorganizations, maintenance of books and records, and adequacy of staff training to carry on safe lending and deposit gathering practices. The OCC requires The First to maintain certain capital ratios and imposes limitations on The First&#8217;s aggregate investment in real estate, bank premises, and furniture and fixtures. The First is required by the OCC to prepare quarterly reports on their financial condition and to conduct an annual audit of their financial affairs in compliance with minimum standards and procedures prescribed by the OCC.

&#160;

Under FDICIA, all insured institutions must undergo regular on-site examinations by their appropriate banking agency. The cost of examinations of insured depository institutions and any affiliates may be assessed by the appropriate agency against each institution or affiliate as it deems necessary or appropriate. Insured institutions are required to submit annual reports to the FDIC and the appropriate agency (and state supervisor when applicable). FDICIA also directs the FDIC to develop with other appropriate agencies a method for insured depository institutions to provide supplemental disclosure of the estimated fair market value of assets and liabilities, to the extent feasible and practicable, in any balance sheet, financial statement, report of condition, or any other report of any insured depository institution. FDICIA also requires the federal banking regulatory agencies to prescribe, by regulation, standards for all insured depository institutions and depository institution holding companies relating, among other things, to: (i) internal controls, information systems, and audit systems; (ii) loan documentation; (iii) credit underwriting; (iv) interest rate risk exposure; and (v) asset quality.

&#160;

National banks and their holding companies which have been chartered or registered or undergone a change in control within the past two years or which have been deemed by the OCC or the Federal Reserve Board, respectively, to be troubled institutions must give the OCC or the Federal Reserve Board, respectively, thirty days prior notice of the appointment of any senior executive officer or director. Within the thirty day period, the OCC or the Federal Reserve Board, as the case may be, may approve or disapprove any such appointment.

&#160;

Deposit Insurance. The FDIC establishes rates for the payment of premiums by federally insured banks and thrifts for deposit insurance. A Deposit Insurance Fund (&#34;DIF&#34;) is maintained for commercial banks and thrifts, with insurance premiums from the industry used to offset losses from insurance payouts when banks and thrifts fail. Since 1993, insured depository institutions like The First have paid for deposit insurance under a risk-based premium system. Assessments are calculated based on the depository institution&#8217;s average consolidated total assets, less its average amount of tangible equity.

&#160;

Transactions With Affiliates and Insiders. The First is subject to Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act, which places limits on the amount of loans to, and certain other transactions with, affiliates, as well as on the amount of advances to third parties collateralized by the securities or obligations of affiliates. The aggregate of all covered transactions is limited in amount, as to any one affiliate, to 10% of The First's capital and surplus and, as to all affiliates combined, to 20% of The First's capital and surplus. Furthermore, within the foregoing limitations as to amount, each covered transaction must meet specified collateral requirements.

&#160;

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The First is also subject to Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, which prohibits an institution from engaging in certain transactions with affiliates unless the transactions are on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to such institution, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies. The First is subject to certain restrictions on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, certain principal shareholders, and their related interests. Such extensions of credit (i) must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties and (ii) must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features.

&#160;

Dividends. The principal source of funds from which we pay cash dividends are the dividends received from our bank subsidiary, The First. Federal banking laws and regulations restrict the amount of dividends and loans a bank may make to its parent company. Under certain conditions, dividends paid to us by The First are subject to approval by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. A national bank may not pay dividends from its capital. All dividends must be paid out of undivided profits then on hand, after deducting expenses, including reserves for losses and bad debts. In addition, a national bank is prohibited from declaring a dividend on its shares of common stock until its surplus equals its stated capital, unless the bank has transferred to surplus no less than one-tenth of its net profits of the preceding two consecutive half-year periods (in the case of an annual dividend). The approval of the OCC is required if the total of all dividends declared by a national bank in any calendar year exceeds the total of its net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years, less any required transfers to surplus. In addition, under FDICIA, the banks may not pay a dividend if, after paying the dividend, the bank would be undercapitalized. See &#34;Capital Requirements&#34; above.

&#160;

Additionally, as discussed above we participate in the CDCI, part of the TARP. We received $17,123,000 in funding under the CDCI in exchange for our issuance of preferred stock and common stock warrants on September 29, 2010. Participation in the CDCI program constrains our ability to raise dividends by limiting our annual dividend payments on our Common Stock to no more than $0.15 per share annually. The dividend rate payable on the CDCI preferred stock increases from two percent (2%) to nine percent (9%) in 2018, and therefore we may be required to repay the CDCI funds in order to avoid the increased preferred stock dividend payment. Our ability to repurchase our common stock would also be restricted in the event that we failed to make our dividend payments on the preferred stock. Under TARP, we may redeem the CDCI preferred stock at any time without penalty.

&#160;

Branching. National banks are required by the National Bank Act to adhere to branch office banking laws applicable to state banks in the states in which they are located. Under current Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana law, banks may open branches throughout these states with the prior approval of the OCC or other primary federal regulator. In addition, with prior regulatory approval, banks are able to acquire existing banking operations in Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana. Furthermore, federal legislation has recently been passed which permits interstate branching. The new law permits out of state acquisitions by bank holding companies (subject to veto by new state law), interstate branching by banks if allowed by state law, interstate merging by banks, and de novo branching by national banks if allowed by state law.

&#160;

Community Reinvestment Act. The Community Reinvestment Act requires that, in connection with examinations of financial institutions within their respective jurisdictions, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the OCC, or the Office of Thrift Supervision shall evaluate the record of the financial institutions in meeting the credit needs of their local communities, including low and moderate income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of those institutions. These factors are also considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions, and applications to open a branch or facility.

&#160;

USA Patriot Act. In 2001, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the &#8220;USA Patriot Act&#8221;) was signed into law. The USA Patriot Act broadened the application of anti-money laundering regulations to apply to additional types of financial institutions, such as broker-dealers, and strengthened the ability of the U.S. government to detect and prosecute international money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The principal provisions of Title III of the USA Patriot Act require that regulated financial institutions, including banks: (i) establish an anti-money laundering program that includes training and audit components; (ii) comply with regulations regarding the verification of the identity of any person seeking to open an account; (iii) take additional required precautions with non-U.S. owned accounts; and (iv) perform certain verification and certification of money laundering risk for their foreign correspondent banking relationships. The USA Patriot Act also expanded the conditions under which funds in a U.S. interbank account may be subject to forfeiture and increased the penalties for violation of anti-money laundering regulations. Failure of a financial institution to comply with the USA Patriot Act&#8217;s requirements could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution. The First has adopted policies, procedures and controls to address compliance with the requirements of the USA Patriot Act under the existing regulations and will continue to revise and update its policies, procedures and controls to reflect changes required by the USA Patriot Act and implementing regulations.

&#160;

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Other Bank Regulations. Interest and certain other charges collected or contracted for by The First are subject to state usury laws and certain federal laws concerning interest rates. The First&#8217;s loan operations are subject to certain federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the federal Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers; the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs community it serves; the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit; the Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1978, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies; the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, concerning the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies; and the rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal laws. The deposit operations of The First also are subject to the Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records, and the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E issued by the Federal Reserve Board to implement that Act, which governs automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers' rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services.

&#160;

Other Regulatory Matters 

&#160; 

Risk-retention rules. Under the final risk-retention rules, banks that sponsor the securitization of asset-backed securities and residential-mortgage backed securities are required to retain 5% of any loan they sell or securitize, except for mortgages that meet low-risk standards to be developed by regulators. 

&#160; 

Changes to federal preemption. The Dodd-Frank Act created a new independent supervisory body, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the &#8220;CFPB&#8221;) that is to be housed within the Federal Reserve. The CFPB is the primary regulator for federal consumer financial statutes. State attorneys general are authorized to enforce new regulations issued by the CFPB. Although state consumer financial laws will continue to be preempted under the National Bank Act, OCC determinations of such preemption are made on a case-by-case basis. As a result, it is possible that state consumer financial laws enacted in the future may be held to apply to our business activities. The cost of complying with any such additional laws could have a negative impact on our financial results. 

&#160; 

Changes to regulation of bank holding companies. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, bank holding companies must be well-capitalized and well-managed to engage in interstate transactions. In the past, only the subsidiary banks were required to meet those standards. The Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s &#8220;source of strength doctrine&#8221; has now been codified, mandating that bank holding companies such as the Company serve as a source of strength for their subsidiary banks, such that the bank holding company must be able to provide financial assistance in the event the subsidiary bank experiences financial distress. 

&#160; 

Mortgage Rules. During 2013, the CFPB finalized a series of rules related to the extension of residential mortgage loans made by banks. Among these rules are requirements that a bank make a good faith determination that a borrower has the ability to repay a mortgage loan prior to extending such credit, a requirement that certain mortgage loans contain escrow payments, new appraisal requirements, and specific rules regarding how loan originators may be compensated and the servicing of residential mortgage loans. The implementation of these new rules began in January 2014.

&#160; 

&#160; 12 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Volcker Rule. In December 2013, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the OCC, the Commission, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission issued the &#8220;Prohibitions And Restrictions On Proprietary Trading And Certain Interests In, And Relationships With, Hedge Funds And Private Equity Funds,&#8221; commonly referred to as the Volcker Rule, which regulates and restricts investments which may be made by banks. The Volcker Rule was adopted to implement a portion of the Dodd-Frank Act and new Section 13 of the Bank Holding Company Act, which prohibits any banking entity from engaging in proprietary trading or from acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in, or sponsoring or having certain relationships with, a hedge fund or private equity fund (&#8220;covered funds&#8221;), subject to certain exemptions.

&#160;

Debit Interchange Fees 

&#160;

Interchange fees, or &#8220;swipe&#8221; fees, are fees that merchants pay to credit card companies and card-issuing banks such as The First for processing electronic payment transactions on their behalf. The maximum permissible interchange fee that an issuer may receive for an electronic debit transaction is the sum of 21 cents per transaction and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction, subject to an upward adjustment of 1 cent if an issuer certifies that it has implemented policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve the fraud-prevention standards set forth by the Federal Reserve.

&#160;

In addition, the legislation prohibits card issuers and networks from entering into exclusive arrangements requiring that debit card transactions be processed on a single network or only two affiliated networks, and allows merchants to determine transaction routing. Due to the Company&#8217;s size, The Federal Reserve rule limiting debit interchange fees has not reduced our debit card interchange revenues.

&#160;

&#160;

Summary 

&#160;

The foregoing is a brief summary of certain statutes, rules and regulations affecting the Company and The First. It is not intended to be an exhaustive discussion of all statutes and regulations having an impact on the operations of such entities.

&#160;

Increased regulation generally has resulted in increased legal and compliance expense.

&#160;

Finally, additional bills may be introduced in the future in the U.S. Congress and state legislatures to alter the structure, regulation and competitive relationships of financial institutions. It cannot be predicted whether and in what form any of these proposals will be adopted or the extent to which the business of the Company and The First may be affected thereby.

&#160;

Effect of Governmental Monetary and Fiscal Policies 

&#160;

The difference between the interest rate paid on deposits and other borrowings and the interest rate received on loans and securities comprises most of a bank&#8217;s earnings. In order to mitigate the interest rate risk inherent in the industry, the banking business is becoming increasingly dependent on the generation of fee and service charge revenue.

&#160;

The earnings and growth of a bank will be affected by both general economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policy of the U.S. government and its agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve sets national monetary policy such as seeking to curb inflation and combat recession. This is accomplished by its open-market operations in U.S. government securities, adjustments in the amount of reserves that financial institutions are required to maintain and adjustments to the discount rates on borrowings and target rates for federal funds transactions. The actions of the Federal Reserve in these areas influence the growth of bank loans, investments and deposits and also affect interest rates on loans and deposits. The nature and timing of any future changes in monetary policies and their potential impact on the Company cannot be predicted.

&#160;
