 ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS 

Overview 

Except as expressly stated or the context otherwise requires, the terms &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; the &#8220;company&#8221; and &#8220;ICD&#8221; refer to Independence Contract Drilling, Inc. 

We provide land-based contract drilling services for oil and natural gas producers targeting unconventional resource plays in the United States. We construct, own and operate a premium land rig fleet comprised entirely of technologically advanced, custom designed ShaleDriller&#174; rigs that are specifically engineered and designed to optimize the development of our customers&#8217; most technically demanding oil and gas properties. We are focused on creating stockholder and customer value through our commitment to operational excellence and our focus on safety. Although we believe the current downturn in oil prices is presenting significant challenges for the drilling industry, we believe that we are well positioned to successfully navigate the downturn due to our premium rigs, operational excellence, commitment to safety, term contract coverage and strong asset base. 

Our standardized fleet currently consists of fourteen premium ShaleDriller&#174; rigs. Of these fourteen rigs, twelve are 200 Series rigs equipped with our integrated omni-directional walking system designed specifically to optimize pad drilling for our customers. We also have substantially completed the conversion of one of our non-walking rigs to 200 Series status, which we expect will be available for operations at the end of the first quarter of 2016. We also have the ability to upgrade our remaining non-walking rig to 200 Series status when market conditions improve, but until such time this rig has been decommissioned and we do not intend to market it. Every ShaleDriller&#174; rig in our fleet is a 1500-hp, AC programmable rig (&#8220;AC rig&#8221;) designed to be fast-moving between drilling sites and is equipped with top drives, automated tubular handling systems and blowout preventer (&#8220;BOP&#8221;) handling systems. Twelve of our fourteen rigs are equipped with bi-fuel capabilities (they operate on either diesel or a natural gas-diesel blend). 

Our first rig began drilling in May 2012. We currently focus our operations on unconventional resource plays located in geographic regions that we can efficiently support from our Houston, Texas facilities in order to maximize economies of scale. Currently, our rigs are predominantly operating in the Permian Basin, and we have one rig operating in the Eaglebine region, however, our rigs have previously operated in the Mid-Continent region and Eagle Ford Shale, as well.

Industry Trends 

Land Rig Replacement Cycle &#32;&#32; 

The increase in horizontal drilling in the U.S. over the past ten years has resulted in an ongoing land-rig replacement cycle in which the contract drilling industry is systematically upgrading its legacy fleets of electrical silicon-controlled rectifier (&#8220;SCR&#8221;) rigs and mechanical rigs with modern AC rigs that are specifically designed to optimize this type of drilling activity. The following describes the three different types of rig drives: 

Mechanical Rigs . Mechanical rigs were not designed and are not well suited for the demanding requirements of drilling horizontal wells. A mechanical rig powers its systems through a combination of belts, chains and transmissions. This arrangement requires the rig to be rigged up with precise alignment of the belts and chains, which requires substantial time during a rig move. In addition, mechanical power loading of key rig systems, including drawworks, pumps and rotating equipment results in very imprecise control of system parameters, causing lower drill bit life, lower rate of penetration and difficulty maintaining wellbore trajectory. 

SCR Rigs . In contrast to mechanical rigs, SCR rigs rely on direct current, or DC, to power the key rig systems. Load is changed by adjusting the amperage supplied to electric motors powering key rig systems. While a substantial improvement over mechanical belts and chains, SCR control is imprecise, and DC power levels normally drift resulting in fluctuations in pump speed and pressure, bit rotation speed, and weight on bit. These fluctuations can cause wellbore deviation, shorter bit life and less optimal rates of penetration. In addition, SCR equipment is heavy and energy inefficient. 

AC Rigs . Compared to SCR and mechanical rigs, AC rigs are ideally suited for drilling horizontal wells. The first AC rigs were introduced into the U.S. land market in the early 2000s, and since that time their use has grown significantly as the 

use of horizontal drilling has increased. AC rigs use a computer-controlled variable frequency drive ("VFD") to precisely adjust key rig operating parameters and systems allowing for optimization of the rate of penetration, extended bit life and improved control of wellbore trajectory. These factors reduce the amount of time a wellbore is &#8220;open hole,&#8221; or uncased. Shorter open hole times dramatically reduce adjacent formation damage that can be caused by shale hydration or drilling fluid invasion and enhance the operator&#8217;s ability to optimally run and cement casing to complete the drilled well. In addition, when compared to SCR and mechanical rigs, AC rigs are electrically more efficient, produce more torque, utilize regenerative braking, and have digital controls. AC motors are also smaller, lighter and require less maintenance than DC motors. 

Shift to Manufacturing Wellbore Model 

Following their significant investments made in unconventional resource plays, many E&#38;P companies are now focused on developing these investments in a systematic manner. Efficient development of these resource plays involves drilling programs that drill large numbers of wells in succession, as opposed to a single or a few wells designed to delineate a field or hold a lease. We view this as analogous to a manufacturing process that requires an engineered program and is focused on economies of scale to reduce overall field development costs. Cost effective development drilling requires more complex well designs, shorter cycle times, and the use of innovative technology in order to reduce an E&#38;P company&#8217;s overall field development costs. 

One method in which an E&#38;P operator may reduce overall field development costs is through the use of a multi-well pad development program. Pad drilling involves the drilling of multiple wells from a single location, which provides benefits to the E&#38;P company in the form of per well cost savings and accelerated cash flows as compared to non-pad developments. These cost savings result from reduced time required to move the rig between wells, centralized hydraulic fracturing operations and the efficient installation of central production facilities and pipelines. In addition, by performing drilling operations on one well with simultaneous completion operations on a second well, operators do not have to wait until the entire pad is complete to begin earning a return on their investment. Pad drilling promotes &#8220;manufacturing&#8221; efficiencies by enabling &#8220;batch&#8221; drilling, whereby an operator drills all of the wells&#8217; surface holes as the first batch, then drills all of the intermediate sections as the second batch, and concludes with the drilling all of the laterals as the final batch. Efficiencies are created because hole sizes change less frequently, and operators use the same mud system and tools repeatedly. We believe as operators have shifted over time to horizontal drilling, they have implemented pad drilling in order to maximize economics and optimize development plans. In order to maximize the efficiencies gained from pad drilling, a rig must be capable of moving quickly from one well to another and able to address the complexities associated with the growing number of wells per pad. In addition to quickly moving from well to well, omni-directional walking systems are ideally suited for pad drilling because they are capable of efficiently addressing situations on a pad in which wellbores are not precisely aligned or when level variations exist on the pad, which becomes increasingly likely as pads become larger and more complex. 

Another method utilized by operators to increase efficiencies and maximize well economics is the drilling of longer lateral horizontal wells. Operators in our target areas have continued to increase the lateral length of their horizontal wells. Longer laterals provide greater production zones as the portion of the wellbore that passes through the target formation increases, optimizing the impact of hydraulic fracturing and stimulation. Our rigs have drilled some of the longest horizontal wells to date in the Permian Basin, including a well with a lateral section in excess of 13,980 feet. The drilling of longer laterals necessitates the use of increased horsepower drawworks and top drive systems, which provide maximum torque and rotational control and allows the operator to maintain the integrity of its drilling plan throughout the wellbore. Additionally, higher pressure mud pumps are required to pump fluids through significantly longer wellbores. The competitive advantage of higher pressure mud pumps grows as the lateral length increases, as only high pressure pumps can effectively address the severe pressure drop, while providing the required hydraulic horsepower at the bit face and sufficient flow to remove drill cuttings and keep the hole clean. 

Pad Optimal Equipment 

Cost effective development drilling in a manufacturing wellbore model requires more complex well designs, shorter cycle times, and the use of innovative technology in order to reduce an E&#38;P company&#8217;s overall field development costs. Drilling rigs that are designed to maximize drilling efficiency, reduce cycle times, maximize energy efficiency, increase penetration rates while drilling, and drill longer-reach horizontal wells will reduce an E&#38;P company&#8217;s overall field development costs and provide them with greater optionality when designing their field development program. As a result, we believe that E&#38;P companies drilling horizontal wells are going to increasingly demand not only AC rigs that are optimal for horizontal drilling, but premium AC rigs such as our ShaleDriller&#174; rig that are "pad optimal" and include the following equipment and design features: 

&#8226; 

AC Programmable . AC rigs use a variable frequency drive that allows precise computer control of motor speed during operations. This greater control of motor speed provides more precise drilling of the wellbore. Among other attributes, 

when compared to electrical SCR rigs and mechanical rigs, AC rigs are electrically more efficient, produce consistent torque, utilize regenerative braking, and have digital controls and AC motors that require less maintenance. AC rigs allow our customers to drill faster, which, in general, eliminates reservoir permeability damage, and to drill wellbores that more precisely track planned trajectories without doglegs. This, in turn, minimizes open hole time and enables our customers to more effectively and efficiently run casing, cement and successfully complete their wells. 

&#8226; 

Pad Optimized, Omni-Directional Walking System . Our omni-directional walking system is engineered and designed as an integrated part of our ShaleDriller&#174; rig&#8217;s substructure to optimize pad drilling economics for our customers. Pad drilling involves the drilling of multiple wells from a single location, which provides benefits to the E&#38;P company in the form of cost savings and accelerated cash flows. Our walking system allows our rigs to move in any direction quickly between wellheads, rapidly and efficiently adjust to misaligned wellbores, walk over raised wellheads, and increase operational safety due to fewer required rig up and rig down movements. 

&#8226; 

Bi-Fuel Capable . Twelve of our fourteen ShaleDriller&#174; rigs are bi-fuel capable. Bi-fuel operations offer a reduction in carbon emissions and provide significant fuel cost savings for our customers. 

&#8226; 

Efficient Mobilization Between Drilling Sites . A rig that can rapidly move between drilling sites has become increasingly desired by, and impactful to, E&#38;P companies because it reduces cycle times allowing them to drill more wells in the same period of time. In addition to being specifically designed for moving between wells on a pad, our ShaleDriller&#174; rig is designed to move rapidly on conventional rig moves between drilling sites. Our custom designed substructure moves in a single semi-trailer load and allows for automated and rapid rig up and rig down without the use of cranes. This significantly reduces overall move time compared to a traditional substructure design, provides cost savings to our customers, and enables a safer rig up and rig down process. 

&#8226; 

1500-hp Drawworks . All of our rigs are powered with 1500-hp drawworks and are well suited for the development of the vast majority of our customers&#8217; unconventional resource assets. Compared to a 1000-hp or smaller rig, a 1500-hp rig has superior capability to handle extended drill string lengths required to drill long horizontal wells, which are becoming more common in the markets we serve. 

&#8226; 

7500psi Mud Systems . The drilling of longer laterals necessitates the use of higher pressure mud pumps to pump fluids through significantly longer wellbores. The competitive advantage of higher pressure mud pumps grows as the lateral length gets longer, as only high pressure pumps can effectively address the severe pressure drop while providing the required hydraulic horsepower at the bit face and sufficient flow to remove drill cuttings and keep the hole clean. 

Recent Declines in Oil and Gas Prices and Drilling Activity 

Oil prices began to decline in the second half of 2014, declined further during 2015 and have continued to decline in 2016. The closing price of oil was as high as $106.06 per barrel during the third quarter of 2014, was $37.13 per barrel on December 31, 2015 and has fallen as low as $26.68 during January 2016 (WTI spot price as reported by the United States Energy Information Administration). As a result of the decline in oil prices, our industry is now experiencing an exceptional downturn, and market conditions remain very dynamic and are changing quickly. Although the magnitude as well as the duration of this downturn are not yet known, we believe that 2016 will be an exceptionally challenging year for ICD and our industry. 

We believe the vast majority of E&#38;P companies, including our customers, have significantly reduced their 2016 capital spending plans compared to 2015 levels. The initial impact of these spending reductions is evidenced by the published rig counts which have declined more than 60% since their peak in October 2014, and we believe the rig count in the United States may decline further in 2016 until oil and gas prices begin to stabilize and improve. 

As a result of this deterioration in market conditions, our customers are principally focused on their most economic wells, drilling to maintain leasehold positions and on maintaining their most cost efficient operations that deliver the overall lowest cost of producing their wells and minimize their capital expenditures. As a result, operators are focusing more of their capital spending on horizontal drilling programs compared to vertical drilling. They also are more focused on utilizing drilling equipment and techniques that optimize costs and efficiency. Thus, we believe this rapid market deterioration has significantly accelerated the pace of the ongoing land rig replacement cycle and continued shift to horizontal drilling from multi-well pads utilizing &#8220;pad optimal&#8221; rig technology. 

Although we believe that the current market downturn is rapidly increasing the focus of our customers towards the use of premium drilling rigs such as our ShaleDriller&#174;, and that premium operations such as ours have been less affected by the downturn relative to operations conducted by legacy fleets, the rapid pace and level of the market decline has negatively 

impacted pricing, utilization and contract tenors for premium rigs, including our ShaleDriller&#174; rig. During 2015, our premium drilling fleet operated at 85% utilization, but we do not expect to maintain this level of utilization while this current market downturn continues. As of December 31, 2015, eleven of our twelve 200 series rigs were generating revenue. 

&#32;Since December 31, 2015, 

&#8226; 

One of our rigs operating on a farm out basis ceased operations under its contract. Although this arrangement allows us to recognize revenues and full margins for the duration of the contract, we do not expect this rig to recommence drilling operations in the near term. 

&#8226; 

Two of our customers have informed us that they intend to place our rigs operating for them under term contracts on a standby-without-crew basis until market conditions improve. Although these arrangements allow us to continue to recognize revenue and earn expected margins for the durations of these contracts, we do not expect these two rigs to recommence drilling operations in the near term. 

&#8226; 

One of our rigs operating under a term contract that expired during the first quarter of 2016 has become idle. We continue to market this rig, however, given current market conditions, we cannot accurately predict when this rig will return to work or that it can operate at profitable levels until market conditions improve. 

In addition, two of our rigs operating at December 31, 2015 were operating, in the spot-market, under short-term contracts expiring in March 2016, and we also have several rigs operating under term contracts with terms scheduled to expire during 2016. We expect to market our rigs rolling off contracts in 2016 at substantially lower dayrates than where they historically have operated, and there can be no assurance that these rigs will be contracted or remain operating at profitable levels. 

Initial Formation 

We were incorporated in November 2011 but did not have meaningful operations until March 2012. In March 2012, we acquired substantially all of the rig manufacturing and intellectual property (the &#8220;GES assets&#8221;) of Global Energy Services Operating, LLC (&#8220;GES&#8221;), including GES&#8217; Houston-based manufacturing facility (the &#8220;Houston Facility&#8221;), which we currently use to construct our rig fleet. The Houston Facility is located on 14.6 acres in northwest Houston. This acquisition provided us with the necessary infrastructure and asset platform required to accelerate the introduction of our ShaleDriller&#174; rig into our target markets and secure initial contracts with key customers. In exchange for the GES assets, we issued 1.6 million shares of our common stock and a warrant to purchase 2.2 million shares of our common stock, which expired unexercised on March 2, 2015, and we assumed approximately $2.1 million of long-term indebtedness from GES. Because we had only limited operations before the GES acquisition and we succeeded them in substantially all of the ongoing rig construction operations of GES, GES is considered our predecessor for accounting purposes. 

Contemporaneously with the acquisition of the GES assets, we acquired cash balances and two drilling contracts from Independence Contract Drilling LLC (referred to as &#8220;RigAssetCo&#8221;) in exchange for approximately 2.4 million shares of our common stock. 

As a condition to the completion of these two transactions, we also closed a private placement of shares of our common stock resulting in net proceeds to us of $98.4 million. We used the net proceeds of the private placement primarily to continue the construction of our ShaleDriller&#174; rig fleet and expansion of our operating capacity, and to repay the indebtedness assumed from GES. We refer to the GES and RigAssetCo transactions, together with the private placement of common stock, collectively as the &#8220;GES Transaction.&#8221; 

Customer Contracts and Backlog 

Drilling contracts are obtained through competitive bidding or as a result of negotiations with customers, and may cover multi-well and multi-year projects. Each of our rigs operates under a separate drilling contract or drilling order subject to a master drilling contract. We perform drilling services on a &#8220;daywork&#8221; contract basis, under which we charge a fixed rate per day. The dayrate under each of our contracts is a negotiated price determined by the location, depth and complexity of the wells to be drilled, operating conditions, the duration of the contract, and market conditions. We have not accepted any, and do not anticipate entering into, any &#8220;turn-key&#8221; (fixed sum to deliver a hole to a stated depth) or &#8220;footage&#8221; (fixed rate per foot of hole drilled) contracts. The duration of land drilling contracts can vary from &#8220;well-to-well&#8221; or to a fixed term ranging from a few months to several years. The revenue generated by a rig in a given year is the product of the dayrate fee and the number of days the rig is earning this fee based on activity and the terms of the contract, referred to as utilization. &#8220;Well-to-well&#8221; contracts are typically cancelable at the option of either party upon the completion of drilling at a particular site. Fixed-term contracts customarily provide for termination at the election of the customer, with an &#8220;early termination payment&#8221; to be paid to the 

drilling contractor if a contract is terminated prior to the expiration of the fixed term. However, under certain limited circumstances such as destruction of a drilling rig, the drilling contractor&#8217;s bankruptcy, sustained unacceptable performance by the drilling contractor or delivery of a rig beyond certain grace and/or liquidated damage periods, no early termination payment would be paid to the drilling contractor. Drilling contracts also contain provisions regarding indemnification against certain types of claims involving injury to persons, property and for acts of pollution, which are subject to negotiation on a contract-by-contract basis. 

Under a typical daywork contract, we earn a dayrate fee while the rig is operating, and we earn a moving rate fee while the rig is moving between wells or drilling locations under the contract. If the rig is on standby or is not drilling due to a force majeure event unrelated to damage to the rig, contracts typically provide that we earn a rate during this period of time, which rate may be equal to or less than the operating rate. 

Mobilization rates are determined by market conditions and are generally reimbursed by the customer. In most instances, contracts typically provide for additional payments associated with this initial mobilization of a drilling rig and that we receive a demobilization fee at the end of the contract term in certain circumstances equal to the estimated cost to transport the rig from the final drilling location and to compensate us for the estimated demobilization time. 

Drilling contracts typically provide that the contractor continues to earn the operating dayrate while a rig is not operating but under repair or maintenance, so long as the non-operating time due to repair and maintenance does not exceed a specified number of hours in a given day or calendar month. 

Prior to the significant decline in market conditions that began in late 2014, we were able to regularly obtain long-term contracts with terms between one and three years. However, throughout 2015, the vast majority of new rig contracts available in the market have been short-term well-to-well contracts or contracts with terms less than six months. As a result, our contract drilling backlog, or the expected future revenue from executed contracts with original terms in excess of six months, declined significantly from $152.8 million as of December 31, 2014 to $74.4 million as of December 31, 2015. Approximately $53.3 million of our backlog at December 31, 2015 is expected to be realized during 2016. Our backlog does not include potential reductions in rates for unscheduled standby during periods in which the rig is moving, on standby or incurring maintenance and repair time in excess of contractually allowed downtime. In addition, we currently expect that several of our rigs under term contracts will realize revenue on a standby-without-crew basis, which allows us to preserve our expected cash margins from the contract but reduces our overall top line revenue. To the extent that we have rigs under term contracts operating on a standby or standby-without-crew basis, our top line revenues will be less than our reported backlog from term contracts. 

The following chart summarizes the weighted average number of rigs that we have operating under term contracts during 2016 and beyond. &#160;

Our Customers 

Customers for contract drilling services in the U.S. include major oil and gas companies, independent oil and gas companies as well as numerous small to mid-sized publicly-traded and privately held oil and gas companies. We market our contract drilling services to all such customers. During 2015, our customers representing more than 10% of our revenues were Parsley Energy, LP., Pioneer Natural Resources USA, Inc., Laredo Petroleum, Inc., COG Operating, LLC, a subsidiary of Concho Resources, Inc. and Elevation Resources, LLC. While we would attempt to remarket our rigs if we lost any material customer, given current market conditions, the terms of such new contract, if any were found, will be less favorable than the terms of our current contracts. Therefore, the loss of any material customer could have an adverse effect on our business. 

Industry/Competition 

To a large degree, our business depends on the level of capital spending by oil and gas companies for exploration, development and production activities. A sustained increase or decrease in the price of oil and natural gas could have a material impact on the exploration, development and production activities of our customers and could materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The recent decrease in oil prices has caused a reduction in E&#38;P company capital expenditures on exploration, development and production activities, which in turn has resulted in a decreased demand for drilling rigs and downward pricing pressure on drilling rigs in operation. 

The contract drilling industry is highly competitive and has become even more so under current market conditions. The price for contract drilling services is a key competitive factor in the U.S. land contract drilling markets, in part because equipment used in our businesses can be moved from one area to another in response to market conditions. In addition to price, we believe the principal competitive factors in our markets are availability and condition of equipment, quality of personnel, efficiency of equipment, service quality, experience and safety record. 

Many of our competitors are larger, publicly-held corporations with significantly greater resources and longer operating histories than us. Our largest competitors for high-end AC land drilling contract services are Helmerich &#38; Payne, Inc., Precision Drilling Corporation, Nabors Industries, Ltd. and Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. 

Government and Environmental Regulation 

All of our operations and facilities are subject to numerous Federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations related to various aspects of our business, including: 

&#8226; 

drilling of oil and natural gas wells; 

&#8226; 

the relationships with our employees; 

&#8226; 

containment and disposal of hazardous materials, oilfield waste, other waste materials and acids; and 

&#8226; 

use of underground storage tanks. 

To date, we do not believe applicable environmental laws and regulations in the U.S. have required the expenditure by the contract drilling industry of significant resources outside the ordinary course of business. However, compliance costs under existing laws or under any new requirements could become material, and we could incur liability in any instance of noncompliance. 

Our business is generally affected by political developments and by Federal, state and local laws and regulations that relate to the oil and natural gas industry. The adoption of laws and regulations affecting the oil and natural gas industry for economic, environmental and other policy reasons could increase costs relating to drilling and production, and otherwise have an adverse effect on our operations. Federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations currently apply to our operations and may become more stringent in the future. Any suspension or moratorium of the services we provide, whether or not short-term in nature, by a Federal, state or local governmental authority, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. 

In the U.S., the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (&#8220;CERCLA&#8221;), and comparable state statutes impose strict liability on: 

&#8226; 

owners and operators of sites, and 

&#8226; 

persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of &#8220;hazardous substances&#8221; found at sites. 

The Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (&#8220;RCRA&#8221;), as amended, and comparable state statutes govern the disposal of &#8220;hazardous wastes.&#8221; Although CERCLA currently excludes petroleum from the definition of &#8220;hazardous substances,&#8221; and RCRA excludes certain classes of exploration and production wastes from regulation, such exemptions by Congress under both CERCLA and RCRA may be deleted, limited, or modified in the future. If such changes are made to CERCLA and/or RCRA, we could be required to remove and remediate previously disposed of materials (including materials disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) from properties (including ground water contaminated with hydrocarbons) and to perform removal or remedial actions to prevent future contamination. 

The Federal Water Pollution Control Act and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended (the &#8220;Oil Pollution Act&#8221;), and implementing regulations govern: 

&#8226; 

the prevention of discharges, including oil and produced water spills; and 

&#8226; 

liability for drainage into waters of the U.S. 

The Oil Pollution Act imposes strict liability for a comprehensive and expansive list of damages from an oil spill into waters from facilities. Liability may be imposed for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages. Penalties may also be imposed for violation of Federal safety, construction and operating regulations, and for failure to report a spill or to cooperate fully in a clean-up. 

The Oil Pollution Act also expands the authority and capability of the Federal government to direct and manage oil spill clean-up and operations, and requires operators to prepare oil spill response plans in cases where it can reasonably be expected that substantial harm will be done to the environment by discharges on or into navigable waters. Failure to comply with ongoing requirements or inadequate cooperation during a spill event may subject a responsible party, such as us, to civil or criminal actions. Although the liability for owners and operators is the same under the Federal Water Pollution Act, the damages recoverable under the Oil Pollution Act are potentially much greater and can include natural resource damages. 

Our contract drilling services will be marketed in oil and gas producing regions that utilize hydraulic fracturing services to enhance the production of oil and natural gas from formations with low permeability, such as shales. Due to concerns raised relating to potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater quality, legislative and regulatory efforts at the Federal level and in some states have been initiated to render permitting and compliance requirements more stringent for hydraulic fracturing or prohibit the activity altogether. Such efforts could have an adverse effect on oil and natural gas production activities, which in turn could have an adverse effect on the contract drilling services that we render for our exploration and production customers. 

Our operations are also subject to Federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations for the control of air emissions, including the Federal Clean Air Act. The Federal Clean Air Act, and comparable state laws, regulates emissions of various air pollutants through, for example, air emissions permitting programs. In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA") has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources including pursuing the energy extraction sector under a National Enforcement Initiative. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the Federal Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations. Finally, more stringent state and local regulations, such as the EPA rules issued in April 2012, which add new requirements for the oil and gas sector under the New Source Review Program and the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants program, could result in increased costs and the need for operational changes. Any direct and indirect costs of meeting these requirements may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

On December 7, 2009, the EPA announced its findings that emissions of greenhouse gases present an &#8220;endangerment to human health and the environment.&#8221; The EPA based this finding on a conclusion that greenhouse gases are contributing to the warming of the earth&#8217;s atmosphere and other climate changes. The EPA began to adopt regulations that would require a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases from certain stationary sources and has required monitoring and reporting for other stationary sources. Mandatory reporting requirements for additional regional, federal or state requirements have been imposed and additional requirements may be imposed in the future. New legislation or regulatory programs that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases in areas in which we conduct business could have an adverse effect on our operations and demand for our services. For example, during 2012, the EPA published rules that include standards to reduce methane emissions associated with oil and gas production. Pursuant to President Obama&#8217;s Strategy to Reduce Methane Omissions, and as part of the Obama Administration&#8217;s efforts to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by up to 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025. The EPA is expected to propose in the spring of 2016, new regulations that will set methane emission standards for new and modified oil and gas facilities, including production facilities. Currently, our operations are not adversely impacted by existing state and local climate change initiatives and, at this time, it is not possible to accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events; if any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our exploration and production operations. 

We are subject to the requirements of the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (&#8220;OSHA&#8221;) and comparable state statutes. The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of CERCLA and similar state statutes require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations. We believe that we are in compliance with these applicable requirements and with other OSHA and comparable requirements. 

Additionally, environmental laws such as the federal Endangered Species Act (&#8220;ESA&#8221;), may impact exploration, development and production activities on public or private lands. The ESA provides broad protection for species of fish, wildlife and plants that are listed as threatened or endangered in the U.S., and prohibits taking of endangered species. Federal 

agencies are required to ensure that any action authorized, funded or carried out by them is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or modify their critical habitat. While some of our customers&#8217; properties may be located in areas that are designated as habitat for endangered or threatened species, we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the ESA. However, the designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected areas. 

Risks and Insurance 

Our operations are subject to the many hazards inherent in the drilling business, including: 

&#8226; 

accidents at the work location; 

&#8226; 

blow-outs; 

&#8226; 

cratering; 

&#8226; 

fires; and 

&#8226; 

explosions. 

These and other hazards could cause: 

&#8226; 

personal injury or death; 

&#8226; 

suspension of drilling operations; or 

&#8226; 

damage or destruction of our equipment and that of others; 

&#8226; 

damage to producing formations and surrounding areas; and 

&#8226; 

environmental damage. 

Damage to the environment, including property contamination in the form of soil or ground water contamination, could also result from our operations, including through: 

&#8226; 

oil or produced water spillage; 

&#8226; 

natural gas leaks; and 

&#8226; 

fires. 

We maintain insurance coverage of types and amounts that we believe to be customary in the industry, but we may not be fully insured against all risks, either because insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs. Such risks include personal injury, well disasters, extensive fire damage, damage to the environment, and other hazards. The insurance coverage that we maintain includes insurance for fire, windstorm and other risks of physical loss to our rigs and other assets, employer&#8217;s liability, automobile liability, commercial general liability insurance and workers compensation insurance. We cannot assure, however, that any insurance obtained by us will be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities, or that this insurance will continue to be available or available on terms that are acceptable to us. While we carry insurance to cover physical damage to, or loss of, our drilling rigs and other assets, such insurance does not cover the full replacement cost of the rigs or other assets, and we do not carry insurance against loss of earnings resulting from such damage. Liabilities for which we are not insured, or which exceed the policy limits of our applicable insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, we may experience difficulties in collecting from insurers, or such insurers may deny all or a portion of our claims for insurance coverage. 

In addition to insurance coverage, we also attempt to obtain indemnification from our customers for certain risks. These indemnities typically require our customers to hold us harmless in the event of loss of production or reservoir damage. There is no assurance that we will obtain such contractual indemnity, and if obtained, whether such indemnity will be enforceable, whether the customer will be able to satisfy such indemnity or whether such indemnity will be supported by adequate insurance maintained by the customer. 

If a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance or is not an enforceable or recoverable indemnity from a third party, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. See &#8220;Risk Factors - Our operations involve operating hazards, which if not insured or indemnified against, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.&#8221; 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 305 employees, including one contract employee, none of whom were represented by a union. The number of our employees fluctuates depending on our construction and drilling activities. 

Seasonality 

Seasonality has not significantly affected our overall operations. However, our drilling operations can be affected by severe winter storms or other weather related events. Additionally, toward the end of some years, we experience slower contracting activity as customers&#8217; capital expenditure budgets are depleted. 

Raw Materials, Suppliers and Subcontractors 

We use many suppliers of raw materials and services. Although these materials and services have historically been available, there is no assurance that such materials and services will continue to be available on favorable terms or at all. We also utilize numerous manufacturers and independent subcontractors from various trades to supply key components to the rigs that we construct for our use. These key components include masts and substructures, top drives, high pressure mud pumps, pressure control equipment, engines, and VFD control systems. We believe that we have alternative sources for each of these components.
