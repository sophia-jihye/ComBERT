We help corporations, financial institutions, financial advisors, institutional investors and ultra-high-net-worth families create and manage wealth by providing comprehensive, innovative, investment and investment-business solutions. As of December 31, 2015 , through its subsidiaries and partnerships in which the company has a significant interest, SEI manages or administers $670.3 billion &#32;in mutual fund and pooled or separately managed assets, including $262.5 billion in assets under management and $407.8 billion &#32;in client assets under administration.

Our investment management business solutions include: 

&#8226; 

Investment processing outsourcing solutions for providers of institutional and private-client wealth management services, including banks, trust companies, independent wealth advisers and other financial services firms; 

&#8226; 

Investment management solutions for institutional investors, including retirement plan sponsors, not-for-profit organizations and affluent individual investors; and 

&#8226; 

Investment operations outsourcing solutions for investment management firms, banks and investment companies that sponsor and distribute mutual funds, hedge funds and alternative investments. 

General Development of the Business 

For over 45 years, SEI has been a leading provider of wealth management business solutions for the financial services industry. 

We began doing business in 1968 by providing computer-based training simulations for bank loan officers. We developed an investment accounting system for bank trust departments in 1972 and became a leading provider of investment-processing outsourcing services to banks and trust institutions in the United States. Later, we broadened these outsourcing services and began offering bank clients a family of mutual funds, as well as investment-operations outsourcing services. We became a public company in 1981. 

We began to adapt these solutions, and develop new investment management solutions, for selected global markets in the 1990s, including: investment advisors, retirement plan sponsors and institutional investors, asset management distribution firms, investment managers and affluent individual investors. Today, we serve approximately 8,200 &#32;clients in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, continental Europe, South Africa and East Asia. 

In each of these markets, we have combined our core competencies - investment processing, investment management and investment operations - to deliver broader and more strategic solutions for clients and markets. Today, we offer a global wealth platform and investment services for private banks and wealth services firms; a complete wealth platform for operating an investment advisory business; a comprehensive fiduciary management solution for retirement plan sponsors and institutional investors; a total operational outsourcing solution for investment managers and a complete life and wealth solution for ultra-high-net-worth families.

Strategy 

We seek to achieve growth in earnings and shareholder value by strengthening our position as a provider of global investment management solutions. To achieve this objective, we have implemented these strategies: 

Create broader solutions for wealth service firms . Banks, investment managers and financial advisors seek to enter new markets, expand their service offerings, provide a differentiated experience to their clients, improve efficiencies, reduce risks and better manage their businesses. We offer business solutions integrating technology, operating processes and financial products designed to help these institutions better serve their clients and provide opportunities to improve their business success. 

Help institutional investors manage retirement plans and operating capital. &#32;Retirement plan sponsors, not-for-profit organizations and other institutional investors strive to meet their fiduciary obligations and financial objectives while reducing business risk. We deliver customized investment management solutions, as part of a complete solution offering, that enable investors to make better decisions about their investments and to manage their assets more effectively. 

Help affluent individual investors manage their life and wealth goals. &#32;These investors demand a holistic wealth management experience that focuses on their life goals and provides them with an integrated array of financial services that includes substantially more than traditional wealth management offerings. We help these investors identify their goals and offer comprehensive life and wealth advisory services including life planning, investments and other financial services. 

Expand globally . Global markets are large and present significant opportunities for growth. We have evolved U.S. business models for the global wealth management marketplace, focusing on the needs of institutional investors, private banks, independent wealth advisers, investment managers, investment advisors and affluent individual investors. 

Fundamental Principles 

We are guided by these fundamental principles in managing the business and adopting these growth strategies: 

&#8226; 

Achieve growth in revenue and earnings . We seek to grow the business by providing additional services to clients, adding new clients, introducing new products and adapting products for new markets. 

&#8226; 

Forge long-term client relationships . We strive to achieve high levels of customer satisfaction and to forge close and long lasting client relationships. We believe these relationships enable us to market additional services and acquire knowledge and insights that fuel the product development process. 

&#8226; 

Invest in product development . We continually enhance products and services to keep pace with industry developments, regulatory requirements and the emerging needs of markets and clients. We believe ongoing investments in research and development give us a sustainable, competitive advantage in our markets. 

&#8226; 

Maintain financial strength . We adopt business models that generate recurring revenues and positive cash flows. Predictable cash flows serve as a source of funds for continuing operations, investments in new products, common stock repurchases and dividend payments. 

&#8226; 

Leverage investments across the business . We create scalable, enterprise-wide solutions designed to serve the needs of multiple markets, potentially offering operating efficiencies that can benefit corporate profitability. 

&#8226; 

Create value for shareholders . The objective of achieving long-term sustainable growth in revenues and earnings strongly influences the management of the business. This philosophy guides corporate management practices, strategic planning activities and employee compensation practices. 

Business Solutions 

Investment Processing 

Investment processing solutions consist of application and business process outsourcing services, professional services and transaction-based services. We offer these services to providers of institutional and private-client wealth management services, including banks, trust companies, independent wealth advisers and other financial services firms. We also deliver these solutions, combined with our investment management programs, to investment advisors and other financial services firms that provide wealth management services to their advisory clients. 

Application services are delivered through two proprietary software applications: TRUST 3000&#174; and the SEI Wealth Platform SM (the SEI Wealth Platform or the Platform). We own, maintain and operate these applications and associated information processing infrastructure and facilities, and are responsible for customer support. We design and develop enhancements to these proprietary applications. Through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, we also provide business-process 

Page 3 &#32;of 77 

outsourcing services including custodial and sub-custodial services, and back-office accounting services integrated with these software applications. 

The TRUST 3000 product is a comprehensive trust and investment accounting system that provides securities processing and investment accounting for all types of domestic and global securities, and support for multiple account types, including personal trust, corporate trust, institutional trust and non-trust investment accounts. 

The SEI Wealth Platform provides a global, unified and scalable platform for operating a wealth management business. This comprehensive solution includes investment processing and infrastructure services, and advanced capabilities to support wealth advisory, asset management, and wealth administration functions. The Platform provides global wealth management capabilities including a 24/7 operating model, global securities processing, and multi-currency accounting and reporting. Built around a client-centric relationship model, the Platform has an open architecture and supports workflow management and straight-through processing. We began delivering the SEI Wealth Platform to private banks and independent wealth advisers in the United Kingdom in 2007 and to banks in the United States in 2012. We have also implemented select groups of existing investment advisor clients in the United States. 

Investment processing revenues are earned as monthly fees for contracted services including software licenses, information processing and business-process outsourcing. Revenues are primarily earned based upon the type and number of investor accounts serviced or as a percentage of the market value of the clients&#8217; assets processed. These revenues are recognized in Information processing and software servicing fees on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

Professional services revenues are earned from contracted, project-oriented services, including client implementations, and are recognized in Information processing and software servicing fees on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

We also offer transaction execution services through our proprietary software applications. Fees are earned primarily from commissions earned on securities trades executed on behalf of clients. These revenues are recognized as Transaction-based and trade execution fees on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

Investment Management Programs 

Investment management programs consist of money market, fixed-income and equity mutual funds, collective investment products, alternative investment portfolios and separately managed accounts. Through our wholly owned subsidiaries, we serve as sponsor, administrator, transfer agent, investment advisor, distributor and shareholder servicer for many of these products. We distribute these programs through investment advisory firms, including investment advisors and banks, and directly to institutional and individual investors. 

These investment products are used to formulate an investment strategy tailored to meet the needs of different investors, taking into consideration their objectives and risk tolerances. Our clients or our client&#8217;s clients are the investors in these products. Investors typically invest in a globally diversified portfolio that consists of multiple asset classes and investment styles. 

We have expanded these investment management programs to include other consultative, operational and technology components, and have created comprehensive solutions tailored to the needs of a specific market. These components may include investment strategies, consulting services, administrative and processing services and technology tools. 

As of December 31, 2015 , SEI managed $184.1 billion &#32;in assets including: $137.4 billion &#32;invested in fixed-income and equity funds and separately managed account programs; $32.2 billion &#32;invested in collective trust fund programs and $14.5 billion &#32;invested in liquidity or money market funds. An additional $78.3 billion &#32;in assets is managed by our unconsolidated affiliate LSV, a registered investment advisor that specializes in a value equity management style for their clients. 

Revenues from investment management programs are primarily earned as a percentage of net assets under management. These revenues are recognized in Asset management, administration and distribution fees on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Our interest in the earnings of LSV is recognized in Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

Investment Operations 

Investment operations outsourcing solutions consist of accounting and administration services, and distribution support services. We deliver these solutions to investment management firms that offer traditional and alternative products. We support traditional managers who advise a variety of investment products including mutual funds, UCITS schemes, collective investment trusts (CITs), exchange-traded funds (ETFs), institutional accounts and separately managed accounts. We also provide comprehensive solutions to investment managers worldwide that sponsor and distribute alternative investments such as hedge funds, funds of hedge funds, private equity funds and real estate funds, across both registered and partnership structures. 

Page 4 &#32;of 77 

Accounting and administration services include account and fund administration, investment portfolio and fund accounting; cash administration and treasury services; trade capture, settlement and reconciliation; trustee and custodial services; legal, audit and tax support; and investor services. Distribution support services may include access to distribution platforms and market and industry analyses to identify specific product distribution opportunities. These solutions are delivered by utilizing a highly integrated, robust and scalable technology platform adapted to fit the specific business needs of our investment manager clients. 

As of December 31, 2015 , we administered $407.8 billion &#32;in client assets for traditional and alternative investment fund products, including mutual funds, hedge funds and private equity funds. Revenues from these products are primarily earned as a percentage of net assets under administration. 

Revenues for the processing of institutional separate accounts and separately managed accounts are generally earned on the number of investor accounts serviced. Assets associated with this separate account processing are not included in reported assets under administration. Both revenue categories are recognized in Asset management, administration and distribution fees on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

Business Segments 

Business segments are generally organized around our target markets. Financial information about each business segment is contained in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our business segments are: 

Private Banks &#8211; provides investment processing and investment management programs to banks and trust institutions, independent wealth advisers and financial advisors worldwide; 

Investment Advisors &#8211; provides investment management programs to affluent investors through a network of independent registered investment advisors, financial planners and other investment professionals in the United States; 

Institutional Investors &#8211; provides investment management programs and administrative outsourcing solutions to retirement plan sponsors, hospitals and not-for-profit organizations worldwide; 

Investment Managers &#8211; provides investment operations outsourcing solutions to fund companies, banking institutions and both traditional and non-traditional investment managers worldwide; and 

Investments in New Businesses &#8211; focuses on providing investment management programs to ultra-high-net-worth families residing in the United States; developing internet-based investment services and advice solutions; entering new markets; and conducting other research and development activities.

Private Banks &#160; 

The Private Banks segment delivers a comprehensive outsourcing solution integrating investment processing services, investment management and distribution programs, and business expertise to banks and trust institutions, independent wealth advisers and financial advisors worldwide. 

We offer TRUST 3000 investment processing as an application solution (Software-as-a-Service, or SaaS) or as a business processing solution. Application solution clients outsource investment processing software services and information processing to SEI, but retain responsibility for back-office investment operations. Business processing solution clients also outsource investment operations, including custody and safekeeping of certain assets, income collection, securities settlement and other back-office accounting activities. 

Contracts with TRUST 3000 clients have initial terms that are generally three to seven years in length. At December 31, 2015 , we had significant relationships with 96 &#32;bank and trust institutions in the United States. Our principal competitors for this business are: Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (FIS), State Street Corporation, Fi-Tek LLC, Charles Schwab &#38; Co., Inc. and Fidelity Investments. Many large financial institutions develop, operate and maintain proprietary investment and trust accounting systems. We consider these &#8220;in-house&#8221; solutions to be a form of competition. 

Page 5 &#32;of 77 

Our marketing efforts in this segment are focused on the SEI Wealth Platform, as we now have an installed base of operating clients in both the United Kingdom and the United States. We believe the Platform addresses the needs of large global wealth managers. The Platform enables them to manage the growing complexity of their operations, replace legacy platforms, comply with complex regulations, and make more effective use of capital by outsourcing wealth management services. 

We currently offer the SEI Wealth Platform as a business processing solution. New Platform clients undergo a business transformation process that includes either a conversion of existing client assets, or a business transition process which funds new client assets onto the Platform as the client grows their business with a contractual minimum fee in place. We begin to earn processing revenues when the client completes the transformation process and commences operation. 

In 2015, we signed an existing TRUST 3000 client to be the first large national bank to implement the SEI Wealth Platform, and the first client to operate the Platform as an SaaS solution. This will be a multi-year conversion due to the client&#8217;s size, the development work involved to expand the Platform to be offered as a SaaS solution, and the scope of integration activities required. While executing this large-scale implementation, we will continue to install other signed clients. We will also continue to manage our current TRUST 3000 relationships toward eventual conversion to the Platform. 

Contracts with SEI Wealth Platform clients have initial terms that are generally five to seven years in length. At December 31, 2015 , we had significant relationships with 27 &#32;banks, independent wealth advisers and other wealth managers located in the United Kingdom and the United States. Our principal competitors for this business, in addition to those named above, are: Pershing LLC, FNZ UK Ltd., Temenos Group AG, Avaloq, SS&#38;C Technologies, Fiserv, Inc. and smaller technology firms. We also consider &#8220;in-house&#8221; solutions to be a form of competition. 

This segment also offers investment management and distribution programs for banks, wealth managers and other financial services intermediaries. These programs start with SEI&#8217;s standard investment solutions, strategies, funds, and investment services. We can also deliver customized solutions including asset management strategies, as well as investment manager and portfolio research services. Increasingly, asset management distributors with established platforms are seeking to grow their businesses by offering broader investment solutions while outsourcing non-client facing investment services activities. We believe we offer our distribution partners a cost-effective way to grow their businesses and offer their investors differentiated investment choices, such as SEI&#8217;s goal-based investing solution. 

We estimate we have business relationships with approximately 333 &#32;banks, wealth managers and other financial services intermediaries at December 31, 2015 . Our definition of an asset management distribution client for this segment includes financial intermediaries who have exceeded a minimal level of customer assets invested in our investment products. With the growth of our business, the minimal level of customer assets which defines a "business relationship" is adjusted from time to time. Our business is primarily based on approximately 92 &#32;asset management distribution clients who, at December 31, 2015 , had at least $5.0 million each in customer assets invested in our programs. We also had single-product relationships with approximately 90 &#32;additional banks and trust institutions. The principal competitors for this business are: Federated Investors, Inc., Russell Investment Group, Fidelity Investments, Franklin Templeton Investments, discretionary portfolio managers and various multi-manager investment programs offered by other firms. We also consider &#8220;in-house&#8221; proprietary asset management capabilities to be a form of long-term competition. 

Investment Advisors 

The Investment Advisors segment offers investment management solutions throughout the United States to registered investment advisors, financial planners and life insurance agents, many of whom are registered with independent broker-dealers. These solutions include our investment management programs and back-office investment processing outsourcing services and are usually offered on a bundled basis. We also help advisors manage and grow their businesses by giving them access to our marketing support programs and our practice management services which include, for example, workflow recommendations, succession planning advice, business assessment assistance and recommended management practices. We believe our solutions help investment advisors reduce risk, improve quality and gain operational efficiency which allows them to devote more of their resources to acquiring new clients and achieving better outcomes for their existing clients. 

Advisors are responsible for the investor relationship which includes creating financial plans, implementing investment strategies and educating and servicing their customers. Advisors may customize portfolios to include separate account managers provided through our programs as well as SEI-sponsored mutual funds. Our wealth and investment programs are designed to be attractive to affluent or high-net-worth individual investors and small to medium-sized institutional retirement plans. 

We continually enhance our offering to meet the emerging needs of our advisors and their end clients. We anticipate the enhanced service offerings enabled through the SEI Wealth Platform will provide a more diverse range of back-office, front-office and client-facing investment processing outsourcing services and investment management solutions. In 2015, we began 

Page 6 &#32;of 77 

the official launch of the SEI Wealth Platform and expect to convert larger, more sophisticated advisors onto the Platform in 2016 and beyond. We will also continue our focus on recruiting new advisors and improving net cash flows into our investment management programs. 

We estimate we have business relationships with approximately 6,900 &#32;financial advisors at December 31, 2015 . Our definition of a client for this segment includes financial advisors who have exceeded a minimal level of customer assets invested in our investment products. With the growth of our business, the minimal level of customer assets which defines a "business relationship" is adjusted from time to time. Our business is primarily based on approximately 1,725 &#32;investment advisors who, at December 31, 2015 , had at least $5.0 million each in customer assets invested in our programs. Revenues are earned largely as a percentage of average assets under management. 

The principal competition for our investment management products is from other money managers, other turnkey asset management providers, mutual fund companies, custody service providers and the proprietary investment management programs of broker dealers. In the advisor distributor channel, the principal competitors include AssetMark Investment Services Inc., Brinker Capital, EnvestNet Asset Management, Inc., Fidelity Investments, TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab &#38; Co., Inc., and other broker-dealers. As we introduce the Platform, we expect to more directly compete with custody service providers. 

Institutional Investors 

The Institutional Investors segment offers fiduciary management solutions (sometimes referred to as Outsourced Chief Investment Officer - OCIO solutions) for retirement plan sponsors, healthcare systems, and not-for-profit organizations globally. We have a broadly experienced team with specific expertise in defined benefit plans, defined contribution plans, endowments, foundations and balance sheet assets. 

Our clients benefit from solutions that combine the breadth of SEI&#8217;s investment management, administration, and advisory services. Depending on their needs, objectives, and risk tolerance, clients can elect to retain control of, or outsource, specific management functions. As a result, they can integrate SEI&#8217;s investment process, plan administration services, and advisory services into their existing best practices. Our approach is designed to reduce business risk, provide ongoing due diligence, and increase operational efficiency. 

SEI&#8217;s open architecture investment management approach provides access to manager research, manager selection and monitoring, portfolio construction and discretionary management. Plan administration services include trustee, custodial, and benefit payment services. Advisory services include scenario modeling and customization of an asset allocation plan that is designed to meet long-term objectives. 

In 2016 , we expect to continue to build a globally diversified institutional client base, provide our clients with value-added advice and discretionary services, and place increased emphasis on defined contribution fiduciary management sales opportunities. 

Fees are primarily earned as a percentage of average assets under management calculated using the average of the four month ending balances preceding the billing date. At December 31, 2015 , we had relationships with approximately 470 &#32;investment management clients. The principal competitors for this segment are Mercer, Aon Hewitt, Willis Towers Watson, Russell Investments, Northern Trust Company and other investment consultants. 

Investment Managers 

The Investment Managers segment supplies investment organizations of all types with the advanced operating infrastructure they need to be competitive while navigating a host of business and regulatory challenges. Our comprehensive global operations platform provides asset managers with customized and integrated capabilities in the areas of fund administration, fund accounting, data and information management, investment operations, risk management and compliance support. 

We work with a diverse and sophisticated group of traditional, alternative and sovereign wealth managers, including approximately one-third of the top 100 managers worldwide. Clients choose our full-service offering because of its flexibility, speed and ability to support their diverse business needs across multiple product types and structures, investment strategies and asset classes. Our investment manager clients offer a variety of packaging types, including hedge funds, private equity funds, mutual funds, separate accounts, ETFs, UCITS, unit trusts and closed-end funds. For clients who desire to manage assets within a collective investment trust, we offer trustee and investment management services in addition to the aforementioned administration services. Because our operational platform enables managers to view their business in such a comprehensive and integrated way, it gives them more insight and thus control over their business risks and results. 

Over the past few years, investors have faced multiple market crises and rising volatility. Investment managers have responded with a range of innovative products designed to better manage volatility and downside risk, and many now offer alternatives to 

Page 7 &#32;of 77 

the pure long-only investing strategy historically used in traditional markets. Additionally, as competitiveness will increasingly be based on capabilities other than just investment expertise, we have offered managers solutions that help them gain scale and efficiency, run their businesses more intelligently, and be more responsive to investor needs. We also continually enhance our solutions to anticipate and adapt to economic, regulatory and industry changes. 

In 2016 , we expect to continue our efforts to add new asset managers, grow our existing relationships, expand into new markets and further develop our solutions and global operations platform. 

Contracts for our fund administration outsourcing services generally have terms ranging from three to five years. Fees are primarily earned as a percentage of average assets under management and administration. A portion of the revenues for this segment is earned as account servicing fees. At December 31, 2015 , we had relationships with approximately 256 &#32;investment management companies and alternative investment managers. Our competitors vary according to the asset class or solution provided and include large global custodian banks such as State Street, BNY Mellon and Northern Trust as well as independently owned firms such as SS&#38;C Technologies and Citco. 

Investments in New Businesses 

The Investments in New Businesses segment represents other business ventures or research and development activities intended to expand our solutions to new or existing markets including ultra-high-net-worth families who reside in the United States. This segment also includes the costs associated with the business development in the Middle East through our Dubai office, the development of new internet-based investment services and mobile technologies and the integration of specific front office client management technology purchased in 2012. The family wealth management solution offers flexible family-office type services through a highly personalized solution while utilizing the Manager-of-Managers investment process. 

The principal competitors for the family wealth solution are diversified financial services providers focused on the ultra-high-net-worth market. 

Research and Development 

We are devoting significant resources to research and development, including expenditures for new technology platforms, enhancements to existing technology platforms and new investment products and services. Our research and development expenditures for the last three years were: (all dollar amounts in thousands)

The capitalization of costs incurred in developing computer software in 2013 is exclusive of a one-time contractual payment of $8.8 million &#32;to exercise a conversion option in lieu of periodic fee payments pertaining to a software license for functionality utilized by the SEI Wealth Platform (See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information). Our research and development expenditures are included in Compensation, benefits and other personnel and Consulting, outsourcing and professional fees on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

The majority of our research and development spending is related to building the SEI Wealth Platform, which combines business service processing with asset management and distribution services. The Platform offers to our customers a client-centric, rather than an account-centric, process with model-based portfolio management services through a single platform. The Platform utilizes our proprietary applications with those built by third-party providers and integrates them into a single technology solution, providing a common user experience. This integration supports straight-through business processing and enables the transformation of our clients&#8217; wealth services from operational investment processing services to client value-added services. 

The solution will serve markets in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and continental European markets. The Platform provides the technology infrastructure for the business solutions now being marketed to private banks and independent wealth adviser organizations in the United States and the United Kingdom. We believe the demand for the advanced capabilities of the Platform will enable us to significantly extend, expand and improve the services we offer in the Investment Advisors segment. 

The Platform will eventually be used at some level by most of our business segments representing a significant upgrade to our infrastructure. The Platform will enable SEI and our clients to manage the entire lifecycle of wealth services through a single 

Page 8 &#32;of 77 

solution. The workflow automation, firm&#8217;s business rules and straight through processing to the street will dramatically change the client experience, help firms manage risk and allow for greater transparency. 

The Investment Managers segment is enhancing its business solutions to provide services to other areas of the investment firm. The new platform being developed exclusively for this segment includes components that leverage upon the current infrastructure and add significant enhancements that will aggregate, transact and process data. This platform will significantly enhance data integration and aggregation capabilities, data management services, governance, regulatory, risk and compliance reporting and a more efficient customer data warehouse. 

Marketing and Sales 

Our business solutions are directly marketed to potential clients in our target markets. At January 29, 2016 , we employed approximately 100 &#32;sales representatives who operate from offices located throughout the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, continental Europe, South Africa, Asia and other locations. 

Customers 

In 2015 , no single customer accounted for more than ten percent of revenues in any business segment. 

Personnel 

At January 29, 2016 , we had 2,926 &#32;full-time and 59 &#32;part-time employees. Employee unions do not represent any of our employees. Management considers employee relations to be generally good. 

Regulatory Considerations 

Our principal, regulated wholly-owned subsidiaries are SEI Investments Distribution Co., or SIDCO, SEI Investments Management Corporation, or SIMC, SEI Private Trust Company, or SPTC, SEI Trust Company, or STC, and SEI Investments (Europe) Limited, or SIEL. SIDCO is a broker-dealer registered with the SEC under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA). SIMC is an investment advisor registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) under the Commodity Futures Exchange Act. SPTC is a limited purpose federal thrift chartered and regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. STC is a Pennsylvania trust company, regulated by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities. SIEL is an investment manager and financial institution subject to regulation by the Financial Conduct Authority of the United Kingdom. In addition, various SEI subsidiaries are subject to the jurisdiction of regulatory authorities in Canada, the Republic of Ireland and other foreign countries. The Company has a minority ownership interest of approximately 39.2 percent &#32;in LSV, which is also an investment advisor registered with the SEC. 

The Company, its regulated subsidiaries, their regulated services and solutions and their customers are all subject to extensive legislation, regulation and supervision that recently has been subject to, and continues to experience, significant change and increased regulatory activity. These changes and regulatory activities could have a material adverse effect on us and our clients. 

The various governmental agencies and self-regulatory authorities that regulate or supervise the Company and its subsidiaries have broad administrative powers. In the event of a failure to comply with laws, regulations and requirements of these agencies and authorities, the possible sanctions that may be imposed include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on our ability to engage in business for specified periods of time, the revocation of applicable registration as a broker-dealer, investment advisor or other regulated entity, and, as the case may be, censures and fines. Additionally, certain securities and banking laws applicable to us and our subsidiaries provide for certain private rights of action that could give rise to civil litigation. Any litigation could have significant financial and non-financial consequences including monetary judgments and the requirement to take action or limit activities that could ultimately affect our business. 

Governmental scrutiny from regulators, legislative bodies and law enforcement agencies with respect to matters relating to our regulated subsidiaries and their activities, services and solutions, our business practices, our past actions and other matters has increased dramatically in the past several years. Responding to these examinations, investigations, actions and lawsuits, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the proceeding, is time consuming and expensive and can divert the time and effort of our senior management from our business. Penalties and fines sought by regulatory authorities have increased substantially over the last several years, and certain regulators have been more likely in recent years to commence enforcement actions or to advance or support legislation targeted at the financial services industry. We continue to be subject to inquiries from examinations and investigations by supervisory and enforcement divisions of regulatory authorities and expect this to continue in the future. We believe this is also the case with many of our regulated clients. Governmental scrutiny and legal and enforcement proceedings can also have a negative impact on our reputation, our relationship with clients and prospective clients, and on the morale and performance of our employees, which could adversely affect our businesses and results of operations.

We are subject to the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, which contains anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and requires implementation of regulations applicable to financial services companies, including standards for verifying client identification and monitoring client transactions and detecting and reporting suspicious activities. Anti-money laundering laws outside the United States contain similar requirements. We offer investment and banking solutions that also are subject to regulation by the federal and state securities and banking authorities, as well as foreign regulatory authorities, where applicable. Existing or future regulations that affect these solutions could lead to a reduction in sales of these solutions or require modifications of these solutions. 

Compliance with existing and future regulations and responding to and complying with recent increased regulatory activity affecting broker-dealers, investment advisors, investment companies, financial institutions and their service providers could have a significant impact on us. We periodically undergo regulatory examinations and respond to regulatory inquiries and document requests. In addition, recent legislative activity in the United States (including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and attendant rule making activities) and in other jurisdictions (including the European Union and the United Kingdom) have made and continue to make extensive changes to the laws regulating financial services firms. As a result of these examinations, inquiries and requests, as a result of increased civil litigation activity, and as a result of these new laws and regulations, we engage legal counsel, review our compliance procedures, solution and service offerings, and business operations, and make changes as we deem necessary. These additional activities and required changes may result in increased expense or may reduce revenues. 

Our bank clients are subject to supervision by federal and state banking authorities concerning the manner in which such clients purchase and receive our products and services. Our plan sponsor clients and our subsidiaries providing services to those clients are subject to supervision by the Department of Labor and compliance with employee benefit regulations. Investment advisor and broker-dealer clients are regulated by the SEC, state securities authorities, or FINRA. Existing or future regulations applicable to our clients may affect our clients&#8217; purchase of our products and services. 

In addition, see the discussion of governmental regulations in Item 1A &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; for a description of the risks that proposed regulatory changes may present for our business.
