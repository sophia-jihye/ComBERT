 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

OVERVIEW 

Dolby Laboratories creates audio and imaging technologies that transform entertainment and communications at the cinema, at home, at work and on mobile devices. Founded in 1965, our strengths stem from expertise in digital signal processing and compression technologies that have transformed the ability of artists to convey entertainment experiences to their audiences through recorded media. Such technologies led to the development of our noise-reduction systems for analog tape recordings, and have since evolved into multiple offerings that enable more immersive sound for cinema, digital television transmissions and devices, OTT video services, DVD and Blu-ray Discs, gaming consoles, and mobile devices. Today, we derive the majority of our revenue from licensing our audio technologies. We also derive revenue from licensing our consumer imaging and communication technologies, as well as audio and imaging technologies for premium cinema offerings in collaboration with exhibitors. Finally, we provide products and services for a variety of applications in the cinema, broadcast and communications markets. 

OUR STRATEGY 

Key elements of our strategy include: 

Advancing the Science of Sight and Sound. We apply our understanding of the human senses, audio and imaging engineering to develop technologies aimed at improving how people experience and interact with their entertainment and communications content.

We have various licensing models: a two-tier model, an integrated licensing model, a patent licensing model, and more recently, collaboration arrangements. 

Two-Tier Licensing Model . Most of our consumer entertainment licensing business consists of a two-tier licensing model whereby our decoding technologies, included in reference software and firmware code, are first provided under license to semiconductor manufacturers whom we refer to as &#8220;implementation licensees.&#8221; Implementation licensees incorporate our technologies in ICs which they sell to OEMs of consumer entertainment products, whom we refer to as &#8220;system licensees.&#8221; System licensees separately obtain licenses from us that allow them to make and sell end-user products using ICs that incorporate our technologies. 

Implementation licensees pay us a one-time, up-front fee per license. In exchange, the licensee receives a licensing package which includes information useful in implementing our technologies into their chipsets. Once implemented, the licensee sends us a sample chipset for quality control evaluation, and following our validation of the design, the licensee is permitted to sell the chipset for use solely to our network of system licensees. 

System licensees provide us with prototypes of products, or self-test results of products that incorporate our technologies. Upon our confirmation that our technologies are optimally and consistently incorporated, the system licensee may buy ICs under a license for the same Dolby technology from our network of implementation licensees, and may further sell approved products to retailers, distributors, and consumers. For the use of our technologies, our system licensees pay an initial licensing fee as well as royalties, which represent the majority of the revenue recognized from these arrangements. The amount of royalties we collect on a particular product depends on several factors including the nature of the implementations, the mix of Dolby technologies used, and the volume of products using our technologies that are shipped by the system licensee. 

Integrated Licensing Model . We also license our technologies to software operating system vendors and ISVs, and to certain other OEMs that act as combined implementation and system licensees. These licensees incorporate our technologies in their software used on PCs, in mobile applications, or in ICs they manufacture and incorporate into their products. As with the two-tier licensing model, the combined implementation and system licensee pays us an initial licensing fee in addition to royalties as determined by the mix of Dolby technologies used, the nature of the implementations, and the volume of products using our technologies that are shipped, and is subject to the same quality control evaluation process. 

Patent Licensing Model. We license our patents through patent pools which are arrangements between multiple patent owners to jointly offer and license pooled patents to licensees. We also license our patents directly to manufacturers that use our IP in their products. Finally, we generate service fees for managing patent pools on behalf of third party patent owners through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Via Licensing Corporation. By aggregating and offering pooled IP, patent pools deliver efficiencies that reduce transactional costs for both IP owners and licensees. The Via Licensing patent pools enable product manufacturers to efficiently and transparently secure patent licenses for audio coding, interactive television, digital radio and wireless technologies. We offer our AAC, AVC, HE-AAC, HEVC and other IP through patent licensing. Currently, most of our revenue earned from patent licensing relates to the licensing of AAC and HE-AAC technologies. 

Collaboration Arrangements. &#160; 

Dolby Cinema: We partner with exhibitors to create a premium cinema offering with Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos at new and pre-existing venues that are optimized for an immersive entertainment experience. We receive a portion of box-office receipts from the installed theaters. 

Dolby Voice: We enter into arrangements with audio and video conferencing providers where, in return for licensing our IP and know-how, we earn revenue based on access to our technology and services as well as on sales of the Dolby Voice Conference Phone (see "Products" below). 

Settlements &#38; Back Payments From Licensees: Licensing revenue recognized in any given quarter may include back payments and/or settlements with licensees. Within the Results of Operations section of Item 7 " Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, " settlements and back payments are collectively referred to as "recoveries." Such recoveries have become a recurring element of our business which we cannot predict with certainty. 

Products 

We design and manufacture audio and imaging products for the cinema, television, broadcast, and entertainment industries. Distributed in over 80 &#32; countries, these products are used in content creation, distribution, and playback to enhance image and sound quality, and improve transmission and playback. We also market and sell the Dolby Conference Phone which optimizes the conference call experience when using Dolby Voice.

Services 

We offer various services to support theatrical and television production for cinema exhibition, broadcast, and home entertainment, including equipment training and maintenance, mixing room alignment, equalization, as well as audio, color and light image calibration. 

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 

We have a substantial base of IP assets, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets developed based on our technical expertise. 

As of September 30, 2016 , we had approximately 6,600 &#32;issued patents and approximately 4,200 &#32;pending patent applications in more than 90 &#32;jurisdictions throughout the world. Our currently issued patents expire at various times through September 2040 . 

Some of our patents relating to DD technologies, from which we derive a significant, but declining portion of our licensing revenue, have expired and others will expire over the next several years. The primary products where DD is widely used include DVD players (but not Blu-ray players), TVs, and STBs. We have transitioned a number of our DD licensees to DD+ technologies, an extension of our DD technologies, whose patents generally expire later than the DD patents. We are continuing to make progress in transitioning other DD licensees to DD+, technologies from which we derive the majority of our licensing revenue. 

We pursue a general practice of filing patent applications for our technologies in the U.S. and foreign countries where our customers manufacture, distribute, or sell licensed products. We actively pursue new applications to expand our patent portfolio to address new technological innovations. We have multiple patents covering aspects and improvements for many of our technologies. 

We have approximately 1,000 &#32;trademark registrations throughout the world for a variety of wordmarks, logos, and slogans. Our trademarks cover our various products, technologies, improvements, and features, as well as the services that we provide. These trademarks are an integral part of our technology licensing program, and licensees typically elect to place our trademarks on their products to inform consumers that their products incorporate our technology and meet our quality specifications. 

We protect our IP rights both domestically and internationally. From time to time, we experience problems with OEMs of consumer entertainment products in emerging economies. OEMs have failed to report or have underreported shipments of their products that incorporate our technologies. We have also had problems with implementation licensees selling ICs with our technologies to third parties that are not system licensees. We anticipate that such problems will continue to occur. We have taken steps in the past to enforce our IP rights and expect to do so in the future. 

Moreover, we have relatively few or no issued patents in certain countries. For example, in China, Taiwan, and India, we have only limited patent protection for our Dolby technologies. Consequently, we may realize less revenue for DD technologies from those regions in the future. Maintaining or growing our licensing revenue in developing countries such as China, Taiwan, and India will depend in part, on our ability to obtain patent rights in these countries, which is uncertain. Further, because of the limitations of the legal systems in many countries, the effectiveness of patents obtained or that may in the future be obtained, if any, is uncertain. 

INDUSTRY STANDARDS 

Several Dolby technologies have been adopted as the explicit or de facto industry standard for broadcast, discrete media and online delivery in various markets worldwide. 

Explicit industry standards are adopted through a standardization process whereby government entities, industry standards-setting bodies, trade associations, and others evaluate, and then prescribe the use of a technology. For example, as global broadcast standards for digital, HD and UHD television have developed, Dolby audio technologies have been adopted or mandated in various regions of the world, highlights of which are as follows: 

&#8226; 

DD+ and HE-AAC are mandated for use in terrestrial broadcast across many countries including France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Germany, Poland, Turkey and Russia. In addition, DD+ and HE-AAC are included in the digital terrestrial television specifications of emerging digital TV markets in Africa, South-East Asia and India while China has selected DD and DD+ as optional technologies for the country&#8217;s digital terrestrial television specification. 

&#8226; 

DD+ is the de facto technology used by a wide range of pay-TV operators and streaming services worldwide, such as Netflix, and is included in popular operating systems such as iOS and Windows. 

&#8226; 

DD is mandated for HD broadcast in multiple regions including North America and South Korea, and for DVD players on a global basis. 

&#8226; 

AC-4 is Dolby&#8217;s next generation of audio technology that is in the process of being adopted by worldwide standards organizations. 

In addition, Dolby technologies have become de facto industry standards in many consumer entertainment products. De facto industry standards are adopted by industry participants when technologies are introduced to the marketplace and become widely used. For example, prior to the adoption of HD terrestrial broadcast standards mandating Dolby technologies, many European HD broadcasters began broadcasting in DD or DD+, leading OEMs to include these technologies in their televisions and STBs for the European market. 

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 

We conduct R&#38;D activities at numerous locations both in the U.S. and internationally. Dolby&#8217;s history of producing innovative technology has created many forms of IP. When licensed from us, this IP generates revenue that enables further innovation. 

For much of the Company's history, we focused the majority of our R&#38;D resources on audio technologies. In recent years, we have expanded our efforts to identify and develop new technologies beyond the strong audio platform that comprises most of our revenue to include audio conferencing and imaging technologies. Each of these technologies can support many offerings, and we anticipate bringing new products to market using these platforms in the future.

PRODUCT MANUFACTURING 

Our product quality is enabled through the use of well-established, and in some cases, highly automated, assembly processes along with rigorous testing of our products. Although we have some manufacturing facilities, we rely primarily upon contract manufacturers for the majority of our production capacity. We purchase components and fabricated parts from multiple suppliers; however, we rely on sole source suppliers for certain components used to manufacture our products. We source components and fabricated parts both locally and globally. 

SALES AND MARKETING 

Our marketing efforts focus on demonstrating how our solutions improve entertainment and communications. We sell our solutions primarily using an internal sales organization to various customers in the markets where we operate. We promote our solutions and our brand through industry events such as trade-shows, film festivals, movie premieres, product launches, as well as through our website, public relations, direct marketing, co-marketing programs and social media. In addition, we hold the naming rights to the Dolby Theatre, home to the Academy Awards&#174; in Hollywood, California, where we showcase our technology and host high-profile events. 

We maintain more than twenty &#32;sales offices in key regions around the globe. S&#38;M expenses included in our consolidated statements of operations were as follows (in thousands):

Some of our current and future competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, and other resources than we do, or may have more experience or advantages in the markets in which they compete. For example, some of our current or potential competitors may have an advantage over us based on greater experience in certain technology markets. In addition, some of our current or potential competitors may be able to offer integrated systems in certain markets for entertainment technologies, including audio, imaging, and digital rights management technologies, which could make competing technologies that we develop or acquire obsolete. By offering an integrated system solution, these potential competitors may also be able to offer competing technologies at lower prices than we can, which could adversely affect our operating results. 

Many products that include our audio and imaging technologies also include technologies developed by our competitors. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets include some or all of the following: 

&#8226; 

Degree of access and inclusion in industry standards; 

&#8226; 

Technological performance, flexibility, and range of application; 

&#8226; 

Brand recognition and reputation; 

&#8226; 

Timeliness and relevance of new product introductions; 

&#8226;
