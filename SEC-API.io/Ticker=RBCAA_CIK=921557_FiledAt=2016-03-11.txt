General Business Overview 

As of December 31, 201 5 , the Company was divided into four distinct operating segments: Traditional Banking, Warehouse , Mortgage Banking and RPG. Management considers the first three segments to collectively constitute &#x201C;Core Bank&#x201D; or &#x201C;Core Banking&#x201D; activities. Correspondent Lending operations are considered part of Traditional Banking operations. The RPG segment includes the following divisions: TRS, RPS and RC S . TRS generates the majority of RPG&#x2019;s income, with the relatively smaller divisions of RPG, RPS and RCS, considered immaterial for separate and independent segment reporting. All divisions of the RPG segment operate through the Bank.

The Company &#x2019;s pending acquisition of Cornerstone Bancorp, Inc. (&#x201C;Cornerstone&#x201D;), and its wholly-owned bank subsidiary Cornerstone Community Bank, is expected to close during the first half of 2016 for approximately $32.3 million in cash. The acquisition of Cornerstone will expand the Company&#x2019;s footprint in the Tampa, Florida metropolitan statistical area . On December 31, 2015, Cornerstone operated four banking centers in the Tampa, Florida metropolitan statistical area, with approximately $250 million in total assets, approximately $190 million in loans and approximately $200 million in deposits. 

For additional information concerning the Company&#x2019;s acquisition of Cornerstone Bancorp, Inc., see Footnote 2 &#x201C;Acquisition (Subsequent Event) &#x201D; of Part II Item 8 &#x201C;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#x201D; 

(I) Traditional Banking segment 

Lending Activities 

The Bank&#x2019;s principal lending activities consists of the following: 

Retail Mortgage Lending &#x2014; Through its retail banking centers detailed above, its Correspondent Lending channel and its Internet Banking channel, the Bank originates single family, residential real estate loans. In addition, the Bank originates home equity amortizing l oans (&#x201C;HEAL&#x201D;) and home equity lines of credit (&#x201C;HELOCs&#x201D;) through its retail banking centers. All such loans are generally collateralized by owner occupied property. In 2015, the Bank embarked o n an aggressive marketing campaign to increase its HELOCs utilizing a promotional rate product. Under the terms of the promotional product during 2015, clients received a fixed interest rate of 1.99% for the first twelve months with no up front closing costs. When the promotional rate expires after twelve months, rates are adjusted to an index based on the New York Prime Rate (&#x201C;Prime&#x201D;). During January 2016, the Company increased its offering rate on the promotional product to 2.99% for the first twelve months with no up front closing costs. 

For those loans originated through the Bank&#x2019;s retail banking centers, the collateral is predominately located in the Bank&#x2019;s market footprint, while loans originated through the Correspondent Lending channel and Internet Banking are generally secured by owner occupied collateral located outside of the Bank&#x2019;s market footprint. All mortgage loans retained on balance sheet are included as a component of the Company&#x2019;s &#x201C;Traditional Banking&#x201D; segment and are discussed below and elsewhere in this filing. 

The Bank offers single family, first lien residential real estate, adjustable rate mortgages (&#x201C;ARM&#x201D;s) with interest rate adjustments tied to various market indices with specified minimum and maximum adjustments. The Bank generally charges a higher interest rate for its ARMs if the property is not owner occupied. The interest rates on the majority of ARMs are adjusted after their fixed rate periods on an annual basis, with most having annual and lifetime limitations on upward rate adjustments to the loan. These loans typically feature amortization periods of up to 30 years and have fixed interest rate periods generally ranging from five to ten years, with demand dependent upon market conditions. In general, ARMs containing longer fixed rate periods have historically been more attractive to the Bank&#x2019;s clients in a relatively low rate environment, while ARMs with shorter fixed rate periods have historically been more attractive to the Bank&#x2019;s clients in a relatively high rate environment. While there is no requirement for clients to refinance their loans at the end of the fixed rate period, clients have historically done so the majority of the time, as most clients are interest rate risk-averse on their first mortgage loans. 

Depending on the term and amount of the ARM, loans collateralized by single family, owner-occupied first lien residential real estate may be originated with a loan-to-value (&#x201C;LTV&#x201D;) up to 90% and a combined LTV up to 100%. During the fourth quarter of 2013, the Bank introduced a 100% LTV product for home purchase transactions within its primary markets. The Bank does not require the borrower to obtain private mortgage insurance for ARM loans. Except for the HEAL product under $150,000, the Bank requires mortgagee&#x2019;s title insurance on single family, first lien residential real estate loans to protect the Bank against defects in its liens on the properties that collateralize the loans. The Bank normally requires title, fire, and extended casualty insurance to be obtained by the borrower and when required by applicable regulations, flood insurance. The Bank maintains an errors and omissions insurance policy to protect the Bank against loss in the event a borrower fails to maintain proper fire and other hazard insurance policies. 

Single family, first lien residential ARMs originated prior to January 10, 2014 generally contain an early termination penalty (&#x201C;ETP&#x201D;). Effective January 10, 2014, with the implementation of the Ability to Repay (&#x201C;ATR&#x201D;) Rule, the Bank eliminated ETPs for newly originated ARMs. 

Single family, first lien residential real estate loans with fixed rate periods of 15, 20 and 30 years are primarily sold into the secondary market. MSRs attached to the sold portfolio are either sold along with the loan or retained. All loans sold into the secondary market along with their corresponding MSRs are included as a component of the Company&#x2019;s &#x201C;Mortgage Banking&#x201D; segment as discussed elsewhere in this filing. The Bank, as it has in the past, may retain such longer-term fixed rate loans from time - to - time in the future to help combat market compression. Any such loans retained on balance sheet would be reported as a component of the Traditional Banking segment. 

For additional information regarding the Bank&#x2019;s interest rate sensitivity, see the section titled &#x201C;Asset/Liability Management and Market Risk&#x201D; under Part II Item 7 &#x201C;Management&#x2019;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial condition and Results of Operations.&#x201D; 

The Bank does, on occasion, purchase single family, first lien residential real estate loans in low-to-moderate income areas in order to meet its obligations under the Community Reinvestment Act (&#x201C;CRA&#x201D;). The Bank generally applies secondary market underwriting criteria to the review of these purchased loan portfolios and generally reserves the right to reject particular loans from a loan package being purchased that do not meet its underwriting criteria. In connection with loan purchases, the Bank receives various representations and warranties from the sellers of the loans regarding the quality and characteristics of the loans. 

In January 2014, the CFPB&#x2019;s final rule implementing the ATR requirements in the Dodd-Frank Act became effective. The rule, among other things, requires lenders to consider a consumer&#x2019;s ability to repay a mortgage loan before extending credit to the consumer and limits prepayment penalties. The rule provides a presumption of compliance with the ATR requirements and certain protections from liability for a mortgage loan meeting the parameters of a qualified mortgage (&#x201C; QM &#x201D;) . While regulatory agencies have explained that there is no legal requirement or supervisory expectation to originate any QMs at all, transactions covered by the ATR requirements that do not meet the parameters of a QM, i.e. &#x201C;non-QMs,&#x201D; do not maintain the presumed protections from liability like their QM counterparts. 

Management believes that ARM loans originated through the Bank&#x2019;s retail origination channel during 2014 were predominantly QMs; however, the Bank made strategic changes to its underwriting guidelines in 2015 that resulted in the substantial majority of ARM loans originated through its retail origination channel to be non-QMs. Management made these strategic changes to provide a better client experience for the Bank&#x2019;s mortgage loan clients and to reduce the overall costs to the Bank of originating loans subject to the QM parameters. Management still expects all of its ARM loans to meet the ATR requirements.

&#x201C;Supervision and Regulation&#x201D; in this section of the filing 

&#xB7; 

Part I Item 1A &#x201C;Risk Factors&#x201D; 

Commercial Lending &#x2014; The Bank&#x2019;s Commercial and Corporate Banking department (the &#x201C;CCB Department&#x201D;) is co mposed of Corporate Banking, Commercial Finance , Municipal Lending, and Republic Realty. All credit approvals and processing for this Division are prepared and underwritten through the Bank&#x2019;s existing Credit Administration Department (&#x201C;CAD&#x201D;) . 

Corporate Banking &#x2019;s marketing focus is locally-based companies within the Bank&#x2019;s market footprint, typically with revenues of $15 million to $150 million. Credit opportunities are generally driven by the following: companies expanding their businesses; companies acquiring new businesses; generational transfers from existing owners to children, existing management, or employees (Employee Stock Ownership Plans); and refinancing of existing debt at other banks. Corporate Banking&#x2019;s primary product focus is Commercial &amp; Industrial (&#x201C;C&amp;I&#x201D;) l ending , and t o a lesser degree, Co mmercial Real Estate (&#x201C;CRE&#x201D;) o pportunities. The targeted C&amp;I credit size for client relationships is $2.5 million to $25 million , with limited exceptions for corporate borrowers of the highest credit quality . It is the Bank&#x2019;s goal to be the primary bank for these clients including obtaining the clients&#x2019; full depository relationships as well. On an exception basis, for large locally-based public institutions, the Bank may consider participations in larger credit facilities. In these cases, the client is not expected to maintain its primary banking relationship with the Bank . 

C&amp;I l oans typically include those secured by General Business Assets (&#x201C;GBA&#x201D;), which consist of equipment, accounts receivable, inventory, and othe r business assets owned by the borrower/g uarantor. Credit facilities include annually renewable lines of credit and term lo ans with maturities typically from three to seven years, and may also involve quarterly financial covenant requirements . These reporting requirements are monitored by the Bank&#x2019;s CAD . Underwri ting C&amp;I l oans is based on the b orrower&#x2019;s financial capacity to repay these loans from its E arn ings Before I n terest, T ax es, Depreciation and A mortization (&#x201C;EBITDA&#x201D;) , with c apital strength, collateral and management experience also important underwriting considerations. 

The Commercial Finance Group targets financing for equipment, typically ranging from $100,000 to $500, 000 per unit financed with five to seven year terms. Credit exposures to individual relationships ar e expected to be $500,000 to $5 million . It is not a requirement in this area that the Bank maintain the borrower&#x2019;s primary banking relationship . Both leasing and lending are used to accommodate f inancing needs, with EBITDA, company financial history, an d collateral values/useful life primary underwriting considerations. 

The Municipal Lending Area respond s to financing requests from cities and counties, largely in the state of Ke ntucky and in southern Indiana. The Bank issues general obligation and/or appropriation leases/l oans to cities and counties. G eneral o bligation leases/loans range between $100,000 to $5 million , with leases above $5 million requir ing approval from the Bank&#x2019;s Executive Loan Committee . Appropriation l eases generally do not exceed $1 million . It is not a requirement in this area that the Bank maintain the client&#x2019;s primary banking relationship. 

The B ank started Republic Realty in 2015 to focus on stabilized CRE loans with low leverage and strong cash flows. The majority of interest rates offered are based on the 30-day London Interbank Offered Rate (&#x201C; LIBOR &#x201D;) . Fixed rates are facilitated to borrowers with terms o f up to 10 years, by utilizing interest rate s wap s . In some cases, limited or non-recourse (of owners) loans will be issued, based upon the capital position, cash flows, and stabilization of the borrowing entity. Most all borrowers are single-asset entities. Loan sizes will typically range from $3 million up to $25 million. Loans will be located within the Bank&#x2019;s market footprint or within adjacent markets. Primary underwriting considerations are property cash flow (current and historical), quality of leases, financial capacity of sponsors, and collateral value of property financed. 

The Bank&#x2019;s CRE and multi-family loans are typically secured by improved property such as office buildings, medical facilities, retail centers, warehouses, apartment buildings, condominiums, schools, religious institutions and other types of commercial use property. 

During 2015 , while continuing to increase its total commercial-related loan portfolio, the Bank strategically diversif ied its commercial loan mix by increasing the ratio of C&amp;I loans to total commercial loans and conversely decreasing the ratio of CRE loans to total commercial loans. At December 31, 2015 , the CRE, C&amp;I and Lease Financing Receivables (&#x201C; LFR &#x201D;) classes accounted for 78%, 21% and 1%, respectively, of the commercial lending portfolio, compared to 83%, 16% and less than 1%, respectively, at December 31, 2014. The Bank looks to continue this trend in the near-term . 

Construction and Land Development Lending &#x2014; The Bank originates residential construction real estate loans to finance the construction of single family dwellings. Such loans may be made to contractors to build single family dwellings under contract or directly to consumers . Construction loans are generally offered on the same basis as other single family, first lien residential real estate loans, except that a larger percentage down payment is typically required. 

Construction loans are structured either to be converted to permanent loans with the Bank at the end of the construction phase or to be paid off at closing . R esidential properties are generally made in amounts up to 8 0% of anticipated cost of construction. L oans to developers and builders generally have terms of nine to twelve months. Loan proceeds on builders&#x2019; projects are typically disbursed in increments as construction progresses and as property inspections warrant. 

The Bank also originates land development loans to real estate developers for the acquisition, development and construction of commercial projects. Such loans may involve additional risks because the funds are advanced to fund the project while under construction, and the project is of speculative value prior to completion. Moreover, because it is relatively difficult to evaluate completion value accurately, the total amount of funds required to complete a development may be subject to change. Repayments of these loans depend to a large degree on the conditions in the real estate market or the economy. 

Internet Lending &#x2014; The Bank accepts online loan applications through its website, www.republicbank.com. Historically, the majority of loans originated through the internet have been within the Bank&#x2019;s traditional markets of Kentucky and Indiana. Other states where loans are marketed include Tennessee, Florida, Ohio, Virginia, and Minnesota, as well as, the District of Columbia. 

Correspondent Lending &#x2014; The Bank began acquiring single family, first lien mortgage loans for investment through its Correspondent Lending channel in May 2014. Correspondent Lending generally involves the Bank acquiring, primarily from its Warehouse clients, closed loans that meet the Bank&#x2019;s specifications. Substantially all loans purchased through the Correspondent Lending channel are purchased at a premium. Premiums on loans acquired though the Correspondent Lending channel are amortized into interest income on the level-yield method over the expected life of the loan. L oans acquired through the Correspondent Lending channel are generally made to borrowers outside of the Bank&#x2019;s market footprint. As of December 31, 2015, a substantial majority of loans originated through the Company&#x2019;s Correspondent Lending channel were secured by single family residences located in the state of California. 

Consumer Lending &#x2014; Traditional consumer loans made by the Bank include home improvement and home equity loans, as well as other secured and unsecured personal loans in addition to credit cards. With the exception of home equity loans, which are actively marketed in conjunction with single family, first lien residential real estate loans, other traditional consumer loan products, while available, are not and have not been actively promoted in the Bank&#x2019;s markets. 

T he Bank began acquiring unsecured consumer installment loans for investment from a third-party originator in April 2014. Such consumer loans are purchased at par and are selected by the Bank based on certa in underwriting characteristics . 

Indirect Lending &#x2013; In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Bank initiated a formal indirect lending division to grow its presence in the consumer auto loan market . The program involves setting up relationships with automobile dealers in the Bank&#x2019;s market footprint and obtaining new loans in a low cost delivery method. Management believes that this initiative also places the Bank in a position to enter f loor p lan lending in 2016.

The Bank&#x2019;s other Traditional Banking activities generally consists of the following: 

Private Banking &#x2014; The Bank provides financial products and services to high net worth individuals through its Private Banking Department. The Bank&#x2019;s Private Banking officers have extensive banking experience and are trained to meet the unique financial needs of this clientele. 

Treasury Management Services &#x2014; The Bank provides various deposit products designed for commercial business clients located throughout its market footprint . Lockbox processing, remote deposit capture, business on-line banking, account reconciliation and Automated Clearing House (&#x201C;ACH&#x201D;) processing are additional services offered to commercial businesses through the Bank&#x2019;s Treasury Management Department. 

Internet Banking &#x2014; The Bank expands its market penetration and service delivery by offering clients Internet Banking services and products through its website, www.republicbank.com. 

Mobile Banking &#x2014; The Bank allows clients to easily and securely access and manage their accounts through its mobile banking application. 

Other Banking Services &#x2014; The Bank also provides trust, title insurance and other financial institution related products and services. 

Bank Acquisitions &#x2014; The Bank maintains an acquisition strategy to selectively grow its franchise as a complement to its organic growth strategies. T he Company expects to complete its pending acquisition of Cornerstone Bancorp, Inc., headquartered in St. Petersburg, Florida during the first half of 2016 . 

See additional discussion regarding the Traditional Banking segment under Footnote 23 &#x201C;Segment Information&#x201D; of Part II Item 8 &#x201C;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#x201D; 

(II) Warehouse Lending segment 

The Bank provides short-term, revolving credit facilities to mortgage bankers across the United States through mortgage warehouse lines of credit. These credit facilities are secured by single family, first lien residential real estate loans. The credit facility enables the mortgage banking clients to close single family, first lien residential real estate loans in their own name and temporarily fund their inventory of these closed loans until the loans are sold to investors approved by the Bank or purchased by the Bank through its Correspondent Lending channel. Individual loans are expected to remain on the warehouse line for an average of 15 to 30 days. Interest income and loan fees are accrued for each individual loan during the time the loan remains on the warehouse line and collected when the loan is sold. The Bank receives the sale proceeds of each loan directly from the investor and applies the funds to pay off the warehouse advance and related accrued interest and fees. The remaining proceeds are credited to the mortgage banking client. 

See additional discussion regarding the Warehouse Lending segment under Footnote 23 &#x201C;Segment Information&#x201D; of Part II Item 8 &#x201C;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#x201D; 

(III) Mortgage Banking segment 

Mortgage Banking activities primarily include 15-, 20- and 30-year fixed-term single family, first lien residential real estate loans that are sold into the secondary market, primarily to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (&#x201C;FHLMC&#x201D; or &#x201C;Freddie Mac&#x201D;). The Bank typically retains servicing on loans sold into the secondary market. Administration of loans with servicing retained by the Bank includes collecting principal and interest payments, escrowing funds for property taxes and property insurance and remitting payments to secondary market investors. A fee is received by the Bank for performing these standard servicing functions. 

As part of the sale of loans with servicing retained, the Bank records MSRs. MSRs represent an estimate of the present value of future cash servicing income, net of estimated costs, which the Bank expects to receive on loans sold with servicing retained by the Bank. MSRs are capitalized as separate assets. This transaction is posted to net gain on sale of loans, a component of &#x201C;Mortgage Banking income&#x201D; in the income statement. Management considers all relevant factors, in addition to pricing considerations from other servicers, to estimate the fair value of the MSRs to be recorded when the loans are initially sold with servicing retained by the Bank. The carrying value of MSRs is initially amortized in proportion to and over the estimated period of net servicing income and subsequently adjusted quarterly based on the weighted average remaining life of the underlying loans. The MSR amortization is recorded as a reduction to net servicing income, a component of Mortgage Banking income. 

With the assistance of an independent third party, the MSRs asset is reviewed at least quarterly for impairment based on the fair value of the MSRs using groupings of the underlying loans by interest rates. Any impairment of a grouping is reported as a valuation allowance. A primary factor influencing the fair value is the estimated life of the underlying loans serviced. The estimated life of the loans serviced is significantly influenced by market interest rates. During a period of declining interest rates, the fair value of the MSRs is expected to decline due to increased anticipated prepayment speed assumptions within the portfolio. Alternatively, during a period of rising interest rates, the fair value of MSRs is expected to increase, as prepayment speed assumptions on the underlying loans would be anticipated to decline. 

See additional discussion regarding the Mortgage Banking segment under Footnote 23 &#x201C;Segment Information&#x201D; of Part II Item 8 &#x201C;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#x201D; 

(IV) Republic Processing Group segment 

All divisions of the RPG segment operate through the Bank. Nationally, RPG facilitates the receipt and payment of federal and state tax refund products under the TRS division. The RPS division offers general purpose reloadable prepaid debit cards through third party program managers. The RCS division offers short-term consumer credit products. 

Tax Refund Solutions division : 

Republic, through its TRS division, is one of a limited number of financial institutions that facilitates the payment of federal and state tax refund products through third-party tax preparers located throughout the Nation, as well as tax-preparation software providers. Substantially all of the business generated by the TRS division occurs in the first quarter of the year. The TRS division traditionally operates at a loss during the second half of the year, during which time the division incurs costs preparing for the upcoming year&#x2019;s first quarter tax season. 

RTs are products whereby a tax refund is issued to the taxpayer after the Bank has received the refund from the federal or state government. There is no credit risk or borrowing cost for the Bank associated with these products because they are only delivered to the taxpayer upon receipt of the refund directly from the governmental paying authority. Fees earned on RTs, net of rebates, are the primary source of revenue for the TRS division and the RPG segment, and are reported in the income statement as non interest income under the line item &#x201C;Net refund transfer fees.&#x201D; 

Introduction of the &#x201C;Easy Advance&#x201D; 

Since RB&amp;T&#x2019;s discontinuance of the R efund A nticipation L oans (&#x201C;RAL s&#x201D;) in April 2012, the tax industry, as a whole, has continued to make credit alternatives available to its customer base each year, including the availability of RALs in various states through finance companies. One credit alternative to a traditional RAL the industry has developed is a product that allows a taxpayer to receive an advance of a portion of their refund with no additional fee paid by the taxpayer, and all fees for the advance being paid by the tax preparer or tax software company (collectively, the &#x201C;Tax Providers&#x201D;) to the lenders that offer this product. In an effort to gain a competitive marketing advantage, some Tax Providers offered this no-fee advance product to the public in 2015 with others offer ing a similar program during the first quarter 2016 tax season. 

TRS began offering a no-fee tax credit product during the first quarter of 2016. As part of the program, the Tax Providers pay the Bank a flat fee per approved a dvance. RPG&#x2019;s credit product, which is named &#x201C;Easy Advance,&#x201D; has the following features: 

&#xB7; 

An advance amount of $750 per customer; 

&#xB7; 

P roduct of fered through February 29, 2016; 

&#xB7; 

All fees for the product to be paid by the Tax Providers; 

&#xB7; 

No requirement that the customer pay for another bank product, such as an RT; 

&#xB7; 

The customer can elect to have proceeds disbursed by direct deposit, prepaid card, check or the Walmart Direct2Cash &#xAE; product; 

&#xB7; 

The Tax Providers may not impose an upcharge to the Easy Advance customer to offset the cost of the advance, 

&#xB7; 

Repayment to the Bank is deducted from the customer&#x2019;s tax refund proceeds; and 

&#xB7; 

If an insufficient refund to repay the Easy Advance occurs: 

o 

there is no recourse to the customer, 

o 

no negative credit reporting on the customer, and 

o 

no collecti on efforts against the customer. 

Prior to the 2016 tax season, the Bank&#x2019;s senior management team reviewed with its primary federal regulator, the FDIC, the features listed above for the Easy Advance product and the Bank&#x2019;s plans to offer the product during the first quarter of 2016. 

Management believes the overall volume of the product is primarily dependent on the marketing of the product by the Tax Providers. The Tax Providers&#x2019; willingness to market the product is highly dependent upon the actual value and perceived value of the product by the Tax Providers. The product is a no-fee value-added product to the taxpayer customer. This no-fee product to the customer is intended to retain existing customers or to attract additional tax preparation customers to the Tax Providers, with the Tax Providers&#x2019; expectation to earn more than enough revenue on tax preparation services to cover the costs they incur in offering the product. 

Related to the overall credit losses for the Easy Advance, the Bank&#x2019;s ability to control those losses is highly dependent upon its ability to predict the taxpayer&#x2019;s likelihood to receive their tax refund filed with the IRS. The Bank&#x2019;s approval model for the Easy Advance is based on prior year IRS funding patterns with on-going changes made in-season to adjust for any new current year funding patterns recognized by the Bank. Because much of the loan volume overall occurs each year before that year&#x2019;s funding patterns can be analyzed and subsequent underwriting changes made, credit losses in the current year could be higher than management&#x2019;s predictions if IRS funding patterns change materially between the prior year and current year. 

Republic Payment Solutions division : 

The RPS division is an issuing bank offering general purpose reloadable prepaid cards through third party program managers. This program&#x2019;s objectives include: 

&#xB7; 

generate a low-cost deposit source; 

&#xB7; 

generate float revenue from the previously mentioned low cost deposit source; 

&#xB7; 

serve as a source of fee income; and 

&#xB7; 

generate interchange revenue. 

For the projected near-term, as the prepaid card program matures, the operating results of the RPS division are expected to be immaterial to the Company&#x2019;s overall results of operations and will be reported as part of the RPG business operating segment. The RPS division will not be reported as a separate business operating segment until such time, if any, that it meets reporting thresholds. 

The Company divides prepaid cards into two general categories: 

Reloadable Cards : These types of cards are considered general purpose reloadable (&#x201C;GPR&#x201D;) cards. These cards may take the form of payroll cards issued to an employee by an employer to receive the direct deposit of their payroll. GPR cards can also be issued to a consumer at a retail location or mailed to a consumer after completing an online application. GPR cards can be reloaded multiple times with a consumer&#x2019;s payroll, government benefit, a federal or state tax refund or through cash reload networks located at retail locations. Reloadable cards are generally open loop cards as described below. 

Non-Reloadable Cards : These are generally one-time use cards that are only active until the funds initially loaded to the card are expended. These types of cards are considered gift or incentive cards. These cards may be open loop or closed loop, as described below. Normally these types of cards are used for the purchase of goods or services at retail locations and cannot be used to receive cash. 

Prepaid cards may be open loop, closed loop or semi-closed loop. Open loop cards can be used to receive cash at automatic teller machines (&#x201C;ATM&#x201D;s) or purchase goods or services by use of personal identification numbers (&#x201C; PIN s&#x201D;) or signature at retail locations. These cards can be used virtually anywhere that Visa&#xAE; or MasterCard&#xAE; is accepted. Closed loop cards can only be used at a specific merchant. Semi-closed loop cards can be used at several merchants. 

The prepaid card market is one of the fastest growing segments of the payments industry throughout the Nation. This market has experienced significant growth in recent years due to consumers and merchants embracing improved technology, greater convenience, more product choices and greater flexibility. Prepaid cards have also proven to be an attractive alternative to traditional bank accounts for certain segments of the population, particularly those without, or who could not qualify for, a checking or savings account. 

The RPS division will work with various third parties to distribute prepaid cards to consumers throughout the Nation. The Company will also likely work with these third parties to develop additional financial services for consumers to increase the functionality of the program and prepaid card usage. 

Republic Credit Solutions division : 

Through the Bank, the RCS division offers short-term consumer credit products. In g eneral, the credit products are unsecured , small dollar consumer loans with maturities of 30 days-or-more , and are dependent on various factors including the consumer&#x2019;s ability to repay. 

During the third quarter of 2015, one of RCS&#x2019; small dollar consumer loan programs exited the program&#x2019;s pilot phase. Under the operation of this program, the Company retains a 10% ownership in the loans originated and sells a 90% participation interest. During 2015, RPG sold approximately $ 137 million of loans from this program to a third party compared to $ 636 ,000 during 2014. As of December 3 1 , 2015, RCS carried approximately $ 7 million of such loans on its balance sheet, representing its 10% retained ownership.

None of the Company&#x2019;s employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement, and Republic has never experienced a work stoppage. The Company believes that its employee relations have been and continue to be good. 

Executive Officers

Competition 

Traditional Banking 

The Traditional Bank encounters intense competition in its market footprint in originating loans, attracting deposits, and selling other banking related financial services. Through its Correspondent Lending channel, the Bank also competes to acquire newly originated mortgage loans from select mortgage companies on a national basis. The deregulation of the banking industry, the ability to create financial services holding companies to engage in a wide range of financial services other than banking and the widespread enactment of state laws which permit multi-bank holding companies, as well as the availability of nationwide interstate banking, has created a highly competitive environment for financial institutions. In one or more aspects of the Bank&#x2019;s business, the Bank competes with local and regional retail and commercial banks, other savings banks, credit unions, finance companies, mortgage companies and other financial intermediaries operating in Kentucky, Indiana, Florida, Tennessee and Ohio. The Bank also competes with insurance companies, consumer finance companies, investment banking firms and mutual fund managers. Some of the Company&#x2019;s competitors are not subject to the same degree of regulatory review and restrictions that apply to the Company and the Bank. Many of the Bank&#x2019;s primary competitors, some of which are affiliated with large bank holding companies or other larger financial based institutions, have substantially greater resources, larger established client bases, higher lending limits, more extensive banking center networks, numerous ATMs, and greater advertising and marketing budgets. They may also offer services that the Bank does not currently provide. These competitors attempt to gain market share through their financial product mix, pricing strategies and banking center locations. Legislative developments related to interstate branching and banking in general, by providing large banking institutions easier access to a broader marketplace, can act to create more pressure on smaller financial institutions to consolidate. It is anticipated that competition from both bank and non-bank entities will continue to remain strong in the foreseeable future. 

The primary factors in competing for bank products are convenient locations and ATMs, flexible hours, deposit interest rates, services, internet banking, mobile banking, range of lending services offered and lending fees. Additionally, the Bank believes that an emphasis on highly personalized service tailored to individual client needs, together with the local character of the Bank&#x2019;s business and its &#x201C;community bank&#x201D; management philosophy will continue to enhance the Bank&#x2019;s ability to compete successfully in its market footprint . 

Warehouse Lending 

The Bank competes with financial institutions across the United States for mortgage banking clients in need of warehouse lines of credit. Competitors may have substantially greater resources, larger established client bases, higher lending limits, as well as underwriting standards and on-going oversight requirements that could be viewed more favorably by some clients. A few or all of these factors can lead to a competitive disadvantage to the Company when attempting to retain or grow its Warehouse client base. 

Mortgage Banking 

The Bank competes with mortgage bankers, mortgage brokers and financial institutions for the origination and funding of mortgage loans. Many competitors have branch offices in the same areas where the Bank&#x2019;s loan officers operate. The Bank also competes with mortgage companies whose focus is often on telemarketing and internet lending. 

Republic Processing Group 

Tax Refund Solutions division 

The TRS division faces direct competition for RT market share from independently-owned processing groups partnered with banks. T he Bank continues to incur substantial pressure on its profit margin for its RT products, as it competes with rebate and pricing incentives in the RT marketplace. 

Republic Payment Solutions division 

The prepaid card industry is subject to intense and increasing competition. The Bank competes with a number of companies that market different types of prepaid card products, such as GPR, gift, incentive and corporate disbursement cards. There is also competition from large retailers who are seeking to integrate more financial services into their product offerings. Increased competition is also expected from alternative financial services providers who are often well-positioned to service the &#x201C;underbanked&#x201D; and who may wish to develop their own prepaid card programs. 

Republic Credit Solutions division 

The small dollar consumer loan industry is highly competitive. Management believes principal competitors for its small dollar loan programs will be billers who accept late payments for a fee, overdraft privilege programs of other banks and credit unions, as well as payday lenders. 

New entrants to the small dollar consumer loan market must successfully implement underwriting and fraud prevention processes, overcome consumer brand loyalty and have sufficient capital to withstand early losses associated with unseasoned loan portfolios. In addition, there are substantial regulatory and compliance costs, including the need for expertise to customize products associated with licenses to lend in various states in the Nation. 

Supervision and Regulation 

The Company and the Bank are subject to extensive federal and state banking laws and regulations, which establish a comprehensive framework of activities in which the Company and the Bank may engage. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to provide protection to clients and depositors, not stockholders. 

The Company is a financial holding company, a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank that is subject to direct supervision by The Federal Reserve Bank (&#x201C;FRB&#x201D;). The Company&#x2019;s principal source of funds is the payment of cash dividends from the Bank. The Company files regular routine reports with the FRB in addition to the Bank&#x2019;s filings with the FDIC concerning business activities and financial condition. These regulatory agencies conduct periodic examinations to review the Company&#x2019;s safety and soundness, and compliance with various requirements. 

The Bank is a Kentucky-chartered commercial banking and trust corporation and as such, it is subject to supervision and regulation by the FDIC and the Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions (&#x201C;KDFI&#x201D;). The Bank also operates in Florida, Indiana, Ohio and Tennessee. All deposits, subject to regulatory prescribed limitations, held by the Bank are insured by the FDIC. 

T he Bank is subject to restrictions, requirements, potential enforcement actions and examinations by the FDIC and KDFI. The FRB regulates the Company with monetary policies and operational rules that directly impact the Bank. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (&#x201C;FHLB&#x201D;) System. As a member of the FHLB system, the Bank must also comply with applicable regulations of the Federal Housing Finance Board. Regulation by these agencies is intended primarily for the protection of the Bank&#x2019;s depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund (&#x201C;DIF&#x201D;) and not for the benefit of the Company&#x2019;s stockholders. The Bank&#x2019;s activities are also regulated under consumer protection laws applicable to the Bank&#x2019;s lending, deposit and other activities. The Bank and the Company are also subject to regulations issued by the CFPB, an independent bureau of the FRB created by the Dodd-Frank Act. An adverse ruling against the Company or the Bank under these laws could have a material adverse effect on results of operations. 

Regulators have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement authority and examination policies, including, but not limited to, policies that can materially impact the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves. Any change in regulatory requirements and policies, whether by the FRB, the FDIC, the KDFI the CFPB or state or federal legislation, could have a material adverse impact on Company operations. 

Regulators have broad enforcement powers over banks and their holding companies, including, but not limited to: the power to mandate or restrict particular actions, activities, or divestitures; impose monetary fines and other penalties for violations of laws and regulations; issue cease and desist or removal orders; seek injunctions; publicly disclose such actions; and prohibit unsafe or unsound practices. This authority includes both informal and formal actions to effect corrective actions and/or sanctions. In addition, the Bank is subject to regulation and potential enforcement actions by other state and federal agencies. 

Certain regulatory requirements applicable to the Company and the Bank are referred to below or elsewhere in this filing. The description of statutory provisions and regulations applicable to banks and their holding companies set forth in this filing does not purport to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations. Their effect on the Company and the Bank is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual laws and regulations. 

Prepaid Card Regulation 

The prepaid cards marketed by the RPS division are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations, including regulations issued by the CFPB , as well as those discussed below. Prepaid cards issued by the Bank could be subject to the Electronic Fund Transfers Act (&#x201C;EFTA&#x201D;) and the FRB&#x2019;s Regulation E. With the exception of those provisions comprising the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and Disclosure Act of 2009 (&#x201C;CARD Act&#x201D;); the Bank treat s prepaid products such as GPR cards as being subject to certain provisions of the EFTA and Regulation E when applicable, such as those related to disclosure requirements, periodic reporting, error resolution procedures and liability limitations. 

State Wage Payment Laws and Regulations 

The use of payroll card programs as means for an employer to remit wages or other compensation to its employees or independent contractors is governed by state labor laws related to wage payments. RPS payroll cards are designed to allow employers to comply with such applicable state wage and hour laws. Most states permit the use of payroll cards as a method of paying wages to employees either through statutory provisions allowing such use, or, in the absence of specific statutory guidance, the adoption by state labor departments of formal or informal policies allowing for the use of such cards. Nearly every state allowing payroll card program s places certain requirements or restrictions on their use as a wage payment method. The most common of these requirements or restrictions involves obtaining the prior written consent of the employee, limitations on payroll card fees and disclosure requirements. 

Card Association and Payment Network Operating Rules 

In providing certain services, the Bank is required to comply with the operating rules promulgated by various card associations and network organizations, including certain data security standards, with such obligations arising as a condition to access or participation in the relevant card association or network organization. Each card association and network organization may audit the Bank from time to time to ensure compliance with these standards. The Bank maintains appropriate policies and programs and adapts business practices in order to comply with all applicable rules and standards of such associations and organizations. 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 

On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law, which was intended to cause a fundamental restructuring of federal banking regulation through implementation of extensive regulatory reforms. Many of these reforms have been implemented and others are expected to be implemented in the future. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act creates a new Financial Stability Oversight Council to identify systemic risks in the financial system and gives federal regulators new authority to take control of and liquidate financial companies . Provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that have been or will be implemented that have impacted or may impact the Company and the Bank include: 

&#xB7; 

Requiring publicly traded companies to provide stockholders the opportunity to cast a non-binding vote on executive compensation at least every three years and on &#x201C;golden parachute&#x201D; payments in connection with approvals of mergers and acquisitions. The legislation also authorizes the SEC to promulgate rules that would allow stockholders to nominate their own candidates using a company&#x2019;s proxy materials. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act directs the federal banking regulators to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to executives of depository institutions and their holding companies with assets in excess of $1 billion, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded or not. The Dodd-Frank Act gives the SEC authority to prohibit broker discretionary voting on elections of directors and executive compensation matters. 

&#xB7; 

Applying Section 23A and Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act (governing transactions with insiders) to derivative transactions, repurchase agreements and securities lending and borrowing transactions that create credit exposure to an affiliate or an insider. Any such transactions with affiliates must be fully secured. The exemption from Section 23A for transactions with financial subsidiaries was effectively eliminated. The Dodd-Frank Act additionally prohibits an insured depository institution from purchasing an asset from or selling an asset to an insider unless the transaction is on market terms and, if representing more than 10% of capital, is approved in advance by the disinterested directors. 

&#xB7; 

Creating the CFPB, which is granted broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws. The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets. Smaller institutions are subject to rules promulgated by the CFPB, but continue to be examined and supervised by federal banking regulators for consumer compliance purposes. 

&#xB7; 

Permanently increasing the maximum deposit insurance amount for financial institutions from $100,000 to $250,000 per depositor, retroactive to January 1, 2009. The Dodd-Frank Act also broadened the base for FDIC insurance assessments. Assessments are now based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution. The Dodd-Frank Act also required the FDIC to increase the reserve ratio of the DIF from 1.15% to 1.35% of insured deposits by 2020 and eliminates the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to insured depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminates the federal statutory prohibition against the payment of interest on business checking accounts. 

&#xB7; 

Imposing new requirements for mortgage lending, including prohibitions on certain compensation to mortgage originators and special consumer protections, including limitations on certain mortgage terms. Additionally, requiring lenders to consider a consumer&#x2019;s ability to repay a mortgage loan before extending credit to the consumer and limiting prepayment penalties. 

&#xB7; 

Limiting permissible debit interchange fees for certain financial institutions. 

&#xB7; 

Revising certain corporate governance requirements for public companies. 

Incentive Compensation &#x2014; In 2011, seven federal agencies, including the FDIC, the FRB and the SEC, issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking designed to implement section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which applies only to financial institutions with total consolidated assets of $1 billion or more. This seeks to strengthen the incentive compensation practices at covered institutions by better aligning employee rewards with longer-term institutional objectives. The proposed orders are designed to: 

&#xB7; 

prohibit incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by providing covered persons with &#x201C;excessive&#x201D; compensation; 

&#xB7; 

prohibit incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by providing covered persons with compensation that &#x201C;could lead to a material financial loss&#x201D; to an institution; 

&#xB7; 

require disclosures that will enable the appropriate federal regulator to determine compliance with the rule; and 

&#xB7; 

require the institution to maintain policies and procedures to ensure compliance with these requirements and prohibitions commensurate with the size and complexity of the organization and the scope of its use of incentive compensation. 

Volcker Rule &#x2014; In December , 2013, the final Volcker Rule provision of the Dodd-Frank Act was approved and implemented by the FRB, the FDIC, the SEC, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (&#x201C;CFTC&#x201D;) (collectively, the &#x201C;Agencies&#x201D;). The Volcker Rule aims to reduce risk and banking system instability by restricting U.S. banks from investing in or engaging in proprietary trading and speculation and imposing a strict framework to justify exemptions for underwriting, market making and hedging activities. U.S. banks are restricted from investing in funds with collateral comprised of less than 100% loans that are not registered with the SEC and from engaging in hedging activities that do not hedge a specific identified risk. Affected institutions were required to fully conform to the Volcker Rule by July 21, 2015. 

I. The Company 

Acquisitions &#x2014; The Company is required to obtain the prior approval of the FRB under the Bank Holding Company Act (&#x201C;BHCA&#x201D;) before it may, among other things, acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank, or ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank, if after such acquisition it would own or control, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of any class of the voting shares of such bank. In addition, the Bank must obtain regulatory approval before entering into certain transactions, such as adding new banking offices and mergers with, or acquisitions of, other financial institutions. In approving bank acquisitions by bank holding companies, the FRB is required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding company, its subsidiaries and related banks, and the target bank involved, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served and various competitive and other factors. Consideration of financial resources generally focuses on capital adequacy, which is discussed below. Consideration of convenience and needs issues includes the parties&#x2019; performance under the CRA. Under the CRA, all financial institutions have a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of their designated communities, specifically including low-to-moderate income persons and neighborhoods. 

Under the BHCA, so long as it is at least adequately capitalized, adequately managed, has a satisfactory or better CRA rating and is not subject to any regulatory restrictions, the Company may purchase a bank, subject to regulatory approval. Similarly, an adequately capitalized and adequately managed bank holding company located outside of Kentucky, Florida, Indiana, Ohio or Tennessee may purchase a bank located inside Kentucky, Florida, Indiana, Ohio or Tennessee subject to appropriate regulatory approvals. In either case, however, state law restrictions may be placed on the acquisition of a bank that has been in existence for a limited amount of time, or would result in specified concentrations of deposits. For example, Kentucky law prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring control of banks located in Kentucky if the holding company would then hold more than 15% of the total deposits of all federally insured depository institutions in Kentucky. 

The BHCA and the Federal Change in Bank Control Act also generally require the approval of the Federal Reserve prior to any person or company acquiring control of a state bank or bank holding company. Acquiring control conclusively occurs if immediately after a transaction, the acquiring person or company owns, controls, or holds voting securities of the institution with the power to vote 25% or more of any class. Acquiring control is refutably presumed if, immediately after a transaction, the acquiring person or company owns, controls, or holds voting securities of the institution with the power to vote 10 percent or more of any class, and (i) the institution has registered securities under section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act; or (ii) no other person will own, control, or hold the power to vote a greater percentage of that class of voting securities immediately after the transaction. 

Financial Activities &#x2014; The activities permissible for bank holding companies and their affiliates were substantially expanded by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (&#x201C;GLBA&#x201D;). The GLBA permits bank holding companies that qualify as, and elect to be, Financial Holding Company&#x2019;s (&#x201C;FHCs&#x201D;), to engage in a broad range of activities that are financial in nature, incidental to financial activity, or complementary to financial activity that does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally. These financial activities include, but are not limited to , the following: underwriting securities, dealing in and making a market in securities, insurance underwriting and agency activities without geographic or other limitation, as well as merchant banking. To achieve and maintain its status as a FHC, the Company and all of its affiliated depository institutions must be well-capitalized, well-managed, and have at least a &#x201C;satisfactory&#x201D; CRA rating. The Company currently qualifies as and maintains an election as a FHC. 

Subject to certain exceptions, state banks are permitted to control or hold an interest in a financial subsidiary that engages in a broader range of activities than are permissible for national banks to engage in directly, subject to any restrictions imposed on a bank under the laws of the state under which it is organized. Conducting financial activities through a bank subsidiary can impact capital adequacy and regulatory restrictions may apply to affiliate transactions between the bank and its financial subsidiaries. 

Safe and Sound Banking Practice &#x2014; The FRB does not permit bank holding companies to engage in unsafe and unsound banking practices. The FDIC and the KDFI have similar restrictions with respect to the Bank. 

Pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (&#x201C;FDIA&#x201D;), the FDIC has adopted a set of guidelines prescribing safety and soundness standards. These guidelines establish general standards relating to internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings standards, compensation, fees and benefits. In general, the guidelines require appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines. 

Source of Strength Doctrine &#x2014; Under FRB policy, a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to its banking subsidiaries and to commit resources for their support. Such support may restrict the Company&#x2019;s ability to pay dividends, and may be required at times when, absent this FRB policy, a holding company may not be inclined to provide it. A bank holding company may also be required to guarantee the capital restoration plan of an undercapitalized banking subsidiary and any applicable cross-guarantee provisions that may apply to the Company. In addition, any capital loans by the Company to its bank subsidiary are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the bank subsidiary. In the event of a bank holding company&#x2019;s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment. The Dodd-Frank Act codifies the Federal Reserve Board&#x2019;s existing &#x201C;source of strength&#x201D; policy that holding companies act as a source of strength to their insured institution subsidiaries by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of distress. 

Office of Foreign Asset Control (&#x201C;OFAC&#x201D;) &#x2014; The Company and the Bank, like all U.S. companies and individuals, are prohibited from transacting business with certain individuals and entities named on the OFAC&#x2019;s list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons. Failure to comply may result in fines and other penalties. The OFAC issued guidance for financial institutions in whereby it asserted that it may, in its discretion, examine institutions determined to be high risk or to be lacking in their efforts to comply with its requirements. 

Code of Ethics &#x2014; The Company has adopted a code of ethics that applies to all employees, including the Company&#x2019;s principal executive, financial and accounting officers. T he Company&#x2019;s code of ethics is posted on the Bank&#x2019;s website. The Company intends to disclose information about any amendments to, or waivers from, the code of ethics that are required to be disclosed under applicable SEC regulations by providing appropriate information on the Company&#x2019;s website. If at any time the code of ethics is not available on the Company&#x2019;s website, the Company will provide a copy of it free of charge upon written request. 

II. The Bank 

The Kentucky and federal banking statutes prescribe the permissible activities in which a Kentucky chartered bank may engage and where those activities may be conducted. Kentucky&#x2019;s statutes contain a super parity provision that permits a well-rated Kentucky bank to engage in any banking activity in which a national bank in Kentucky, a state bank, state thrift, or state savings operating in any other state, a federal savings bank or federal thrift, or meeting the qualified thrift lender test, provided it first obtains a legal opinion from counsel specifying the statutory or regulatory provisions that permit the activity. 

Branching &#x2014; Kentucky law generally permits a Kentucky chartered bank to establish a branch office in any county in Kentucky. A Kentucky bank may also, subject to regulatory approval and certain restrictions, establish a branch office outside of Kentucky. Well-capitalized Kentucky chartered banks that have been in operation at least three years and that satisfy certain criteria relating to, among other things, their composite and management ratings, may establish a branch in Kentucky without the approval of the Commissioner of the KDFI, upon notice to the KDFI and any other state bank with its main office located in the county where the new branch will be located. Branching by all banks not meeting these criteria requires the approval of the Commissioner of the KDFI, who must ascertain and determine that the public convenience and advantage will be served and promoted and that there is a reasonable probability of the successful operation of the branch. In any case, the proposed branch must also be approved by the FDIC, which considers a number of factors, including financial condition, capital adequacy, earnings prospects, character of management, needs of the community and consistency with corporate powers. As a result of the Dodd Frank Act, the Bank, along with any other national or state chartered bank generally may branch across state lines. Such unlimited branching authority has the potential to increase competition within the markets in which the Company and the Bank operate. 

Affiliate Transaction Restrictions &#x2014; Transactions between the Bank and its affiliates, and in some cases the Bank&#x2019;s correspondent banks, are subject to FDIC regulations, the FRB&#x2019;s Regulations O and W, and Sections 23A, 23B, 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act (&#x201C;FRA&#x201D;). In general, these transactions must be on terms and conditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices and substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank or its subsidiary, as those for comparable transactions with non-affiliated parties. In addition, certain types of these transactions referred to as &#x201C;covered transactions&#x201D; are subject to quantitative limits based on a percentage of the Bank&#x2019;s capital, thereby restricting the total dollar amount of transactions the Bank may engage in with each individual affiliate and with all affiliates in the aggregate. Affiliates must pledge qualifying collateral in amounts between 100% and 130% of the covered transaction in order to receive loans from the Bank. Limitations are also imposed on loans and extensions of credit by a bank to its executive officers, directors and principal stockholders and each of their related interests. 

The FRB promulgated Regulation W to implement Sections 23A and 23B of the FRA. This regulation contains many of the foregoing restrictions and also addresses derivative transactions, overdraft facilities and other transactions between a bank and its non-bank affiliates. 

Restrictions on Distribution of Subsidiary Bank Dividends and Assets &#x2014; Bank regulators may declare a dividend payment to be unsafe and unsound even if the Bank continues to meet its capital requirements after the dividend. Dividends paid by the Bank provide substantially all of the Company&#x2019;s operating funds. Regulatory requirements limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by the Bank. Under federal regulations, the Bank cannot pay a dividend if, after paying the dividend, the Bank would be undercapitalized. 

Under Kentucky and federal banking regulations, the dividends the Bank can pay during any calendar year are generally limited to its profits for that year, plus its retained net profits for the two preceding years, less any required transfers to surplus or to fund the retirement of preferred stock or debt, absent approval of the respective state or federal banking regulators. FDIC regulations also require all insured depository institutions to remain in a safe and sound condition, as defined in regulations, as a condition of having FDIC deposit insurance. 

FDIC Deposit Insurance Assessments &#x2014; All Bank deposits are insured to the maximum extent permitted by the DIF. These bank deposits are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. As insurer, the FDIC is authorized to conduct examinations of, and to require reporting by, insured institutions. It also may prohibit any insured institution from engaging in any activity determined by regulation or order to pose a serious threat to the DIF. 

In addition to assessments for deposit insurance premiums, all institutions with deposits insured by the FDIC are required to pay assessments to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, a mixed-ownership government corporation established to recapitalize the predecessor to the DIF. These assessments will continue until the Financing Corporation (&#x201C;FICO&#x201D;) bonds mature between 2017 through 2019. 

The FDIC&#x2019;s risk-based premium system provides for quarterly assessments. Each insured institution is placed in one of four risk categories depending on supervisory and capital considerations. Within its risk category, an institution is assigned to an initial base assessment rate which is then adjusted. The FDIC may adjust the scale uniformly from one quarter to the next, however, no adjustment can deviate more than three basis points from the base scale without notice and comment. No institution may pay a dividend if in default of paying FDIC deposit insurance assessments. 

In 2011, the FDIC Board of Directors adopted a final rule, which redefined the deposit insurance assessment base as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rule: 

&#xB7; 

Redefined the deposit insurance assessment base as average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity (defined as Tier 1 Capital); 

&#xB7; 

Made generally conforming changes to the unsecured debt and brokered deposit adjustments to assessment rates; 

&#xB7; 

Created a depository institution debt adjustment; 

&#xB7; 

Eliminated the secured liability adjustment; and 

&#xB7; 

Adopted a new assessment rate schedule, and, in lieu of dividends, other rate schedules when the reserve ratio reaches certain levels. 

The FDIC is authorized to set the reserve ratio for the DIF annually at between 1.15% and 1.50% of estimated insured deposits. The Dodd-Frank Act mandates that the statutory minimum reserve ratio of the DIF increase from 1.15% to 1.35% of insured deposits by September 30, 2020. Banks with assets of less than $10 billion are exempt from any additional assessments necessary to increase the reserve fund above 1.15%. 

The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution, including the Bank, if it determines after a hearing that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, order or any condition imposed by an agreement with the FDIC. It may also suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for the permanent termination of insurance, if the institution has no tangible capital. If insurance is terminated, the accounts at the institution at the time of the termination, less subsequent withdrawals, shall continue to be insured for a period of six months to two years, as determined by the FDIC. Management is aware of no existing circumstances which would result in termination of the Bank&#x2019;s FDIC deposit insurance. 

I n November 2014, the FDIC revised the risk-based deposit insurance assessment system to reflect changes in the regulatory capital rules in accordance with Basel III that became effective in 2015 and 2018. For deposit insurance assessment purposes, the updated system will revise the ratios and ratio thresholds relating to capital evaluations. 

Consumer Laws and Regulations &#x2014; In addition to the laws and regulations discussed herein, the Bank is also subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in their transactions with banks. While the discussion set forth in this filing is not exhaustive, these laws and regulations include Regulation E, the Truth in Savings Act, Check Clearing for the 21 st Century Act and the Expedited Funds Availability Act, among others. These federal laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with consumers when accepting deposits. Certain laws also limit the Bank&#x2019;s ability to share information with affiliated and unaffiliated entities. The Bank is required to comply with all applicable consumer protection laws and regulations, both state and federal, as part of its ongoing business operations. 

Regulation E &#x2014; A 2009 amendment to Regulation E prohibits financial institutions from charging consumers fees for paying overdrafts on ATM and one-time debit card transactions, unless a consumer affirmatively consents, or opts in, to the overdraft service for those types of transactions. Before opting in, the consumer must be provided a notice that explains the financial institution&#x2019;s overdraft services, including the fees associated with the service and the consumer&#x2019;s choices. The final rules require institutions to provide consumers who do not opt in with the same account terms, conditions, and features (including pricing) that they provide to consumers who do opt in. For consumers who do not opt in, the institution would be prohibited from charging overdraft fees for any overdrafts it pays on ATM and one-time debit card transactions. 

The Bank earns a substantial majority of its deposit fee income related to overdrafts from the per item fee it assesses its clients for each insufficient funds check or electronic debit presented for payment. Both the per item fee and the daily fee assessed to the account resulting from its overdraft status, if computed as a percentage of the amount overdrawn, results in a high rate of interest when annualized and are thus considered excessive by some consumer groups. 

Prohibitions Against Tying Arrangements &#x2014; The Bank is subject to prohibitions on certain tying arrangements. A depository institution is prohibited, subject to certain exceptions, from extending credit to or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that the client obtain some additional product or service from the institution or its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution. 

The USA Patriot Act (&#x201C;Patriot Act&#x201D;), Bank Secrecy Act (&#x201C;BSA&#x201D;) and Anti-Money Laundering (&#x201C;AML&#x201D;) &#x2014; The Patriot Act was enacted after September 11, 2001, to provide the federal government with powers to prevent, detect, and prosecute terrorism and international money laundering, and has resulted in promulgation of several regulations that have a direct impact on financial institutions. There are a number of programs that financial institutions must have in place such as: (i) BSA/AML controls to manage risk; (ii) Customer Identification Programs to determine the true identity of customers, document and verify the information, and determine whether the customer appears on any federal government list of known or suspected terrorists or terrorist organizations; and (iii) monitoring for the timely detection and reporting of suspicious activity and reportable transactions. Title III of the Patriot Act takes measures intended to encourage information sharing among financial institutions, bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies. Further, certain provisions of Title III impose affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions, including banks, savings banks, brokers, dealers, credit unions, money transfer agents and parties registered under the Commodity Exchange Act. Among other requirements, the Patriot Act imposes the following obligations on financial institutions: 

&#xB7; 

Establishment of enhanced anti-money laundering programs; 

&#xB7; 

Establishment of a program specifying procedures for obtaining identifying information from customers seeking to open new accounts; 

&#xB7; 

Establishment of enhanced due diligence policies, procedures and controls designed to detect and report money laundering; 

&#xB7; 

Prohibitions on correspondent accounts for foreign shell banks; and 

&#xB7; 

Compliance with record keeping obligations with respect to correspondent accounts of foreign banks. 

Depositor Preference &#x2014; The FDIA provides that, in the event of the &#x201C;liquidation or other resolution&#x201D; of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution, including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors, and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver, will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured, non-deposit creditors, including depositors whose deposits are payable only outside of the U.S. and the parent bank holding company, with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution. 

Liability of Commonly Controlled Institutions &#x2014; FDIC-insured depository institutions can be held liable for any loss incurred, or reasonably expected to be incurred, by the FDIC due to the default of another FDIC-insured depository institution controlled by the same bank holding company, or for any assistance provided by the FDIC to another FDIC-insured depository institution controlled by the same bank holding company that is in danger of default. &#x201C;Default&#x201D; generally means the appointment of a conservator or receiver. &#x201C;In danger of default&#x201D; generally means the existence of certain conditions indicating that default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance. Such a &#x201C;cross-guarantee&#x201D; claim against a depository institution is generally superior in right of payment to claims of the holding company and its affiliates against that depository institution. At this time, the Bank is the only insured depository institution controlled by the Company. However, if the Company were to control other FDIC-insured depository institutions in the future, the cross-guarantee would apply to all such FDIC-insured depository institutions. 

Federal Home Loan Bank System &#x2014; The FHLB offers credit to its members, which include savings banks, commercial banks, insurance companies, credit unions, and other entities. The FHLB system is currently divided into twelve federally chartered regional FHLBs which are regulated by the Federal Housing Finance Board. The Bank is a member and owns capital stock in the FHLB Cincinnati. The amount of capital stock the Bank must own to maintain its membership depends on its balance of outstanding advances. It is required to acquire and hold shares in an amount at least equal to 1% of the aggregate principal amount of its unpaid single family residential real estate loans and similar obligations at the beginning of each year, or 1/20 th of its outstanding advances from the FHLB, whichever is greater. Advances are secured by pledges of loans, mortgage backed securities and capital stock of the FHLB. FHLBs also purchase mortgages in the secondary market through their Mortgage Purchase Program (&#x201C;MPP&#x201D;). The Bank has never sold loans to the MPP. 

In the event of a default on an advance, the Federal Home Loan Bank Act establishes priority of the FHLB&#x2019;s claim over various other claims. Regulations provide that each FHLB has joint and several liability for the obligations of the other FHLBs in the system. If an FHLB falls below its minimum capital requirements, the FHLB may seek to require its members to purchase additional capital stock of the FHLB. If problems within the FHLB system were to occur, it could adversely affect the pricing or availability of advances, the amount and timing of dividends on capital stock issued by FHLBs to its members, or the ability of members to have their FHLB capital stock redeemed on a timely basis. Congress continues to consider various proposals which could establish a new regulatory structure for the FHLB system, as well as for other government-sponsored entities. The Bank cannot predict at this time, which, if any, of these proposals may be adopted or what effect they would have on the Bank&#x2019;s business. 

Federal Reserve System &#x2014; Under regulations of the FRB, the Bank is required to maintain non interest-earning reserves against its transaction accounts (primarily NOW and regular checking accounts). The Bank is in compliance with the foregoing reserve requirements. Required reserves must be maintained in the form of vault cash, a non interest-bearing account at the FRB, or a pass-through account as defined by the FRB. The effect of this reserve requirement is to reduce the Bank&#x2019;s interest-earning assets. The balances maintained to meet the reserve requirements imposed by the FRB may be used to satisfy liquidity requirements imposed by the FDIC. The Bank is authorized to borrow from the FRB discount window. 

General Lending Regulations 

Pursuant to FDIC regulations, the Bank may extend credit subject to certain restrictions. Additionally, state law may impose additional restrictions. While the discussion of extensions of credit set forth in this filing is not exhaustive, federal laws and regulations include but are not limited to the following: 

&#xB7; 

Community Reinvestment Act 

&#xB7; 

Home Mortgage Disclosure Act 

&#xB7; 

Equal Credit Opportunity Act 

&#xB7; 

Truth in Lending Act 

&#xB7; 

Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act 

&#xB7; 

Fair Credit Reporting Act 

&#xB7; 

C ARD Act 

Community Reinvestment Act (&#x201C;CRA &#x201D;) &#x2014; Under the CRA, financial institutions have a continuing and affirmative obligation to help meet the credit needs of their designated community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound banking practices. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for the Bank, nor does it limit the Bank&#x2019;s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. In particular, the CRA assessment system focuses on three tests: 

&#xB7; 

a lending test, to evaluate the institution&#x2019;s record of making loans in its assessment areas; 

&#xB7; 

an investment test, to evaluate the institution&#x2019;s record of investing in community development projects, affordable housing and programs benefiting low or moderate income individuals and businesses in its assessment area or a broader area that includes its assessment area; and 

&#xB7; 

a service test, to evaluate the institution&#x2019;s delivery of services through its retail banking channels and the extent and innovativeness of its community development services. 

The CRA requires all institutions to make public disclosure of their CRA ratings. In June 2015 , the Bank received a &#x201C;Satisfactory&#x201D; CRA Performance Evaluation. A copy of the public section of this CRA Performance Evaluation is available to the public upon request. 

Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (&#x201C;HMDA&#x201D;) &#x2014; The HMDA grew out of public concern over credit shortages in certain urban neighborhoods. One purpose of the HMDA is to provide public information that will help show whether financial institutions are serving the housing credit needs of the neighborhoods and communities in which they are located. The HMDA also includes a &#x201C;fair lending&#x201D; aspect that requires the collection and disclosure of data about applicant and borrower characteristics, as a way of identifying possible discriminatory lending patterns and enforcing anti-discrimination statutes. The HMDA requires institutions to report data regarding applications for loans for the purchase or improvement of single family and multi-family dwellings, as well as information concerning originations and purchases of such loans. Federal bank regulators rely, in part, upon data provided under HMDA to determine whether depository institutions engage in discriminatory lending practices. The appropriate federal banking agency, or in some cases the Department of Housing and Urban Development, enforces compliance with HMDA and implements its regulations. Administrative sanctions, including civil money penalties, may be imposed by supervisory agencies for violations of the HMDA. 

Equal Credit Opportunity Act; Fair Housing Act (&#x201C;ECOA&#x201D;) &#x2014; The ECOA prohibits discrimination against an applicant in any credit transaction, whether for consumer or business purposes, on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age (except in limited circumstances), receipt of income from public assistance programs or good faith exercise of any rights under the Consumer Credit Protection Act. Under the Fair Housing Act, it is unlawful for any lender to discriminate in its housing-related lending activities against any person because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, handicap or familial status. Among other things, these laws prohibit a lender from denying or discouraging credit on a discriminatory basis, making excessively low appraisals of property based on racial considerations, or charging excessive rates or imposing more stringent loan terms or conditions on a discriminatory basis. In addition to private actions by aggrieved borrowers or applicants for actual and punitive damages, the U.S. Department of Justice and other regulatory agencies can take enforcement action seeking injunctive and other equitable relief or sanctions for alleged violations. 

Truth in Lending Act (&#x201C;TLA&#x201D;) &#x2014; The TLA governs disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers and is designed to ensure that credit terms are disclosed in a meaningful way so that consumers may compare credit terms more readily and knowledgeably. As result of the TLA, all creditors must use the same credit terminology and expressions of rates, and disclose the annual percentage rate, the finance charge, the amount financed, the total of payments and the payment schedule for each proposed loan. Violations of the TLA may result in regulatory sanctions and in the imposition of both civil and, in the case of willful violations, criminal penalties. Under certain circumstances, the TLA also provides a consumer with a right of rescission, which if exercised within three business days would require the creditor to reimburse any amount paid by the consumer to the creditor or to a third party in connection with the loan, including finance charges, application fees, commitment fees, title search fees and appraisal fees. Consumers may also seek actual and punitive damages for violations of the TLA. 

The Dodd-Frank Act did not specify whether the presumption of ATR compliance is conclusive (i.e., creates a safe harbor) or is rebuttable. For mortgages that are not QMs, the final rule describes certain minimum requirements for creditors making ATR determinations, but does not dictate that they follow particular underwriting models. At a minimum, creditors generally must consider eight underwriting factors: (1) current or reasonably expected income or assets; (2) current employment status; (3) the monthly payment on the covered transaction; (4) the monthly payment on any simultaneous loan; (5) the monthly payment for mortgage-related obligations; (6) current debt obligations, alimony, and child support; (7) the monthly debt-to-income ratio or residual income; and (8) credit history. Creditors must generally use reasonably reliable third-party records to verify the information they use to evaluate the factors. 

Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (&#x201C;RESPA&#x201D;) &#x2014; The RESPA requires lenders to provide borrowers with disclosures regarding the nature and cost of real estate settlements. The RESPA also prohibits certain abusive practices, such as kickbacks, and places 

limitations on the amount of escrow accounts. Violations of the RESPA may result in imposition of penalties, including: (i) civil liability equal to three times the amount of any charge paid for the settlement services or civil liability of up to $1,000 per claimant, depending on the violation; (ii) awards of court costs and attorneys&#x2019; fees; and (iii) fines of not more than $10,000 or imprisonment for not more than one year, or both. A rule requiring integrated disclosures from the TLA and RESPA became effective in October 2015. 

Fair Credit Reporting Act (&#x201C;FACT&#x201D;) &#x2014; The FACT requires the Bank to adopt and implement a written identity theft prevention program, paying particular attention to several identified &#x201C;red flag&#x201D; events. The program must assess the validity of address change requests for card issuers and for users of consumer reports to verify the subject of a consumer report in the event of notice of an address discrepancy. The FACT gives consumers the ability to challenge the Bank with respect to credit reporting information provided by the Bank. The FACT also prohibits the Bank from using certain information it may acquire from an affiliate to solicit the consumer for marketing purposes unless the consumer has been given notice and an opportunity to opt out of such solicitation for a period of five years. 

Ability to Repay (&#x201C;ATR&#x201D;) Rule and Qualified Mortgage Loans (&#x201C;QMs&#x201D;) &#x2014; In January 2014, the CFPB&#x2019;s final rule implementing the ATR requirements in the Dodd-Frank Act became effective. The rule, among other things, requires lenders to consider a consumer&#x2019;s ability to repay a mortgage loan before extending credit to the consumer and limits prepayment penalties. The rule also establishes certain protections from liability for mortgage lenders with regard to QMs they originate. For this purpose, the rule defines QMs to include loans with a borrower debt-to-income ratio of less than or equal to 43% or, alternatively, a loan eligible for purchase by the FNMA or Freddie Mac while they operate under Federal conservatorship or receivership, and loans eligible for insurance or guarantee by the Federal Housing Administration (&#x201C;FHA&#x201D;), U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (&#x201C;VA&#x201D;) or U.S. Department of Agriculture (&#x201C;USDA&#x201D;). Additionally, QMs may not: (i) contain excess upfront points and fees; (ii) have a term greater than 30 years; or (iii) include interest-only or negative amortization payments. 

Loans to One Borrower &#x2014; Under current limits, loans and extensions of credit outstanding at one time to a single borrower and not fully secured generally may not exceed 15% of the institution&#x2019;s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. Loans and extensions of credit fully secured by certain readily marketable collateral may represent an additional 10% of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. 

Interagency Guidance on Non Traditional Mortgage Product Risks &#x2014; In 2006, final guidance was issued to address the risks posed by residential mortgage products that allow borrowers to defer repayment of principal and sometimes interest (such as &#x201C;interest-only&#x201D; mortgages and &#x201C;payment option&#x201D; ARMs. The guidance discusses the importance of ensuring that loan terms and underwriting standards are consistent with prudent lending practices, including consideration of a borrower&#x2019;s repayment capacity. The guidance also suggests that banks i) implement strong risk management standards, ii) maintain capital levels commensurate with risk and iii) establish an Allowance that reflects the collectability of the portfolio. The guidance urges banks to ensure that consumers have sufficient information to clearly understand loan terms and associated risks before making product or payment choices. 

Loans to Insiders &#x2014; The Bank&#x2019;s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and principal shareholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the FRA and Regulation O of the Federal Reserve Board. Among other things, these provisions require that extensions of credit to insiders: 

&#xB7; 

be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with non-insiders and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other features that are unfavorable to the Bank; and 

&#xB7; 

not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of the Bank&#x2019;s capital. 

The regulations allow small discounts on fees on residential mortgages for directors, officers and employees. In addition, extensions of credit to insiders in excess of certain limits must be approved by the Bank&#x2019;s Board of Directors. 

Capital Adequacy Requirements 

Capital Guidelines &#x2014; Both the Company and the Bank are required to comply with capital adequacy guidelines. Guidelines are established by the FRB in the case of the Company and the FDIC in the case of the Bank. The FRB and FDIC have substantially similar risk based and leverage ratio guidelines for banking organizations, which are intended to ensure that banking organizations have adequate capital related to the risk levels of assets and off balance sheet instruments. Under the risk based guidelines, specific categories of assets are assigned different risk weights based generally on the perceived credit risk of the asset. These risk weights are multiplied by corresponding asset balances to determine a risk weighted asset base. 

Through December 31, 2014, the guidelines require d a minimum total risk based capital ratio of 8.0%, of which at least 4.0% wa s required to consist of Tier 1 capital elements (generally, common shareholders&#x2019; equity, minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, less goodwill and certain other intangible assets). Total capital is the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital generally may consist of limited amounts of subordinated debt, qualifying hybrid capital instruments, other preferred stock, loan loss reserves and unrealized gains on certain equity investment securities. Tier 2 capital may not exceed 100% of Tier 1 capital. 

In addition to the risk based capital guidelines, the FRB utilized a leverage ratio as a tool to evaluate the capital adequacy of bank holding companies. The leverage ratio is a company&#x2019;s Tier 1 capital divided by its average total consolidated assets (less goodwill and certain other intangible assets). 

New Capital Rules &#x2014; Effective January 1, 2015 the Company and the Bank became subject to the new capital regulations in accordance with Basel III. The new regulations establish higher minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements, a new common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and a new capital conservation buffer. The capital conservation buffer requirement is phased in beginning in January 2016, and will increase until fully implemented in 2019. The new regulations also include revisions to the definition of capital and changes in the risk-weighting of certain assets. For prompt corrective action, the new regulations establish definitions of &#x201C;well capitalized&#x201D; as a 6.5% common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, an 8.0% Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, a 10.0% total risk-based capital ratio and a 5.0% Tier 1 leverage ratio. As of December 31, 2015 , the ratios for both the Company and the Bank exceeded the minimum capital ratio requirements for &#x201C;well-capitalized&#x201D; including the 2.5% capital conservation buffer, when fully implemented. 

Under the new capital rules, Tier 1 capital generally consists of common stock (plus related surplus) and retained earnings, a restricted amount of minority interest as additional Tier 1 capital, and non-cumulative preferred stock (plus related surplus), subject to certain eligibility requirements, minus goodwill and other specified intangible assets and other regulatory deductions. Proceeds of trust preferred securities are excluded from Tier 1 capital unless such securities were issued before 2010 by bank or savings and loan holding companies with less than $15 billion of assets. 

The federal banking agencies&#x2019; risk based and leverage ratios represent minimum supervisory ratios generally applicable to banking organizations that meet certain specified criteria, assuming that they have the highest regulatory capital rating. Banking organizations not meeting these criteria are required to operate with capital positions above the minimum ratios. FRB guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions may be expected to maintain strong capital positions above the minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets. The FDIC may establish higher minimum capital adequacy requirements if, for example, a bank proposes to make an acquisition requiring regulatory approval, has previously warranted special regulatory attention, rapid growth presents supervisory concerns, or, among other factors, has a high susceptibility to interest rate and other types of risk. The Bank is not subject to any such individual minimum regulatory capital requirement. 

As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 the Company&#x2019;s capital ratios were as follows:

Corrective Measures for Capital Deficiencies &#x2014; The banking regulators are required to take &#x201C;prompt corrective action&#x201D; with respect to capital deficient institutions. Agency regulations define, for each capital category, the levels at which institutions are well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. A bank is undercapitalized if it fails to meet any one of the ratios required to be adequately capitalized. 

Undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized institutions are required to submit a capital restoration plan, which must be guaranteed by the holding company of the institution. In addition, agency regulations contain broad restrictions on certain activities of undercapitalized institutions including asset growth, acquisitions, branch establishment, and expansion into new lines of business. With certain exceptions, an insured depository institution is prohibited from making capital distributions, including dividends, and is prohibited from paying management fees to control persons if the institution would be undercapitalized after any such distribution or payment. A bank&#x2019;s capital classification will also affect its ability to accept brokered deposits. Under banking regulations, a bank may not lawfully accept, roll over or renew brokered deposits, unless it is either well-capitalized or it is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from its applicable regulator. 

If a banking institution&#x2019;s capital decreases below acceptable levels, bank regulatory enforcement powers become more enhanced. A significantly undercapitalized institution is subject to mandated capital raising activities, restrictions on interest rates paid and transactions with affiliates, removal of management and other restrictions. Banking regulators have limited discretion in dealing with a critically undercapitalized institution and are normally required to appoint a receiver or conservator. Banks with risk based capital and leverage ratios below the required minimums may also be subject to certain administrative actions, including the termination of deposit insurance upon notice and hearing, or a temporary suspension of insurance without a hearing if the institution has no tangible capital. 

In addition, a bank holding company may face significant consequences if its bank subsidiary fails to maintain the required capital and management ratings, including entering into an agreement with the FRB which imposes limitations on its operations and may even require divestitures. Such possible ramifications may limit the ability of a bank subsidiary to significantly expand or acquire less than well-capitalized and well-managed institutions. More specifically, the FRB&#x2019;s regulations require a FHC to notify the FRB within 15 days of becoming aware that any depository institution controlled by the company has ceased to be well-capitalized or well-managed. If the FRB determines that a FHC controls a depository institution that is not well-capitalized or well-managed, the FRB will notify the FHC that it is not in compliance with applicable requirements and may require the FHC to enter into an agreement acceptable to the FRB to correct any deficiencies, or require the FHC to decertify as a FHC. Until such deficiencies are corrected, the FRB may impose any limitations or conditions on the conduct or activities of the FHC and its affiliates that the FRB determines are appropriate, and the FHC may not commence any additional activity or acquire control of any company under Section 4(k) of the BHC Act without prior FRB approval. Unless the period of time for compliance is extended by the FRB, if a FHC fails to correct deficiencies in maintaining its qualification for FHC status within 180 days of entering into an agreement with the FRB, the FRB may order divestiture of any depository institution controlled by the company. A company may comply with a divestiture order by ceasing to engage in any financial or other activity that would not be permissible for a bank holding company that has not elected to be treated as a FHC. The Company is currently classified as a FHC. 

Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (&#x201C;FDICIA&#x201D;), each federal banking agency has prescribed, by regulation, non-capital safety and soundness standards for institutions under its authority. These standards cover internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, such other operational and managerial standards as the agency determines to be appropriate, and standards for asset quality, earnings and stock valuation. An institution which fails to meet these standards must develop a plan acceptable to the agency, specifying the steps that the institution will take to meet the standards. Failure to submit or implement such a plan may subject the institution to regulatory sanctions. 

Other Legislative Initiatives 

The U.S. Congress and state legislative bodies continually consider proposals for altering the structure, regulation and competitive relationships of financial institutions. It cannot be predicted whether, or in what form, any of these potential proposals or regulatory initiatives will be adopted, the impact the proposals will have on the financial institutions industry or the extent to which the business or financial condition and operations of the Company and its subsidiaries may be affected.
