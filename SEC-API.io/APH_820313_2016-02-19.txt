Our Strategy 

&#160; 

The Company&#146;s overall strategy is to provide its customers with comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high level of service on a worldwide basis while maintaining continuing programs of productivity improvement and cost control. Specifically, our business strategy is as follows: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Pursue broad diversification - The Company constantly drives to increase its diversity of markets, customers, applications and products. Due to the tremendous variety of opportunities in the electronics industry, management believes that it is very important to ensure participation wherever significant growth opportunities are available. This diversification positions us to proliferate our technologies across the broadest array of opportunities and reduces our exposure to any particular market, thereby reducing the variability of our financial performance. An overview of the Company&#146;s market and product participation is described under &#147;Markets&#148;.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Develop performance-enhancing interconnect solutions - The Company seeks to expand the scope and number of its preferred supplier relationships. The Company works closely with its customers at the design stage to create and manufacture innovative solutions. These products generally have higher value-added content than other interconnect products and have been developed across the Company&#146;s markets. The Company is focused on technology leadership in the interconnect areas of radio frequency, power, harsh environment, high-speed and fiber optics, as well as sensors, as it views these technology areas to be of particular importance to our global customer base.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Expand global presence - The Company intends to further expand its global manufacturing, engineering, sales and service operations to better serve its existing customer base, penetrate developing markets and establish new customer relationships. As the Company&#146;s global customers expand their international operations to access developing world markets and lower manufacturing costs in certain regions, the Company is continuing to expand its international footprint in order to provide just-in-time capabilities to these customers. The majority of the Company&#146;s international operations have broad capabilities including new product development. The Company is also able to take advantage of the lower manufacturing costs in some regions, and has established low-cost manufacturing and assembly facilities in the three major geographical markets of the Americas, Europe/Africa and Asia.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Control costs - The Company recognizes the importance in today&#146;s global marketplace of maintaining a competitive cost structure. Innovation, product quality and comprehensive customer service are not mutually exclusive with controlling costs. Controlling costs is part of a mindset. It is having the discipline to invest in programs that have a good return, maintaining a cost structure as flexible as possible to respond to changes in the marketplace, dealing with suppliers and vendors in a fair but prudent way to ensure a reasonable cost for materials and services and creating a mindset of managers to manage the Company&#146;s assets as if they were their own.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Pursue strategic acquisitions and investments - The Company believes that the interconnect and sensor industry is highly fragmented and continues to provide significant opportunities for strategic acquisitions. Accordingly, we continue to pursue acquisitions of high-growth potential companies with strong management teams that complement our existing business while further expanding our product lines, technological capabilities and geographic presence. Furthermore, we seek to enhance the performance of acquired companies by leveraging Amphenol&#146;s business strategy and access to low-cost manufacturing around the world. In 2015, the Company invested approximately $200 million primarily in three separate acquisitions in the automotive, military, commercial aerospace and industrial markets, which broadened and enhanced the Company&#146;s customer base and product offerings in these markets. In addition, in January 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of FCI Asia Pte Ltd (&#147;FCI&#148;) for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1,179 million, net of cash acquired (subject to closing adjustments), which further strengthened our customer base and product offerings in the information technology and data communications, industrial, mobile networks, automotive and mobile devices markets.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Foster collaborative, entrepreneurial management - Amphenol&#146;s management system is designed to provide clear income statement and balance sheet responsibility in a flat organizational structure. Each general manager is incented to grow and develop his or her business and to think entrepreneurially in providing innovative, timely and cost-effective solutions to customer needs. In addition, Amphenol&#146;s general managers have access to the resources of the larger organization and are encouraged to work collaboratively with other general managers to meet the needs of the expanding marketplace and to achieve common goals.

Customers and Geographies 

&#160; 

The Company manufactures and sells a broad portfolio of products on a global basis to customers in various industries. Our customers include many of the leaders in their respective industries, and our relationships with them typically date back many years. We believe that our diversified customer base provides us an opportunity to leverage our skills and experience across markets and reduces our exposure to particular end markets. Additionally, we believe that the diversity of our customer base is an important strength of the Company. 

&#160; 

There has been a trend on the part of original equipment manufacturer (&#147;OEM&#148;) customers to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have the ability to meet certain quality, delivery and other standards while maintaining competitive prices. The Company has positioned its global resources to compete effectively in this environment. As an industry leader, the Company has established close working relationships with many of its customers on a global basis. These relationships allow the Company to better anticipate and respond to these customer needs when designing new products and new technical solutions. By working with customers in developing new products and technologies, the Company is able to identify and act on trends and leverage knowledge about next-generation technology across our portfolio of products. In addition, the Company has concentrated its efforts on service, procurement and manufacturing improvements designed to increase product quality and lower product lead-time and cost. For a discussion of risks related to the Company&#146;s sales to OEMs, see the risk factor titled &#147;The Company is dependent on the communications industry, including information technology and data communications, wireless communications and broadband communications&#148; in Part I, Item 1A herein.

During the year ended December 31, 2015, aggregate sales to Apple Inc., including sales of products to EMS companies and subcontractors that the Company believes are manufacturing products on their behalf, accounted for approximately 11% of our net sales. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company&#146;s net sales for the years ended December 31, 2014 or 2013. 

&#160; 

The Company sells its products through its own global sales force, independent representatives and a global network of electronics distributors. The Company&#146;s sales to distributors represented approximately 12% of the Company&#146;s net sales in 2015. In addition to product design teams and customer collaboration arrangements, the Company uses key account managers to manage customer relationships on a global basis such that it can bring to bear its total resources to meet the worldwide needs of its multinational customers. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing 

&#160; 

The Company is a global manufacturer employing advanced manufacturing processes including molding, stamping, plating, turning, extruding, die casting and assembly operations and proprietary process technology for specialty and coaxial cable production and sensor fabrication. Outsourcing of certain manufacturing processes is used when cost-effective. Substantially all of the Company&#146;s manufacturing facilities are certified to the ISO9000 series of quality standards, and many of the Company&#146;s manufacturing facilities are certified to other quality standards, including QS9000, ISO14000, TS16949 and TS16469. 

&#160; 

The Company&#146;s manufacturing facilities are generally vertically integrated operations from the initial design stage through final design and manufacturing. The Company has an established manufacturing presence in approximately 30 countries. Our global coverage positions us near many of our customers&#146; locations and allows us to assist them in consolidating their supply base and lowering their production costs. In addition, the Company generally relies on local general management in every region, which we believe creates a strong degree of organizational stability and deeper understanding of local markets. We believe our balanced 

&#160; 

&#160; 

geographic distribution lowers our exposure to any particular geography. The Company designs, manufactures and assembles its products at facilities in the Americas, Europe, Asia, Australia and Africa. The Company believes that its global presence is an important competitive advantage, as it allows the Company to provide quality products on a timely and worldwide basis to its multinational customers. 

&#160; 

The Company employs a global manufacturing strategy to lower its production and logistics costs and to improve service to customers. The Company&#146;s strategy is to maintain strong cost controls in its manufacturing and assembly operations. The Company is continually evaluating and adjusting its expense levels and workforce to reflect current business conditions and maximize the return on capital investments. The Company sources its products on a worldwide basis. To better serve certain high volume customers, the Company has established just-in-time facilities near these major customers. The Company&#146;s international manufacturing and assembly facilities generally serve the respective local markets and coordinate product design and manufacturing responsibility with the Company&#146;s other operations around the world. The Company has lower cost manufacturing and assembly facilities in China, Macedonia, Malaysia, Mexico, India, Indonesia, Eastern Europe and North Africa to serve regional and world markets. For a discussion of risks attendant to the Company&#146;s foreign operations, see the risk factor titled &#147;The Company is subject to the risks of political, economic and military instability in countries outside the United States&#148; in Part I, Item 1A herein.

Research and Development 

&#160; 

The Company generally implements its product development strategy through product design teams and collaboration arrangements with customers, which result in the Company obtaining approved vendor status for its customers&#146; new products and programs. The Company focuses its research and development efforts primarily on those product areas that it believes have the potential for broad market applications and significant sales within a one- to three-year period. The Company seeks to have its products become widely accepted within the industry for similar applications and products manufactured by other potential customers, which the Company believes will provide additional sources of future revenue. By developing application specific products, the Company has decreased its exposure to standard products, which generally experience greater pricing pressure. 

&#160; 

At the end of 2015, our research, development, and engineering efforts are supported by approximately 1,800 employees and are performed primarily by individual operating units focused on specific markets and technologies. The Company&#146;s research and development expense for the creation of new and improved products and processes was $124.7 million, $114.8 million and $103.4 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

Patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business. We also rely upon trade secrets, manufacturing know-how, continuing technological innovations, and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position. We review third-party proprietary rights, including patents and patent applications, as available, in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy, avoid infringement of third-party proprietary rights, identify licensing opportunities, and monitor the intellectual property claims of others. 

&#160; 

We own a large portfolio of patents that principally relate to electrical, optical, electronic, antenna and sensor products. We also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents and trademarks. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. Trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the trademarks. 

&#160; 

While we consider our patents and trademarks to be valued assets, we do not believe that our competitive position or our operations are dependent upon or would be materially impacted by the loss of any single patent or group of related patents. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Raw Materials 

&#160; 

The Company purchases a wide variety of raw materials for the manufacture of its products, including precious metals such as gold and silver used in plating, aluminum, steel, copper, titanium and metal alloy products used for cable, contacts and connector shells, certain rare earth metals used in sensors and plastic materials used for cable and connector bodies and inserts. Such raw materials are generally available throughout the world and are purchased locally from a variety of suppliers. The Company is generally not dependent upon any one source for raw materials, or if one source is used the Company attempts to protect itself through long-term supply agreements. Information regarding our purchasing obligations related to commitments to purchase certain goods and services is disclosed in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160;

In addition, the Company competes with a large number of smaller companies who compete in specific geographies, markets or products. 

&#160; 

Backlog 

&#160; 

The Company estimates that its backlog of unfilled orders as of December 31, 2015 was approximately $1,121 million compared with backlog of approximately $1,043 million as of December 31, 2014. Orders typically fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on customer demand and general business conditions. Unfilled orders may generally be cancelled prior to shipment of goods. It is expected that all or a substantial portion of the backlog will be filled within the next 12 months. Significant elements of the Company&#146;s business, such as sales to the communications related markets (including wireless communications, information technology and data communications) and broadband communications and sales to distributors, generally have short lead times. Therefore, backlog may not be indicative of future demand. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, the Company had approximately 50,700 employees worldwide, of which approximately 40,300 were located in lower cost regions. Approximately 42,000 of the Company&#146;s employees worldwide were hourly employees with the remainder being salaried employees. The Company believes that it has a good relationship with its unionized and non-unionized employees. 

&#160; 

Environmental Matters 

&#160; 

Certain operations of the Company are subject to environmental laws and regulations which govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company believes that its operations are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that the costs of continuing compliance will not have a material effect on the Company&#146;s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
