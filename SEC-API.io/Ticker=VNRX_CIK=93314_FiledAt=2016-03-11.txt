BUSINESS 

Description of Our Business 

We are a clinical-stage life sciences company focused on developing blood-based diagnostic tests that meet the need for accurate, fast, cost effective and scalable tests for detecting and diagnosing cancer and other diseases. We have developed twenty eight blood-based assays to date to detect specific biomarkers that can be used individually or in combination to generate a profile which forms the basis of a test for a particular cancer or disease. We intend to commercialize our products in the future through various channels within the European Union, the United States and throughout the rest of the world likely beginning with China and India.

We are developing blood-based diagnostics for the most prevalent cancers, beginning with colorectal, lung, and pancreatic cancer, using our Nucleosomics &#174; biomarker discovery platform. The platform employs a range of simple NuQ &#174; immunoassays on an industry standard ELISA format, which allows rapid quantification of epigenetic changes in biofluids (whole blood, plasma, serum, sputum, urine etc.) compared to other approaches such as bisulfite conversion and polymerase chain reaction, or PCR. NuQ &#174; biomarkers can be used alone, or in combination to generate profiles related to specific conditions. The first tranche of data released from a large independent trial for colorectal cancer could, if carried through into our screening or symptomatic trials, potentially have a positive impact for broad scale, cost effective, cancer diagnostics. According to available data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, this could be of significant benefit to the approximately 148 million 50-74 year olds in the European Union alone that the European Union recommends are screened for colorectal cancer. 1 

We anticipate that because of their ease of use and cost efficiency, our tests have the potential to become the first method of choice for cancer diagnostics, allowing detection of a range of cancers at an earlier stage than typically occurs currently, and testing of individuals who, for reasons such as time, cost or aversion to current methods, are not currently tested. We believe our blood test for colorectal cancer has the potential to have significantly higher compliance from patients compared to fecal tests and colonoscopies which are invasive and/or unpleasant.

We undertook our early trials in Europe given that our laboratories are based in Belgium and that we have strong relationships with world class collaborators. Hvidovre Hospital in Denmark has given us access to 4,800 previously collected samples from patients for our retrospective symptomatic colorectal trial and a further 14,000 samples are being collected over 24 months from August 2014, from patients for our prospective screening colorectal trial. All research and development operations are currently in Belgium due to its favorable environment for small companies including a well-trained technical work force, low cost quality research facilities and access to government support, including our funding from the Walloon Region.

In 2015, we decided to completely focus our efforts on the clinical in-vitro diagnostics, or IVD, market, where products are used for patient diagnosis and can only be accessed after a test has either been approved for clinical use in the United States by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, or for risk assessment as a Laboratory Developed Test, or LDT, in the United States under a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, or CLIA, waiver. A similar system operates in China through the Chinese Food and Drug Administration, or CFDA. In the European Union, approval is obtained by declaration and marking that the test conforms to the essential requirements of the relevant European health, safety and environmental protection legislation, or CE Marking. The CE Mark is also recognized in certain Asian territories including India for the private payer market.

We obtained our first CE Mark certification in September 2015, for a single biomarker for colorectal cancer, or CRC, and plan to certify two new biomarkers quarterly in 2016 as well as our symptomatic diagnostic panel test for CRC. We expect that we will be required to do further United States trials to achieve FDA approval for our CRC test both as an adjunct test as a 510(k) application and under a Premarket Approval, or PMA, as a screening test . We are committed to filing for FDA approval to allow patient access to our tests in the United States as soon as practicable. We intend to begin 510(k) purposed U.S. based trials in 2016 and pursue FDA clearance as an adjunct test in 2017 for CRC and for lung and pancreatic cancer in 2018. We intend to begin PMA purposed U.S. based trials in 2016 or 2017 and pursue FDA approval upon completion. 

We also expect that we will be required to do trials in China to achieve CFDA approval for our lung cancer test, provided we can ensure adequate protection of our intellectual property in China. Local validation studies will be required to support sales of our CE Marked colorectal cancer test in India for the private payer market. We plan to seek distribution partners for the major Asian markets in 2016. 

Our Nucleosomics &#174; biomarker platform is a technology that can be used for a wide variety of cancers. We are currently developing Nucleosomics &#174; tests for a number of major cancers including colorectal, pancreatic, lung and aggressive prostate. We have one trial underway in the United States with MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas, to establish the efficacy of Nucleosomics &#174; in a precision medicine application to differentiate between the more aggressive anaplastic prostate cancer, and the typical, less-aggressive castration resistant prostate cancer. We are also validating the use of our tests for early diagnosis of endometriosis, a benign but often debilitating condition, and the leading cause of admissions to hospital for abdominal pain. Endometriosis affects approximately 10% of women and is a leading cause of female infertility 2 . At present, there are no non-surgical diagnostic tests for endometriosis.

The Market 

Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, accounting for around 8.2 million annual deaths globally. 3 In the United States alone, there were an estimated 13.8 million cancer survivors in 2010. 4 By 2020, this figure is expected to rise to 18.1 million. The Agency for Healthcare research and Quality, or AHRQ, estimated the health economic burden for cancer relating to direct medical costs at approximately $88.7 billion for 2011. 5 The annualized cost of cancer care based on analysis of Medicare payments linked to Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results, or SEER, Program data is projected to reach $157 billion at 2020. 6 These figures are mirrored across the globe and we expect will continue to grow as populations age. This is a large potential addressable market for which we believe diagnostics will be a significant part. Incidence of, and mortality due to, CRC in the U.S. have been steadily falling since the mid 1980&#146;s with an acceleration of reduction in both men (3% per annum) and women (2.3% per annum) over the last 15 years. This is largely due to early detection and removal of polyps via colonoscopy. 7 The Pap test has had a similar impact in improving 5-year survival rates in women with precancerous and cancerous cervical lesions. 8

Statistically, the chances of surviving cancer are greatly improved by early detection and treatment. However, there are currently very few blood tests for diagnosis of cancer in common clinical use. The only commonly used blood-screening test for any cancer is the Prostate-Specific Antigen, or PSA, test for prostate cancer. We consider the PSA test to have relatively poor diagnostic accuracy (detecting approximately 70% of prostate cancers and misdiagnoses about 30% of healthy men as positive for cancer) but is widely used because it is the best product currently available. 9 This test is intended to be used to monitor patients after definitive diagnosis or treatment. The American Cancer Society recommends that prostate cancer screening should not occur without an informed decision making process regarding risks. 10 In 2012, the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force recommended against PSA-based screening for healthy men because of a &#147;moderate or high probability&#148; that the service has no benefit or that the harms outweigh the benefits.&#148; 11 There are currently no commonly used blood tests for screening for lung, pancreatic or colorectal cancer.

Further, current methods of cancer diagnosis are either invasive, not cost effective, have low acceptance or cannot provide accurate results. The inadequacy of existing diagnostic products means that most cancers are only diagnosed once the patient experiences symptoms and the cancer is well established. By this stage, it will often have spread beyond the primary tumor (metastatic cancers), making it substantially more difficult to treat. For example colorectal cancer is one of the more survivable diseases if caught early: it has an observed five-year survival rate of 92% in stage I, but only 11% in stage IV. 12 We believe that early, non-invasive, accurate cancer diagnosis remains a significant unmet medical need and a huge commercial opportunity. For these reasons, cancer diagnostics is an active field of research and development both academically and commercially.

The global IVD market is forecast to reach $65 billion in 2018, 13 driven by the increasing health care demands of an aging population. In the United States, 14 the IVD market is made up of:

&#183;

Immunochemistry of tissue samples (expected to grow 6.8% per annum from 2011-2018, with an expected value of $25.5 billion by 2018). 15 These are mostly used to confirm cancer diagnosis post-surgery and to determine cancer sub-type; 

&#183;

Immunoassay (chemical tests used to detect a substance in blood or body fluid), is expected to be the second largest market with a value of more than $19.1 billion by 2018. 16 These tests are mostly used to monitor for disease progress and relapse. This market segment includes our future Nucleosomics &#174; products, which will be blood immunoassay tests for modified histones for the diagnosis of cancer.

&#183;

Testing at hospital laboratories: $30 billion annual revenue for eight billion tests in 2011;

&#183;

Testing at CLIA laboratories: $20 billion annual revenue for 3 billion tests in 2011; and

&#183;

Testing at physician office laboratories: $3 billion annual revenue for 1.2 billion tests in 2011. 

Our Product Candidates 

Commercialization of our future products in the clinical IVD market (e.g. for patient diagnosis in hospitals, clinics, etc.), requires government approval (CE Marking in Europe, FDA approval in the United States and/or CFDA approval in China). We obtained our first biomarker CE certification in September 2015 and plan to certify two to three new markers quarterly in 2016. We plan to CE Mark our CRC test panel for Europe in the second half of 2016 for the symptomatic market. 

The technology behind the products that we are currently developing is described in detail below:

NuQ &#174; Suite of Epigenetic Cancer Blood Tests 

Using our Nucleosomics &#174; technology, we have developed twenty eight epigenetic NuQ &#174; assays, which are designed to detect the level and structure of nucleosomes in blood. Epigenetics is the science of how genes are switched &#147;on&#148; or &#147;off&#148; in the body&#146;s cells. A major factor controlling the switching &#147;on&#148; and &#147;off&#148; is the structuring of DNA. The DNA in human cells is packaged as protein complexes in a &#147;beads on a string&#148; structure. Each individual protein/DNA &#147;bead&#148; is called a nucleosome. These nucleosomes then form additional structures with increasingly dense packing, culminating in chromosomes containing hundreds of thousands of nucleosomes.

Cancer is characterized by uncontrolled and often rapid cell growth which exceeds the corresponding rate of cell death. When cells die, the DNA fragments into individual nucleosomes which are released into the blood as illustrated in Figure 2 below. The cell debris in the bloodstream is eventually recycled back into the body. When a cancer is present, the number of dying cells can overwhelm the recycling process, leaving the excess fragments, including the nucleosomes, in the blood. Importantly, the structure of nucleosomes is not uniform but subject to immense variety, and nucleosomes in cancer cells have differences in structure from those in healthy cells. 18 

Figure 2 &#150; Release of nucleosomes into blood

Blood nucleosome levels can be raised in conditions other than cancer including in auto-immune disease, inflammatory disease, endometriosis, sepsis, and in the immediate aftermath of major trauma (for example following a heart attack, surgery or car accident). Our primary focus is on cancer diagnosis but we also intend to pursue diagnostic opportunities in other disease areas.

To date we have developed twenty eight NuQ &#174; blood assays that fall into the five main types set forth below and are intended to complement each other and, together, to provide a total solution.

&#183;

NuQ &#174; -X : We have developed two blood assays in the NuQ &#174; -X family to detect the presence of cancer by detecting nucleosomes containing specific nucleotides. 

&#183;

NuQ &#174; -V : We have developed three blood assays in the NuQ &#174; -V family to detect cancer by detecting nucleosomes containing specific histone variants. Through our research, we have found that the pattern of blood levels of the different types of histone variants in nucleosomes is different for different cancer types. 

&#183;

NuQ &#174; -M : We have developed seventeen blood assays in the NuQ &#174; -M family to detect cancer by detecting nucleosomes containing modified histones, the proteins that package and order DNA into nucleosomes. 

&#183;

NuQ &#174; -A : We have developed five blood assays in the NuQ &#174; -A family to detect cancer by detecting nucleosome-protein adducts. 

&#183;

NuQ &#174; -T : We have developed a NuQ &#174; -T assay to detect cancer by detecting total blood nucleosome levels. 

Generally, the tests described above are being developed to work in combination, collectively called the NuQ &#174; panel, for the IVD market. In our biggest independent clinical trial to date, we have used the NuQ &#174; panel prototypes to test approximately 4800 samples from patients with symptoms associated with colorectal cancer (the &#147;Denmark Trial&#148;). Additionally the NuQ &#174; panel prototypes have been used to test a small number of blood samples from lung and prostate cancer patients.

NuQ &#174; Clinical Diagnostic Products 

There are three basic platforms in the clinical IVD market that we intend to adapt our future NuQ &#174; products to in the future. 

&#183;

Centralized Laboratory Market: Centralized laboratories test thousands of blood samples taken from patients everyday mostly using fully automated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, or ELISA, systems, commonly known as random access analyzers, usually supplied by one of the global diagnostics companies. Tests run on ELISA systems use components of the immune system and chemicals to detect immune responses in the body. ELISA systems analyze thousands of blood samples every day and can run dozens of different ELISA tests in any combination on any sample and for many samples simultaneously. The systems are highly automated and rapid (as little as ten minutes for many tests), and can be run at low costs. Additionally, ELISA instruments are used in all major hospitals throughout the United States and Europe and therefore, are well understood by clinicians and laboratory staff. It is more cost-effective and technically simple for hospitals and clinics to run several blood samples simultaneously using ELISA tests compared to non-ELISA tests or alternative methods for screening cancer. All of the NuQ &#174; tests that we are in the process of developing are designed for ELISA systems. A typical example of an automated ELISA system is shown below in Figure 4.

Figure 4 &#150; Example of an Automated ELISA System

One option that may be available to us in the future is to license our Nucleosomics &#174; technology to a global diagnostics company. Another option that may be available to us is to sell manual and/or semi-automated 96 well ELISA plates for use by these laboratories. We do not have an anticipated timeframe for licensing our Nucleosomics &#174; technology or selling ELISA plates to laboratories, although we are actively seeking such relationships worldwide. 

&#183;

Point-of-Care Devices : Point-of-care devices are small instruments that perform tens of ELISA tests per day rapidly on blood taken from a finger prick. The instruments can be implemented in any oncology clinic and tests can be performed during patient consultations. We intend to contract with an instrument manufacturer to produce these instruments for point-of-care NuQ &#174; testing for the oncologist&#146;s office, general doctor&#146;s office or at home testing. We aim to enter the point-of-care clinical market in Europe and the United States about 18 months after launch on the manual platform, as we will first need to adapt test prototypes to these small instruments and demonstrate their success in the greater diagnostics market before these products will be adopted by others in the industry. At this stage of its development, we cannot accurately predict the costs to manufacture these devices or their selling price. As of the date of this report, we have not entered into any discussions or negotiations regarding the manufacture or sale of these devices. See Figure 5 for an example of a point-of-care device.

Figure 5 &#150; Example of a Point-of-Care Device

The above photograph is an illustration of our intended products. To date, we have no products available for sale on the IVD market and there is no guarantee that any such products will be developed or commercialized on such market. 

&#183;

Disposable Tests for Doctor&#146;s Office or Home Use : Disposable tests for use in a doctor&#146;s office or at home are single shot disposable devices which can be provided by a clinician as part of a screening program or purchased over the counter at any chemist shop or pharmacy and test a drop of blood taken from a finger prick. The test can be administered at a doctor&#146;s office using a point-of-care device or performed at home using a home testing kit, neither of which requires laboratory involvement. Thus, the patient experiences considerably lower costs using these tests as compared to traditional laboratory tests. The format of the self-use home testing kit is very easy to use and reproduce and does not rely on laboratory processing. There are currently no useful diagnostics tests suitable for mass screening for cancer in general through a simple self-use home testing kit. Figure 6 below shows a basic home use test on the left which displays the results of the test in the two windows, similar to a pregnancy test. The test on the right is more sophisticated and plugs into a meter or the USB port of a computer for analysis and interpretation allowing results to be sent directly to a clinician.

Figure 6 &#150; Examples of Disposable Tests for Doctor&#146;s Office or Home Use

The above photograph is an illustration of our intended products. To date, we have no products available for sale on the IVD market and there is no guarantee that any such products will be developed or commercialized on such market. 

We intend to contract with a specialist company to adapt the NuQ &#174; test prototypes to the doctor&#146;s office or home use system and to contract with a manufacturer for the production of these tests beginning approximately 18 months after launch on the manual platform. We have not entered into any agreements of contracts with a specialist company or manufacturer. Initially, we intend to sell these tests for professional use only (doctor&#146;s office) and to sell the tests for non-professional home use at a later time. We do not yet have an estimated timeframe for entering into this market. Further, at this early stage of our development, we cannot accurately determine the manufacturing costs or selling price of these tests.

NuQ &#174; tests for non-cancer conditions 

Blood nucleosome levels can be raised in conditions other than cancer including in auto-immune disease, inflammatory disease, endometriosis, sepsis, and in the immediate aftermath of major trauma (for example following a heart attack, surgery or car accident). Our primary focus is on cancer diagnosis but we also intend to pursue diagnostic opportunities in other disease areas. Our primary non-cancer focus is the development of a test for endometriosis. 

Endometriosis is a progressive gynecological condition that affects one in ten women of childbearing age and approximately 176 million women worldwide. The disease is the leading cause of infertility in women, with up to 40% of all infertile women suffering from endometriosis. At present, there is currently no existing non-surgical diagnostic test for endometriosis. Diagnosis is typically made via invasive and expensive laparoscopy, followed by a histological examination of any lesions found to confirm the diagnosis. The lack of a suitable screening test has also held up development of a cure for the disease.

Singapore Volition acquired the patent application for an endometriosis test in June 2011 and we are now in the process of developing the test based on our existing Nucleosomics &#174; technology. We designed the test to be a simple blood test taken at two stages of a woman&#146;s menstrual cycle, during menses and partway through the month. If the two measurements show quantitative differences in total nucleosome level, endometriosis is indicated. We are currently conducting hypothesis-testing and clinical proof of concept work (to demonstrate that the test is feasible and is effective) on the endometriosis test in our laboratory. We completed pilot studies of the test in 2012 and received the first samples from The University of Oxford in the first quarter of 2015 as part of a larger endometriosis study. The University of Oxford will provide serum and plasma samples from approximately 350 patients with endometriosis and 150 control patients over a period of two years. Further samples from a prospective serial collection in 20 healthy women and 20 women with confirmed endometriosis will be provided by Clinical Trials Laboratory Services (UK) in the first half of 2016. The test is too early in its development for us to accurately determinate the manufacturing costs and sale price of the test. 

HyperGenomics &#174; 

We are in the process of developing HyperGenomics &#174; tissue and blood-based tests to determine disease subtype following initial diagnosis and to help decide the most appropriate therapy. We have decided to focus on our clinical IVD Nucleosomics &#174; products in 2015 and only continue with background work in HyperGenomics &#174; until we have the capital and management resources to do multiple programs concurrently.

Selecting the correct treatment approach can significantly improve outcome, reduce side effects and deliver cost savings. The HyperGenomics &#174; tests will be performed on cancer tissue obtained either by biopsy or during surgical resection to determine the cancer subtype and to determine optimal treatment regimens. The HyperGenomics &#174; profiling tests are being developed to provide detailed epigenetic characterization of tumors in a cost effective way. A new protocol for analyzing white blood cells &#150; a precursor to applications in leukemia - was developed in 2012. We commenced development of a bioinformatics pipeline to analyze the complex data sets generated from the biological samples in 2012 and continued development of the algorithms in 2013. A new in house methodology patents for HyperGenomics &#174; was filed in 2015.

We realized our first revenue of $50,000 from contract research in 2012. We will allocate resources to the HyperGenomics &#174; research use only, or RUO, kit as soon as is practical given our focus on the Nucleosomics &#174; clinical IVD products commencing in 2015. Beta-testing is expected to take approximately six months to complete once initiated and we expect it to cost approximately $50,000. If beta-testing is successful, we expect to launch HyperGenomics &#174; research kits into the RUO market in Europe and in the United States.

Further exemplification work on the HyperGenomics &#174; platform is being carried out through a PhD studentship at the German Cancer Centre in Heidelberg funded by Volition. The program includes development of HyperGenomic &#174; profiles in a range of cells and cancer models and comparison to established industry standard analytical techniques.

We plan to launch the HyperGenomics &#174; test into the IVD market in Europe and the United States following the commercialization of the test into the RUO market. The estimated timeframe for its launch into the IVD market has not yet been determined and will depend upon the speed of clinical trials and market approval. The HyperGenomics &#174; test is too early in its development for us to accurately determinate the manufacturing costs and sale price of the test. 

Clinical Studies 

We have completed two clinical studies in colorectal cancer, one study in pancreatic cancer and one study in lung cancer with the results announced as set forth below. 

Completed Colorectal Cancer Studies 

&#183; 

Results of a completed clinical study in colorectal cancer were announced in the fourth quarter of 2015. The study included 121 patients referred for colonoscopy at the university hospital, CHU Dinant Godinne - UCL Namur, in Belgium, who either presented with symptoms suggesting the presence of colorectal cancer or were high-risk subjects. Analysis of the results revealed that a panel test of four NuQ &#174; biomarker assays, adjusted for age, detected 91% of colorectal cancer cases at 90% specificity. In addition, the results showed equally accurate detection of early and late-stage cancers. The analysis also revealed that the same panel test detected 67% of the type of polyps most likely to develop into cancer. 

&#183;

Results of a completed blinded retrospective clinical study in colorectal adenomas and colorectal cancer in collaboration with Hvidovre Hospital in Denmark were announced in the first quarter of 2016. The primary objective of the study was to identify new nucleosome biomarkers to improve precancerous polyp/adenoma detection. A secondary objective was to identify new nucleosome biomarkers to improve early stage colorectal cancer detection. In the study approximately 430 samples from patients with single or multiple precancerous polyp(s) (181 patients), subjects with no polyps or colorectal cancers and without other diseases (160 subjects); plus 88 early stage (I/II) colorectal cancer patients were investigated. The cohort comprised high and low risk polyps of various histologies. The samples were analyzed using 18 NuQ &#174; assays. Use of newly developed NuQ &#174; assays, as part of a panel of five of the Company&#146;s NuQ &#174; biomarker blood assays, accurately detected 75% of colorectal adenomas, or polyps, that were most likely to become cancerous in an age adjusted analysis. A NuQ &#174; panel also detected 86% of early stage I colorectal cancers in an age adjusted analysis. 

Completed Pancreatic Cancer Study 

&#183; 

Results of a completed clinical study in pancreatic cancer were announced in the third quarter of 2015. The peer-reviewed study was conducted in collaboration with Lund University, Sweden, and led by Roland Andersson, MD, PhD, Professor of Surgery and Vice-Dean, Faculty of Medicine. This study assessed blood samples from 59 individuals, including 25 patients with stage 2 pancreatic cancer, 10 patients with other pancreatic diseases and 24 healthy individuals, using VolitionRx's Nucleosomics &#174; technology platform. Analysis of the blood samples demonstrated that a panel of five NuQ &#174; assays distinguished 84% (21 of 25) of the early-stage pancreatic cancer cases from healthy subjects, with only two false positive results among the healthy subjects. The detection rate of the test was improved further to 92% (23 of 25) of cancer cases by inclusion of the classical CA19-9 cancer biomarker with no false positives results among the healthy subjects. Full results of the study have been published in Clinical Epigenetics, the official journal of the Clinical Epigenetics Society. 

Completed Lung Cancer Study 

&#183;

Results of a completed clinical study in lung cancer were announced in the fourth quarter of 2014. The lung cancer study tested both sputum and blood samples taken from 46 patients attending the Pneumology department of the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, or CHU, de Liege in Belgium . The patients were diagnosed either with non-small cell lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, or with no disease (healthy). In sputum samples, our NuQ &#174; test was able to detect 18 of 21 lung cancer cases (85%) with no false positive results for healthy subjects (0 of 13). The sputum assay data is age and smoking independent. In blood the NuQ &#174; assays were able to detect 16 of the 21 patients with cancer (76%) with a single false positive result from a healthy subject (1 of 13). The blood assay data is adjusted for age and smoking risk. 

We currently have clinical studies underway in colorectal cancer and lung cancer and prostate cancer as well as a &#147;pan-cancer&#148; study in 27 cancers as set forth below. Further studies in lung and pancreatic cancer are planned to commence in 2016. 

Current Colorectal Cancer Studies 

&#183;

A retrospective symptomatic colorectal cancer study with Hvidovre Hospital in Denmark with full access to all Danish national registries and databases analyzing approximately 4,800 previously collected samples from patients with colorectal cancer, polyps or adenomas, benign bowel diseases, or other malignancies, all of whom have undergone a colonoscopy, which we refer to as the &#147;Retrospective CRC Trial. The Retrospective CRC Trial is designed to (i) establish a NuQ &#174; profile for the detection of colorectal cancer in an initially blinded cohort, which we refer to as Phase I; and (ii) validate that profile in a second blind cohort, which we refer to as Phase II. As part of Phase I, at the end of the third quarter 2015, we announced detection of 81% of CRC cases at 78% specificity in an age adjusted analysis. Additional NuQ &#174; assays are currently being tested on these Phase I samples. Phase II commenced using the best NuQ &#174; assays on the blind sample cohort in 2015 with the results intended to be used to support CE Marking of specific NuQ &#174; assays in the second half of 2016.

&#183;

A prospective Fecal Immunochemical Test, or FIT, screening colorectal cancer study with Hvidovre Hospital in Denmark with 14,000 samples being collected over 24 months from August 2014, from patients who have had a fecal occult blood test, which we refer to as the FIT Test. Patients who tested positive following the FIT Test will additionally have a colonoscopy and we have full access to these results and the patient&#146;s medical history. It is anticipated that 8,000 samples will be collected from patients who tested positive following a FIT Test and 6,000 samples from patients tested negative. The Prospective CRC Study is designed to evaluate the performance of the validated NuQ &#174; panel from the Retrospective CRC Trial in a large non-symptomatic cohort. The samples will be analyzed in batches throughout the collection period. This study will establish the performance of NuQ &#174; tests in relation to FIT which is the market standard in European markets. The study is in the collection and analysis phase with the first results expected in late 2016.

Current Lung Cancer Studies 

&#183;

A prospective lung cancer study conducted with the Liege University Hospital (Belgium) with 240 subjects collected from subjects with lung cancer, COPD and with healthy lungs. The trial is designed to evaluate the potential of a NuQ &#174; based test alone and with additional patient data, to detect the most common Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer. Preliminary results from the first 73 subjects released in the fourth quarter of 2015 demonstrated that, when combined with details of smoking history, a panel of four NuQ &#174; biomarker assays detected 93% of Non-Small Cell lung cancer cases (27 of 29), with 91% specificity(2 false positive results among 22 healthy subjects). Collection and full analysis is expected to complete in the third quarter of 2017.

&#183;

A 600 subject study conducted with Bonn University Hospital (Germany) collected from subjects with lung cancer, subjects with benign (non-cancer lung diseases) and healthy control subjects. Collection and analysis is expected to complete in 2016.

Current Prostate Cancer Studies 

&#183;

A retrospective study to evaluate NuQ &#174; assays in a treatment selection setting to distinguish anaplastic cancer, a particularly aggressive form of prostate cancer, from typical castration resistant prostate cancer, or CRPC, the less aggressive form. This study is in progress and no results have been announced to date.

&#183;

A retrospective study with Surrey Cancer Research Institute, University of Surrey, UK with 550 blood samples collected from patients attending the hospital will be analyzed using a panel of NuQ &#174; biomarker assays. Three groups of patients will be assessed: those with aggressive prostate cancer; those with indolent or slow-growing prostate cancer; and age-matched healthy controls. The analysis of the panel of NuQ &#174; assay data is expected to be complete in the first quarter of 2016. In addition to determining the NuQ &#174; blood test's accuracy in detecting prostate cancer, the study will also assess the tests' ability to distinguish among the different prostate conditions and healthy samples. This study is in progress and no results have been announced to date.

&#183;

A prospective prostate cancer study, carried out by Immune Health, with 120 patients with aggressive prostate cancer; those with indolent or slow-growing prostate cancer; and age-matched healthy controls. The study is currently in the recruiting phase and the analysis of the panel of NuQ &#174; assay data is expected to be complete in the first quarter of 2017. The study will also assess the ability to distinguish clinically actionable, aggressive prostate cancer from non-actionable slow growing disease. This study is in collection and no results have been announced to date.

Current &#147;Pan-Cancer&#148; Study 

&#183;

A large prospective study conducted with University Hospital in Bonn, Germany on approximately 4,700 patients to evaluate the performance of our NuQ &#174; assays on patients with the 27 most prevalent cancer types and other diseases, as well as healthy subjects. Collection of blood samples has commenced. Analysis of the blood samples will be performed with a wide range of NuQ &#174; assays. The primary objectives of this study are; (i) to identify further cancers that are highly amenable to detection by NuQ &#174; assays; and (ii) to identify NuQ &#174; assays suitable for the differential diagnosis between cancers. The study is expected to complete in the first half of 2017.

Research and Development Expenditures 

For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our expenditures for research and development activities were $6.1 million and $4.0 million, respectively. Such research and development focused on responding to the need for early, accurate diagnostic tests through the development of our proprietary technologies and product prototypes. We intend to develop a range of products over the next five to ten years. None of these costs are borne directly by customers.

Future Intellectual Property Strategy 

We intend to continue our development of the Nucleosomics &#174; and HyperGenomics &#174; technologies and will continue to apply for patents for future product developments. Our strategy is to protect the technologies and gain market exclusivity with patents in Europe and the U.S and in other strategic countries. The patents on the technologies underlying our products should provide broad coverage for each product, including protection through at least 2031 for products developed using the NuQ &#174; -X, NuQ &#174; -V and NuQ &#174; -A technologies.

Trademarks 

We also own a number of trademarks that protect our marks including &#147;NuQ &#174; ,&#148; &#147;Nucleosomics &#174; &#148; and &#147;HyperGenomics &#174; .&#148;

Government Regulations 

The health care industry, and thus our business, is subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign regulation. Some of the pertinent laws have not been definitively interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of subjective interpretations. In addition, these laws and their interpretations are subject to change. 

Both United States federal and state governmental agencies continue to subject the health care industry to intense regulatory scrutiny, including heightened civil and criminal enforcement efforts. As indicated by work plans and reports issued by these agencies, the federal government will continue to scrutinize, among other things, the marketing, labeling, promotion, manufacturing and export of diagnostic health care products. Our diagnostic products fall within the medical device category and are subject to FDA clearance or approval in the United States. 

The federal government also has increased funding in recent years to fight health care fraud, and various agencies, such as the United States Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, or OIG, and state Medicaid fraud control units, are coordinating their enforcement efforts.

In Europe, medical devices are regulated by self-certification through the CE Mark system. Under the system, developers and manufacturers must operate a Quality System and validate medical devices in a limited clinical trial to demonstrate the manufacturer has met analytical and clinical performance criteria. VolitionRx has implemented an International Organization for Standardization standard - ISO 13485 - quality management system for the design and manufacture of medical devices. ISO 13485 addresses managerial awareness of regulatory requirements, control systems, inspection and traceability, device design, risk and performance criteria as well as verification for corrective and preventative measures for device failure. Medical device companies such as ours are subject to pre-market compliance assessments from Notified Bodies, a certification organization which the national authority (the competent authority) of a European member state designates to carry out one or more of the conformity assessment procedures. ISO 13485 certification establishes conformity to specific European Union directives related to medical devices and allows CE Marking and sale of the device. The European Union has recently proposed terms that would impose additional requirements to obtain a CE Mark, which could result in delays and further expense, in terms of staff costs, to us as compared to the current CE Mark approval process, as the new regulations will require each product submission to be thoroughly audited by Notified Bodies, instead of the current self-certification process. The EU Medical Devices Regulation, or MDR, and IVD Regulation, or IVDR, are both in the final stages of the legislative procedure and are estimated to be furnished sometime in 2016, allowing them to come into effect by the end of 2016, or early 2017. Some time will be required to polish the agreed text and have it translated into the official EU languages.

We will also be required to comply with numerous other federal, state, and local laws relating to matters such as safe working conditions, industrial safety, and labor laws. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations in the future, and lack of compliance could have material adverse effects on our operations. 

We believe that we have structured our business operations to comply with applicable legal requirements. However, it is possible that governmental entities or other third parties could interpret these laws differently and assert otherwise.

Please refer to the section below titled &#147;Government Approval&#148; for additional information.

Government Approval 

All of our intended products are designed to be non-invasive, meaning they cannot harm the subject other than through misdiagnosis. Our strategy is to go through the process of obtaining regulatory approval for IVD products to be used clinically on cancer patients. Conformit&#233; Europ&#233;enne, or CE Marking, is a mandatory conformity mark for certain products placed on market in the European Union including, medical devices and IVD tests. CE Marking ensures that the manufacturer&#146;s product conforms to the essential requirements of the relevant European health, safety and environmental protection legislation. We intend to first focus on obtaining regulatory approval in Europe, due to the grant of the NuQ &#174; patent in Europe and the relatively fast European CE Marking process. We currently anticipate this will be followed closely by licensing to CLIA labs for a LDT in the United States, and/or regulatory submissions in the United States and in the rest of the world. In many territories, the European CE Mark is sufficient to place products on the clinical market and, where it is not, it often simplifies the regulation processes.

Europe &#150; CE Marking 

Manufacturers in the European Union and abroad must meet CE Marking requirements, where applicable, in order to market their products in Europe. The CE Mark certifies that a product has met European Union health, safety, and environmental requirements which ensure consumer safety. 

To receive the CE Mark, our diagnostic products must meet certain requirements as set forth in the In-Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Directive. The requirements to procure CE Marking for In-Vitro Diagnostic Medical products are: 

&#183;

analytical validation of the products;

&#183;

clinical validation of the products (which can be retrospective clinical studies using biobank patient samples, i.e. blood samples from historic patients);

&#183;

implementation of regulatory compliant manufacture; 

&#183;

implementation of a Quality System; and 

&#183;

certification from the International Organization for Standardization (this last requirement is not technically required but will aid the regulatory approval process in Europe and the United States).

The first NuQ &#174; -X assay received a CE Mark in September 2015 and our R&#38;D, manufacturing and distribution facility, Belgian Volition SA received EN ISO 13485, 2012 certification (an internationally recognized quality system) at the start of 2016. The requirements listed above are general requirements that apply to all of our intended products. In compliance with the In-Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Directive and the CE Marking process, we have ensured that all development and validation is carried out in a manner consistent with regulatory approval. Additionally, we have maintained proper records so that our future products can be approved as quickly and simply as possible. We have engaged a regulatory advisor to lead the Company in meeting the last requirement for all of our future products. All of these requirements must be completed prior to the submission of an application for CE Marking. We will submit applications, which will contain a dossier of all relevant analytical, clinical and manufacturing data following retrospective clinical studies which we expect will require a total of approximately six (6) months to complete. We estimate the cost of obtaining CE Marking will be approximately $500,000 per NuQ &#174; panel. We expect to apply for CE Marking for additional NuQ &#174; -V (variant) and NuQ&#174;-T (total) assays NuQ &#174; -V001 and NuQ &#174; -T003 in the first quarter of 2016, with a further NuQ &#174; -V002 and NuQ &#174; -M001 (Modification) at the end of the second quarter of 2016 as well as the colorectal cancer screening test in the second half of 2016 (for European market). Sales of our clinical products can occur in Europe once CE Marking has been granted.

In Europe, IVD companies are able to self-certify that they meet the appropriate regulatory requirements and are subject to inspection for enforcement. European agencies, conduct market surveillance to ensure the provisions of the applicable Directive have been met for products marketed within the European Union. In pursuit of this goal, surveillance authorities will:

&#183;

audit commercial, industrial and storage premises;

&#183;

visit work places and other premises where products are put into service and used;

&#183;

organize random checks; and

&#183;

take samples of products for examination and testing.

If a product is found to be noncompliant, corrective action will depend on and be appropriate to the level of noncompliance. Others responsible for the noncompliance of the product will be held accountable as well. Penalties, which may include imprisonment, are determined by national law.

U.S. Regulations 

Food and Drug Administration 

In the United States, in vitro diagnostics are regulated by the FDA as medical devices. There are two principal regulatory pathways to receive authorization to market in vitro diagnostics, a 510(k) premarket notification and a premarket approval application, or PMA. The FDA makes a risk-based determination as to which pathway a particular in vitro diagnostic is eligible. In addition, since July 2012 with the enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, a de novo pathway is directly available for certain low to moderate risk devices that would not qualify for the 510(k) notification pathway due to lack of a predicate device. The information that must be submitted to the FDA in order to obtain clearance or approval to market a new medical device varies depending on how the medical device is classified by the FDA. Medical devices are classified into one of three classes on the basis of their level of risk and the controls deemed by the FDA to be necessary to reasonably assure their safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are subject to &#147;general controls&#148;, including establishment registration, device listing, labeling, reporting and recordkeeping, and adherence to FDA&#146;s quality system regulations, which are device-specific good manufacturing practices. Class II devices are subject to the general controls and also special controls, including guidance documents, performance standards, and postmarket surveillance. Class III devices are subject to most of the previously identified requirements as well as to premarket approval. Most Class I devices are exempt from the requirement for premarket notification to the FDA; most Class II devices require the submission and clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification to the FDA prior to commercial marketing; and Class III devices require submission and approval of a PMA. Device manufacturers and PMA holders are also subject to numerous postmarketing requirements. 

The FDA can require the submission of clinical data to support 510(k) clearance, de novo reclassification, or a PMA. Clinical studies undertaken in the United States are subject to FDA requirements applicable to investigational device exemptions, or IDEs, institutional review boards, or IRBs, review and approval, and informed consent of the study subjects. 

Clinical Trials of Devices 

Clinical trials for a medical device must be conducted in accordance with FDA requirements, including informed consent from study participants, review and approval by an IRB at each institution where a trial will be conducted, financial disclosure by clinical investigators, and listing of appropriate studies on ClinicalTrials.gov. Additionally, FDA approval of an IDE application must be obtained in order to conduct a clinical trial of &#147;significant risk&#148; devices, which are devices that present a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject, including devices that are of substantial importance in diagnosing or treating disease, or preventing impairment of human health. Sponsors of clinical trials are responsible for monitoring the studies, and for recordkeeping and reporting. The FDA may prevent clinical trials from moving forward, and may suspend or terminate trials once initiated. The FDA may inspect sponsor records, clinical investigators, and clinical sites involved in clinical trials. The FDA may take enforcement action for non-compliance with any of these requirements. 

510(k) Premarket Notification 

A 510(k) notification requires the sponsor to demonstrate that a medical device is substantially equivalent to another marketed device, termed a &#147;predicate device&#148;, that is legally marketed in the United States and for which a PMA was not required. A device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device if it has the same intended use and same technological characteristics as the predicate or has the same intended use but different technological characteristics, where the information submitted to the FDA does not raise new questions of safety or effectiveness and demonstrates that the device is at least as safe and effective as the legally marketed predicate device. 

The FDA&#146;s performance goal review time for a 510(k) notification is 90 days from the date of receipt. In practice, however, the review process often takes significantly longer. After its initial review, the FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, in order to make a decision regarding the claims of substantial equivalence. Clinical studies of in vitro diagnostic products are typically designed with the primary objective of obtaining analytical or clinical performance data. If the FDA believes that the device is not substantially equivalent to a predicate device, it will issue a &#147;Not Substantially Equivalent&#148; letter and designate the device as a Class III device, which will require the submission and approval of a PMA before the new device may be marketed. Under certain circumstances, the sponsor may submit a de novo petition to the FDA to reclassify the new device as a Class I or Class II device. 

If a predicate device does not exist, the FDA may make a risk-based determination that the device is eligible for de novo reclassification and premarket review instead of requiring a PMA. The de novo process is similar to clearance of the 510(k) premarket notification, and typically requires the submission of clinical data to support the reclassification. A de novo petition can be submitted either prior to the submission of a 510(k) when no predicate device can be identified, or after the FDA determines that a new device is &#147;not substantially equivalent&#148; due to lack of an appropriate predicate device. Under the FDASIA, the FDA may &#147;decline to undertake a classification&#148; if the FDA either (1) identifies a legally marketed predicate device that would be appropriate for a 510(k), or (2) determines that the device is not low to moderate risk or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls cannot be developed. The statute directs the FDA to classify the device within 120 days following receipt of the de novo application. 

Premarket Approval 

The PMA process is more complex, costly and time consuming than the 510(k) process. A PMA must be supported by manufacturing data, preclinical data, and more detailed and comprehensive scientific evidence, including clinical data, to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the medical device for its intended purpose. If the device is determined to present a &#147;significant risk,&#148; the sponsor may not begin a clinical trial until it submits an application for an investigational device exemption, or IDE, to the FDA and obtains approval from the FDA to begin the trial. 

After the PMA is submitted, the FDA has 45 days to make a threshold determination that the PMA is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If the PMA is deemed not sufficiently complete, the FDA will issue a &#147;refuse to file&#148; determination. If the PMA is complete, the FDA will file the PMA and begin a substantive review of the application. The FDA is subject to a performance goal review time for a PMA that is 180 days from the date of filing, although in practice the total review time is longer. Questions from the FDA, requests for additional data, additional testing and submissions by the applicant, and referral to an advisory committee may delay the process considerably. Indeed, the total process may take several years and there is no guarantee that the PMA will ever be approved. Even if approved, the FDA may limit the indication for which the device may be marketed. The FDA may also request additional clinical studies or registries as a condition of approval or even after the PMA is approved. Any changes to the medical device may require a supplemental PMA to be submitted and approved. In addition, annual reports and other reports are required. 

Requirements Applicable to Marketed Devices 

The FDA Quality System Regulations, or QSRs, impose requirements for design control and validation, management review, complaint handling and investigation, labeling control, servicing and recordkeeping, among others. The FDA also regulates device imports and exports. Manufacturers are required to submit medical device reports for deaths or serious injuries associated with the use of their devices, and for malfunctions that could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. The FDA also requires reporting of certain corrections or removals of devices. Labeling and promotional activities are subject to regulation by the FDA, and certain device advertising is subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission. 

Laboratory Developed Tests 

Although the FDA has claimed for many years that it has the statutory authority to regulate laboratory-developed tests, or LDTs, as medical devices, the agency has generally exercised enforcement discretion toward them. LDTs are tests that are developed, validated, and offered as testing services by a clinical laboratory, and these tests are regulated under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act, or CLIA. The FDA has stated that it will take enforcement action against any specific LDT if necessary to protect the public health. In recent years, the FDA has indicated that it is reconsidering its policy of enforcement discretion and reviewing the regulatory requirements that it will apply to LDTs.

CLIA and State Clinical Laboratory Laws 

The FDA is responsible for the complexity categorization of commercially marketed in vitro diagnostic, or IVD, tests under CLIA, placing them into one of three categories based upon the potential risk to public health in reporting erroneous results. The categories were devised on the basis of the complexity of the test, and include waived tests, tests of moderate complexity, and tests of high complexity. 

The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, regulates clinical laboratories under CLIA. Laboratories that perform testing on human specimens for the purpose of providing information for diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease or assessment of health are subject to CLIA, which imposes quality standards for laboratory testing to ensure the accuracy, reliability and timeliness of patient test results. 

Laboratories performing moderate- or high-complexity testing must meet various CLIA requirements applicable to personnel, operations, establishment and verification of performance specifications, proficiency testing, patient test management, quality control, and quality assurance. CLIA certified laboratories are typically subject to survey and inspection every two years to assess compliance with program standards. Sanctions can be applied against a laboratory that is found to be out of compliance with CLIA requirements, including, among others, suspension, limitation, or revocation of a CLIA certificate. 

Laboratories may also seek accreditation by the College of American Pathologists, or CAP. CAP is an independent, non-governmental organization approved by CMS to inspect laboratories to determine compliance with CLIA requirements. The CAP Laboratory Accreditation Program is an internationally recognized program that utilizes teams of practicing laboratory professionals as inspectors, and accreditation by CAP can often be used to meet CLIA or state certification requirements. 

In addition to CLIA, States also have laws that apply to clinical laboratories, including state licensing laws. Some states impose requirements that are more stringent than CLIA requirements. State laws may also require detailed review of a laboratory&#146;s technical procedures or scientific validation of laboratory tests. 

Product Development and Plan of Operations 

NuQ &#174; Assays (Cancer and Other Conditions): 

&#183;

In-Vitro Diagnostics Market 

o

CE Marking (Europe): A pilot NuQ &#174; panel of three assays underwent external third party retrospective clinical validations during 2012 which took approximately nine months to complete. A larger NuQ &#174; panel of assays commenced large-scale retrospective clinical validations in 2013, which will continue during the first half of 2016 in a symptomatic population. Once the retrospective validations are completed, the tests will be submitted for CE Mark approval, both for each individual biomarker assay and for the complete biomarker assay panel in a symptomatic population. The first NuQ &#174; -X biomarker assay received a CE Mark in September 2015 and we expect the first biomarker assay panel to receive a CE Mark in the second half of 2016. We estimate that the cost of CE Marking our first biomarker panel will be approximately $500,000. We additionally expect to have the results from the prospective 14,000 patient CRC study with Hvidovre Hospital in Denmark in a European screening population in the second half of 2016 and expect to CE Mark the CRC biomarker panel for use in a screening population in 2017.

o

FDA Approval (United States): FDA approval for colorectal screening applications is expected to require longer large-scale prospective clinical validation studies including U.S. trials. Our FDA PMA clinical trial process is expected to commence in 2016 and be completed in 2018. When the trial is completed, the data will be submitted to the FDA for United States PMA. We estimate the cost of obtaining FDA PMA will be approximately $5 million, with the understanding that up to $50 million may ultimately be required depending on a multitude of factors as previously discussed. As an intermediate step we will seek 510(k) approval for use of NuQ &#174; as a symptomatic adjunct test (used in combination with other tests to identify at risk patients). This abbreviated process is expected to begin in 2016 and complete in 2017 with an estimated cost of between $1million and $1.5 million.

We expect to produce a rolling pipeline of products for different types of cancers over the next one to five years. 

NuQ &#174; Clinical Diagnostic Products: 

&#183;

Centralized Laboratory Market 

o

License of Nucleosomics &#174; technology to a global diagnostics company: We may license our Nucleosomics &#174; technology on a non-exclusive basis to a global diagnostics company. The approximate licensing fees have not yet been determined. We have not entered into any agreements with diagnostic companies or established an anticipated timeframe for licensing our Nucleosomics &#174; technology.

o

Sell manual and/or semi-manual ELISA plates to centralized laboratories: We may sell manual and/or semi-automated 96 well ELISA plates for use by centralized laboratories. The approximate manufacturing costs or sales price have not yet been determined. We are in discussions with several groups to distribute our products in multiple regions.

o

Point-of-Care Devices: We intend to enter the point-of-care clinical market in Europe and in the United States 18 months after launching on the manual platform. The approximate manufacturing costs or sales price per device have not yet been determined. We have not entered into any discussions or negotiations regarding the manufacture or sale of these devices.

o

Disposable Tests for Doctor&#146;s Office or Home Use: We intend to contract with a specialist company to adapt the NuQ &#174; tests to the doctor&#146;s office or home use system and to contract with a manufacturer for the production of these tests. The sale of these tests will initially be for professional use only (doctors) and will likely be released at a later time for non-professional home use. The approximate manufacturing costs or sales price per test have not yet been determined. We have not entered into any discussions or negotiations with a specialist company or manufacturer. We do not yet have an estimated timeframe for the manufacture or sale of these tests.

If we do not have enough funds to fully implement our business plan, we will be forced to scale back our plan of operations and our business activities, increase our anticipated timeframes to complete each milestone or seek additional funding. In the event that additional financing is delayed, we will prioritize the maintenance of its research and development personnel and facilities, primarily in Belgium, and the maintenance of our patent rights. In the event of an ongoing lack of financing, we may be obliged to discontinue operations.

Sales and Marketing Strategy 

Our future products will require several dynamic and evolving sales models tailored to different worldwide markets, users and products. Pending completion of our review of the regulatory environment in the United States, including the effect of the Draft Guidance, we will combine a licensing and sales strategy focused on the IVD products through 2016. In 2017 we intend to license NuQ &#174; tests for LDT use in the United States and/or launch our own products as an adjunct product to progressively grow sales volumes after CE Marking in Europe and FDA approval in the United States, with sales to centralized laboratories and eventually reach the mass diagnostics testing market. The sales strategy will evolve as we continue to develop our intended products and seek entry into the IVD markets.

Competition 

We believe that our main competitor in the blood-based diagnostic market is Epigenomics AG. Epigenomics has European approval for its methylated DNA based PCR tests in colon cancer (Epi proColon &#174; ) and lung cancer (Epi proLung). In colon cancer, our main target market, we face potential competition from alternative procedures including flexible sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy and virtual colonoscopy as well as traditional tests such as the guaiac and immunochemical FIT Tests. Exact Sciences Corporation has recently received FDA approval and reimbursement approval for its stool-based DNA screening test. We anticipate facing competition primarily from large healthcare, pharmaceutical and diagnostic companies such Epigenomics AG, Applied Proteomics Inc., and Exact Sciences Corporation, as well as others such as Abbott Laboratories Inc., Cepheid Inc., Philips, GE Healthcare, Siemens, Gen-Probe Incorporated, MDxHealth SA, Roche Diagnostics and Sequenom, Inc.

We hope that our future products will have a competitive edge compared to those offered by competitors on the basis that our tests are being developed to be accurate, cost-effective and attractive from a government reimbursement perspective, easy to use, non-invasive, technologically advanced, and compatible with ELISA systems, based on strong intellectual property and to be used for mass screenings.

Many of our anticipated competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources and larger, more established marketing, sales and distribution systems than we will have. Many of our competitors also offer broad product lines outside of the diagnostic testing market and have brand recognition. Moreover, our competitors may make rapid technological developments that may result in our intended technologies and products becoming obsolete before we are able to enter the market, recover the expenses incurred to develop them or generate significant revenue. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to develop our intended products in a timely manner, keep our future products current with advancing technologies, achieve market acceptance of our future products, gain name recognition and a positive reputation in the healthcare industry, and establish successful marketing, sales and distribution efforts.

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we (including our subsidiaries) had 13 full-time employees and 2 part-time employees.
