 Item 1. Business 

&#160;

North America Frac Sand, Inc., is a Florida corporation, (the "Company"). Historically, the Company has been in the business of providing marketing of consulting services primarily to independent aquatic farming operators and other market participants located in the Midwest of the United States of America (the "U.S."). Historically, we conducted initial marketing and sales activities to take advantage of opportunities related to time, location and quality of aquatic farming operations. We have conducted our operations primarily in Indiana.

&#160;

In early 2014, we entered into a share purchase agreement with Innovate Building Systems Inc., an Alberta Company involved in the business of constructing modular building systems markets primarily for the oil and gas industry in Alberta, Canada. In August 2014 we terminated the share purchase agreement and decided not to go ahead with the acquisition. On July 10, 2015, we entered into a share purchase agreement with Canadian Sandtech Inc. ("CSI") to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of North America Frac Sand (CA) Ltd. ("NAFS-CA") by issuing to CSI 26,800,000 shares of the Company. All terms of the acquisition were finalized on February 29, 2016; therefore, subject to the completion of the audit, the required Super 8-K will be finalized shortly. 

&#160;

Description of Principal Products, Services And Their Markets 

&#160;

We were founded in April 2007 and are based in Indianapolis, Indiana. In June of 2012 we changed our domicile from the state of Indiana to the State of Florida. Shortly after formation and during the organizational period in 2007, our previous CEO and President's son, was diagnosed with infantile spasms. Consequently, operations were limited, allowing Mr. Cupp to tend to his son's care. During 2012, our previous CEO and President's son was again diagnosed with continuation of the infantile spasms requiring a second brain surgery, thus limiting the time our CEO was able to spend on the implementation of the 12-18 month plan of operations. Therefore, as a result the following is reflective of the delay and is still our current plan.

&#160;

We have conducted initial marketing and sales activities to take advantage of opportunities related to time, location and quality of various aquatic farm projects

&#160;

We currently conduct our marketing operations primarily in Indiana. 

&#160;

Our Plan of Operation for the next twelve months is to raise capital to continue to expand our operations. Although we are not presently engaged in any capital raising activities, we anticipate that we may engage in one or more private offerings of our company's securities. We would most likely rely upon the transaction exemptions from registration provided by Regulation D, Rule 506 or conduct a private offering under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. 

&#160;

The implementation of our business strategy is estimated to take approximately 12-18 months. Once we are able to secure funding, implementation will begin immediately. The major parts of the strategy to be immediately implemented will be the sales and marketing and office equipment and human resource procurement.

&#160;

Our limited revenues have affected the Company directly. Without a strong or known market demand, it was considered a risk to expand in any new geographical areas, since there was realistic probability that costs and overages would not be recovered upon completion and sales generated.

&#160;

Distribution Methods Of The Products Or Services 

&#160;

Our marketing initiatives will include:

&#160;

(a) utilizing direct response print advertisements placed primarily in small business, entrepreneurial, and special interest magazines;

(b) affiliated marketing and direct mail;

(c) promoting our services and attracting businesses through our (proposed) website;

(d) presence at industry trade shows;

(e) continue to nurture the relationships we have with our core customers that we have done business with; and,

(f) seek additional customers coming into the marketplace and create relationships with them.

Competitive Business Conditions And The Smaller Reporting Company's Competitive Position In The Industry And Methods Of Competition 

&#160;

Aquaculture Industry 

&#160;

Aquaculture is the farming of aquatic animals or plants. Aquaculture is the fastest growing segment in the food production system and has been for the past two decades. According to a study by the World Food and Agriculture Organization ("FAO") published March 2, 2009 world fisheries production reached a new high of 143.6 million metric tons, including farmed and ocean caught product. Based on the FAO's projections, it is estimated that in order to maintain the current level of per capita consumption, global aquaculture production will need to reach in excess of 80 million tons of fish by 2050. 

&#160;

As the availability of sites for aquaculture is becoming increasingly limited and the ability to develop non-agricultural land is often restricted, the competition to develop additional aquaculture production systems is intensifying. As the intensification for aquaculture production systems increases, the demand for institutional support, services, and skilled persons is anticipated to increase, along with the demand for more knowledge-based aquaculture education and training as aquaculture becomes more important worldwide

&#160;

Shrimp Industry 

&#160;

The United States population is vast, with an annual shrimp consumption of approximately 1.25 billion pounds, approximately 4 pounds per capita. The current average wholesale cost for frozen and delivered shrimp is $3 to $5 per pound, depending on quality and season,. The target market for the Company is to establish assist the establishment of production facilities and distribution networks in metropolitan areas of the United States, as well as international distribution networks through Joint Venture partnerships throughout the world. This should allow the Company to capture a significant portion of shrimp sales by offering locally grown, environmentally "green", naturally grown, fresh shrimp at competitive wholesale prices.

&#160;

Fresh Shrimp Market 

&#160;

The Company believes that a substantial market exists for live and fresh shrimp throughout the world. The Company plans to consult and assist to develop aquaculture farm operations to sell shrimp by using distributors or delivering them directly to market by packing the shrimp in salt water or ice, without freezing them. The Company has the added advantage of being able to market its shrimp as fresh, natural and locally grown. Being able to advertise the shrimp as locally grown and the fact that very few resources were used to transport the product provides the Company with an immense marketing advantage over the competition. Many customers are willing to pay a premium for such products.

&#160;

Strategy for Growth 

&#160;

Our strategy for growth involves increasing our sales force and support staff and expanding our presence to other geographic markets across the United States. We focus on geographic areas, products and price points where we believe there are significant demand for our services and the potential for attractive returns to our company and investors. We currently are selling services primarily in Indiana.

&#160;

&#168; 

Increase Sales. Our growth strategy is to increase our Sales volume by expanding our presence in our current geographic markets and by entering new geographic markets.

Internal Growth. We intend to continue to recruit highly-qualified sales professionals and support staff. Our compensation plan will include stock options and stock bonuses for production enhancing our ability to recruit and retain key employees. 

&#160;

In executing our business strategy, we focus on the following elements: 

&#160;

&#168; 

Leveraging Technology to Maximize Efficiency. We utilize the internet to give our clients easy access to our company. We will continue to utilize technology to reduce operating costs, improve communication with clients, and centralize data among our branch operations. 

&#160; &#168; 

Promoting Sales &#38; Recruitment Culture. To maintain a culture of continuous growth and recruitment, we have implemented a program whereby employees are encouraged to recruit earning them additional equity ownership.
