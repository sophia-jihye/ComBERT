Business 

Overview 

SunCoke Energy, Inc. (&#8220;SunCoke Energy,&#8221; &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; and &#8220;us&#8221;) is the largest independent producer of high-quality coke in the Americas, as measured by tons of coke produced each year, and has more than 50 years &#32;of coke production experience. Coke is a principal raw material in the blast furnace steelmaking process. Coke is generally produced by heating metallurgical coal in a refractory oven, which releases certain volatile components from the coal, thus transforming the coal into coke. We also provide coal handling and/or mixing services at our Coal Logistics terminals. &#32; 

We have designed, developed, built, own and operate five &#32;cokemaking facilities in the United States (&#8220;U.S.&#8221;) with collective nameplate capacity to produce approximately 4.2 million &#32;tons of coke per year. Additionally, we have designed and operate one &#32; cokemaking facility in Brazil under licensing and operating agreements on behalf of our customer. We have a preferred stock investment in the project company that owns this facility, which has approximately 1.7 million &#32; tons of annual cokemaking capacity. In March 2013, we formed a cokemaking joint venture with VISA Steel Limited ("VISA Steel") in India called VISA SunCoke Limited ("VISA SunCoke"), which has cokemaking capacity of approximately 440 thousand &#32;tons of coke per year. 

Our cokemaking ovens utilize efficient, modern heat recovery technology designed to combust the coal&#8217;s volatile components liberated during the cokemaking process and use the resulting heat to create steam or electricity for sale. This differs from by-product cokemaking, which repurposes the coal&#8217;s liberated volatile components for other uses. We have constructed the only greenfield cokemaking facilities in the U.S. in the last 25 &#32; years and are the only North American coke producer that utilizes heat recovery technology in the cokemaking process. We believe that heat recovery technology has several advantages over the alternative by-product cokemaking process, including producing higher quality coke, using waste heat to generate steam or electricity for sale and reducing the environmental impact. &#32; 

Our Granite City facility, the first phase of our Haverhill facility, or Haverhill 1, and our VISA SunCoke joint venture have steam generation facilities, which use hot flue gas from the cokemaking process to produce steam for sale to customers pursuant to steam supply and purchase agreements. Granite City sells steam to U.S. Steel, and VISA SunCoke sells steam to VISA Steel. Previously, Haverhill 1 sold steam to Haverhill Chemicals LLC ("Haverhill Chemicals"), which filed for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code during 2015. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015, Haverhill 1 provides steam, at no cost, to Altivia Petrochemicals, LLC ("Altivia"), which purchased the facility from Haverhill Chemicals. While the Company is not currently generating revenues from providing steam to Altivia, the current arrangement, for which rates may be renegotiated beginning in 2018, mitigates costs associated with disposing of steam as well as potential compliance issues. Our Middletown facility and the second phase of our Haverhill facility, or Haverhill 2, have cogeneration plants that use the hot flue gas created by the cokemaking process to generate electricity, which is either sold into the regional power market or to AK Steel pursuant to energy sales agreements. &#32; 

Our Coal Logistics business provides coal handling and/or mixing services to steel, coke (including some of our domestic cokemaking facilities), electric utility and coal mining customers. During 2015, we acquired Convent Marine Terminal ("CMT") located in Convent, Louisiana, which represents a significant expansion of the Coal Logistics business and marks our entry into export coal handling. We also have terminals in East Chicago, Indiana and in West Virginia and Kentucky. Inclusive of the acquisition of CMT, the Coal Logistics business has the collective capacity to mix and/or transload more than 40 million &#32;tons of coal annually and has storage capacity of 3 million &#32;tons. &#32;&#32; 

At December 31, 2015, we control approximately 109 million &#32; tons of proven and probable coal mining reserves in Virginia and West Virginia , a portion of which are currently mined by contractors . Due to the depressed coal mining industry, we have rationalized our Coal Mining business, including terminating approximately 350 employees and reducing production approximately 50 percent. We will continue to evaluate options to minimize costs associated with providing our Jewell cokemaking facility with coal, including potentially closing our remaining mines and moving to a 100 percent purchased coal model. 

Incorporated in Delaware in 2010 and headquartered in Lisle, Illinois, we became a publicly-traded company in 2011 and our stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (&#8220;NYSE&#8221;) under the symbol &#8220;SXC.&#8221; 

Formation of a Master Limited Partnership &#32; and Dropdown Transactions 

On January 24, 2013, we completed the initial public offering of SunCoke Energy Partners, L.P., a master limited partnership (the "Partnership&#8221;), through the sale of 13,500,000 &#32; common units of limited partner interests in the Partnership in exchange for $231.8 million &#32; of net proceeds (the "Partnership Offering"). The key assets of the Partnership at the time of formation were a &#32; 65 percent &#32; interest in each of our Haverhill and Middletown cokemaking and heat recovery facilities. &#32; 

During 2014, we contributed an additional 33 percent &#32;interest of our Haverhill and Middletown cokemaking facilities to the Partnership for a total transaction value of $365.0 million &#32;(the "Haverhill and Middletown Dropdown"). On January 13, 2015, we contributed an initial &#32; 75 percent &#32;interest in our Granite City cokemaking and heat recovery facility for a total transaction value of $244.4 million &#32;(the "Granite City Dropdown"), and on August 12, 2015, we contributed an additional 23 percent &#32; interest for a total transaction value of $65.2 million &#32;(the "Granite City Supplemental Dropdown"). Subsequent to these dropdowns, we continue to own the remaining 2 percent interest in each of these cokemaking facilities. &#32;&#32;At December 31, 2015, we own the general partner of the Partnership, which holds a 2.0 percent &#32;ownership interest and incentive distribution rights, and a 53.9 percent &#32;limited partner interest in the Partnership. The remaining 44.1 percent &#32;interest in the Partnership was held by public unitholders and is reflected in noncontrolling interest on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. &#32; 

See further discussion of these transactions in Note 4 &#32;to our consolidated financial statements.

(1) 

Cokemaking capacity represents stated capacity for production of blast furnace coke. Middletown production and sales volumes are based on &#8220;run of oven&#8221; capacity, which includes both blast furnace coke and small coke. Middletown capacity on a &#8220;run of oven&#8221; basis is approximately 578 thousand tons per year. 

(2) 

Cokemaking capacity represents 100 percent of VISA SunCoke. 

We are a technological leader in cokemaking. We believe our advanced heat recovery cokemaking process has numerous advantages over by-product cokemaking, including producing higher quality coke, using waste heat to generate derivative energy for resale and reducing environmental impact. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 specifically directed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;) to evaluate our heat recovery coke oven technology as a basis for establishing Maximum Achievable Control Technology (&#8220;MACT&#8221;) standards for new cokemaking facilities. In addition, each of the four cokemaking facilities that we have built since 1990 has either met or exceeded the applicable Best Available Control Technology (&#8220;BACT&#8221;), or Lowest Achievable Emission Rate (&#8220;LAER&#8221;) standards, as applicable, set forth by the EPA for cokemaking facilities at that time. 

Our core business model is predicated on providing steelmakers an alternative to investing capital in their own captive coke production facilities. We direct our marketing efforts principally towards steelmaking customers that require coke for use in their blast furnaces. Substantially all our coke sales are made pursuant to long-term, take-or-pay agreements with ArcelorMittal, AK Steel and U.S. Steel, who are three of the largest blast furnace steelmakers in North America, each of which individually accounts for greater than ten percent of our consolidated revenues. The take-or-pay provisions require that our customers purchase all of our coke production, in certain cases subject to a tonnage in excess of our stated capacity, or pay the contract price for any such coke they elect not to take. To date, our customers have satisfied their obligations under these agreements. 

These coke sales agreements have an average remaining term of approximately nine &#32;years and contain pass-through provisions for costs we incur in the cokemaking process, including coal procurement costs, subject to meeting contractual coal-to-coke yields, operating and maintenance expenses, costs related to the transportation of coke to our customers, taxes (other than income taxes) and costs associated with changes in regulation. With the exception of our Jewell cokemaking facility, all of our coke sales agreements also provide for the pass-through of actual coal costs on a delivered basis, subject to meeting contractual coal-to-coke yields. The coal cost component of the coke price under the Jewell coke sales agreement reflects a market price for coal based upon third-party coal purchases under our Haverhill contract with ArcelorMittal. These features of our coke sales agreements reduce our exposure to variability in coal price changes and inflationary costs over the remaining terms of these agreements. 

The coke sales agreement and energy sales agreement with AK Steel at our Haverhill facility are subject to early termination by AK Steel under limited circumstances and provided that AK Steel has given at least two years prior notice of its intention to terminate the agreement and certain other conditions are met. No other coke sales contract has an early termination clause. 

Our steelmaking customers are currently operating in an environment that is significantly challenged by declining steel prices driven by global over capacity and lower demand. The combination of the strong U.S. dollar, continued high import activity and reduced drilling activity caused by low oil and gas prices has served to depress both spot and contract prices for steel, which has driven market deterioration for flat rolled and tubular steel. Several steel producers, including certain of our customers, have filed petitions with the Department of Commerce and the International Trade Commission alleging that unfairly traded imports are causing material injury to the domestic steel industry in the U.S. and that foreign steel producers benefit from significant subsidies provided by the governments of their respective countries. While trade action is underway, domestic steel utilization rates in 2015 are down significantly from 2014 utilization rates. As a result of these current market conditions, certain of our customers have temporarily idled portions of their facilities, but continue to comply with the terms of their long-term, take-or-pay contracts with us. 

Further, ArcelorMittal is currently undergoing negotiations with its union labor workforce. Our coke and energy sales agreements contain force majeure provisions allowing temporary suspension of performance by our customers for the duration of specified events beyond the control of our customers, such as a strike. Declaration of force majeure, coupled with a lengthy suspension of performance under one or more coke or energy sales agreements, may seriously and adversely affect our cash flows, financial position and results of operations. For additional information see &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors.&#8221; &#32; 

Through an engineering study in prior years, we identified major refurbishment work that was necessary to preserve the production capacity of our Indiana Harbor facility. We completed the resulting refurbishment project in the first half of 2014. While the original refurbishment improved overall plant condition, further work remains to stabilize plant performance. During 2015, we rebuilt the interiors of 48 ovens using a more comprehensive approach. We approached these rebuilds in blocks of ovens as opposed to individually, taking them out of service and bringing them back online on a controlled basis, which gave us the ability to complete the work in a more systematic way. This new approach also provides a better ability to enter the ovens and more fully addresses the shortcomings in the oven walls and crowns. In 2016, we will continue improvement efforts and evaluate the performance of the rebuilt ovens with the overall goal of stabilizing daily production and increasing efficiency. Rather than focusing on delivering on the full-year production target of 1.22 million tons, our emphasis will be on achieving stable production results and operating the plant in an optimal manner, which we expect will drive improved profitability and more holistically address the continued underperformance at Indiana Harbor. 

Revenues from our Brazilian cokemaking facility are derived from licensing and operating fees based upon the level of production required by our customer and include the full pass-through of the operating costs of the facility. We also receive an annual preferred dividend on our preferred stock investment in the Brazilian project company that owns the facility. In general, the facility must achieve certain minimum production levels for us to receive the preferred dividend. In 2013, we reduced production at our Brazilian cokemaking facility at the request of our customer. This production decrease did not impact the receipt of our preferred dividend. Production returned to historical levels in 2014 and reached record highs in 2015. 

Our joint venture investment in VISA SunCoke, located in Odisha, India, generates earnings through heat recovery cokemaking and the associated steam generation units. VISA SunCoke's cokemaking process utilizes heat recovery technology developed in China and has an operating capacity of 440 thousand tons. Our India joint venture intends to sell approximately one-third of its coke production and all of its steam production to VISA Steel with the remainder of the coke production sold in the spot market. While VISA SunCoke continues to operate well, high volumes of low-priced Chinese coke imports have resulted in the deterioration of coke margins. Consequently, we significantly impaired our equity method investment in VISA SunCoke during 2014, and based on the continued deterioration of market factors, we further impaired our investment to zero in 2015. Consequently, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015, we no longer include the results of our share of VISA SunCoke in our consolidated financial statements. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP"), our share of future earnings of the joint venture will only be included in our results once the cumulative investment balance is no longer negative. The Company has no plans to make further capital contributions to this joint venture. 

Coal Logistics Operations 

During 2013, we expanded our operations into the coal logistics market through the acquisitions of Kanawha River Terminals ("KRT") and SunCoke Lake Terminal, LLC ("Lake Terminal"). KRT is a leading metallurgical and thermal coal mixing and handling terminal service provider with collective capacity to mix and transload 30 million &#32;tons of coal annually through operations in West Virginia and Kentucky. Lake Terminal is located in East Chicago, Indiana and provides coal handling and mixing services to our Indiana Harbor cokemaking operations. 

On August 12, 2015, we also acquired CMT for $403.1 million . CMT is one of the largest export terminals on the U.S. Gulf Coast. CMT provides strategic access to seaborne markets for coal and other industrial materials. Supporting low-cost Illinois basin coal producers, the terminal provides loading and unloading services and has direct rail access and the current capability to transload 10 million &#32;tons of coal annually. The facility is supported by long-term contracts with volume commitments covering all of its current 10 million &#32;ton capacity. 

With the acquisition of CMT, we now own and operate five coal handling terminals with the collective capacity to mix and/or transload more than 40 million &#32;tons of coal annually and has storage capacity of 3 million &#32;tons. Our coal terminals act as intermediaries between coal producers and coal end users by providing transloading, storage and mixing services. Coal is transported from the mine site in numerous ways, including rail, truck, barge or ship. We do not take possession of coal but instead derive our revenues by providing coal handling and/or mixing services to our customers on a per ton basis. For CMT, cash received from customers based on pro-rata volume commitments under take-or-pay contracts that is in excess of cash earned for services provided during the quarter is recorded as deferred revenue. Deferred revenue on take-or-pay contracts is recognized into income annually based on the terms of the contract. Our coal mixing and/or handling services are provided to steel, coal mining, coke (including some of our domestic cokemaking facilities) and electric utility customers. 

Our Coal Logistics coal mining customers are currently faced with a market depressed by oversupply and declining coal prices. Our CMT customers are also impacted by seaborne export market dynamics. Fluctuations in the benchmark price for coal delivery into northwest Europe, as referenced in the API2 index price, influence our customers' decisions to place tons into the export market and thus impact transloading volumes through our terminal facility. Despite the current challenging coal mining and coal export markets, our customers have continued to perform on their contracts with us. 

Coal Mining Operations 

Our underground metallurgical Coal Mining operations are located in Virginia and West Virginia, near our Jewell cokemaking facility. During 2014, we aggressively pursued the sale of our Coal Mining business without success. Consequently, in the fourth quarter of 2014, we began to rationalize our operations, which continued during 2015 with the idling of certain mines and a reduction of coal production from 1.2 million tons produced during 2014 to 0.6 million tons in 2015. We also transitioned to a fully contractor-mined operation and decommissioned our coal preparation plant. As a result, we purchased approximately 0.6 million tons of coal from third-parties in 2015 to help fulfill the remaining coal requirements to supply our Jewell cokemaking facility. 

In 2015, 83 percent of the coal produced was used by our Jewell cokemaking facility, 6 percent was used at our other domestic cokemaking facilities, and the remaining 11 percent was sold to third-parties. Intersegment coal revenues for sales to our Domestic Coke segment are based on prices that third-parties, or coke customers of our Domestics Coke segment, have agreed to pay for our coal and approximate the market price for the applicable quality of metallurgical coal. Most of the coal sales to these third-parties and facilities are under contracts with one year terms, and, as a result, coal revenues lag the market for spot coal prices. 

In 2016, we expect to continue reducing the ongoing impact of our Coal Mining operations on overall results. In the first half of 2016, we expect to complete a capital project to install additional coal handling and storage facilities to service our Jewell cokemaking operations and will evaluate the cost benefits of various coal procurement alternatives to minimize costs associated with providing our Jewell cokemaking facility with coal, including potentially closing our remaining mines and moving to a 100 percent purchased coal model. 

Seasonality 

Our revenues in our cokemaking business and much of our Coal Logistics business are tied to long-term, take-or-pay contracts and as such, are not seasonal. However, our cokemaking profitability is tied to coal-to-coke yields, which improve in drier weather. Accordingly, the coal-to-coke yield component of our profitability tends to be more favorable in the third quarter. Extreme weather may also challenge our operating costs and production in the winter months. 

Raw Materials 

Metallurgical coal is the principal raw material for our cokemaking operations. Except for our Jewell cokemaking facility, where we internally supply a substantial amount of the metallurgical coal from our contractor-mined Coal Mining operations discussed above, most of the metallurgical coal used to produce coke at our domestic cokemaking facilities is purchased from third-parties. We believe there is an ample supply of metallurgical coal available in the U.S. and worldwide, and we have been able to supply coal to our domestic cokemaking facilities without any significant disruption in coke production. 

Each ton of coke produced at our facilities requires approximately 1.4 tons of metallurgical coal. We purchased 5.4 million tons of metallurgical coal in 2015. Coal from third-parties is generally purchased on an annual basis via one-year contracts with costs passed through to our customers in accordance with the applicable coke sales agreements. Occasionally, 

shortfalls in deliveries by coal suppliers require us to procure supplemental coal volumes. As with typical annual purchases, the cost of these supplemental purchases is also passed through to our customers. In 2016, certain of our coal contracts contain an option, at the Company's discretion, to reduce our commitment by up to 15 percent. Most coal procurement decisions are made through a coal committee structure with customer participation. The customer can generally exercise an overriding vote on most coal procurement decisions. 

While we generally pass coal costs through to our coke customers, all of our contracts include some form of coal-to-coke yield standard. To the extent that our actual yields are less than the standard in the contract, we are at risk for the cost of the excess coal used in the cokemaking process. Conversely, to the extent actual yields are higher than contractual standards, we are able to realize higher margins. 

Transportation and Freight 

For inbound transportation of coal purchases, our facilities that access a single rail provider have long-term transportation agreements, and where necessary, coal-mixing agreements that run concurrently with the associated coke sales agreement for the facility. At facilities with multiple transportation options, including rail and barge, we enter into short-term transportation contracts from year to year. For coke sales, the point of delivery varies by agreement and facility. The point of delivery for coke sales from our Jewell and Haverhill cokemaking facilities is generally designated by the customer and shipments are made by railcar under long-term transportation agreements held by us. All delivery costs are passed through to the customers. At our Middletown, Indiana Harbor and Granite City cokemaking facilities, coke is delivered primarily by a conveyor belt leading to the customer&#8217;s blast furnace, with the customer responsible for additional transportation costs, if any. All transportation and freight costs in our Coal Logistics segment are paid by the customer directly to the transportation provider. &#32; 

Research and Development and Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights 

Our research and development program seeks to develop promising new cokemaking technologies and improve our heat recovery processes. Over the years, this program has produced numerous patents related to our heat recovery coking design and operation, including patents for pollution control systems, oven pushing and charging mechanisms, oven flue gas control mechanisms and various others. 

At Indiana Harbor and Vit&#243;ria, Brazil, where we do not own 100 percent of the entity owning the cokemaking facility, we have licensing agreements in place for the entity&#8217;s use of our technology. At Indiana Harbor, we receive no payment for the licensing rights. At Vit&#243;ria, we receive a licensing fee that is payable in conjunction with the operation of the facility. We expect the Brazilian licensing agreement to continue through at least 2022. At VISA SunCoke, our joint venture with VISA Steel in India, our technology is not currently in use, but the parties have agreed to enter into a license agreement should our technology be used in the future. 

We are party to an omnibus agreement with the Partnership, which grants the Partnership a royalty-free license to use the name &#8220;SunCoke&#8221; and related trademarks. Additionally, the omnibus agreement grants the Partnership a non-exclusive right to use all of our current and future cokemaking and related technology necessary for their operations. 

Competition 

Cokemaking 

The cokemaking business is highly competitive. Most of the world&#8217;s coke production capacity is owned by blast furnace steel companies utilizing by-product coke oven technology. The international merchant coke market is largely supplied by Chinese, Colombian and Ukrainian producers among others, though it is difficult to maintain high quality coke in the export market, and when coupled with transportation costs, coke imports are often not economical. 

The principal competitive factors affecting our cokemaking business include coke quality and price, technology, reliability of supply, proximity to market, access to metallurgical coals and environmental performance. Competitors include merchant coke producers as well as the cokemaking facilities owned and operated by blast furnace steel companies. 

In the past, there have been technologies which have sought to produce carbonaceous substitutes for coke in the blast furnace. While none have proven commercially viable thus far, we monitor the development of competing technologies carefully. We also monitor ferrous technologies, such as direct reduced iron production ("DRI"), as these could indirectly impact our blast furnace customers. 

We believe we are well-positioned to compete with other coke producers. Current production from our cokemaking business is largely committed under long-term contracts. As a result, competition mainly affects our ability to obtain new contracts supporting development of additional cokemaking capacity as well as the sale of coke in the spot market. Our facilities were constructed using proven, industry-leading technology with many proprietary features allowing us to produce 

consistently higher quality coke than our competitors produce. Additionally, our technology allows us to produce ratable quantities of heat that can be utilized as industrial grade steam or converted into electrical power. 

Coal Logistics 

The coal mixing and/or handling service market is highly competitive in the geographic area of our operations. The principal competitive factors affecting our Coal Logistics business include proximity to the source of coal as well as the nature and price of our services provided. We believe we are well-positioned to compete with other coal mixing and/or handling terminal service providers. Our KRT competitors are generally located within 100 miles of our operations. KRT has state-of-the-art mixing capabilities with fully automated and computer controlled mixing that mixes coal to within two percent accuracy of customer specifications. KRT also has the ability to provide pad storage and has access to both CSX and Norfolk Southern rail lines as well as the Ohio River system. Lake Terminal provides coal handling and/or mixing services for our Indiana Harbor cokemaking facility and therefore does not have any competitors. Our CMT competitors, who serve the coal export market, are generally located on the lower Mississippi River. CMT is one of the largest export terminals on the U.S. gulf coast and provides strategic access to seaborne markets for coal and other industrial materials. CMT is currently building a new state-of-the-art ship loader which will allow faster coal loading onto larger ships. Additionally, CMT has direct rail access on the Canadian National Rail line, which provides a competitive advantage in the coal logistics industry. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we have approximately 1,125 &#32;employees in the U.S. Approximately 32 percent &#32;of our domestic employees, principally at our cokemaking operations, are represented by the United Steelworkers union under various contracts. Additionally, approximately 2 percent &#32; of our domestic employees are represented by the International Union of Operating Engineers. On July 27, 2015 , we reached a new four -year labor agreement for our Haverhill location, which will expire on November 1, 2019 . The labor agreement at our Indiana Harbor cokemaking facility expired on September 1, 2015 . We are currently negotiating the extension of the agreement and do not anticipate any work stoppages. The labor agreements at our Quincy and Lake Terminal coal handling facilities expire on April 30, 2016 &#32;and June 30, 2016 , respectively. We will be negotiating the renewal of these agreements in 2016 and do not anticipate any work stoppages. &#32;&#32; 

As of December 31, 2015 , we have approximately 273 &#32;employees at the cokemaking facility in Vit&#243;ria, Brazil, all of whom are represented by a union under a labor agreement. The labor agreement at our Vitoria, Brazil facility expired on October 31, 2015 . We are currently negotiating the extension of the agreement and do not anticipate any work stoppages. &#32; 

Safety 

We are committed to maintaining a safe work environment and ensuring strict environmental compliance across all of our operations as the health and safety of our employees and the communities in which we operate are critical to our success. We believe that we employ best practices and conduct continual training programs to ensure that all of our employees are focused on safety. Furthermore, we employ a structured safety and environmental process that provides a robust framework for managing and monitoring safety and environmental performance. 

We have consistently operated within the top quartile for the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration&#8217;s recordable injury rates as measured and reported by the American Coke and Coal Chemicals Institute. 

Arrangements and Transactions Between Sunoco and SunCoke Energy &#32; 

In connection with the our initial public offering ("IPO"), SunCoke Energy and Sunoco, Inc. ("Sunoco") entered into certain agreements that effected our separation from Sunoco, provided a framework for our relationship with Sunoco after the separation and provided for the allocation between SunCoke Energy and Sunoco of Sunoco&#8217;s assets, employees, liabilities and obligations attributable to periods prior to, at and after the separation. 

On July 18, 2011 (the "Separation Date"), SunCoke Energy and Sunoco entered into a guaranty, keep well, and indemnification agreement. Under this agreement, SunCoke Energy: (1) guarantees the performance of certain obligations of its subsidiaries, prior to the date that Sunoco or its affiliates may become obligated to pay or perform such obligations, including the repayment of a loan from Indiana Harbor Coke Company L.P.; (2) indemnifies, defends, and holds Sunoco and its affiliates harmless against all liabilities relating to these obligations; and (3) restricts the assets, debts, liabilities and business activities of one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, so long as certain obligations of such subsidiary remain unpaid or unperformed. In addition, SunCoke Energy released Sunoco from its guaranty of payment of a promissory note owed by one of its subsidiaries to another of its subsidiaries. 

Legal and Regulatory Requirements 

The following discussion summarizes the principal legal and regulatory requirements that we believe may significantly affect us. 

Permitting and Bonding 

&#8226; 

Permitting Process for Cokemaking Facilities. &#32;The permitting process for our cokemaking facilities is administered by the individual states. However, the main requirements for obtaining environmental construction and operating permits are found in the federal regulations. Once all requirements are satisfied, a state or local agency produces an initial draft permit. Generally, the facility reviews and comments on the initial draft. After accepting or rejecting the facility&#8217;s comments, the agency typically publishes a notice regarding the issuance of the draft permit and makes the permit and supporting documents available for public review and comment. A public hearing may be scheduled, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") also has the opportunity to comment on the draft permit. The state or local agency responds to comments on the draft permit and may make revisions before a final construction permit is issued. A construction permit allows construction and commencement of operations of the facility and is generally valid for at least 18 months. Generally, construction commences during this period, while many states allow this period to be extended in certain situations. 

&#8226; 

Air quality. &#32;Our cokemaking facilities employ Maximum Available Control Technology (&#8220;MACT&#8221;) standards designed to limit emissions of certain hazardous air pollutants. Specific MACT standards apply to door leaks, charging, oven pressure, pushing and quenching. Certain MACT standards for new cokemaking facilities were developed using test data from SunCoke's Jewell cokemaking facility located in Vansant, Virginia. Under applicable federal air quality regulations, permitting requirements may differ among facilities, depending upon whether the cokemaking facility will be located in an &#8220;attainment&#8221; area&#8212;i.e., one that meets the national ambient air quality standards (&#8220;NAAQS&#8221;) for certain pollutants, or in a &#8220;non-attainment&#8221; or "unclassifiable" area. The status of an area may change over time as new NAAQS standards are adopted, resulting in an area change from one status or classification to another. In an attainment area, the facility must install air pollution control equipment or employ Best Available Control Technology (&#8220;BACT&#8221;). In a non-attainment area, the facility must install air pollution control equipment or employ procedures that meet Lowest Achievable Emission Rate (&#8220;LAER&#8221;) standards. LAER standards are the most stringent emission limitation achieved in practice by existing facilities. Unlike the BACT analysis, cost is generally not considered as part of a LAER analysis, and emissions in a non-attainment area must be offset by emission reductions obtained from other sources. 

&#8226; 

Stringent NAAQS for ambient nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide went into effect in 2010. In July 2013, the EPA identified or "designated" as nonattainment 29 areas in 16 states where monitored air quality showed violations of the 2010 1-hour SO2 NAAQS. In August 2015, the EPA finalized a new rulemaking to assist in implementation of the primary 1-hour SO2 NAAQS that requires either additional monitoring, or modeling of ambient air SO2 levels in various areas including where certain of our facilities are located. By July 2016, states subject to this rulemaking must provide EPA with either a modeling approach using existing emissions data, or a plan to undertake ambient air monitoring for SO2 to begin in 2017. For states that choose to install ambient air SO2 monitoring stations, after three years of data has been collected, or sometime in 2020, EPA will evaluate this data relative to the appropriate attainment designation for the areas under the 1-hour SO2 NAAQS. This rulemaking will require certain of our facilities to undertake this ambient air monitoring. We may be required to install yet additional pollution controls and incur greater costs of operating at those of our facilities located in areas that EPA determines to be non-attainment with the 1-hour SO2 NAAQS based on its evaluation of this data. In 2012, a NAAQS for fine particulate matter, or PM 2.5, went into effect. In November 2015, the EPA revised the existing NAAQS for ground level ozone to make the standard more stringent. These new standards and any future more stringent standard for ozone have two impacts on permitting: (1) demonstrating compliance with the standard using dispersion modeling from a new facility will be more difficult; and (2) additional areas of the country may become designated as non-attainment areas. Facilities operating in areas that become non-attainment areas due to the application of new standards may be required to install Reasonably Available Control Technology (&#8220;RACT&#8221;). A number of states have also filed or joined suits to challenge the EPA&#8217;s new standard in court. While we are not able to determine the extent to which this new standard will impact our business at this time, it does have the potential to have a material impact on our operations and cost structure. 

&#8226; 

The EPA adopted a rule in 2010 requiring a new facility that is a major source of greenhouse gases (&#8220;GHGs&#8221;) to install equipment or employ BACT procedures. Currently, there is little information on what may be acceptable as BACT to control GHGs (primarily carbon dioxide from our facilities), but the database and additional guidance may be enhanced in the future. 

&#8226; 

Several states have additional requirements and standards other than those in the federal statutes and regulations. Many states have lists of &#8220;air toxics&#8221; with emission limitations determined by dispersion modeling. States also often have specific regulations that deal with visible emissions, odors and nuisance. In some cases, the state delegates some or all of these functions to local agencies. 

&#8226; 

Wastewater and Stormwater. &#32;Our heat recovery cokemaking technology does not produce process wastewater as is typically associated with by-product cokemaking. Our cokemaking facilities, in some cases, have wastewater discharge and stormwater permits. 

&#8226; 

Waste. &#32;The primary solid waste product from our heat recovery cokemaking technology is calcium sulfate from flue gas desulfurization, which is generally taken to a solid waste landfill. The material from periodic cleaning of heat recovery steam generators is disposed of as hazardous waste. On the whole, our heat recovery cokemaking process does not generate substantial quantities of hazardous waste. 

&#8226; 

U.S. Endangered Species Act. &#32;The U.S. Endangered Species Act and certain counterpart state regulations are intended to protect species whose populations allow for categorization as either endangered or threatened. With respect to permitting additional cokemaking facilities, protection of endangered or threatened species may have the effect of prohibiting, limiting the extent of or placing permitting conditions on soil removal, road building and other activities in areas containing the affected species. Based on the species that have been designated as endangered or threatened on our properties and the current application of these laws and regulations, we do not believe that they are likely to have a material adverse effect on our operations. 

&#8226; 

Permitting Process for Coal Mining Operations. &#32;The U.S. coal mining permit application process is initiated by collecting baseline data to adequately assess and model the pre-mine environmental condition of the permit area, including geologic data, soil and rock structures, cultural resources, soils, surface and ground water hydrology, and coal that we intend to mine. We use this data to develop a mine and reclamation plan, which incorporate provisions of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (&#8220;SMCRA&#8221;), state programs and complementary environmental programs that impact coal mining. The permit application includes the mine and reclamation plan, documents defining ownership and agreements pertaining to coal, minerals, oil and gas, water rights, rights of way and surface land and documents required by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement&#8217;s (&#8220;OSM&#8217;s&#8221;) Applicant Violator System. Once a permit application is submitted to the regulatory agency, it goes through a completeness and technical review before a public notice and comment period. Some SMCRA mine permits take over a year to prepare, depending on the size and complexity of the mine, and often take six months to two years to be issued. Regulatory authorities have considerable discretion in the timing of the permit issuance and the public has the right to comment on and otherwise engage in the permitting process, including through public hearings and intervention in the courts. SMCRA mine permits also take a significant period of time to be transferred. 

&#8226; 

Bonding Requirements for Coal Mining Operations Permits. &#32;Before a SMCRA permit is issued, a mine operator must submit a bond or other form of financial security to guarantee the payment and performance of certain long-term mine closure and reclamation obligations. The costs of these bonds or other forms of financial security have fluctuated in recent years and the market terms of surety bonds generally have become more unfavorable to mine operators. Surety providers are requiring greater amounts of collateral to secure a bond, which has required us to provide increasing quantities of cash to collateralize bonds or other forms of financial security to allow us to continue mining. These changes in the terms of the bonds have been accompanied, at times, by a decrease in the number of companies willing to issue surety bonds. As of December 31, 2015 , we have posted an aggregate of approximately $48 million in surety bonds or other forms of financial security for reclamation purposes. 

Regulation of Operations 

&#8226; 

Clean Air Act. &#32;The Clean Air Act and similar state laws and regulations affect our cokemaking operations, primarily through permitting and/or emissions control requirements relating to particulate matter (&#8220;PM&#8221;) and sulfur dioxide (&#8220;SO2&#8221;). The Clean Air Act air emissions programs that may affect our operations, directly or indirectly, include, but are not limited to: the Acid Rain Program; NAAQS implementation for SO2, PM and nitrogen oxides (&#8220;NOx&#8221;); GHG rules; the Clean Air Interstate Rule; MACT emissions limits for hazardous air pollutants; the Regional Haze Program; New Source Performance Standards (&#8220;NSPS&#8221;); and New Source Review. The Clean Air Act requires, among other things, the regulation of hazardous air pollutants through the development and promulgation of various industry-specific MACT standards. Our cokemaking facilities are subject to two categories of MACT standards. The first category applies to pushing and quenching. The EPA is to make a risk-based determination for pushing and quenching emissions and determine whether additional emissions reductions are necessary, but the EPA has yet to publish or propose any residual risk standards; therefore, the impact of potential additional EPA regulation in this area cannot be estimated at this time. The second category of MACT standards applicable to our cokemaking facilities applies to emissions from charging and coke oven doors. 

&#8226; 

Terminal Operations. Our terminal operations located along waterways and the Gulf of Mexico are also governed by permitting requirements under the CWA and CAA. These terminals are subject to U.S. Coast Guard regulations and comparable state statutes regarding design, installation, construction, and management. Many such terminals owned and operated by other entities that are also used to transport coal, including for export, have been pursued by environmental interest groups for alleged violations of their permits&#8217; requirements, or have seen their efforts to obtain or renew such permits contested by such groups. While we believe that our operations are in material compliance with these permits, we cannot assure you that no such challenges or claims will be made against our operations in the future. Moreover, our terminal operations may be affected by the impacts of additional regulation on the mining of all types of coal and use of thermal coal for fuel, which is restricting supply in some markets and may reduce the volumes of coal that our terminals manage. 

&#8226; 

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. &#32;The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (&#8220;FERC&#8221;) regulates the sales of electricity from our Haverhill and Middletown facilities, including the implementation of the Federal Power Act (&#8220;FPA&#8221;) and the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (&#8220;PURPA&#8221;). The nature of the operations of the Haverhill and Middletown facilities makes each facility a qualifying facility under PURPA, which exempts the facilities and the Company from certain regulatory burdens, including the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 (&#8220;PUHCA&#8221;), limited provisions of the FPA, and certain state laws and regulation. FERC has granted requests for authority to sell electricity from the Haverhill and Middletown facilities at market-based rates and the entities are subject to FERC&#8217;s market-based rate regulations, which require regular regulatory compliance filings. 

&#8226; 

Clean Water Act of 1972. &#32;Although our cokemaking facilities generally do not have water discharge permits, the Clean Water Act (&#8220;CWA&#8221;) may affect our operations by requiring water quality standards generally and through the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (&#8220;NPDES&#8221;). Regular monitoring, reporting requirements and performance standards are requirements of NPDES permits that govern the discharge of pollutants into water. Discharges must either meet state water quality standards or be authorized through available regulatory processes such as alternate standards or variances. Additionally, through the CWA Section 401 certification program, states have approval authority over federal permits or licenses that might result in a discharge to their waters. 

&#8226; 

Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. &#32;We may generate wastes, including &#8220;solid&#8221; wastes and &#8220;hazardous&#8221; wastes that are subject to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (&#8220;RCRA&#8221;) and comparable state statutes, although certain mining and mineral beneficiation wastes and certain wastes derived from the combustion of coal currently are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA. The EPA has limited the disposal options for certain wastes that are designated as hazardous wastes under RCRA. Furthermore, it is possible that certain wastes generated by our operations that currently are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes, and therefore be subject to more rigorous and costly management, disposal and clean-up requirements. 

&#8226; 

Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. &#32;Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (&#8220;CERCLA&#8221;), also known as Superfund, and similar state laws, responsibility for the entire cost of clean-up of a contaminated site, as well as natural resource damages, can be imposed upon current or former site owners or operators, or upon any party who released one or more designated &#8220;hazardous substances&#8221; at the site, regardless of the lawfulness of the original activities that led to the contamination. In the course of our operations we may have generated and may generate wastes that fall within CERCLA&#8217;s definition of hazardous substances. We also may be an owner or operator, or a past owner or operator, of facilities at which hazardous substances have been released. Under CERCLA, we may be responsible for all or part of the costs of cleaning up facilities at which such substances have been released and for natural resource damages. We also must comply with reporting requirements under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act. 

&#8226; 

Climate Change Legislation and Regulations. &#32;Our facilities are presently subject to the GHG reporting rule, which obligates us to report annual emissions of GHGs. The EPA also finalized a rule in 2010 requiring a new facility that is a major source of greenhouse gases (&#8220;GHGs&#8221;) to install equipment or employ BACT procedures. Currently there is little information as to what may constitute BACT for GHG in most industries. We may also be subject to the EPA&#8217;s &#8220;Tailoring Rule,&#8221; where certain modifications to our facilities could subject us to the additional permitting and other obligations relative to emissions of GSGs under the New Source Review/Prevention of Significant Deterioration (NSR/PSD) and Title V programs of the Clean Air Act based on whether the facility triggered NSR/PSD because of emissions of another pollutant such as SO2, NOx, PM, ozone or lead. The EPA has engaged in rulemakings to regulate GHG emissions from existing and new coal fired power plants, and we expect continued legal challenges to this rulemaking and any future rulemaking for other industries. For instance, in August 2015, the EPA issued its final Clean Power Plan rules establishing carbon pollution standards 

for power plants. The EPA expects each state to develop implementation plans for power plants in its state to meet the individual state targets established in the Clean Power Plan, and has also proposed a federal compliance plan to implement the Clean Power Plan in the event that approvable state plans are not submitted. Judicial challenges have been be filed, which seek a stay of the implementation of the rules. Electricity generated by natural gas often results in lower CO 2 &#32;emission rates than other forms of fossil fuels. Depending on the method of implementation selected by the states, and if implementation is not stayed pending resolution of the legal challenges, the Clean Power Plan could increase the demand for natural gas-generated electricity. Currently, we do not anticipate these new or existing power plan GHG rules to apply directly to our facilities, the impact of and future GHG-related legislation and regulations on us will depend on a number of factors, including whether GHG sources in multiple sectors of the economy are regulated, the overall GHG emissions cap level, the degree to which GHG offsets are allowed, the allocation of emission allowances to specific sources, actions by the states in implementing these requirements and the indirect impact of carbon regulation on coal prices. We may not recover the costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements imposed on us from our customers due to limitations in our agreements. The imposition of a carbon tax or similar regulation could materially and adversely affect our revenues. Collectively, these requirements along with restrictions and requirements regarding the mining of all types of coal may reduce the volumes of coal that we manage and may ultimately adversely impact our revenues. 

&#8226; 

Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006. &#32;The Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006 (the &#8220;Miner Act&#8221;), has increased significantly the enforcement of safety and health standards and imposed safety and health standards on all aspects of mining operations. There also has been a significant increase in the dollar penalties assessed for citations issued. 

&#8226; 

Security. Our Convent Marine Terminal is subject to regulation by the United States Coast Guard pursuant to the Maritime Transportation Security Act. We have an internal inspection program designed to monitor and ensure compliance by the Convent Marine Terminal with these requirements. We believe that we are in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the security of the facility. 

Reclamation and Remediation 

&#8226; 

Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977. &#32;The SMCRA established comprehensive operational, environmental, reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of U.S. surface mining as well as many aspects of deep mining. Where state regulatory agencies have adopted federal mining programs under SMCRA, the state becomes the regulatory authority, and states that operate federally approved state programs may impose standards that are more stringent than the requirements of SMCRA. Permitting under SMCRA generally has become more difficult in recent years, which adversely affects the cost and availability of coal. The Abandoned Mine Land Fund, which is part of SMCRA, assesses a fee on all coal produced in the U.S. From October 1, 2007 through September 30, 2012, the fee was $0.315 per ton of surface-mined coal and $0.135 per ton of underground mined coal. From October 1, 2012 through September 30, 2021, the fee has been reduced to $0.28 per ton of surface-mined coal and $0.12 per ton of underground mined coal. Our reclamation obligations under applicable environmental laws could be substantial. Under GAAP, we are required to account for the costs related to the closure of mines and the reclamation of the land upon exhaustion of coal reserves. The fair value of an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The present value of the estimated asset retirement costs is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. At December 31, 2015 , we had asset retirement obligation of $13.8 million &#32;related to estimated mine reclamation costs. The amounts recorded are dependent upon a number of variables, including the estimated future retirement costs, estimated proven reserves, assumptions involving profit margins, inflation rates, and the assumed credit-adjusted interest rates. Our future operating results would be adversely affected if these accruals were determined to be insufficient. These obligations are unfunded. Further, although specific criteria varies from state to state as to what constitutes an &#8220;owner&#8221; or &#8220;controller&#8221; relationship, under SMCRA the responsibility for reclamation or remediation, unabated violations, unpaid civil penalties and unpaid reclamation fees of independent contract mine operators can be imputed to other companies which are deemed, according to the regulations, to have &#8220;owned&#8221; or &#8220;controlled&#8221; the contract mine operator. Sanctions are quite severe and can include being denied new permits, permit amendments, permit revisions and revocation or suspension of permits issued since the violation or penalty or fee due date. 

&#8226; 

Black Lung Benefits Revenue Act of 1977 and Black Lung Benefits Reform Act of 1977, as amended in 1981. &#32;Under these laws, each U.S. coal mine operator must pay federal black lung benefits and medical expenses to claimants who are current and former employees and last worked for the operator after July 1, 1973. Coal mine operators also must make payments to a trust fund for the payment of benefits and medical expenses to claimants who last worked in the coal industry prior to July 1, 1973. The trust fund is funded by an excise tax on U.S. coal production of up to $1.10 per ton for deep-mined coal and up to $0.55 per ton for surface-mined coal, neither 

amount to exceed 4.4 percent of the gross sales price. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (&#8220;PPACA&#8221;), which was implemented in 2010, amended previous legislation and provides for the automatic extension of awarded lifetime benefits to surviving spouses and changes the legal criteria used to assess and award claims. Our obligation related to black lung benefits is estimated based on various assumptions, including actuarial estimates, discount rates, changes in health care costs and the impact of PPACA. 

&#8226; 

Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. &#32;Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (&#8220;CERCLA&#8221;), also known as Superfund, and similar state laws, responsibility for the entire cost of clean-up of a contaminated site, as well as natural resource damages, can be imposed upon current or former site owners or operators, or upon any party who released one or more designated &#8220;hazardous substances&#8221; at the site, regardless of the lawfulness of the original activities that led to the contamination. In the course of our operations we may have generated and may generate wastes that fall within CERCLA&#8217;s definition of hazardous substances. We also may be an owner or operator of facilities at which hazardous substances have been released by previous owners or operators. Under CERCLA, we may be responsible for all or part of the costs of cleaning up facilities at which such substances have been released and for natural resource damages. We also must comply with reporting requirements under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act. 

Environmental Matters and Compliance 

Our failure to comply with the aforementioned requirements may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of clean-up and site restoration costs and liens, the issuance of injunctions to limit or cease operations, the suspension or revocation of permits and other enforcement measures that could have the effect of limiting production from our operations. Please see Note 18 &#32;to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Notices of Violation (&#8220;NOVs&#8221;) issued by the EPA and state regulators for our Haverhill, Granite City, and Indiana Harbor cokemaking facilities. 

Many other legal and administrative proceedings are pending or may be brought against us arising out of our current and past operations, including matters related to commercial and tax disputes, product liability, antitrust, employment claims, natural resource damage claims, premises-liability claims, allegations of exposures of third-parties to toxic substances and general environmental claims. Although the ultimate outcome of these proceedings cannot be ascertained at this time, it is reasonably possible that some of them could be resolved unfavorably to us. Management of the Company believes that any liability which may arise from such matters would not be material in relation to the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company at December 31, 2015 .
