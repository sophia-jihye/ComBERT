Mercer 

General 

We are one of the world&#146;s largest producers of market NBSK pulp, which leads to increased presence and better industry information in our markets and provides for close customer relationships with many large pulp consumers. We operate two modern and highly efficient mills in Eastern Germany and one mill in Western Canada and have our headquarters in Vancouver, Canada. We are the sole NBSK pulp producer, and the only significant producer of pulp for resale, known as &#147;market pulp&#148;, in Germany, which is the largest pulp import market in Europe. We are able to supply the growing pulp demand in China both through our Canadian mill&#146;s ready access to the Port of Vancouver and through our Stendal mill&#146;s existing logistics arrangements. In addition, as a result of the significant investments we have made in co-generation equipment, all of our mills generate and sell a significant amount of surplus &#147;green&#148; energy to regional utilities. We also produce and sell tall oil, a by-product of our production process, which is used as both a chemical additive and as a &#147;green&#148; energy source. 

We currently employ approximately 1,469 people. Our three NBSK pulp mills have consolidated annual production capacity of approximately 1.5 million ADMTs of NBSK pulp and are capable of generating 305 MW of electricity. Key operating details for each of our mills are as follows: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Rosenthal mill . Our Rosenthal mill is a modern, efficient ISO 9001, 14001 and 50001 certified NBSK pulp mill that has an annual production capacity of approximately 360,000 ADMTs and 57 MW of electrical generation. The Rosenthal mill is located in the town of Blankenstein, Germany, approximately 300 kilometers south of Berlin. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Stendal mill . Our Stendal mill is a state-of-the-art, single-line, ISO 9001 and 14001 certified NBSK pulp mill that has an annual production capacity of approximately 660,000 ADMTs and 148 MW of electrical generation. The Stendal mill is one of the largest NBSK mills in Europe. The Stendal mill is located near the town of Stendal, Germany, approximately 130 kilometers west of Berlin. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149;

&#160; Celgar mill . Our Celgar mill is a modern, efficient ISO 9001 and 14001 certified NBSK pulp mill with an annual production capacity of approximately 520,000 ADMTs and 100 MW of electrical generation. The Celgar mill is located near the city of Castlegar, British Columbia, Canada, approximately 600 kilometers east of Vancouver. 

Our mills are some of the most modern and newest NBSK pulp mills in Europe and North America. We believe the relative age, production capacity and electrical generation capacity of our mills provide us with certain manufacturing cost and other advantages over many of our competitors. We believe competitors&#146; older mills do not have the equipment or capacity to produce or sell surplus power or chemicals in a meaningful amount. In addition, since our mills are relatively new they benefit from lower maintenance capital requirements and higher efficiency relative to many of our competitors&#146; mills. 

The following table sets out our pulp production and pulp revenues for the periods indicated:

&#160; $ 946,237 &#160; &#160; $ 1,073,632 &#160; &#160; $ 996,187 &#160; Our modern mills generate electricity, which is surplus to their operating requirements, providing our mills with a stable revenue source unrelated to pulp prices. Additionally, our German mills generate tall oil from black liquor, which is sold to third parties for use in numerous applications including bio-fuels. Since our energy and chemical production are by-products of our pulp production process, there are minimal incremental costs and our surplus energy and chemical sales are highly profitable. All of our mills generate and sell surplus energy to regional utilities. Our German mills benefit from special tariffs under Germany&#146;s Renewable Energy Sources Act, referred to as the &#147;Renewable Energy Act&#148;, which provides for premium pricing on &#147;green&#148; energy. Our Celgar mill is party to a fixed electricity purchase agreement with the regional public utility provider for the sale of surplus power through 2020. 

The following table sets out the amount of surplus energy produced and sold and revenues from the sale of chemicals for the periods indicated:

&#160;

&#160; Our strategic mill locations position us well to serve customers in Europe, Asia, and North America. Due to the proximity of our German mills to most of our European customers, we benefit from lower transportation costs relative to most of our major competitors. Our Celgar mill, located in Western Canada, is well situated to serve Asian and North American customers, specifically in China, which is the world&#146;s largest and fastest-growing pulp import market. Our Stendal mill also supplies customers in China through its existing logistics arrangements. We primarily work directly with customers to capitalize on our geographic diversity, coordinate sales and enhance customer relationships. We believe our ability to deliver high quality pulp on a timely basis and our customer service make us a preferred supplier for many customers. 

&#160;

Fiber is the largest production cost in manufacturing NBSK pulp. Although fiber is cyclical in both price and supply, there is a significant amount of high-quality fiber within a close radius of each of our mills. This fiber supply, combined with our purchasing power and our ability to switch between whole logs chipped at our mills and sawmill residual chips, enables us to enter into contracts and arrangements which have generally provided us with sufficient fiber supply. 

Corporate Structure, History and Development of Business 

Mercer Inc. reorganized as a corporation under the laws of the State of Washington in 2006 from a Washington business trust. Its common stock is quoted and listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (MERC) and the Toronto Stock Exchange (MRI.U). As at December 31, 2015, we had 64,501,896 shares of common stock outstanding. 

The following simplified chart sets out our principal operating subsidiaries, their jurisdictions of organization, their principal activities and their annual pulp production and electrical generation capacity: 

&#160;

&#160;

We acquired our Rosenthal mill in 1994 and, in 1999, completed a major capital project to convert it to the production of kraft pulp from sulphite pulp, increase its production capacity and improve efficiencies. The project cost approximately $385.7 million, of which approximately $100.8 million was financed through government grants. Subsequent capital investments and efficiency improvements have reduced emissions and energy costs and increased the mill&#146;s annual production capacity and production of tall oil. 

In September 2004, we completed construction of the Stendal mill at a cost of approximately $1.1 billion, which was financed through a combination of government grants of approximately $332.0 million, low-cost, long-term project debt, which was largely severally guaranteed by governments in Germany, and equity. Subsequent capital investments and efficiency improvements have increased the mill&#146;s annual production capacity and its generation of &#147;green&#148; energy. 

We initially had a 63.6% ownership interest in Stendal which increased over time through acquisitions and/or further investments to 83.0% in 2013. In September 2014, we made an additional capital investment in Stendal and acquired all of the shareholder loans and substantially all of the shares of the minority shareholder in Stendal and other rights. As a result of such transactions, we now consolidate all of the economic interest in Stendal. 

&#160;

In February 2005, we acquired the Celgar mill for $210.0 million plus defined working capital. The Celgar mill was completely rebuilt in the early 1990s through a C$850.0 million modernization and expansion project. Since its acquisition, we have effected several capital projects and other initiatives at the Celgar mill to increase its annual production capacity and its generation of &#147;green&#148; energy. 

Corporate Strategy 

Our corporate strategy is to expand our asset and earnings base through organic growth and acquisitions, primarily in Europe and North America. We pursue organic growth through active management and targeted capital expenditures to generate a high return by increasing pulp, energy and chemical production, reducing costs and improving efficiency. We are also leveraging our fiber and process expertise to develop innovative new products based on other derivatives of the kraft pulping process. We seek to acquire interests in companies and assets in the pulp industry and related businesses where we can leverage our experience and expertise in adding value through a focused management approach. Key elements of our strategy include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149;

&#160; Focus on Premium Grade Market NBSK Pulp. We produce market NBSK pulp because it is a premium grade kraft pulp and generally obtains the highest price relative to other kraft pulps. Although demand is cyclical, between 2006 and 2015 overall worldwide demand for bleached softwood kraft market pulp grew at an average of approximately 1% per annum. We focus on customers that produce tissue, specialty papers and high-quality printing and writing paper grades. We believe the growth in demand from tissue and specialty paper customers, which utilize a significant proportion of NBSK pulp, has more than offset the secular decline in demand from printing and writing paper customers. This allows us to benefit from our long-term relationships with tissue and specialty paper manufacturers in Europe and participate in higher growth markets in emerging countries such as China where there has been strong growth in tissue demand. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149;

&#160; Increasing Stable Revenues from Renewable Energy and Chemical Sales and Leveraging our Fiber and Process Expertise to Expand Growth. We focus on enhancing our generation and sales of surplus renewable energy and chemicals and, because there are minimal associated incremental costs, such sales are highly profitable. These sales provide us with a stable income source unrelated to cyclical changes in pulp prices. Additionally, we seek to capitalize on our fiber and process expertise to expand our commercialization and sales of new products and into new growth areas. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149;

&#160; Targeted Capital Expenditures to Enhance Production Capacity and Efficiency. We operate three large modern pulp mills which provide us with a platform to be an efficient and competitive producer of high-quality NBSK pulp without the need for significant sustaining capital. We seek to make targeted capital expenditures to increase production and operational efficiency, reduce costs and increase electricity and chemical sales. Over the last five years, we have invested approximately $180.3 million (including $41.0 million in associated government grants) in growth capital expenditures for capacity expansions, operational efficiencies and renewable energy and chemical production. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149;

&#160; Achieving Operational Excellence. Operating our mills reliably and at a competitive cost is important for our financial performance. In addition to capital expenditures, we continuously strive to develop maintenance systems and procedures that will improve the throughput of our products by increasing the reliability of our manufacturing processes. We also seek to reduce operating costs by better managing certain operating activities such 

&#160;

&#160; as fiber procurement, sales, marketing and logistics activities. We believe that our continued focus on operational excellence should allow us to achieve improved profitability and cash flows. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149;

&#160; Strategic Opportunities. We believe there will be continuing change and consolidation in our and related businesses as industry participants continually seek to lower costs, refocus their product lines and react to ever changing global market conditions. We take an opportunistic approach to potential investments or acquisitions that can grow our business and expand our earnings. 

The Pulp Industry 

General 

Pulp is used in the production of paper, tissues and paper-related products. Pulp is generally classified according to fiber type, the process used in its production and the degree to which it is bleached. Kraft pulp, a type of chemical pulp, is produced through a sulphate chemical process in which lignin, the component of wood which binds individual fibers, is dissolved in a chemical reaction. Chemically prepared pulp allows the wood&#146;s fiber to retain its length and flexibility, resulting in stronger paper products. Kraft pulp can be bleached to increase its brightness. Kraft pulp is noted for its strength, brightness and absorption properties and is used to produce a variety of products, including lightweight publication grades of paper, tissues and other paper-related products. 

There are two main types of bleached kraft pulp, being softwood kraft made from coniferous trees and hardwood kraft made from deciduous trees. Softwood species generally have long, flexible fibers which add strength to paper while fibers from species of hardwood contain shorter fibers which lend bulk and opacity. 

We produce and sell NBSK pulp, which is a bleached kraft pulp manufactured using northern softwood and is considered a premium grade because of its strength. It generally obtains the highest price relative to other kraft pulps. Southern bleached softwood kraft pulp is kraft pulp manufactured using southern softwood and does not possess the strength found in NBSK pulp. NBSK pulp is the sole pulp product of our mills. 

Most paper users of market kraft pulp use a mix of softwood and hardwood grades to optimize production and product qualities. In 2015, market kraft pulp consumption was approximately 54% hardwood bleached kraft and 43% softwood bleached kraft, with the remainder comprised of unbleached pulp. Over the last several years, production of hardwood pulp, based on fast growing plantation fiber primarily from Asia and South America, has increased much more rapidly than that of softwood grades, based on fiber that has longer growth cycles. Hardwood kraft generally has a cost advantage over softwood kraft as a result of lower fiber costs, higher wood yields and, for newer hardwood mills, economies of scale. As a result of this growth in supply and lower costs, kraft pulp customers have substituted some of the pulp content in their products to hardwood pulp. 

Counteracting customers&#146; ability to substitute lower priced hardwood pulp for NBSK pulp is the requirement for strength and formation characteristics in finished goods. Paper and tissue makers focus on larger paper machines with higher speeds and lower basis weights for certain papers which require the strength characteristics of softwood pulp. Additionally, where paper products are lightweight or specialized, like direct mail, magazine paper or premium tissue, or where strength or absorbency are important, softwood kraft forms a significant proportion of the fiber used. As a result, we believe that the ability of kraft pulp users to further substitute hardwood for softwood pulp is limited by such requirements. 

&#160;

Kraft pulp can be made in different grades, with varying technical specifications, for different end uses. Kraft pulp is valued for its reinforcing role in mechanical printing papers and is sought after by producers of paper for the publishing industry, primarily for magazines and advertising materials. Kraft pulp is also an important ingredient for tissue manufacturing and tissue demand tends to increase with living standards in developing countries. Kraft pulp produced for reinforcement fibers is considered the highest grade of kraft pulp and generally obtains the highest price. 

Markets 

We believe that over 130 million ADMTs of chemical pulp are converted annually into tissues, printing and writing papers, carton boards and other specialty grades of paper and paperboard around the world. We also believe that over one third of this pulp is sold on the open market as market pulp, while the remainder is produced for internal purposes by integrated paper and paperboard manufacturers. 

The pulp business is highly cyclical in nature and markets are characterized by periods of supply and demand imbalance, which in turn affect prices. Pulp markets are highly competitive and are sensitive to cyclical changes in the global economy, industry capacity and foreign exchange rates, all of which can have a significant influence on selling prices and our operating results. The length and magnitude of industry cycles have varied over time but generally reflect changes in macro-economic conditions and levels of industry capacity. Pulp is a commodity that is generally available from other producers. Because commodity products have few distinguishing qualities from producer to producer, competition is generally based upon price, which is generally determined by supply relative to demand. 

Between 2006 and 2015, worldwide demand for chemical market pulp grew at an average rate of approximately 2% annually, with worldwide demand for bleached softwood kraft market pulp having grown at an average of approximately 1% per annum. 

The following chart illustrates the global demand for chemical market pulp for the periods indicated: 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Two key macro-economic trends in worldwide NBSK pulp demand over the last several years have been: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149;

&#160; a significant increase in demand from emerging markets, and in particular China, which has more than offset a decline in demand in the mature markets of Europe, North America and Japan; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149;

&#160; a significant shift in demand by end use, as demand from tissue and specialty producers has increased markedly and offset the secular decline in demand for printing and writing paper resulting from the rapid growth in digital media. 

Since 2006, demand for chemical softwood market pulp has grown in the emerging markets of Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America. China in particular has experienced substantial growth and its imports of softwood market pulp grew by approximately 12% per annum between 2006 and 2015. We believe the emerging markets now account for approximately 52% of total world demand. China now accounts for approximately 30% of global bleached softwood kraft market pulp demand, compared to only 13% in 2006. Western Europe currently accounts for approximately 26% of global bleached softwood kraft market pulp demand, compared to approximately 36% in 2006. The demand in the mature markets of Europe, North America and Japan in 2015 declined by approximately 2.9 million ADMTs from 2006. 

The following chart sets forth industry-wide bleached softwood kraft deliveries to China for the periods indicated: 

&#160;

&#160;

Growth in NBSK pulp demand in China and other emerging markets has, to a large extent, been driven by increased demand from tissue and specialty paper producers, as a result of economic growth and rising income levels and living standards in such markets. These factors generally contribute to a greater demand for personal hygiene products in such regions. In China alone, tissue producers have publicly announced plans to increase their annual tissue capacity by approximately 1.0 million ADMTs during 2016. At this time there can be no assurance as to when and how much of such capacity expansion will be implemented. 

This has also led to an overall shift in demand for NBSK pulp, as demand from tissue producers has increased, while demand from printing and writing end uses has decreased. Between 2003 and 2013, NBSK pulp demand for tissue production increased by approximately 168%, an approximate 10% compound annual growth rate. From 2006 to 2014, a period very affected by &#147;digital substitution&#148; of traditional paper grades, total NBSK demand grew by 3%. 

&#160;

The following chart compares NBSK pulp demand by end use in each of 2003 and 2013 (the latest year for which figures are currently available). 

&#160;

&#160;

We believe 2014 and 2015 NBSK demand by end use was generally consistent with the trend in the chart above. 

A measure of demand for kraft pulp is the ratio obtained by dividing the worldwide demand of kraft pulp by the worldwide capacity for the production of kraft pulp, or the &#147;demand/capacity ratio&#148;. An increase in this ratio generally occurs when there is an increase in global and regional levels of economic activity. An increase in this ratio also generally indicates greater demand as consumption increases, which often results in rising kraft pulp prices and a reduction of inventories by producers and buyers. As prices continue to rise, producers continue to run at higher operating rates. However, an adverse change in global and regional levels of economic activity generally negatively affects demand for kraft pulp, often leading buyers to reduce their purchases and rely on existing pulp inventories. As a result, producers run at lower operating rates by taking downtime to limit the build-up of their own inventories. The demand/capacity ratio for softwood kraft pulp was approximately 92%, 93% and 94% in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

Between 2011 and 2015, we believe approximately 0.8 million ADMTs of pulp capacity was idled or shut down through mill closures or curtailments. Further, in efforts to improve environmental and safety standards, China has publicly stated that it will be reducing existing pulp and paper capacity in the near term by closing &#147;old&#148; mills, targeting a removal of 3.4 million ADMTs by the end of 2015. At this time, there can be no certainty as to the actual amount and timing of any such closures. 

Producers have publicly announced plans to expand the global supply of bleached hardwood kraft pulp in the 2016 and 2017 period by about 3.6 million ADMTs, primarily from South America and Asia. Further capacity increases of about 2.7 million ADMTs have been announced for 2018. We cannot ascertain with any certainty how much such capacity increases will be actually realized, given capital, fiber and other restraints. This increase in bleached hardwood kraft pulp is largely targeted at the growing demand for pulp in developing markets, particularly in China, by producers of tissues, specialty papers and packaging. Although not a direct competitor to NBSK pulp, if such additional bleached hardwood kraft pulp supply is not absorbed by such demand growth, as a result of generally lower prices for bleached hardwood kraft 

&#160;

pulp, this supply increase could put downward pressure on NBSK pulp prices. However, we believe customers&#146; ability to further substitute lower priced bleached hardwood kraft pulp for NBSK pulp is limited by the strength characteristic of NBSK pulp which is required by large modern paper machines to run lower basis-weight paper products efficiently. 

Producers have also publicly announced modernization and expansion projects for NBSK mills in Europe, including Russia, to be implemented in 2016 and 2017, ranging from small expansions of existing mills to potential &#147;greenfield&#148; mills. We estimate that if all of these projects were completed, they would increase NBSK pulp capacity by about 1.1 million ADMTs per annum. Further capacity increases of about 0.9 million ADMTs of NBSK pulp have been announced for 2018. We currently believe a number of the projects announced for 2016 and 2017 will be implemented while others are currently subject to various conditions including financing and further development. We believe that, because of fiber constraints, such a significant expansion of NBSK capacity in the region would likely require the closure of older mills. However, at this time, we cannot predict which of the publicly announced expansion projects will be completed or how much additional NBSK pulp production capacity may come online and when. As pulp prices are highly cyclical, there can be no assurance that NBSK pulp prices will not decline in the future as a result of increases to the supply of kraft pulp. 

In addition, certain integrated pulp and paper producers have the ability to discontinue paper production by idling their paper machines and selling their NBSK pulp production on the market, if market conditions, prices and trends warrant such actions. 

NBSK Pulp Pricing 

Kraft pulp is a globally traded commodity and prices are highly cyclical and volatile. Kraft pulp prices are generally quoted in U.S. dollars. Pricing is primarily influenced by the balance between supply and demand, as affected by global macroeconomic conditions, changes in consumption and capacity, the level of customer and producer inventories and fluctuations in exchange rates. Generally, we and other producers consider global NBSK pulp supply and demand to be evenly balanced when world inventory levels are at about 30 days&#146; supply. 

General macroeconomic conditions are closely tied to overall global business activity, which helps determine pulp demand and, in turn, impacts pricing. 

As the majority of market NBSK pulp is produced and sold by Canadian and Northern European producers, while the price of NBSK pulp is generally quoted in U.S. dollars, pricing is often affected by fluctuations in the currency exchange rates for the U.S. dollar versus the euro and the Canadian dollar. As NBSK pulp producers generally incur costs in their local currency, while pulp is quoted in U.S. dollars, a U.S. dollar strengthening generally benefits producers&#146; businesses and operating margins. Conversely, a weakening of the U.S. dollar versus the local currency of producers generally adversely affects producers&#146; businesses and operating margins. 

As a corollary to changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the euro and Canadian dollar, a stronger U.S. dollar generally increases costs to customers of NBSK pulp producers and results in downward pressure on prices. Conversely, a weakening U.S. dollar generally supports higher pulp pricing. However, there is invariably a time lag between changes in currency exchange rates and pulp prices. This lag can vary and is not predictable with any certainty. 

As Northern Europe has historically been the world&#146;s largest market and NBSK pulp is the premium grade, the European market NBSK price is generally used as a benchmark price by the industry. The average European list prices for NBSK pulp since 2006 have fluctuated between a low of approximately $575 per ADMT in 2009 and a high of $1,030 per ADMT in 2011. 

&#160;

The following chart sets out the changes in list prices for NBSK pulp in Europe, as stated in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars and euros for the periods indicated: 

&#160;

&#160;

In 2013, demand from China was stable throughout the year and supply was slightly under-balanced, which resulted in higher year-end list prices. In 2014, demand from both Europe and China was stable, while supply was slightly under-balanced throughout the year which kept prices relatively high. In 2015, demand was generally stable. However, the strength of the dollar resulted in lower pulp prices. 

The following table sets out list prices for NBSK pulp in the regions indicated at the dates indicated:

&#160; &#160; 940 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,020 &#160; &#160; &#160; 990 &#160; A producer&#146;s net sales realizations are list prices, net of customer discounts, commissions and other selling concessions. While there are differences between NBSK list prices in Europe, North America and Asia, European prices are generally regarded as the global benchmark and pricing in other regions tends to follow European trends. The nature of the pricing structure in Asia is different in that, while quoted list prices tend to be lower than Europe, customer discounts and rebates are much lower, resulting in net sales realizations that are generally similar to other markets.

&#160;

&#160;

Seasonality 

We are exposed to fluctuations in quarterly sales volumes and expenses due to seasonal factors. These factors are common in the NBSK pulp industry. We generally have weaker pulp demand in Europe during the summer holiday months and in China in the period relating to its lunar new year. We typically have a seasonal build-up in raw material inventories in the early winter months as our mills build up their fiber supply for the winter when there is reduced availability. 

Competition 

Pulp markets are large and highly competitive. Producers ranging from small independent manufacturers to large integrated companies produce pulp worldwide. Our pulp and customer services compete with similar products manufactured and distributed by others. While many factors influence our competitive position, particularly in weak economic times, a key factor is price. Other factors include service, quality and convenience of location. Some of our competitors are larger than we are in certain markets and have substantially greater financial resources. These resources may afford those competitors more purchasing power, increased financial flexibility, more capital resources for expansion and improvement and enable them to compete more effectively. Our key NBSK pulp competitors are principally located in Northern Europe and Canada and include Canfor Pulp, Mets&#228; Fibre, S&#246;dra Cell and Asia Pulp and Paper. 

Pulp Production 

We manufacture and sell NBSK pulp produced from wood chips and pulp logs at our three mills.

Capacity is the rated capacity of the plants for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

The kraft pulp produced at the Rosenthal mill is a long-fibered softwood pulp produced by a sulphate cooking process and manufactured primarily from wood chips and pulp logs. A number of factors beyond economic supply and demand have an impact on the market for chemical pulp, including requirements for pulp bleached without any chlorine compounds or without the use of chlorine gas. The Rosenthal mill has the capability of producing both &#147;totally chlorine free&#148; and &#147;elemental chlorine free&#148; pulp. Totally chlorine free pulp is bleached to a high brightness using oxygen, ozone and hydrogen peroxide as bleaching agents, whereas elemental chlorine free pulp is produced by substituting chlorine dioxide for chlorine gas in the bleaching process. This substitution virtually eliminates complex chloro-organic compounds from the mill&#146;s effluent. The Rosenthal mill produces pulp for reinforcement fibers to the specifications of certain of our customers. We believe that a number of our customers consider us their supplier of choice. 

The kraft pulp produced at the Stendal mill is of a slightly different grade than the pulp produced at the Rosenthal mill as the mix of softwood fiber used is slightly different. This results in a complementary product more suitable for different end uses. The Stendal mill is capable of producing both totally chlorine free and elemental chlorine free pulp. 

The Celgar mill produces high-quality kraft pulp that is made from a unique blend of slow growing/long-fiber Western Canadian tree species. It is used in the manufacture of high-quality paper and tissue products. We believe the Celgar mill&#146;s pulp is known for its excellent product characteristics, including tensile strength, wet strength and brightness. The Celgar mill is a long-established supplier to paper and tissue producers in Asia. 

Generation and Sales of &#147;Green&#148; Energy and Chemicals at our Mills 

Our pulp mills are large scale bio-refineries that, in addition to pulp, also produce surplus &#147;carbon neutral&#148; or &#147;green&#148; energy. As part of the pulp production process our mills generate &#147;green&#148; energy using carbon-neutral bio-fuels such as black liquor and wood waste. Through the incineration of bio-fuels in the recovery and power boilers, our mills produce sufficient steam to cover all of our steam requirements and allow us to produce surplus electricity which we sell to third party utilities. As a result, we have benefited from &#147;green&#148; energy legislation, incentives and commercialization that have developed over the last decade in Europe and Canada. In addition, in recent years we have applied considerable resources to increasing our capacity to produce and sell chemicals, primarily tall oil for use in numerous applications including bio-fuels. 

Our surplus energy and chemical sales provide our mills with a new stable revenue source unrelated to pulp prices. Since our energy and chemical production are by-products of our pulp production 

&#160;

process, there are minimal incremental costs and our surplus energy and chemical sales are highly profitable. We believe that this revenue source gives our mills a competitive advantage over other older mills which do not have the equipment or capacity to produce and/or sell surplus power and/or chemicals in a meaningful amount. 

In December 2013, we completed a $49.3 million capital project at our Stendal mill, referred to as &#147;Project Blue Mill&#148;, to increase production and efficiency through debottlenecking initiatives including the installation of an additional 46 MW steam turbine at the mill. The debottlenecking which, among other things, required a new turbine in order to enhance and efficiently utilize steam production was designed to increase the mill&#146;s annual pulp production capacity by 30,000 ADMTs. The new turbine permits the mill to produce an additional 109,000 MWh annually of surplus renewable energy for sale at premium pricing. 

In September 2010, we completed a $60.6 million capital project at our Celgar mill, referred to as the &#147;Celgar Energy Project&#148;, to increase the production of &#147;green&#148; energy and optimize its power generation capacity. Approximately $44.6 million of the project cost was financed by grants from the Canadian federal government. The project included the installation of a 48 MW condensing turbine which increased the mill&#146;s installed generating capacity to 100 MW and upgraded its bark boiler and steam consuming facilities. 

The following table sets out our electricity generation and surplus electricity sales for the five years ended December 31, 2015:

&#160;

German Mills 

Our German mills participate in a program established pursuant to the Renewable Energy Act, which requires that public electric utilities give priority to electricity produced from renewable energy sources by independent power producers and pay a fixed tariff for such electricity for a period of 20 years. Such tariff expires December 31, 2019 for our Rosenthal mill and December 31, 2024 for our Stendal mill. Under the program, our German mills now sell their surplus energy to the local electricity grid at the rates stipulated by the Renewable Energy Act for biomass energy. 

Since 2005, our German mills have also benefited from the sale of emission allowances under the European Union Carbon Emissions Trading Scheme, referred to as the &#147;EU ETS&#148;. However, our eligibility for special tariffs under the Renewable Energy Act has reduced the amount of emissions allowances granted to our German mills under the EU ETS. 

In 2015, our Rosenthal and Stendal mills sold approximately 165,852 MWh and 500,050 MWh of electricity, respectively, for proceeds of $16.8 million and $46.7 million, respectively. 

In 2015, our Rosenthal and Stendal mills generated $2.3 million and $9.4 million, respectively, from the sale of tall oil, a by-product of our production process. In 2014, our Rosenthal mill completed a capital project which allowed it to process and sell tall oil. We currently expect tall oil sales to increase in the future. 

Celgar Mill 

The Celgar mill has an electricity sales agreement with British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority, referred to as &#147;B.C. Hydro&#148;, for the sale of power generated, pursuant to which the mill agreed to supply a minimum of approximately 238,000 MWh of surplus electrical energy annually to the utility over a ten-year term. The agreement expires in 2020. 

&#160;

In 2015, our Celgar mill sold approximately 149,064 MWh of renewable electricity for proceeds of approximately $11.2 million. 

In 2012, we initiated a claim against the Government of Canada under the North American Free Trade Agreement, referred to as &#147;NAFTA&#148;, relating to our investment in Celgar and unfair and discriminatory treatment regarding its ability to purchase and sell energy. See Item 3. &#147;Legal Proceedings&#148;. 

In 2015, our Celgar mill&#146;s energy costs benefited from a recovery of $6.1 million as a result of a successful appeal before the British Columbia Utilities Commission of certain elements of the mill&#146;s energy purchase agreement.

Cash production costs per ADMT excludes depreciation and amortization. 

Production Costs 

Our major costs of production are fiber, labor, energy and chemicals. Fiber, comprised of wood chips and pulp logs, is our most significant operating expense, representing about 62% of our cash production costs. Given the significance of fiber to our total operating expenses and our limited ability to control its costs, compared with our other operating costs, volatility in fiber costs can materially affect our margins and results of operations. 

Fiber 

Our mills are situated in regions which generally provide a relatively stable supply of fiber. The fiber consumed by our mills consists of wood chips produced by sawmills as a by-product of the sawmilling process and pulp logs. Wood chips are small pieces of wood used to make pulp and are either wood residuals from the sawmilling process or pulp logs chipped especially for this purpose. Pulp logs consist of lower quality logs not used in the production of lumber. Wood chips and pulp logs are cyclical in both price and supply. 

Generally, the cost of wood chips and pulp logs is primarily affected by the supply and demand for lumber. Additionally, regional factors such as harvesting levels and weather conditions can also have a material effect on the supply, demand and price for fiber. 

In Germany, the price and supply of wood chips has been affected by increasing demand from alternative or renewable energy producers and government initiatives for carbon neutral energy. Declining 

&#160;

energy prices, weaker economies or warm winters such as in 2014 and 2015 tempered the demand for wood chips resulting from initiatives by European governments to promote the use of wood as a carbon neutral energy. Over the long-term, we expect this non-traditional demand for fiber is likely to continue to increase. 

In August 2012, Russia entered the World Trade Organization and, as a result, lowered its export tariffs for pine and spruce to 15% and 13%, respectively, which we believe has had a positive impact on European fiber supply. 

During the past few years, certain customers have endeavored to purchase pulp that is produced using fiber that meets certain recognized wood certification requirements from forest certification agencies like FSC, PEFC, SFI-CSA. If the fiber we purchase does not meet certain wood certifications required by customers, it may make it more difficult or prevent us from selling our pulp to such customers. The chain of custody wood certification process is a voluntary process which allows a company to demonstrate that they use forest resources in accordance with strict principles and standards in the areas of sustainable forest management practices and environmental management. In an effort to procure wood only from sustainably managed sources, we employ an FSC Chain of Custody protocol for controlled wood and PEFC certification, which requires tracking of fiber origins and preparing risk based assessments regarding the region and operator. In the areas where we operate, we are actively engaged in the further development of certification processes. Although wood certification requirements continue to evolve and are not consistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, we currently do not expect certification requirements to have a material adverse impact on our fiber procurement and pulp sales. 

Offsetting some of the increases in demand for wood fiber have been initiatives to increase harvest levels in Germany, particularly from small private forest owners. We believe that Germany has the highest availability of softwood forests in Europe suitable for harvesting and manufacturing. We believe private ownership of such forests is approximately 48%. Many of these forest ownership stakes are very small and have been harvested at rates much lower than their rate of growth. In 2013, per unit fiber prices in Germany increased by approximately 13%, mainly due to strong demand from the European board producers and sawmills, along with the increased demand for pellets due to an unusually cold winter. In addition to increased demand, high snow levels and summer floods in some areas in which we operate led to lower fiber supply levels during much of 2013. In 2014, our per unit fiber costs in Germany decreased by approximately 6% due to sawmills running at high rates, a stronger supply of logs and lower demand from pellet producers and board manufacturers. In 2015, our per unit fiber costs in Germany decreased by approximately 17% due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. In 2015, in local currency terms, average fiber prices in Germany were marginally lower as a result of a generally balanced wood market. 

We believe we are the largest consumer of wood chips and pulp logs in Germany and often provide the best long-term economic outlet for the sale of wood chips in Eastern Germany. We coordinate the wood procurement activities for our German mills to reduce overall personnel and administrative costs, provide greater purchasing power and coordinate buying and trading activities. This coordination and integration of fiber flows also allows us to optimize transportation costs, and the species and fiber mix for both mills. 

In 2015, the Rosenthal mill consumed approximately 1.8 million cubic meters of fiber. Approximately 64% of such consumption was in the form of sawmill wood chips and approximately 36% was in the form of pulp logs. The wood chips for the Rosenthal mill are sourced from approximately 34 sawmills located primarily in the states of Bavaria, Baden-W&#252;rttemberg and Th&#252;ringia and are within a 300 kilometer radius of the Rosenthal mill. Within this radius, the Rosenthal mill is the largest consumer of wood chips. Given its location and size, the Rosenthal mill is often the best economic outlet for the sale of wood chips in the area. Approximately 63% of the fiber consumed by the Rosenthal mill is spruce and the remainder is pine. While fiber costs and supply are subject to cyclical changes largely in the sawmill 

&#160;

industry, we expect that we will be able to continue to obtain an adequate supply of fiber on reasonably satisfactory terms for the Rosenthal mill due to its location and our long-term relationships with suppliers. We have not historically experienced any significant fiber supply interruptions at the Rosenthal mill. 

Wood chips for the Rosenthal mill are normally sourced from sawmills under one-year contracts with quarterly adjustments for market pricing. Substantially all of our chip supply is sourced from suppliers with which we have long-standing relationships. Pulp logs are sourced from the state forest agencies in Th&#252;ringia, Saxony and Bavaria and from private and municipal forest owners. In addition, the Rosenthal mill buys relevant volumes from traders and via imports from the Czech Republic and Poland. 

In 2015, the Stendal mill consumed approximately 3.3 million cubic meters of fiber. Approximately 27% of such fiber was in the form of sawmill wood chips and approximately 73% in the form of pulp logs. The core wood supply region for the Stendal mill includes most of the Northern and Western part of Germany within an approximate 300 kilometer radius of the mill. We also purchase wood chips from Southwestern and Southern Germany. The fiber consumed by the Stendal mill consisted of approximately 41% pine, 57% spruce and 2% other species in 2015. The Stendal mill has sufficient chipping capacity to fully operate solely using pulp logs, if required. We source pulp logs from private forest holders, municipal forest owners and from state forest agencies in Saxony-Anhalt, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Saxony, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Hesse, Brandenburg, Schleswig-Holstein, Rhineland Palatinate and the City of Berlin. The volumes are distributed at optimal costs between the mills. In addition, over the last three years, the Stendal mill also imported fiber from Poland and the Baltic Sea region. 

In 2015, the Celgar mill consumed approximately 2.4 million cubic meters of fiber. Approximately 69% of such fiber was in the form of sawmill wood chips and the remaining 31% came from pulp logs processed through its woodroom or chipped by a third party. Celgar&#146;s woodroom is able to process about 40% of the mill&#146;s fiber needs. The source of fiber at the mill is characterized by a mixture of species (pine, douglas fir, hemlock, cedar and spruce) and the mill sources fiber from a number of Canadian and U.S. suppliers. 

The availability of fiber for the Celgar mill is in large part influenced by the strength of the lumber market. Lumber markets are primarily driven by U.S. housing starts and, to a lesser degree, demand from China. 

The Celgar mill has access to approximately 33 different chip suppliers from Canada and the U.S., representing approximately 69% of its total annual fiber requirements. The Celgar mill&#146;s woodroom and third party chippers supplied the remaining 31% of the mill&#146;s fiber requirements in 2015. Chips are purchased in Canada and the U.S. in accordance with chip purchase agreements. Generally, pricing is reviewed and adjusted periodically to reflect market prices. One of the longer-term contracts is a so-called &#147;evergreen&#148; agreement, where the contract remains in effect until one of the parties elects to terminate after providing the stipulated notice. All other contracts are generally for one year with quarterly adjustments or on three-month terms. 

To secure the volume of pulp logs required by its woodroom, the Celgar mill has entered into pulp log supply agreements, which can range from three-month to one-year terms, with a number of different suppliers, many of whom are also contract chip suppliers to the mill. All of the pulp log agreements can be terminated by either party for any reason, upon seven days&#146; written notice. The Celgar mill also purchased two non-renewable licenses at a cost of $1.3 million, which will provide saw logs to sawmills in the area and pulp logs for the Celgar mill to use. The Celgar mill also bids on British Columbia timber sales from time to time. 

&#160;

In 2015, our Celgar mill&#146;s per unit fiber costs were flat compared to 2014, as the strength of the dollar largely offset higher prices in local currency terms. However, in Canadian dollar terms, in 2015 average fiber prices for our Celgar mill were approximately 17% higher than in 2014, due to the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, as a portion of our Celgar mill&#146;s fiber is sourced in U.S. dollars, and due to increased demand for chips in our Celgar mill&#146;s procurement area from coastal pulp mills. 

Labor 

Our labor costs are generally steady, with small overall increases due to inflation in wages and health care costs. Over the last three years, we have been able to largely offset such increases by increasing our efficiencies and production and streamlining operations. 

Energy 

Our energy is primarily generated from renewable carbon neutral sources, such as black liquor and wood waste. Our mills produce all of our steam requirements and generate excess energy which we sell to third party utilities. In 2015, we generated 1,846,842 MWh and sold 814,966 MWh of surplus energy. See also &#147;&#150; Generation and Sales of &#145;Green&#146; Energy and Chemicals at our Mills&#148;. We utilize fossil fuels, such as natural gas, primarily in our lime kilns and we use a limited amount for start-up and shut-down operations. Additionally, from time to time, mill process disruptions occur and we consume small quantities of purchased electricity and fossil fuels to maintain operations. As a result, all of our mills are subject to fluctuations in the prices for fossil fuels. 

Chemicals 

Our mills use certain chemicals which are generally available from several suppliers and sourcing is primarily based upon pricing and location. Our chemical costs have declined over the last three years through improved efficiencies and capital expenditures and the strength of the dollar. 

In connection with our focus on the growing bio-energy market, we sell tall oil, a by-product of our production process which is used as both a chemical additive and as a &#147;green&#148; energy source. In 2015, we generated $11.7 million from the sale of tall oil.

&#160; Our global sales and marketing group is responsible for conducting all sales and marketing of the pulp produced at our mills and currently has approximately 14 employees. This group largely handles all European and North American sales directly. Sales to Asia are made directly or through commission agents overseen by our sales group. The global sales and marketing group handles sales to approximately 190 customers. We coordinate and integrate the sales and marketing activities of our German mills to realize on a number of synergies between them. These include reduced overall administrative and personnel costs and coordinated selling, marketing and transportation activities. We also coordinate sales from the Celgar mill with our German mills on a global basis, thereby providing our larger customers with seamless service across all major geographies. In marketing our pulp, we seek to establish long-term relationships by providing a competitively priced, high-quality, consistent product and excellent service. In accordance with customary practice, we maintain long-standing relationships with our customers, pursuant to which we periodically reach agreements on specific volumes and prices. 

Our pulp sales are on customary industry terms. At December 31, 2015, we had no material payment delinquencies. In 2015, one customer through several of its operations accounted for 16% of our pulp sales. In 2014, one customer through several of its operations accounted for 13% of our pulp sales. In 2013, two customers through several of their operations accounted for 10% and 11%, respectively, of our pulp sales. We do not believe our pulp sales are dependent upon the activities of any single customer and the loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on us. 

Our sales to tissue and specialty paper product manufacturers were approximately 50% of our pulp sales in 2015 and 2014 and about 49% of our pulp sales in 2013. Generally tissue producer customers are 

&#160;

not as sensitive to cyclical declines in demand caused by downturns in economic activity. The balance of our sales was to other paper product manufacturers. 

Transportation 

We transport our NBSK pulp generally by truck, rail and ocean carriers through third-party carriers. We have a small fleet of trucks in Germany that deliver some of our German mills&#146; pulp. 

Our German mills are currently the only significant market kraft pulp producers in Germany, which is the largest import market for kraft pulp in Europe. We therefore have a competitive transportation cost advantage compared to Canadian and Northern European pulp producers when shipping to customers in Europe. Due to the location of our German mills, we are able to deliver pulp to many of our customers primarily by truck and rail. Most trucks that deliver goods into Eastern Germany generally do not have significant backhaul opportunities as the region is primarily an importer of goods. We are therefore frequently able to obtain relatively low backhaul freight rates for the delivery of our products to many of our customers. Since many of our customers are located within a 500 kilometer radius of our German mills, we can generally supply pulp to customers of these mills faster than our competitors because of the short distances between the mills and our customers. 

The Celgar mill&#146;s pulp is transported to customers by rail, truck and ocean carrier to ensure timely delivery. The majority of Celgar&#146;s pulp for overseas markets is initially delivered primarily by rail to the Port of Vancouver for shipment overseas by ocean carrier. Based in Western Canada, the Celgar mill is well positioned to service Asian customers. The majority of the Celgar mill&#146;s pulp for domestic markets is shipped by rail directly to the customer or to third party warehouses in the U.S. In 2015, we established a logistics and reload center near Trail, British Columbia. The center provides us with additional warehouse space for our Celgar mill and greater transportation flexibility in terms of access to rail and trucking options. 

In each of 2015, 2014 and 2013, outbound transportation costs comprised approximately 9% of our total consolidated cost of sales. Generally, in recent years, our transportation costs have decreased due to the positive impact of a stronger dollar, decreases in fuel costs and higher shipping capacity. We have also taken initiatives to target sales to the most &#147;freight logical&#148; customers. 

Capital Expenditures 

In 2015, we continued with our capital investment programs designed to increase pulp, &#147;green&#148; energy and chemical generation, reduce costs and improve efficiency and environmental performance at our mills. The improvements made at our mills over the years have increased the competitive position of our facilities. 

Total capital expenditures at our mills (excluding any related governmental grants) are set out in the following table for the periods indicated:

Capital investments at the Rosenthal mill in 2015 related to a wastewater reduction project consisting of an evaporation plant upgrade and completion of an automated chip storage project. In 2014, they related primarily to the automated chip storage project and a tall oil project. In 2013, capital expenditures at the Rosenthal mill related primarily to the completion of the recovery upgrade project and the replacement of capital. 

Capital investments at the Stendal mill in 2015 related primarily to a wastewater reduction project consisting of an evaporation plant upgrade. In 2014, they related primarily to the evaporation plant upgrade. In 2013, capital investments at the Stendal mill related primarily to Project Blue Mill, which was completed in December 2013. Project Blue Mill required $49.3 million in capital expenditures, which was primarily funded through approximately &#128;11.3 million ($15.0 million) of non-refundable German government grants, a &#128;17.0 million ($22.2 million) five-year amortizing secured term debt facility, operating cash flow of the Stendal mill and shareholder contributions. 

Certain of our capital investment programs in Germany were partially financed through government grants made available by German federal and state governments. Under legislation adopted by the federal and certain state governments of Germany, government grants are provided to qualifying businesses operating in Eastern Germany to finance capital investments. The grants are made to encourage investment and job creation. For example, the government grants received in connection with Project Blue Mill require us to maintain the employment of core employees for five years after completion of the project, among certain other terms. Previously, government grants were available for up to 35% of the cost of qualified investments. These grants at the 35% of cost level required that at least one permanent job be created for each &#128;0.5 million ($0.6 million) of capital investment eligible for such grants and that such jobs be maintained for a period of five years from the completion of the capital investment project. Generally, government grants are not repayable by a recipient unless such recipient fails to complete the proposed capital investment or, if applicable, fails to create or maintain the requisite amount of jobs or comply with other applicable terms. In the case of such failure, the government is entitled to revoke the grants and seek repayment unless such failure resulted from material unforeseen market developments beyond the control of the recipient, in which case the government may refrain from reclaiming previous grants. Pursuant to legislation in effect at the time, the Stendal mill recorded approximately $350.0 million of government grants. We believe that we are currently in compliance in all material respects with all of the terms and conditions governing the government grants we have received in Germany. See Item 3. &#147;Legal Proceedings&#148;. 

The following table sets out, as at the dates indicated, the effect of government grants on the recorded value of such assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets:

Qualifying capital investments at industrial facilities in Germany that reduce effluent discharges offset wastewater fees that would otherwise be required to be paid. For more information about our environmental capital expenditures, see &#147;&#150; Environmental&#148;. 

In 2015, capital investments at the Celgar mill included a logistics and reload center and other maintenance projects. In 2014, they included a new chip screening project, the logistics and reload center and maintenance projects. In 2013, capital expenditures at the Celgar mill related primarily to a variety of maintenance projects. 

In January 2014, we commenced the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning, or &#147;ERP&#148;, system to replace our existing business software applications at an estimated cost of $12.0 million. The project was designed to be completed in stages over the following two years. The ERP system installation will replace a suite of existing legacy systems which, while functional, will begin becoming obsolete in the near future. The ERP solution introduces state-of-the-art, end-to-end business solutions that will provide automation for most aspects of our business including finance, payroll, inventory management, sales, fiber management, supply chain, business analytics and forecasting. 

To assist us through the implementation, we have engaged third party advisors with extensive experience in ERP implementations using contemporary systems implementation methodologies that will address not only the technical complexities of such an implementation but also assist with maintaining internal controls over financial reporting. 

Excluding costs for projects financed through government grants, capital expenditures, including ERP expenditures, in 2016 are expected to be approximately $56.0 million, comprised principally of approximately: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149;

&#160; $18.2 million at the Rosenthal mill for the retrofit of the lime kiln, a rail acceptance system for logs and other maintenance projects; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149;

&#160; $16.2 million at the Stendal mill for the replacement of mobile equipment and other maintenance projects; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149;

&#160; $20.3 million at the Celgar mill for maintenance projects and the purchase of equipment for our second pass harvesting project; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149;

&#160; $1.3 million for continuing implementation of our ERP software across the entire company. 

&#160;

Innovation 

We are well positioned to capitalize on our expertise with fiber and its processing to expand our product mix and into new markets. Accordingly, we have a number of initiatives focused on developing innovative new products that are based on derivatives of the kraft pulping process. Currently these derivatives are focused in two broad categories: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149;

&#160; the further refinement of materials contained in black liquor, the extractive chemical and lignin containing compounds that are a result of the kraft pulping process; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149;

&#160; the further refinement of cellulose materials that are currently the basis of NBSK pulp. 

We are working on some of these initiatives on our own and some with industry associations and others with joint venture partners. Currently, one of the more well-developed of these projects is a cellulose derivative generally referred to in the industry as &#147;cellulose filaments&#148;. Cellulose filaments are the result of a new process that unbinds the individual filaments that make up a cellulose fiber. In northern softwoods, there are approximately 1,000 filaments making up a single fiber. The filaments resulting from this patented process are long, ribbon-like structures that have unique strength characteristics similar to other chemical derivatives, such as aramids. We believe that this material may have commercial potential in many applications, including strength enhancers, solution stabilizers and specialty solutions for numerous other industries. 

We are part of an industry association that has made considerable progress in developing a particular manufacturing process. We, along with other member companies, including certain other NBSK producers, have license rights to further develop and market existing intellectual property registered under patent to our industry association. The association and one of its member companies have constructed a pilot production facility and we have access to its product for development purposes. While there remains much work to be done, we continue to be encouraged with the results to date and intend to continue to expend resources to develop this technology, both individually and in joint development arrangements with third parties. We currently estimate expenditures totaling approximately $0.5 million in 2016. 

Such research and development is still at an early stage and there has been no commercialization of any products to date. We currently estimate it may take between two and four years before we can determine if product applications can be commercialized. However, there can be no assurance that such research and development will ever result in commercialization or the production or sales of any products by us at a profit or at all. 

We have also worked with suppliers to develop new customized forms of railcars in Germany designed to better handle the transportation of logs and chips to our German mills. These customized cars are larger than existing ones and are expected to reduce transportation and handling costs at our German mills. We expect to take delivery of about 300 to 400 cars over the next 18 months. 

We have also worked with equipment suppliers to develop innovative logging equipment to permit us to effect second pass harvesting in the fiber procurement area for the Celgar mill. Such equipment includes customized processing and chipping equipment and trailers for haulage. 

Environmental 

Our operations are subject to a wide range of environmental laws and regulations, dealing primarily with water, air and land pollution control. We devote significant management and financial resources to comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. In particular, the operation of our plants is 

&#160;

subject to permits, authorizations and approvals and we have to comply with certain emission limits. Compliance with these requirements is monitored by local authorities and non-compliance may result in administrative orders, fines or closures of the non-compliant mill. Our total capital expenditures on environmental projects at our mills were approximately $19.4 million in 2015, approximately $6.1 million in 2014 and approximately $1.9 million in 2013. In 2016, capital expenditures for environmental projects are expected to be approximately $1.3 million. These capital expenditures are expected to reduce wastewater fees and upgrade the effluent system. 

We believe we have obtained all required environmental permits, authorizations and approvals for our operations. We believe our operations are currently in material compliance with the requirements of all applicable environmental laws and regulations and our respective operating permits. 

Under German state environmental rules relating to effluent discharges, industrial users are required to pay wastewater fees based upon the amount of their effluent discharge. These rules also provide that an industrial user which undertakes environmental capital expenditures and lowers certain effluent discharges to prescribed levels may offset the amount of these expenditures against the wastewater fees that they would otherwise be required to pay. We expect capital investment programs and other environmental initiatives at our German mills will continue to offset the wastewater fees that are payable and we believe they will ensure that our operations continue in substantial compliance with prescribed standards. 

Environmental compliance is a priority for our operations. To ensure compliance with environmental laws and regulations, we regularly monitor emissions at our mills and periodically perform environmental audits of operational sites and procedures both with our internal personnel and outside consultants. These audits identify opportunities for improvement and allow us to take proactive measures at the mills as considered appropriate. 

The Rosenthal mill has a relatively modern biological wastewater treatment and oxygen bleaching facility. We have significantly reduced our levels of absorbable organic halogen discharge at the Rosenthal mill and we believe the Rosenthal mill&#146;s absorbable organic halogen and chemical oxygen discharges are in compliance with the standards currently mandated by the German government. 

Management believes that, as the Stendal mill is a state-of-the-art facility, it will be able to continue to operate in compliance with the applicable environmental requirements. 

Management further believes that Celgar will continue to operate in substantial compliance with the requirements of all applicable environmental laws and regulations. 

Future regulations or permits may place lower limits on allowable types of emissions, including air, water, waste and hazardous materials, and may increase the financial consequences of maintaining compliance with environmental laws and regulations or conducting remediation. Our ongoing monitoring and policies have enabled us to develop and implement effective measures to maintain emissions in substantial compliance with environmental laws and regulations to date in a cost-effective manner. However, there can be no assurances that this will be the case in the future. 

Climate Change 

Over the past several years, changing weather patterns and climatic conditions due to natural and man-made causes have added to the unpredictability and frequency of natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, hail storms, wildfires, snow storms and ice storms, which could also affect our operations, including variations in the cost and availability of raw materials, such as fiber. However, as there are 

&#160;

differing scientific studies relating to the severity, extent and speed at which climate change is occurring, we cannot identify and predict all of the consequences of climate change on our business and operations. 

The effects and perceived effects of climate change and social and governmental responses have created both opportunities and negative consequences for our business. 

The focus on climate change has generated a substantial increase in demand and in legislative requirements for &#147;carbon neutral&#148; or &#147;green&#148; energy in both Europe and, increasingly, in North America. Pulp mills consume wood residuals, being wood chips and pulp logs, as the base raw material for their production process. Wood chips are residuals left over from lumber production and pulp logs are generally lower quality logs left over from logging that are unsuitable for the production of lumber. 

As part of their production process, our mills take wood residuals and process them through a digester where cellulose is separated from the wood to be used in pulp production and the remaining residuals, called &#147;black liquor&#148;, are used for &#147;green&#148; energy production. As a result of their use of wood residuals and because our mills generate combined heat and power in a process known as cogeneration, they are efficient producers of energy. This energy is carbon neutral and produced from a renewable source. Our relatively modern mills generate a substantial amount of energy that is surplus to their operational requirements. 

These factors, along with governmental initiatives in respect of renewable or &#147;green&#148; energy legislation, have provided business opportunities for us to enhance our generation and sales of &#147;green&#148; energy to regional utilities. 

We are constantly exploring other initiatives to enhance our generation and sales of surplus &#147;green&#148; energy and chemical by-products. Other potential opportunities that may result from climate change include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149;

&#160; the expansion of softwood forests and increased growth rates for such forests; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149;

&#160; more intensive forestry practices and timber salvaging versus harvesting standing timber; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149;

&#160; greater demand for sustainable energy and cellulosic biomass fuels; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149;

&#160; additional governmental incentives and/or legislative requirements to enhance biomass energy production. 

At this time, we cannot predict which, if any, of these potential opportunities will be realized by us or their economic effect on our business. 

While all of the specific consequences to our business from climate change are not predictable, the most visible adverse consequence to date is that the focus on renewable energy has created greater demand and competition for wood residuals or fiber from renewable energy producers like the pellet industry in Germany. 

In Germany, the price and supply of wood residuals have been affected by an increasing demand from alternative or renewable energy producers and governmental initiatives for carbon neutral energy. Declining energy prices, weaker economies or warm winters such as in 2015 and 2014 temper the demand for wood chips resulting from initiatives by European governments to promote the use of wood as a carbon neutral energy. Over the long term, this non-traditional demand for fiber is expected to increase in Europe. Additionally, the growing interest and focus in British Columbia for renewable &#147;green&#148; energy is also 

&#160;

expected to create additional competition for such fiber in that region over time. Such additional demand for wood residuals may increase the competition and prices for wood residuals over time. 

Governmental action or legislation may also have an important effect on the demand and prices for wood residuals. As governments pursue &#147;green&#148; energy initiatives, they risk creating incentives and demand for wood residuals from renewable energy producers that &#147;cannibalizes&#148; or adversely affects traditional users, such as lumber and pulp and paper producers. We are continually engaged in dialogue with governments to educate and try to ensure potential initiatives recognize the traditional and continuing role of our mills in the overall usage of forestry resources and the economies of local communities. 

Other potential negative consequences from climate change that over time may affect our business include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149;

&#160; a greater susceptibility of northern softwood forests to disease, fire and insect infestation; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149;

&#160; the disruption of transportation systems and power supply lines due to more severe storms; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149;

&#160; the loss of fresh water transportation for logs and pulp due to lower water levels; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149;

&#160; decreases in the quantity and quality of processed water for our mill operations; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149;

&#160; the loss of northern softwood forests in areas in sufficient proximity to our mills to competitively acquire fiber; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149;

&#160; lower harvest levels decreasing the supply of harvestable timber and, as a consequence, wood residuals. 

Human Resources 

We currently employ approximately 1,469 people. We have approximately 1,028 employees working in our German operations, including our wood procurement, transportation and sales subsidiaries. In Canada, we have approximately 441 employees, of which 21 are employed at our Vancouver, British Columbia, office. 

Rosenthal employs approximately 438 people, the majority of whom are bound by a collective agreement. In July 2015, the Rosenthal mill revised its collective agreement for a two-year period until June 2017. The agreement provides for an initial 2.4% wage increase and a subsequent increase of 2.4% in September 2016. 

Stendal employs approximately 584 people, the majority of which are bound by a collective agreement. In 2011, Stendal entered into a seven-year collective agreement, effective July 2011 and expiring in 2018. Since, prior to entering into this collective agreement, Stendal&#146;s employees had relatively lower wages compared to their peers at other German pulp mills, this agreement provided for an approximately 5.5% wage increase in 2012 and a further 2.5% minimum annual wage increase from 2013 to 2015. 

Celgar employs approximately 420 people, the majority of which are bound by a collective agreement. Celgar entered into a five-year collective agreement with its hourly workers in 2012, which expires in April 2017. The agreement provided for lump sum payments of C$3,750 for all active employees in 2012 and 2013 and wage increases of 2.0%, 2.5% or 3.0% in each of 2014, 2015 and 2016. 

We consider the relationships with our employees to be good. Although no assurances can be provided, we have not had any significant work stoppages at any of our operations and we would therefore expect to enter into new labor agreements with our workers when the current labor agreements expire without any significant work stoppages. 

&#160;

Our directors and senior managers have extensive experience in the pulp and forestry industries, along with experienced managers at all of our mills. Our management has a proven track record of implementing new initiatives and capital projects in order to reduce costs throughout our operations as well as identifying and harnessing new revenue opportunities. 

Description of Certain Indebtedness 

The following summarizes certain material provisions of: (i) our 2019 and 2022 Senior Notes; (ii) our Stendal Revolving Credit Facility; (iii) our credit facilities related to our Rosenthal mill; and (iv) the Celgar Working Capital Facility. The summaries are not complete and are qualified by reference to the applicable documents and the applicable amendments to such documents on file with the SEC and incorporated by reference herein. 

2019 and 2022 Senior Notes 

On November 26, 2014, we issued $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.000% Senior Notes due 2019, referred to as the &#147;2019 Senior Notes&#148;, and $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.750% Senior Notes due 2022, referred to as the &#147;2022 Senior Notes&#148; and, together with the 2019 Senior Notes, the &#147;2019 and 2022 Senior Notes&#148;, to refinance our previously outstanding 9.50% Senior Notes due 2017, Stendal&#146;s senior project finance facility and Stendal&#146;s amortizing term facility for Project Blue Mill. 

The 2019 Senior Notes mature on December 1, 2019 and interest on the 2019 Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on each June 1 and December 1. Interest is payable to holders of record of the 2019 Senior Notes on the immediately preceding May 15 and November 15 and is computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. The 2022 Senior Notes mature on December 1, 2022 and interest on the 2022 Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on each June 1 and December 1.

&#160; a &#128;25.0 million revolving working capital facility which we extended in 2016 to mature in October 2019, referred to as the &#147;Rosenthal Loan Facility&#148;. The Rosenthal Loan Facility consists of a revolving credit facility which may be utilized by way of cash advances or advances by way of letter of credit or bank guarantees.

An interest period for cash advances shall be one, three or six months or any other period as Rosenthal and the lenders may determine. There is also a 0.90% per annum commitment fee on the unused and uncancelled amount of the revolving facility which is payable semi-annually in arrears. This facility is secured by a first ranking security interest on the inventories and receivables of Rosenthal. It also provides Rosenthal with a hedging facility relating to the hedging of the interest, currency and pulp prices as they affect Rosenthal pursuant to a strategy agreed to by Rosenthal and the lender from time to time. As at December 31, 2015, &#128;3.1 million was supporting bank guarantees, leaving approximately &#128;21.9 million available under this facility; and
