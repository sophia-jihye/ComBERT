 Item &#160; 1 . Business 

Overview 

Transocean Ltd. (together with its subsidiaries and predecessors, unless the context requires otherwise, &#8220;Transocean,&#8221; the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221;) is a leading international provider of offshore contract drilling services for oil and gas wells. A s of February 11, 2016 , we owned or had partial ownership interests in and operated 61 mobile offshore drilling units. As of February 11, 2016, our fleet consisted of 28 &#160; u ltra &#8209; d eepwater floaters, seven harsh environment floaters, five deepwater floaters , 11 &#160; m idwater f loaters and 10 &#160; h igh &#8209; s pecification j ackups . At February 11, 2016, we also had six ultra &#8209;deepwater drillships and &#160; five &#160; h igh &#8209; s pecification j ackups under construction or under contract to be constructed. 

Our primary business is to contract our drilling rigs, related equipment and work crews predominantly on a dayrate basis to drill oil and gas wells. We specialize in technically demanding regions of the global offshore drilling business with a particular focus on deepwater and harsh environment drilling services . We believe our mobile offshore drilling fleet is one of the most versatile fleets in the world , consisting of floaters and high &#8209;specification jackups used in support of offshore drilling activities and offshore support services on a worldwide basis. 

Transocean Ltd. is a Swiss corporation &#160; with its registered office in Steinhausen, Canton of Zug and with principal executive offices located at Chemin de Blandonnet 10, 1214 Vernier, Switzerland. Our telephone number at that address is +41 22 930 &#8209; 9000 . Our shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (&#8220;NYSE&#8221;) under the symbol &#8220;RIG&#8221; and on the SIX Swiss Exchange (&#8220;SIX&#8221;) under the symbol &#8220;RIGN&#8221; (see &#8220;&#8212;Recent Developments&#8221;). For information about the revenues, operating income, assets and other information related to our business, our segments and the geographic areas in which we operate, see &#8220;Part II. Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; and &#8220;Part II. Item 8.

Recent Developments 

On November 23, 2015, we announced our intent to delist our shares from the SIX, and on December 17, 2015, we announced that the SIX listing authorities approved our application to delist our shares. Such delisting is expected to become effective on March 31, 2016, with the last trading day scheduled to be March 30, 2016. Our shares will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE. 

On October 29, 2015, shareholders at our extraordinary general meeting approved the reduction of the par value of each of our shares to CHF 0.10 from the original par value of CHF 15.00. The par value reduction became effective as of January 7, 2016 upon registration in the commercial register. 

On August &#160; 5, 2014, we completed an initial public offering to sell a noncontrolling interest in Transocean Partners LLC (&#8220;Transocean Partners&#8221;) , a consolidated Marshall Islands limited liability company , which trades on the NYSE under the ticker symbol &#8220;RIGP&#8221;. Through Transocean Partners Holdings Limited, a Cayman Islands company and our wholly owned subsidiary, we hold the controlling interest with 21.3 million common units and 27.6 million subordinated units and all of the incentive distribution rights . See &#8220;Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212;Note 15&#8212;Noncontrolling Interest.&#8221; 

Drilling Fleet 

Fleet overview &#8212; Most of our drilling equipment is suitable for both exploration and development drilling, and we normally engage in both types of drilling activity . Likewise, all of our drilling rigs are mobile and can be moved to new locations in response to customer demand . All of our mobile offshore drilling units are designed to operate in locations away from port for extended periods of time and have living quarters for the crews, a helicopter landing deck and storage space for drill pipe , riser and drilling supplies. Our drilling fleet can be generally characterized as follows: (1) floaters, including drillships and semisubmersibles, and (2) jackups. 

Drillships are generally self &#8209; propelled vessels , shaped like conventional ships , and are the most mobile of the major rig types . All of our high &#8209;specification drillships are equipped with a computer &#8209;controlled dynamic positioning thruster system, which allows them to maintain position without anchors through the use of their onboard propulsion and station &#8209; keeping systems . Drillships typically have greater deck load and storage capacity than early generation semisubmersible rigs , which provides logistical and resupply efficiency benefits for customers. D rillships are generally better suited to operations in calmer sea conditions and typically do not operate in areas considered to be harsh environments. We have 13 ultra &#8209;deepwater drillships in operation that are, and six ultra &#8209;deepwater drillships under construction that will be, equipped with our patented dual &#8209; activity technology . Dual &#8209; activity technology employs structures, equipment and techniques using two &#160; d rilling stations within a dual derrick to allow these &#160; drillships to perform simultaneous drilling tasks in a parallel , rather than a sequential manner , reduc ing critical path activity , to improve efficiency in both exploration and development drilling. In addition to dynamic positioning thruster systems, dual &#8209;activity technology, industry &#8209;leading hoisting capacity and a second blowout preventer system, four of our six newbuild drillships under construction will be outfitted to accommodate a future upgrade to a 20,000 pounds per square inch (&#8220;psi&#8221;) blowout preventer.

&#160;

Semisubmersibles are floating vessels that can be partially submerged by means of a water ballast system such that the lower column sections and pontoons are below the water surface during drilling operations . These rigs are capable of maintaining their position over a well through the use of an anchoring system or a computer &#8209; controlled dynamic positioning thruster system . Although most semisubmersible rigs are relocated with the assistance of tugs, some units are self &#8209; propelled and move between locations under their own power when afloat on pontoons . Typically , semisubmersibles are capable of operating in rougher sea conditions than drillships. We have two custom &#8209;designed, high &#8209;capacity, dual &#8209;activity semisubmersible drilling rigs, equipped for year &#8209;round operations in harsh environments, including those of the Norwegian continental shelf and sub &#8209;Arctic waters. We have three &#160; semisubmersibles , which are designed for mild environments and are equipped with the unique tri &#8209; act derrick . The tri &#8209; act derrick was designed to reduce overall well construction costs, as it allows offline tubular and riser handling operations to occur at two &#160; sides of the derrick while the center portion of the derrick is being used for normal drilling operations through the rotary table . Additionally, five of our 30 semisubmersibles are equipped with our patented dual &#8209; activity technology. 

Jackup rigs are mobile self &#8209; elevating drilling platforms equipped with legs that can be lowered to the ocean floor until a foundation is established to support the drilling platform . Once a foundation is established, the drilling platform is then jacked further up the legs so that the platform is above the highest expected waves. &#160; These rigs are generally suited for water depths of 400 feet or less. We have five newbuild high &#8209;specification jackups under construction that are expected to be capable of constructing wells up to 35,000 feet deep and feature advanced offshore drilling technology, including offline tubular handling features and simultaneous operations support. 

Fleet categories &#8212; We further categorize the drilling units of our fleet as follows: ( 1 ) &#8220; ultra &#8209;deepwater &#160; f loaters,&#8221; (2) &#8220; h arsh e nvironment f loaters,&#8221; (3) &#8220; d eepwater f loaters , &#8221; ( 4 ) &#8220;m idwater f loaters&#8221; and ( 5 ) &#8220;high &#8209;specification &#160; jackups.&#8221; 

Ultra &#8209;deepwater &#160; f loaters are equipped with high &#8209; pressure mud pumps and are capable of drilling in water depth s of 7,500 feet or greater . Harsh environment f loaters are capable of drilling in harsh environments in water depths between 1,500 and 10, 000 &#160; feet and &#160; have greater displacement, which offers larger variable load capacity, more useable deck space and better motion characteristics . Deepwater f loaters are generally those other semisubmersible rigs and drillships capable of drilling in water depth s between 4,500 and 7, 5 00 feet . Midwater f loaters are generally comprised of those non &#8209; high &#8209; specification semisubmersibles that have a water depth capacity of less than 4,500 feet . High &#8209;specification &#160; j ackups have high capacity derricks, drawworks, mud systems and storage and generally have a water depth capacity of between 350 and 400 feet . 

As of February 11 , 20 16 , we owned and operated a fleet of 61 rigs, excluding rigs under construction, as follows : 

&#167; 

28 &#160; u ltra &#8209; d eepwater f loaters ; 

&#167; 

Seven h arsh e nvironment f loaters ; 

&#167; 

Five &#160; d eepwater floaters; 

&#167; 

11 m idwater f loaters; and 

&#167; 

10 high &#8209; specification jackups. 

Fleet status &#8212; Depending on market conditions, we may idle or stack non &#8209; contracted rigs. An i dle rig is between drilling contracts, readily available for operations, and operating costs are typically at or near normal levels. A s tacked rig typically has reduced operating costs, is staffed by a reduced crew or has no crew and is (a) preparing for an extended period of inactivity, (b) expected to continue to be inactive for an extended period, or (c) completing a period of extended inactivity. Stacked rigs will continue to incur operating costs at or above normal operating levels for 30 to 60 days following initiation of stacking. Some idle rigs and all s tacked rigs require additional costs to return to service . The actual cost to return to service , which in many instances could be significant and could fluctuate over time, depends upon various factors, including the availability and cost of shipyard facilities, cost of equipment and materials and the extent of repairs and maintenance that may ultimately be required . We consider these factors, together with market conditions, length of contract , &#160; d ayrate and other contract terms , &#160; when deciding whether to return a stacked rig to service . We may , from time to time, consider marketing stacked rigs as accommodation units or for other alternative uses until drilling activity increases and we obtain drilling contracts for these units . We may not return some stacked rigs to work for drilling services or for these alternative uses. 

Drilling unit s &#8212;The following tables, presented as of February 11, 2016, provide certain specifications for our rigs. Unless otherwise noted, the stated location of each rig indicates either the current drilling location, if the rig is operating, or the next operating location, if the rig is in shipyard with a follow &#8209;on contract. As of February 11, 2016, we owned all of the drilling rigs in our fleet noted in the tables below, except for the following: (1) those specifically described as being owned through our interests in consolidated entities that were less than wholly owned and (2) Petrobras 10000 , which is subject to a capital lease through August 2029.

W e operate in a single, global offshore drilling market , as our drilling rigs are mobile assets and are able to be moved according to prevailing market conditions . We may mobilize our drilling rigs between regions for a variety of reasons, including to respond to customer contracting requirements or capture demand in another locale. Consequently , we cannot predict the percent age of our revenues that will be derived from particular geographic or political areas in future periods. 

As of February 11 , 201 6 , our drilling fleet was located in the U.K. North Sea &#160; ( 13 units) , U.S. Gulf of Mexico &#160; ( 10 units), Trinidad (seven units) , Norway &#160; ( five units), &#160; Brazil &#160; ( four units) , Angola (three units), Thailand (three units), India &#160; ( two units ), Malaysia (two units), Nigeria (two units), Australia &#160; ( one &#160; unit ) , Canada (one unit), Gabon (one unit), Ivory Coast (one unit), &#160; Myanmar (one unit), Romania (one unit), Singapore (one unit), South Africa (one unit), Spain (one unit) and United Arab Emirates (one unit). 

We categorize the market sectors in which we operate as follows: (1) ultra-deepwater, (2) deepwater, (3) midwater and (4) jackup. The ultra &#8209;deepwater, deepwater and mid water market sectors , collectively known as the floater market, are serviced by our drillships and semisubmersibles , seven of which are suited to work in harsh environments. W e generally view the ultra-deepwater market sector as water depths beginning at 7,500 feet and extending to the maximum water depths in which rigs are capable of drilling, which is currently up to 12,000 feet. The deepwater market sector services water depths beginning at approximately 4,500 feet to approximately 7,500 feet, and the midwater market sector services water depths from approximately 300 feet to approximately 4,500 feet. The jackup market sector begins at the outer limit of the transition zone, which is characterized by coastal and state water areas, extending to water depths of approximately 400 feet. 

The market &#160; for &#160; offshore &#160; drilling &#160; rigs &#160; and associated &#160; services &#160; reflects &#160; oil &#160; companies&#8217; &#160; demand &#160; for &#160; equipment for &#160; drilling &#160; exploration, &#160; appraisal &#160; and development &#160; wells &#160; and for &#160; performing &#160; maintenance &#160; on existing &#160; production wells. Activity &#160; levels &#160; of exploration &#160; and production (&#8220;E&#38;P&#8221;) companies &#160; and their &#160; associated &#160; capital &#160; expenditures are &#160; largely &#160; driven &#160; by the &#160; worldwide &#160; demand &#160; for &#160; energy, &#160; including &#160; crude &#160; oil &#160; and natural &#160; gas. Worldwide energy supply and demand drives oil and natural gas &#160; prices, &#160; which in turn, &#160; impact &#160; E&#38;P companies&#8217; &#160; ability &#160; to fund investments &#160; in exploration, &#160; development &#160; and production &#160; activities. 

At present, the industry is experiencing a cyclical downturn. Sustained weak commodity pricing has resulted in our customers delaying investment decisions and postponing exploration and production programs. Oil and natural gas prices do not currently support sustained demand for drilling rigs across all asset classes and regions. As a result of this reduced demand, we have seen a sharp decline in the execution of drilling contracts for the global offshore drilling fleet and an unprecedented level of early drilling contract terminations. We currently expect very few drilling contracts to be awarded in 2016, exacerbating the excess rig capacity and resulting in continued downward pressure on dayrates. In this environment, older and less capable assets are more likely to be permanently retired, ultimately reducing the available supply of drilling rigs. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we sold 17 and two drilling units, respectively, for scrap value, and at December 31, 2015, we have five additional rigs classified as held for sale for scrap value. 

Despite current market conditions, our long &#8209;term outlook for the offshore drilling sector remains positive, particularly for high &#8209;specification assets. Prior to the downturn, Brazil, the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and West Africa emerged as key ultra &#8209;deepwater market sectors, and licensing activity demonstrated an increased interest in deepwater fields as E&#38;P companies looked to explore new prospects. We expect deepwater oil and gas production will continue to be a part of the long &#8209;term strategy for E&#38;P companies as they strive to meet global demand for hydrocarbons replacing reserves. A number of new deepwater and ultra &#8209;deepwater development opportunities have been identified globally. If commodity prices stabilize and rebound to sustainable levels, we anticipate that many of the projects will receive approval to move forward. Many of these projects are technically demanding due to factors such as water depth, complex well designs, deeper drilling depth, high pressure and temperature, sub &#8209;salt, harsh environments, and heightened regulatory standards; therefore, they require sophisticated drilling units. Generally, ultra &#8209;deepwater rigs are the most modern, technologically advanced class of the offshore fleet and have capabilities that are attractive to exploration and production companies operating in deeper water depths or other challenging environments or with complex well designs.

Contract Drilling Services 

Our contracts to provide offshore drilling services are individually negotiated and vary in their terms and provisions. We obtain most of our drilling contracts through competitive bidding against other contractors and direct negotiations with operators . Drilling contracts generally provide for payment on a dayrate basis, with higher rates for periods while the drilling unit is operating and lower rates or zero rates for periods of mobilization or when drilling operations are interrupted or restricted by equipment breakdowns, adverse environmental conditions or other conditions beyond our control. 

A dayrate drilling contract generally extends over a period of time covering either the drilling of a single well or group of wells or covering a stated term. At December 31, 201 5 , the contract backlog was approximately $16.0 billion, representing a de crease of 29 percent and 43 percent , respectively, compared to the contract backlog at December 31, 201 4 and 201 3 , which was $ 22.5 billion and $ 28.2 billion, respectively. See &#8220;Part II. Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Outlook&#8212;Drilling market&#8221; and &#8220;Part II. Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Outlook&#8212;Performance and Other Key Indicators.&#8221; 

Certain of our drilling contracts wit h customers may be cancelable for the convenience of the customer upon payment of an early termination payment. Such payments, however, may not fully compensate us for the loss of the contract. Contracts also customarily provide for either automatic termination or termination at the option of the customer typically without the payment of any termination fee, under various circumstances such as non &#8209;performance, in the event of extended downtime or impaired performance caused by equipment or operational issues, or periods of extended downtime due to force majeure events. Many of these events are beyond our control. The contract term in some instances may be extended by the customer exercising options for the drilling of additional wells or for an additional term. Our contracts also typically include a provision that allows the customer to extend the contract to finish drilling a well &#8209;in &#8209;progress. During periods of depressed market conditions, our customers may seek to renegotiate firm drilling contracts to reduce their obligations or may seek to repudiate their contracts. Suspension of drilling contracts will result in the reduction in or loss of dayrate for the period of the suspension. If our customers cancel some of our contracts and we are unable to secure new contracts on a timely basis and on substantially similar terms, or if contracts are suspended for an extended period of time or if a number of our contracts are renegotiated, it could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations or cash flows. See &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212;Risks related to our business&#8212;Our drilling contracts may be terminated due to a number of events.&#8221; 

Consistent with standard industry practice, our customers generally assume, and indemnify us against, well control and subsurface risks under dayrate drilling contracts. Under all of our current drilling con tracts, our customers, as the operators, indemnify us for pollution damages in connection with reservoir fluids stemming from operations under the contract and we indemnify the operator for pollution from substances in our control that originate from the rig , such as diesel used onboard the rig or other fluids stored onboard the rig and above the water surface. Also, under all of our current drilling contracts, the operator indemnifies us against damage to the well or reservoir and loss of subsurface oil and gas and the cost of bringing the well under control. However, our drilling contracts are individually negotiated, and the degree of indemnification we receive from the operator against the liabilities discussed above can vary from contract to contract, based on market conditions and customer requirements existing when the contract was negotiated. In some instances, we have contractually agreed upon certain limits to our indemnification rights and can be responsible for damages up to a specified maximum dollar amount , which is, in any case, immaterial to us. The nature of our liability and the prevailing market conditions, among other factors, can influence such contractual terms. In most instances in which we are indemnified for damages to the well, we have the responsibility to redrill the well at a reduced dayrate. Notwithstanding a contractual indemnity from a customer, there can be no assurance that our customers will be financially able to indemnify us or will otherwise honor their contractual indemnity obligations. See &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212;Risks related to our business&#8212;Our business involves numerous operating hazards, and our insurance and indemnities from our customers may not be adequate to cover potential losses from our operations.&#8221; 

The interpretation and enforceability of a contractual indemnity depends upon the specific facts and circumstances involved, as governed by applicable laws , and may ultimately need to be decided by a court or other proceeding which will need to consider the specific contract language, the facts and applicable laws. The law generally considers contractual indemnity for criminal fines and penalties to be against public policy . Courts also restrict indemnification for criminal fines and penalties. The inability or other failure of our customers to fulfill their indemnification obligations , or unenforceability of our contractual protections could have a material adverse effect on our

Significant Customer s 

We engage in offshore drilling services for most of the leading international oil companies or their affiliates , as well as for many government &#8209; controlled oi l companies and independent oil companies. For the year ended December 31, 201 5 , our most significant customers were Chevron Corporation (together with its affiliates, &#8220;Chevron&#8221;) and Royal Dutch Shell plc (t ogether with its affiliates, &#8220;Shell &#8221;), representing approximately 14 percent and 10 percent, respectively, of our consolidated operating revenues. No other customers accounted for 10 percent or more of our consolidated operating revenues in the year ended December 31, 2015. Additionally, as of February 11, 2016, the customers with the most significant aggregate amount of contract backlog associated with our drilling contracts were Shell and Chevron, representing approximately 51 percent and 21 percent, respectively, of our total contract backlog. See &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212;Risks related to our business&#8212;We rely heavily on a relatively small number of customers and the loss of a significant customer or a dispute that leads to the loss of a customer could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.&#8221; 

Employees 

We require highly skilled personnel to operate our drilling units. Consequently, w e conduct extensive personnel recruiting, training and safety programs. &#160; At December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 9,100 employees associated with our continuing operations , including approximately 500 persons engaged through contract labo r providers. &#160; &#160; Approximately 30 percent of our total workforce, working primarily in Angola, the U.K., Nigeria, Norway, Australia and Brazil are represented by, and some of our contracted labor work under, collective bargaining agreements, substantially all of which are subject to annual salary negotiation. These negotiations could result in higher personnel expenses , other increased costs or increased operation al restrictions , as the outcome of such negotiations apply to all offshore employ ees not just the union members. Additionally, failure to reach agreement on certain key issues may result in strikes, lockouts or other work stoppages that may materially impact our operations. 

Legislation has been introduced in the U.S. Congress that could encourage additional unionization efforts in the U.S., as well as increase the chances that such efforts succeed. &#160; Additional unionization efforts, if successful, new collective bargaining agreements or work stoppages could materially increase our labor costs and operating restrictions. 

Joint Venture, Agency and Sponsorship Relationships and Other Investments 

As of December 31, 2015, we held a 70.9 percent limited liability company interest in Transocean Partners. On August 5, 2014, we completed the initial public offering of 20.1 million common units of Transocean Partners, which trades on the NYSE under the ticker symbol &#8220;RIGP.&#8221; During the year ended December 31, 2015, Transocean Partners repurchased 91,500 common units under its unit repurchase program, and at December 31, 2015, 20.0 million publicly traded common units remained outstanding. We hold the remaining 21.3 million common units and 27.6 million subordinated units of Transocean Partners and all of its incentive distribution rights. 

Additionally, i n some areas of the world, local customs and practice or governmental requirements necessitate the formation of joint ventures with local participation . W e may or may not control these joint ventures. We are an active participant in several joint venture drilling companies, principally in Angola, Indonesia , Malaysia &#160; and Nigeria. &#160; Local laws or customs in some areas of the world also effectively mandate establishment of a relationship with a local agent or sponsor . When appropriate in these areas, we enter into agency or sponsorship agreements. Some of the joint ventures in which we participate are as follows: 

We hold a 65 percent interest in ADDCL, a consolidated Cayman Islands joint venture company formed to own Discoverer &#160; Luanda , which operates in Angola. O ur local partner, Angco Cayman &#160; Limited , a Cayman Islands company, holds the remaining 35 percent interest in ADDCL. Beginning January 31, 2016, Angco Cayman Limited will have the right to exchange its interest in the joint venture for cash at an amount based on an appraisal of the fair value of the drillship, subject to certain adjustments. 

We ho ld a 70 percent interest in TDSOI , a consolidated British Virgin Islands joint venture company formed to own Transocean Honor , which operates in Angola. O ur local partner, Angco II, a Cayman Islands company, holds the remaining 3 0 percent interest in TDSOI. Under certain circumstances, Angco II will have the right to exchange its interest in the joint venture for cash at an amount based on an appraisal of the fair value of the jackup, subject to certain adjustments. 

We hold a 24 percent direct interest and a 36 percent indirect interest in Indigo Drilling Limited (&#8220;Indigo&#8221;), a consolidated Nigerian joint venture company formed to engage in drilling operations offshore Nigeria. Our local partner s , Mr. Fidelis Oditah and Mr. Chima Ibeneche, each hold &#160; a 12.5 percent direct interest , and our other partners, Mr. Joseph Obi and Mr. Ben Osuno, together own a 15 percent indirect interest, in Indigo. 

Additionally, we hold interests in certain joint venture companies in Angola, Indonesia, Malaysia and Nigeria that have been formed to perform certain management services and other onshore support services for our operations.

Technological Innovation 

We are a leading international provider of offshore contract drilling services for oil and gas wells. We specialize in technically demanding sectors of the global offshore drilling business. Our fleet is considered one of the most versatile in the world with a particular focus on deepwater and harsh environment drilling capabilities. Since launching the offshore industry&#8217;s first jackup drilling rig in 1954, we have achieved a long history of technological innovations, including the first dynamically positioned drillship, the first rig to drill year &#8209;round in the North Sea and the first semisubmersible rig for year &#8209;round sub &#8209;Arctic operations. In recent years, we have repeatedly achieved the world water depth record, holding the current world record at 10,411 feet. Eighteen rigs in our existing fleet are, and six of our rigs that are currently under construction will be, equipped with our patented dual &#8209; activity technology , which allows our rigs to perform simultaneous drilling tasks in a parallel rather than sequential manner and reduces critical path activity while improving efficiency in both exploration and development drilling. &#160; &#160; Additionally, three rigs in our existing fleet are equipped with the unique tri &#8209;act derrick, which allows offline tubular and riser activities during normal drilling operations and is patented in certain market sectors in which we operate . 

We continue to develop and deploy industry &#8209;leading technology. In addition to our patented dual &#8209;activity drilling technology, some of our most recent newbuild drillships will include industry &#8209;leading hookload capability, compensated cranes for performing subsea installations, hybrid power systems and reduced emissions and advanced generator protection. The newbuild drillships will also be outfitted with two blowout preventers and triple liquid mud systems and are designed to accept 20,000 psi blowout preventers in the future. The effective use of and continued improvements in technology to address our customers&#8217; requirements are critical to maintaining our competitive position within the contract drilling services industry. W e expect to continue to develop technology internally , through partnerships, such as our collaboration with a customer to develop a fault &#8209;resistant and fault &#8209;tolerant blowout preventer control system, or to acquire technology through strategic acquisitions . 

Environmental Compliance 

Our operations are subject to a variety of global environmental regulations. We monitor our compliance with environmental regulation in each country of operation and, while we see an increase in general environmental regulation, we have made and will continue to make the required expenditures to comply with current and future environmental requirements. We make expenditures to further our commitment to environmental improvement and the setting of a global environmental standard as part of our wider corporate responsibility effort. We assess the environmental impacts of our business, focusing on the areas of greenhouse gas emissions, climate change, discharges and waste management. Our actions are designed to reduce risk in our current and future operations, to promote sound environmental management and to create a proactive environmental program. To date, we have not incurred material costs in order to comply with recent environmental legislation, and we do not believe that our compliance with such requirements will have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, consolidated results of operations or cash flows. 

For a discussion of the effects of environmental regulation, see &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212;Risks related to our business&#8212;Compliance with or breach of environmental laws can be costly, expose us to liability and could limit our operations.&#8221;
