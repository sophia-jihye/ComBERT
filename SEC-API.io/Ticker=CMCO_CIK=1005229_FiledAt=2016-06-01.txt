 Item 1. Business 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

We are a leading global designer, manufacturer and marketer of hoists, actuators, cranes, rigging tools, digital power control systems, and other material handling products serving a wide variety of commercial and industrial end-user markets. Our products are used to efficiently and ergonomically move, lift, position and secure objects and loads. We are the U.S. market leader in hoists and material handling drive systems, our principal line of products, as well as certain chain, forged fittings, and actuator products which we believe provides us with a strategic advantage in selling other products. We have achieved this leadership position through strategic acquisitions, our extensive, diverse and well-established distribution channels and our commitment to product innovation and quality. We have one of the most comprehensive product offerings in the industry and we believe we have more overhead hoists in use in North America than all of our competitors combined. Additionally, we believe we are the market leader of manual hoist and actuator products in Europe, which provides us further opportunity to sell other products through our existing distribution channels in that region. In September 2015, we significantly expanded our product offering with the acquisition of Magnetek, Inc. (Magnetek). The acquisition combines Magnetek's technology with our broad line of lifting and positioning mechanical products to create a more comprehensive solution for customers. Magnetek's digital power control systems serve the needs of selected niches of traditional and emerging markets that are becoming increasingly dependent on &#8220;smart&#8221; power. Much of Magnetek's focus is on developing and introducing innovative electronic drive solutions that both enhance our customers' productivity, safety, and energy efficiency. Our products are sold globally and our brand names, including CM, Coffing, Chester, Duff-Norton, Electromotive Systems, Enrange, IMPULSE, M-FORCE, Mondel, OmniPulse, Pfaff, Quattro, Shaw-Box, Telemotive, Unified, STB, and Yale are among the most recognized and well-respected in the marketplace. 

Our business is cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, including changes in industrial capacity utilization, industrial production and general economic activity indicators, like GDP. Both U.S. and Eurozone capacity utilization are primary leading market indicators for our Company. U.S. total industrial capacity utilization has declined to 74.9% in March 2016, compared to 77.3% in March 2015 and 75.4% in December 2015. Eurozone capacity utilization was 81.9% in the quarter ended March 31, 2016, an increase from the quarter ended December 31, 2015 of 81.5% and March 31, 2015 of 81.0%. The European indicator reflects the continued slow recovery from the 2013 recession in Europe, while the U.S. indicator is indicative of a declining industrial market. This was particularly evident in the mining and oil and gas sectors. In addition we follow the Emerging Markets Purchasing Managers&#8217; Index (PMI) for other countries in which we have a strong sales and marketing presence including China, Brazil, Mexico, and South Africa. 

&#160; 

Our Position in the Industry 

&#160; 

We participate predominantly in the hoist, crane, digital power control systems, elevator, and monorail sector. We believe that the demand for our products and services will be aided by several growth drivers. These drivers include: 

&#160; 

Productivity - We believe businesses respond to competitive pressures by seeking to maximize productivity and efficiency, among other actions. Our hoists and other lifting and positioning products allow loads to be lifted and placed quickly, precisely, with little effort and fewer people, thereby increasing productivity and reducing cycle time. Further, our variable frequency AC drive products and DC digital controls are highly reliable, operate at high speeds, and improve production output, while reducing labor and energy costs. In addition, emphasis on &#8220;Lean&#8221; techniques by many companies increases demand for our lifting and positioning products for use in single-piece flow workstation applications. 

&#160; 

Safety - &#32; Driven by workplace safety regulations such as the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and the Americans with Disabilities Act in the U.S. and other safety regulations around the world, and by the general competitive need to reduce costs such as health insurance premiums and workers&#8217; compensation expenses, businesses seek safer ways to lift and position loads. Our lifting and positioning products enable these tasks to be performed with reduced risk of personal injury. Our recent acquisition of Magnetek provides us with additional opportunities to enhance workplace safety and reduce the risk of accidents and personal injury, including collision avoidance software, programmable acceleration and deceleration, and other safeguards that prevent overheating, eliminate load swing, and prevent uneven lifting. 

&#160; 

Consolidation of Suppliers - &#32;In an effort to reduce costs and increase productivity, our channel partners and end-user customers are increasingly consolidating their suppliers. We believe that our broad product offering combined with our well established brand names will enable us to benefit from this consolidation and enhance our market share. 

Modernization and Upgrade of Existing Equipment - Overhead cranes, elevators, and mining equipment represent significant investments in capital which in most cases operate under severe duty and in some cases, in harsh environments. Many of the structural components of these systems are manufactured to withstand significant mechanical forces, and to have useful lives in excess of 30 years. For example, it is not uncommon to find cranes that are more than 50 years old still operating today, or elevators or mining equipment operating with aging and inefficient power control equipment. Rather than scrap structurally sound but outdated equipment, it is often more cost-effective to modernize the equipment to meet current operational needs by upgrading the power control systems. Our recently acquired drive technology along with our application expertise can provide reduced energy consumption, greater reliability, improved throughput, lower operational costs, enhanced features, and prolonged equipment life over older drive technology. We believe our large installed base of product combined with our industry expertise provides us with opportunities to expand our business through modernization projects. 

Conversion to Wireless Applications - Many industries, including the overhead material handling, mobile hydraulic, construction, and mining markets, are rapidly adopting remote wireless control solutions. While wireless control has been available for a number of years, technology has improved significantly in recent years, enabling enhancements that have resulted in products that are safer, more reliable, ergonomically designed, versatile, and cost-effective. Our recent acquisition of Magnetek provides us with an expanded wireless control product offering, which we believe will help us to meet demand, increase market share, and enter new markets in this growing field. 

Communication and Diagnostic Features - In many electrical applications today, electronic devices controlled by microprocessors are increasingly being networked together, resulting in smart devices with greater productivity and user benefits. The benefits of this trend on control systems for industrial applications include lower installation costs, better monitoring of performance, improved integration with supervisory systems, and improved uptime. We believe the development of "smart" hoists with the power of embedded and connected microprocessors will provide a tremendous benefit for users at all levels from maintenance to production users to meet their productivity, uptime and safety needs today and into the future.

Consistent Free Cash Flow Generation and Access to Capital &#8212;We have consistently generated positive free cash flow (which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures) through periods of economic uncertainty by continually controlling our costs, improving our working capital management and reducing the capital intensity of our manufacturing operations. During fiscal 2015, we significantly enhanced our capital structure by obtaining a $125 million term loan which replaced higher interest bearing notes and entering into a new $150 million revolving credit facility with an accordion feature allowing increases up to an additional $75 million with lender approval. This capital structure allows us to manage our liquidity in a low cost manner while maintaining flexibility to pursue attractive strategic growth opportunities. We exercised the accordion feature for $75 million and utilized the new $225 million revolving credit facility to obtain the funds necessary to acquire Magnetek in September of fiscal 2016. We borrowed $195 million under the revolving credit facility to fund the acquisition price and pay certain acquisition related fees. We have repaid $40 million of the amount borrowed for the Magnetek acquisition by March 31, 2016 and expect to repay an additional $30 million in fiscal 2017 in addition to our scheduled principal payments of $12.5 million required under our Term Loan agreement.

Industrial channel partners offer a broad array of industrial components that are used by many end-user markets. We continue to review and add new material handling products to broaden our offerings. 

Continue to Grow in Non-U.S. Markets - Our non-U.S. sales of $223,314,000 &#32;comprised 37% &#32;of our net sales for the year ended March 31, 2016, as compared with $244,033,000, or 42% in fiscal 2015 and as compared to 16% of our net sales in fiscal 1996, the year we became a public company. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted sales by $29,330,000 &#32;during fiscal 2016. Although we have made significant progress, our goal is to continue to increase our presence outside the U.S to capitalize on the higher growth opportunities and continue to diversify our business profile. We presently sell to distributors in over 50 countries and have our primary non-U.S. manufacturing facilities in China, Germany, the United Kingdom, Hungary, Mexico and France. In addition to new product introductions, we continue to expand our sales and service presence in the major and developing market areas of Asia-Pacific, Europe, and Latin America and have sales offices and warehouse facilities in Canada, various countries in Western and Eastern Europe, China, Thailand, Brazil, Uruguay, Panama and Mexico. We intend to increase our sales in Asia-Pacific by manufacturing a broader array of high quality, low-cost products and components in China. We have developed and are continuing to expand our development of hoist and other products in compliance with global standards and international designs to enhance our global distribution. 

Focus on Operational Excellence - &#32;Our objective is to provide the highest quality products and services at prices consistent with the value created for our customers. We continually evaluate our processes with a focus to reduce our costs. Our view is that a market-focused sales and marketing effort along with low operating costs will prove to be successful for both our customers and for the Company. We continually seek ways to reduce our operating costs and increase our manufacturing productivity, while improving our quality. Ongoing programs include our efforts to further develop our &#8220;Lean&#8221; culture throughout the organization, the expansion of our facilities in China, our continued search for new ways to leverage our purchasing power through combined sourcing and the continued focus on enhancing the efficiency of our global supply chain. 

&#160; 

Pursue Strategic Acquisitions and Alliances; Evaluate Existing Business Portfolio - We intend to pursue synergistic acquisitions to complement our organic growth. Priorities for such acquisitions include: i. increasing international geographic penetration, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region and other emerging markets, and ii. further broadening our offering with complementary products and capabilities. Additionally, we continually challenge the long-term fit of our businesses for potential divestiture and redeployment of capital. We believe we achieved a highly synergistic acquisition with our acquisition of Magnetek during fiscal 2016. The acquisition of Magnetek was very strategic as it will support the development of "smart" and integrated technology into our hoisting systems and at the same time, deliver meaningful accretion to our bottom line. We have achieved our cost synergy targets and our plans to add to our revenue streams are on target through the end of FY16.

Distributors also have access to a secure, extranet portal website allowing them to enter sales orders, search pricing information, check order status, and product serial number information. 

&#160; 

Distribution and Markets 

&#160; 

Our distribution channels include a variety of commercial distributors. In addition, we sell overhead bridge, jib and gantry cranes and aluminum light rail systems, as well as certain motion technology products directly to end-users. The following describes our global distribution channels: 

&#160;

(&#8220;CES&#8221;). CES which includes Abell-Howe and Washington Equipment brands designs, manufactures, installs and services a variety of cranes with capacities up to 100 tons. 

&#160; 

Service-After-Sale Distribution Channel - Service-after-sale distributors include our authorized network of 14 &#32;chain repair service stations and over 250 certified hoist service and repair stations globally. This service network is designed for easy parts and service access for our large installed base of hoists and related equipment in that region. 

&#160; 

OEM/Government Distribution Channels - &#32; This channel consists of: 

&#160; 

&#8212; 

OEMs that supply various component parts directly to other industrial manufacturers as well as private branding and packaging of our traditional products for material handling, lifting, positioning and special purpose applications. 

&#8212; 

Government agencies, including the U.S. and Canadian Navies and Coast Guards, that purchase primarily load securing chain and forged attachments. We also provide our products to the U.S. and other governments for a variety of military applications. 

Customer Service and Training 

&#160; 

We maintain customer service departments staffed by trained personnel for all of our sales divisions, and regularly schedule product and service training schools for all customer service representatives and field sales personnel. Training programs for distribution and service station personnel, as well as for end-users, are scheduled on a regular basis at most of our facilities and in the field. We have over 250 service and repair stations worldwide that provide local and regional repair, warranty and general service work for distributors and end-users. End-user trainees attending our various programs include representatives of 3M, DuPont, General Electric, and many other industrial and entertainment organizations. 

&#160; 

We also provide, in multiple languages, a variety of related material in video, CD-ROM, slide and print format addressing relevant material handling topics such as the care, use and inspection of chains and hoists, and overhead lifting and positioning safety. In addition, we sponsor advisory boards made up of representatives of our primary distributors and service-after-sale network members who are invited to participate in discussions focused on improving products and service. These boards enable us and our primary distributors to exchange product and market information relevant to industry trends. 

&#160; 

Backlog 

&#160; 

Our backlog of orders at March 31, 2016 was approximately $98,572,000 compared to approximately $85,170,000 at March 31, 2015. Magnetek accounted for $13,403,000 of our backlog at March 31, 2016. Our orders for standard products are generally shipped within one week. Orders for products that are manufactured to customer specifications are generally shipped within four to twelve weeks. Given the short product lead times, we do not believe that the amount of our backlog of orders is a reliable indication of our future sales. Fluctuations in backlog reflect the project oriented nature of certain aspects of our business. 

Competition 

&#160; 

The material handling industry remains highly fragmented. We face competition from a wide range of regional, national and international manufacturers globally. In addition, we often compete with individual operating units of larger, highly diversified companies. 

&#160; 

The principal competitive factors affecting our business include customer service and support as well as product availability, performance, functionality, brand reputation, reliability and price. Other important factors include distributor relationships and territory coverage. 

&#160; 

Major competitors for hoists are Konecranes, Terex (acquired Demag Cranes) and Kito (and its U.S. subsidiary Harrington); for chain are Campbell Chain, Peerless Chain Company and American Chain and Cable Company; for digital power control systems are Konecranes, Terex (acquired Demag Cranes), Power Electronics International, Inc., Cattron Group International (a division of Laird Technologies), Conductix-Wampfler (a division of Delachaux Group), Control Techniques (a division of Emerson Electric), OMRON Corporation, KEB GmbH, and Fujitec; for forged attachments are The Crosby Group and Brewer Tichner Company; for cranes are Konecranes, Terex (acquired Demag Cranes) and a variety of independent crane builders; for actuators and rotary unions are Deublin, Joyce-Dayton and Nook Industries; and for tire shredders, Granutech. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

At March 31, 2016, we had 2,896 employees; 1,655 in the U.S./Canada, 133 in Latin America, 883 in Europe and 225 in Asia. Approximately 13% &#32;of our employees are represented under three separate U.S. or Canadian collective bargaining agreements which terminate at various times between May 2017 and April 2018. We also have various labor agreements with our non-U.S. employees which we negotiate from time to time. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good and that the risk of a disruption in production related to these negotiations is remote. 

&#160; 

Raw Materials and Components 

&#160; 

Our principal raw materials and components are steel, consisting of structural steel, processed steel bar, forging bar steel, steel rod and wire, steel pipe and tubing and tool steel; electric motors; bearings; gear reducers; castings; steel and aluminum enclosures and wire harnesses; electro-mechanical components and standard variable drives. These commodities are all available from multiple sources. We purchase most of these raw materials and components from a limited number of strategic and preferred suppliers under long-term agreements which are negotiated on a company-wide basis through our global purchasing group to take advantage of volume discounts. We generally seek to pass on materials price increases to our channel partners and end-user customers. We continue to monitor our costs and reevaluate our pricing policies. Our ability to pass on these increases is determined by market conditions. 

&#160; 

Hedging Activities 

&#160; 

We use derivative instruments to manage selected foreign currency and interest rate risk exposures. The Company does not use derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. 

&#160; 

We use foreign currency forward agreements to i) hedge changes in the value of booked foreign currency liabilities due to changes in foreign exchange rates at the settlement date and ii) to hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases denominated in a foreign currency. We use interest rate swaps to maintain the Company's desired capital structure which is comprised of 50-70% of fixed rate long-term debt and 30-50% of variable rate long-term debt. 

Manufacturing 

&#160; 

We complement our own manufacturing by outsourcing components and finished goods from an established global network of suppliers. We regularly upgrade our global manufacturing facilities and invest in tooling, equipment and technology. 

&#160; 

Our manufacturing operations are highly integrated. Although raw materials and some components such as motors, bearings, gear reducers, steel and aluminum enclosures and wire harnesses, castings, electro-mechanical components and standard variable drives are purchased, our vertical integration enables us to produce many of the components used in the manufacturing of our products. We manufacture hoist lifting chain, steel forged gear blanks, lift wheels, trolley wheels, overhead light rail workstations, and hooks and other attachments for incorporation into our hoist products. These products are also sold as spare parts for hoist repair. Additionally, our hoists are used as components in the manufacture of crane systems by us as well as our crane-builder customers. We also manufacture electronic systems to control cranes, hoists and various other powered equipment. 

&#160; 

Environmental and Other Governmental Regulation 

&#160; 

Like most manufacturing companies, we are subject to various federal, state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment. To address the requirements of such laws, we have adopted a corporate environmental protection policy which provides that all of our owned or leased facilities shall, and all of our employees have the duty to comply with all applicable environmental regulatory standards, and we have initiated an environmental auditing program for our facilities to ensure compliance with such regulatory standards. We have also established managerial responsibilities and internal communication channels for dealing with environmental compliance issues that may arise in the course of our business. We have made and could be required to continue to make significant expenditures to comply with environmental requirements. Because of the complexity and changing nature of environmental regulatory standards, it is possible that situations will arise from time to time requiring us to incur additional expenditures to ensure environmental regulatory compliance. However, we are not aware of any environmental condition or any operation at any of our facilities, either individually or in the aggregate, which would cause expenditures having a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 

&#160; 

We notified the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources (the &#8220;DENR&#8221;) in April 2006 of the presence of certain contaminants in excess of regulatory standards at our facility in Wadesboro, North Carolina. We filed an application with the DENR to enter its voluntary cleanup program and were accepted. We investigated under the supervision of a DENR Registered Environmental Consultant (&#8220;the REC&#8221;) and have commenced voluntary clean-up at the facility. At this time, additional remediation costs are not expected to exceed the accrued balance of $47,000. 

&#160; 

We have been a part of the Pendleton Site PRP Group since about 1993. Many years ago, we sent pickle liquor wastes from Tonawanda, NY to the Pendleton Site for treatment and disposal. The Pendleton Site PRP Group signed an Order on Consent with the NYS DEC in 1996 and the cleanup was concluded in the early 2000s. The Order on Consent required a post-construction operation and maintenance period of 30 years and we are required to pay our share of the costs associated with the operation and maintenance period. These annual costs are approximately $50,000 of which we pay 13.4% or $6,700. Reserves on the books are sufficient to cover these costs for the remainder of the operations and maintenance period. 

Our recently acquired subsidiary Magnetek has also been identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and certain state agencies as a potentially responsible party for cleanup costs associated with alleged past waste disposal practices at several previously utilized, owned or leased facilities and offsite locations. Its remediation activities as a potentially responsible party were not material in fiscal year 2016. Although the materiality of future expenditures for environmental activities may be affected by the level and type of contamination, the extent and nature of cleanup activities required by governmental authorities, the nature of Magnetek's alleged connection to the contaminated sites, the number and financial resources of other potentially responsible parties, the availability of indemnification rights against third parties and the identification of additional contaminated sites, Magnetek's estimated share of liability, if any, for environmental remediation, including its indemnification obligations, is not expected to be material. 

In 1986, Magnetek acquired the stock of Universal Manufacturing Corporation (&#8220;Universal&#8221;) from a predecessor of Fruit of the Loom (&#8220;FOL&#8221;), and the predecessor agreed to indemnify Magnetek against certain environmental liabilities arising from pre-acquisition activities at a facility in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Environmental liabilities covered by the indemnification agreement included completion of additional cleanup activities, if any, at the Bridgeport facility and defense and indemnification against liability for potential response costs related to offsite disposal locations. Magnetek's leasehold interest in the Bridgeport facility was assigned to the buyer in connection with the sale of Magnetek's transformer business in June 2001. FOL, the successor to the indemnification obligation, filed a petition for Reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in 1999 and Magnetek filed a proof of claim in the proceeding for obligations related to the environmental indemnification agreement. Magnetek believes that FOL had substantially completed the clean-up obligations required by the indemnification agreement prior to the bankruptcy filing. In November 2001, Magnetek and FOL entered into an agreement involving the allocation of certain potential tax benefits and Magnetek withdrew its claims in the bankruptcy proceeding. We believe that FOL's obligation to the state of Connecticut was not discharged in the reorganization proceeding. 

In January 2007, the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection (&#8220;DEP&#8221;) requested parties, including Magnetek, to submit reports summarizing the investigations and remediation performed to date at the site and the proposed additional investigations and remediation necessary to complete those actions at the site. DEP requested additional information relating to site investigations and remediation. Magnetek and the DEP agreed to the scope of the work plan in November 2010. The Company has recorded a liability of $422,000 , included in the amount specified above, related to the Bridgeport facility, representing the best estimate of future site investigation costs and remediation costs which are expected to be incurred in the future. 

FOL's inability to satisfy its remaining obligations to the state of Connecticut related to the Bridgeport facility and any offsite disposal locations, or the discovery of additional environmental contamination at the Bridgeport facility is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, cash flows or results of operations. 

The Company has recorded total liabilities of $890,000 for all environmental matters related to Magnetek in the consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2016 on an undiscounted basis. 

For all of the currently known environmental matters, we have accrued as of March 31, 2016 a total of $1,153,000 which, in our opinion, is sufficient to deal with such matters. Further, we believe that the environmental matters known to, or anticipated by us should not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition. However, there can be no assurance that potential liabilities and expenditures associated with unknown environmental matters, unanticipated events, or future compliance with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us. 

Our operations are also governed by many other laws and regulations, including those relating to workplace safety and worker health, principally OSHA in the U.S. and others outside the U.S. and regulations thereunder. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these laws and regulations and do not believe that future compliance with such laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, or liquidity.
