&#160; 

Distribution 

&#160; 

3M products are sold through numerous distribution channels, including directly to users and through numerous wholesalers, retailers, jobbers, distributors and dealers in a wide variety of trades in many countries around the world. Management believes the confidence of wholesalers, retailers, jobbers, distributors and dealers in 3M and its products &#8212; a confidence developed through long association with skilled marketing and sales representatives &#8212; has contributed significantly to 3M&#8217;s position in the marketplace and to its growth. 

&#160; 

Research and Patents 

&#160; 

Research and product development constitutes an important part of 3M&#8217;s activities and has been a major driver of 3M&#8217;s sales and profit growth. Research, development and related expenses totaled $1.7 63 billion in 2015, $1.770 billion in 2014 and $1.715 billion in 2013. Research and development, covering basic scientific &#160; research and the application of scientific advances in the development of new and improved products and their uses, totaled $1. 22 3 billion in 2015, $1.193 billion in 2014 and $1.150 billion in 2013. Related expenses primarily include technical support ; internally developed patent costs, which include costs and fees incurred to prepare, file, secure and maintain patents; amortization of externally acquired patents and externally acquired in-process research and development; and gains/losses associated with certain corporate approved investments in R&#38;D-related ventures, such as equity method effects and impairments. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s products are sold around the world under various trademarks. The Company also owns, or holds licenses to use, numerous U.S. and foreign patents. The Company&#8217;s research and development activities generate a steady stream of inventions that are covered by new patents. Patents applicable to specific products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or patent grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. 

&#160; 

The Company believes that its patents provide an important competitive advantage in many of its businesses. In general, no single patent or group of related patents is in itself essential to the Company as a whole or to any of the Company&#8217;s business segments. The importance of patents in the Electronics and Energy segment is described in &#8220;Performance by Business Segment&#8221; &#8212; &#8220;Electronics and Energy Business&#8221; in Part II, Item 7, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

Raw Materials 

&#160; 

In 2015 , the Company experienced declining costs for most raw material categories and transportation fuel , due largely to the significant price decreases in crude oil . This in turn dr ove year-on-year cost decreases in many feedstock categories, including petroleum based materials, minerals, metals and wood pulp based products. To date, the Company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. It is impossible to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have. 3M has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories and development and qualification of additional supply sources. 3M manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and forward contracts. 

&#160; 

Environmental Law Compliance 

&#160; 

3M&#8217;s manufacturing operations are affected by national, state and local environmental laws around the world. 3M has made, and plans to continue making, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws. 3M is also involved in remediation actions relating to environmental matters from past operations at certain sites (refer to &#8220;Environmental Matters and Litigation&#8221; in Note 1 4 , Commitments and Contingencies). 

&#160; 

Environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed. Reserves for liabilities for anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies, the Company&#8217;s commitment to a plan of action, or approval by regulatory agencies. Environmental expenditures for capital 

&#160;

&#160; 

projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. 

&#160; 

In 2015 , 3M expended about $ 26 million for capital projects related to protecting the environment. This amount excludes expenditures for remediation actions relating to existing matters caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues, which are expensed. Capital expenditures for environmental purposes have included pollution control devices &#8212; such as wastewater treatment plant improvements, scrubbers, containment structures, solvent recovery units and thermal oxidizers &#8212; at new and existing facilities constructed or upgraded in the normal course of business. Consistent with the Company&#8217;s emphasis on environmental responsibility, capital expenditures (other than for remediation projects) for known projects are presently expected to be about $51 million over the next two years for new or expanded programs to build facilities or modify manufacturing processes to minimize waste and reduce emissions. 

&#160; 

While the Company cannot predict with certainty the future costs of such cleanup activities, capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance, the Company does not believe they will have a material effect on its capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. 

&#160;
