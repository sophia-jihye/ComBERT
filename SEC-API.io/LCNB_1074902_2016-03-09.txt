Once primarily a rural county (its population according to the 1950 census was only 38,505), Warren County experienced significant growth during the latter half of the twentieth century and into the twenty-first century. Many people who now live in Warren County are employed by companies located in the Cincinnati and Dayton metropolitan areas. A sizable tourist industry that includes King&#8217;s Island, the Beach Waterpark, and the Ohio Renaissance Festival provides a number of temporary summer jobs. Not including local government entities and school districts, which are significant sources of employment, the top five major employers in Warren County are Macy&#8217;s Credit and Customer Service, Procter &#38; Gamble&#8217;s Mason Business Center, Atrium Health Center Mason, WellPoint (health insurance), and Luxottica. 

Butler County was historically a rural area with the exception of three urban centers. Hamilton and Middletown were both manufacturing centers. As is true with many manufacturing communities in the Midwest, many of the manufacturing companies in Hamilton and Middletown have either closed or greatly diminished their workforces and these jobs have been largely replaced with lower-paying service oriented jobs. Oxford is the home of Miami University and Oxford&#8217;s businesses primarily serve the college students. 

Most of the growth in Butler County has occurred in West Chester, Liberty, and Fairfield Townships. Many of the people living in these townships are employed by companies located in the Cincinnati metropolitan area. Not including local government entities and school districts, the top five major employers in Butler County are Miami University, AK Steel, Cincinnati Financial Corp. (insurance), GE Aviation, and Liberty Mutual Group (insurance). Fort Hamilton Hospital, Mercy Hospital Fairfield, McCullough-Hyde Memorial Hospital, West Chester Hospital, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Liberty Campus, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Fairfield, and Bethesda Butler Hospital are located in Butler County and collectively are a significant source of health-related employment. 

Clinton County remains mostly rural. Wilmington, with a 2010 census population of 12,520, is the largest city. The next largest is Blanchester, with a 2010 census population of 4,243. The unemployment rates for December 2013 through December 2015 are unusually high because of the loss of a dominant employer. DHL, an overnight shipping company, owned the Wilmington Air Park, a decommissioned air force base, and maintained hub operations at this location. In 2008, Wilmington Air Park discontinued operations, resulting in the direct loss of approximately 8,000 jobs, not including job losses sustained by other businesses dependent on the air park operations. Certain services subcontracted to ABX Air and ASTAR Air Cargo continue, but with greatly diminished work forces.

LCNB CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Preble County is mostly rural. Eaton, with a 2010 census population of 8,407, is the only city in the county. Major employers are Neaton Auto Products Manufacturing Inc., Henny Penny Corporation, Parker-Hannifin Corporation, SILFEX, a division of Lam Research Corp., and Wal-Mart. 

Ross and Fayette Counties are both primarily rural. Chillicothe, with a 2010 census population of 21,901, is the largest city in Ross County and Washington Court House, with a 2010 census population of 14,192, is the largest city in Fayette County. Not including local government entities and school districts, major employers in Ross County include Adena Regional Medical Center, Kenworth Truck Company (assembler of heavy trucks), Veterans Affairs Medical Center, P.H. Glatfelter Company (formerly Mead Corp.), the Ross Correctional Institution, and the Chillicothe Correctional Institution. 

Hamilton County&#8217;s economics are dominated by Cincinnati. Fortune 500 companies with their headquarters in Hamilton County include American Financial Group, Macy's, Inc., Fifth Third Bank, The Kroger Company, The Procter &#38; Gamble Company, and Western &#38; Southern Financial Group. The five largest employers are The Kroger Company, The University of Cincinnati, The Procter &#38; Gamble Company, Cincinnati Children&#8217;s Hospital Medical Center, and TriHealth Inc. 

LCNB&#8217;s four offices in Montgomery County are located in the communities of Oakwood, Centerville and Brookville. Similar to Cincinnati and Hamilton County, Dayton is the largest city in Montgomery County and dominates the economic demographics of the county. The largest employer of Montgomery County residents is Wright Patterson Air Force Base, which is actually located in Greene County. Large employers located in Montgomery County include Premier Health Partners, Kettering Health Network, The Kroger Company, LexisNexis, and Sinclair Community College. 

LCNB&#8217;s market area includes a portion of Clermont County primarily because of a branch office located in Goshen, Ohio. Goshen is a suburb of Cincinnati and many of its residents work in Hamilton County. Goshen&#8217;s economic demographics are similar to Hamilton County&#8217;s demographics. 

Competition 

The Bank faces strong competition both in making loans and attracting deposits. The deregulation of the banking industry and the wide spread enactment of state laws that permit multi-bank holding companies as well as the availability of nationwide interstate banking has created a highly competitive environment for financial services providers. The Bank competes with other national and state banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, finance companies, mortgage brokerage firms, realty companies with captive mortgage brokerage firms, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking companies, and other financial intermediaries operating in its market and elsewhere, many of whom have substantially larger financial and managerial resources. 

The Bank seeks to minimize the competitive effect of other financial institutions through a community banking approach that emphasizes direct customer access to the Bank's President and other officers in an environment conducive to friendly, informed, and courteous personal services. Management believes that the Bank is well positioned to compete successfully in its primary market area. Competition among financial institutions is based upon interest rates offered on deposit accounts, interest rates charged on loans and other credit and service charges, the quality and scope of the services rendered, the convenience of the banking facilities, and, in the case of loans to commercial borrowers, relative lending limits. 

Management believes the commitment of the Bank to personal service, innovation, and involvement in the communities and primary market areas it serves, as well as its commitment to quality community banking service, are factors that contribute to its competitive advantage. 

Supervision and Regulation 

LCNB Corp., as a financial holding company, is regulated under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "Act"), and is subject to the supervision and examination of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve Board"). 

The Bank is subject to the provisions of the National Bank Act. The Bank is subject to primary supervision, regulation and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the "OCC"). The Bank is also subject to the rules and regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the FDIC. 

- 7 - 

LCNB CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

LCNB Corp. and the Bank are subject to an extensive array of banking laws and regulations that are intended primarily for the protection of the customers and depositors of LCNB's subsidiary. These laws and regulations govern such areas as permissible activities, loans and investments, and rates of interest that can be charged on loans and reserves. LCNB and the Bank also are subject to general U.S. federal laws and regulations and to the laws and regulations of the State of Ohio. Set forth below are brief descriptions of selected laws and regulations applicable to LCNB and the Bank. 

The Financial Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 ("FIRREA") provides that a holding company and its controlled insured depository institutions are liable for any loss incurred by the FDIC in connection with the default of any FDIC assisted transaction involving an affiliated insured bank or savings association. 

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA") substantially revised the bank regulatory and funding provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and several other federal banking statutes. Among its many reforms, FDICIA, as amended: 

1. 

Required regulatory agencies to take "prompt corrective action" with financial institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements; 

&#160; 

2. 

Established five capital tiers: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized; 

3. 

Imposed significant restrictions on the operations of a financial institution that is not rated well-capitalized or adequately capitalized; 

4. 

Prohibited a depository institution from making any capital distributions, including payments of dividends or paying any management fee to its holding company, if the institution would be undercapitalized as a result; 

&#160; 

5. 

Implemented a risk-based premium system; 

6. 

Required an audit committee to be comprised of outside directors; 

&#160; 

7. 

Required a financial institution with more than $1 billion in total assets to issue annual, audited financial statements prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; and 

8. 

Required a financial institution with more than $1 billion in total assets to document, evaluate, and report on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control system and required an independent public accountant to attest to management's assertions concerning the bank's internal control system. 

The members of an audit committee for banks with more than $1 billion in total assets must be independent of management. Only a majority, rather than all, of the members of an audit committee for banks with total assets between $500 million and $1 billion must be independent. FDICIA does not relieve financial institutions that are public companies, such as LCNB, from internal control reporting and attestation requirements or audit committee independence requirements prescribed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (see below). 

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which amended the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and other banking related laws, was signed into law on November 12, 1999. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act repealed certain sections of the Glass-Steagall Act and substantially eliminated the barriers separating the banking, insurance, and securities industries. Effective March 11, 2000, qualifying bank holding companies could elect to become financial holding companies. Financial holding companies have expanded investment powers, including affiliating with securities and insurance firms and engaging in other activities that are "financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity," as defined in the act, or "complementary to a financial activity." 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("SOX") became effective on July 30, 2002. The purpose of SOX is to strengthen accounting oversight and corporate accountability by enhancing disclosure requirements, increasing accounting and auditor regulation, creating new federal crimes, and increasing penalties for existing federal crimes. SOX directly impacts publicly traded companies, certified public accounting firms auditing public companies, attorneys who work for public companies or have public companies as clients, brokerage firms, investment bankers, and financial analysts who work for brokerage firms or investment bankers. Key provisions affecting LCNB include: 

- 8 - 

LCNB CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

&#160; 

1. 

Certification of financial reports by the chief executive officer ("CEO") and the chief financial officer ("CFO"), who are responsible for designing and monitoring internal controls to ensure that material information relating to the issuer and its consolidated subsidiaries is made known to the certifying officers by others within the company; 

2. 

Inclusion of an internal control report in annual reports that include management's assessment of the effectiveness of a company's internal control over financial reporting and a report by the company's independent registered public accounting firm attesting to the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting; 

&#160; 

3. 

Accelerated reporting of stock trades on Form 4 by directors and executive officers; 

&#160; 

4. 

Disgorgement requirements of incentive pay or stock-based compensation profits received within twelve months of the release of financial statements if the company is later required to restate those financial statements due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement that resulted from misconduct; 

5. 

Disclosure in a company's periodic reports stating if it has adopted a code of ethics for its CFO and principal accounting officer or controller and, if such code of ethics has been implemented, immediate disclosure of any change in or waiver of the code of ethics; 

6. 

Disclosure in a company's periodic reports stating if at least one member of the audit committee is a "financial expert," as that term is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"); and 

7. 

Implementation of new duties and responsibilities for a company's audit committee, including independence requirements, the direct responsibility to appoint the outside auditing firm and to provide oversight of the auditing firm's work, and a requirement to establish procedures for the receipt, retention, and treatment of complaints from a company's employees regarding questionable accounting, internal control, or auditing matters. 

In addition, the SEC adopted final rules on September 5, 2002, which rules were amended in December, 2005, requiring accelerated filing of quarterly and annual reports. Under the amended rules, &#8220;large accelerated filers&#8221; includes companies with a market capitalization of $700 million or more and &#8220;accelerated filers&#8221; includes companies with a market capitalization between $75 million and $700 million. Large accelerated filers are required to file their annual reports within 60 days of year-end and quarterly reports within 40 days. Accelerated filers are required to file their annual and quarterly reports within 75 days and 40 days, respectively. These new accelerated filing deadlines were effective for fiscal years ending on or after December 15, 2005. Under the amended rules, LCNB is considered an accelerated filer. 

The Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 and the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Conforming Amendments Act of 2005 (collectively, the &#8220;Deposit Insurance Reform Acts&#8221;) were both signed into law during February, 2006. The provisions of the Deposit Insurance Reform Acts included: 

1. 

Merging the Bank Insurance Fund and the Savings Association Insurance Fund into a new fund called the Deposit Insurance Fund, effective March 31, 2006; 

2. 

Increasing insurance coverage for retirement accounts from $100,000 to $250,000, effective April 1, 2006; and 

3. 

Eliminating a 1.25% hard target Designated Reserve Ratio, as defined, and giving the FDIC discretion to set the Designated Reserve Ratio within a range of 1.15% to 1.50% for any given year. 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) became effective on July 21, 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act includes provisions that specifically affect financial institutions and other entities providing financial services and other corporate governance and compensation provisions that will affect most public companies. 

- 9 - 

LCNB CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

The Dodd-Frank Act established a new independent regulatory body within the Federal Reserve System known as the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (the &#8220;Bureau&#8221;). The Bureau has assumed responsibility for most consumer protection laws and has broad authority, with certain exceptions, to regulate financial products offered by banks and non-banks. The Bureau has authority to supervise, examine, and take enforcement actions with respect to depository institutions with more than $10 billion in assets, non-bank mortgage industry participants, and other Bureau-designated non-bank providers of consumer financial services. The primary regulator for depository institutions with $10 billion or less in assets will continue to have primary examination and enforcement authority for these institutions. The regulations enforced, however, will be the regulations written by the Bureau. 

The Dodd-Frank Act directs federal bank regulators to develop new capital requirements for holding companies and depository institutions that address activities that pose risk to the financial system, such as significant activities in higher risk areas, or concentrations in assets whose reported values are based on models. 

The Dodd-Frank Act permanently raised the FDIC maximum deposit insurance amount to $250,000. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act places a floor on the FDIC&#8217;s reserve ratio at 1.35% of estimated insured deposits or the comparable percentage of the assessment base. 

General corporate governance provisions included in the Dodd-Frank Act include expanding executive compensation disclosures to be included in the annual proxy statement, requiring non-binding shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation at annual meetings, enhancing independence requirements for compensation committee members and any advisers used by the compensation committee, and requiring the adoption of certain compensation policies including the recovery of executive compensation in the event of a financial statement restatement. 

Noncompliance with laws and regulations by bank holding companies and banks can lead to monetary penalties and/or an increased level of supervision or a combination of these two items. Management is not aware of any current significant instances of noncompliance with laws and regulations and does not anticipate any problems maintaining compliance on a prospective basis. Recent regulatory inspections and examinations of LCNB and the Bank have not disclosed any significant instances of noncompliance. 

The earnings and growth of LCNB are affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve Board. Its policies influence the amount of bank loans and deposits and the interest rates charged and paid thereon and thus have an effect on earnings. The nature of future monetary policies and the effect of such policies on the future business and earnings of LCNB and the Bank cannot be predicted. 

A substantial portion of LCNB's cash revenues is derived from dividends paid by the Bank. These dividends are subject to various legal and regulatory restrictions. Generally, dividends are limited to the aggregate of current year retained net income, as defined, plus the retained net income of the two prior years. In addition, dividend payments may not reduce capital levels below minimum regulatory guidelines. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , LCNB employed 280 &#32;full-time equivalent employees. LCNB is not a party to any collective bargaining agreement. Management considers its relationship with its employees to be very good. Employee benefit programs are considered by management to be competitive with benefit programs provided by other financial institutions and major employers within LCNB&#8217;s market area. 

Divestitures 

In March 2011, LCNB Corp. sold Dakin Insurance Agency Inc. (&#8220;Dakin&#8221;) to an independent insurance agency and therefore its financial results are reported in the income statements as income from discontinued operations, net of tax.

LCNB CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Loan Portfolio 

Administration of the lending function is the responsibility of the Chief Lending Officer and certain senior lenders. Lenders perform their duties subject to oversight and policy direction from the Board of Directors and the Loan Committee. The Loan Committee consists of LCNB&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer, Cashier, Chief Lending Officer, Chief Credit Officer, Loan Operations Officer, Loan Review Officer, Credit Analysis Officer, and the officers in charge of commercial, consumer, and real estate loans. 

Employees authorized to accept loan applications have various, designated lending limits for the approval of loans. A loan application for an amount outside a particular employee&#8217;s lending limit needs to be approved by an employee with a lending limit sufficient for that loan. Residential and commercial real estate loans of any amount require the approval of two of the following designated officers: Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Lending Officer, Chief Credit Officer, and the officers in charge of commercial, real estate, and consumer lending. Any loan in excess of $3.0 million or with policy exceptions needs the approval of the Board of Directors. 

Interest rates charged by LCNB vary with degree of risk, type of loan, amount, complexity, repricing frequency and other relevant factors associated with the loan. 

The following table summarizes the distribution of the loan portfolio for the years indicated:

LCNB is not committed to lend additional funds to debtors whose loans have been modified to provide a reduction or deferral of principal or interest because of deterioration in the financial position of the borrower. 

At December 31, 2015 , there were no material additional loans not classified as acquired credit impaired or already disclosed as non-accrual, accruing restructured, or accruing past due 90 days or more where known information about possible credit problems of the borrowers causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with present loan repayment terms.
