 ITEM 1. BUSINESS . 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

Vista Gold Corp. and its subsidiaries (collectively, &#8220;Vista,&#8221; the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; or &#8220;us&#8221;) are engaged in the gold mining industry. We are focused on the evaluation, acquisition, exploration and advancement of gold exploration and potential development projects which may lead to gold production or value adding strategic transactions such as earn-in right agreements, option agreements, royalty agreements, leases to third parties, joint venture arrangements with other mining companies, or outright sales of assets for cash and/or other consideration. We look for opportunities to improve the value of our gold projects through exploration drilling and/or technical studies focused on optimizing previous engineering work. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s flagship asset is its 100% owned Mt Todd gold project (&#8220;Mt Todd&#8221;) in Northern Territory (&#8220;NT&#8221;), Australia . Completion of a feasibility study or the development of the project is not justified at this time due to the current low gold price. With the completion of the environmental impact statement (&#8220;EIS&#8221;) in 2014 and the previous completion of a significant amount of the project engineering and design, much of which is contained in the previously 

&#160;

released preliminary feasibility study, management believes that the permitting risk is substantially reduced and the potential development timeline at Mt Todd is well defined. We believe that we are well positioned, subject to sustained improvement in gold prices, to move forward quickly with the completion of the Mt Todd feasibility study. At the time the May 2013 PFS was completed, because of the high level of detail in the work completed for the study, it was estimated that the feasibility study could be completed within six months of its start at a cost of approximately $2,500. 

&#160; 

We do not currently generate cash flows from mining operations. The prices for gold equities, particularly those with early stage projects, have decreased significantly during the past few years, and capital raising on reasonable terms has become more difficult for mining companies which do not have producing assets. These market conditions are expected to continue for the foreseeable future, and could affect our ability to raise sufficient capital to advance Mt Todd on reasonable terms, if at all. 

&#160; 

Since 2013 we have raised sufficient cash to operate our business without share dilution, and we have significantly reduced our costs to strengthen our balance sheet and mitigate the effects of these difficult markets. We believe we have sufficient cash to fund our currently planned programs into 2018, while retaining opportunities to access additional financing from non-dilutive sources such as the sale of our used mill equipment and monetization of other non-core assets. 

&#160; 

We plan to continue to evaluate and execute programs that could position us to quickly advance Mt Todd to development when economic conditions permit. In addition, with our improved treasury and strong management team we are in a position to judiciously evaluate and pursue other near-term value creating opportunities. 

&#160;

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had 1 3 employees globally. In addition, we use consultants with specific skills to assist with various aspects of our project evaluation, due diligence, corporate governance and property management. 

&#160; 

Geographic and Segment Information 

&#160; 

We have one reportable segment, consisting of evaluation, acquisition and exploration activities which are focused principally in Australia and North America. We evaluate, acquire, explore and advance gold exploration and potential development projects, which may lead to gold production or value adding strategic transactions. These activities are focused principally in Australia and North America. We reported no operating revenues during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 . Geographic location of mineral properties and plant and equipment is provided in Notes 4 &#8211; Mineral Properties and 5 &#8211; Plant and Equipment to our Consolidated Financial Statements under the section heading &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; below 

&#160; 

Significant Developments in 2015 

&#160; 

In 2015, the Company received an A$13,470 ($10,220) Research &#38; Development (&#8220;R&#38;D&#8221;) Tax Incentive refund, net of costs to prepare and file . &#160; These amounts were paid under the Australian Government&#8217;s R&#38;D Tax Incentive Program, a program designed to encourage industry to engage in R&#38;D activities that benefit Australia; and relate to costs we incurred during the 2012 and 2013 fiscal years for qualifying R&#38;D programs. This R&#38;D Tax Incentive program is a self-assessment process, and as such, the Australian Government has the right to review the qualifying programs and expenditures for a period of four years. &#160; 

&#160; 

In March 2015, we sold 8,000,000 Midas Gold Corp . common shares (&#8220;Midas Gold Shares&#8221;) for net proceeds of $2,772. 

&#160; 

&#160;

In January 2015, the Company amended the payment terms for the sale of its 100% interest in the Los Cardones gold project in Baja California Sur, Mexico. Under the amended terms the Company accepted a final payment of $2,994, net of legal costs, for the project. 

&#160; 

See the section heading &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8221;, below. 

&#160; 

Reclamation 

&#160; 

We generally will be required to mitigate long-term environmental impacts by stabilizing, contouring, re-sloping and revegetating various portions of a site after mining and mineral processing operations are completed. These reclamation efforts would be conducted in accordance with detailed plans, which must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies. 

&#160; 

The Mt Todd site was not reclaimed when the mine closed in the late 1990&#8217;s. Liability for the reclamation of the environmental conditions existing prior to Vista&#8217;s involvement with the project remains the responsibility of the NT Government until 30 days after we have provided notice to the NT Government that we intend to take over and assume the management , operation and rehabilitation of Mt Todd . Vista will not give such notice until a production decision has been made, the project is fully permitted to construct the mine, and the necessary financing for construction has been arranged. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

Our exploration and development activities are subject to various national, state, provincial and local laws and regulations in the United States, Mexico, Australia, and other jurisdictions, which govern prospecting, development, mining, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, hazardous substances and other matters. We have obtained or have pending applications for those licenses, permits or other authorizations currently required to conduct our exploration and other programs. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable mining, health, safety and environmental statutes and regulations in all of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Management of the Company is not aware of any current orders or directions relating to us with respect to the foregoing laws and regulations. 

&#160; 

Australia Laws 

&#160; 

Mineral projects in the Northern Territory are subject to Australian federal and Northern Territory laws and regulations regarding environmental matters and the discharge of hazardous wastes and materials. As with all mining projects, Mt Todd would be expected to have a variety of environmental impacts should development proceed. We are required under Australian laws and regulations (federal, state and territorial) to acquire permits and other authorizations before Mt Todd can be developed and mined. In Australia, environmental legislation plays a significant role in the mining industry. Various environmental documents, such as the Mt Todd EIS, covering studies on inter alia , air, water, pollution, hazardous and toxic wastes, reclamation of mining area, etc., must be prepared and submitted to the Northern Territory Minister for Mines &#38; Energy and Environment and the Australian Government Minister For Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities for approval. During September 2014, the EIS for Mt Todd was approved. The Environmental Protection Agency of the Northern Territory Government (&#8220; NTEPA &#8221;) has advised that it has assessed the environmental impacts of the Mt Todd gold mine and concluded that it can proceed, subject to a number of recommendations which are outlined in the assessment report. We must also comply with Aboriginal heritage legislation requirements, which require heritage survey work to be undertaken prior to the commencement of mining operations. All these recommendations/conditions may result in the occurrence of significant pre-production costs and may delay potential production at &#160; Mt Todd . 

&#160; 

Environmental Regulation 

&#160; 

Our projects are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing protection of the environment. These laws are continually changing and, in general, are becoming more restrictive. Our policy is to conduct business in 

&#160;

a way that safeguards public health and the environment. We believe that our operations are conducted in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations. 

&#160; 

Changes to current local, state or federal laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate could require additional capital expenditures and increased operating and/or reclamation costs. W e are unable to predict what additional legislation, if any, might be proposed or enacted, and additional regulatory requirements could impact the economics of our projects. 

&#160; 

During 2015 , none of our project sites had any material non-compliance occurrences with any applicable environmental regulations. &#160; 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We compete with other mining companies in connection with the acquisition, exploration, financing and development of gold properties. There is competition for the limited number of gold acquisition and exploration opportunities, some of which is with other companies having substantially greater financial resources than we have. As a result, we may have difficulty acquiring attractive gold projects at reasonable prices. We use consultants and compete with other mining companies for the man hours of consulting time required to complete our studies. We also compete with other mining companies for mining engineers, geologists and other skilled personnel in the mining industry and for exploration and development services. 

&#160; 

Gold Price History 

&#160; 

The price of gold is volatile and is affected by numerous factors, all of which are beyond our control, such as the sale or purchase of gold by various central banks and financial institutions, inflation, recession, fluctuation in the relative values of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies, changes in global gold demand and political and economic conditions.
