 Item 1. BUSINESS &#160; 

Introduction 

Granite Construction Company was originally incorporated in 1922. In 1990, Granite Construction Incorporated was formed as the holding company for Granite Construction Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and was incorporated in Delaware. Unless otherwise indicated, the terms &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;Company&#8221; and &#8220;Granite&#8221; refer to Granite Construction Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries. 

We deliver infrastructure solutions for public and private clients in North America. We are one of the largest diversified heavy civil contractors and construction materials producers in the United States. We operate nationwide, serving both public and private sector clients. Within the public sector, we primarily concentrate on heavy-civil infrastructure projects, including the construction of streets, roads, highways, mass transit facilities, airport infrastructure, bridges, trenchless and underground utilities, power-related facilities, water and wastewater facilities, utilities, tunnels, dams and other infrastructure-related projects. Within the private sector, we perform site preparation and infrastructure services for residential development, energy development, commercial and industrial sites, and other facilities, as well as provide construction management professional services. 

We own and lease substantial aggregate reserves and own a number of plant facilities to produce construction materials for use in our construction business and for sale to third parties. We also have one of the largest contractor-owned heavy construction equipment fleets in the United States. We believe that the ownership of a certain amount of these assets enables us to compete more effectively by ensuring availability of these resources at a favorable cost. 

Operating Structure 

Our business is organized into three reportable business segments. These business segments are: Construction, Large Project Construction and Construction Materials. See Note 19 of &#8220;Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#8221; for additional information about our reportable business segments. 

In addition to business segments, we review our business by operating groups and by public and private market sectors. Our operating groups are defined as follows: (i) California; (ii) Northwest, which primarily includes offices in Alaska, Arizona, Nevada, Utah and Washington; (iii) Heavy Civil, which primarily includes offices in California, Florida, New York and Texas; and (iv) Kenny, which primarily includes an office in Illinois. Each of these operating groups may include financial results from our Construction and Large Project Construction segments. A project&#8217;s results are reported in the operating group that is responsible for the project, not necessarily the geographic area where the work is located. In some cases, the operations of an operating group include the results of work performed outside of that geographic region. Our California and Northwest operating groups include financial results from our Construction Materials segment.

&#160; 

&#160; 

Construction: &#32;Revenue from our Construction segment was $1.3 billion &#32;and $1.2 billion &#32;( 53.3% &#32;and 52.1% &#32;of our total revenue) in 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. Revenue from our Construction segment is derived from both public and private sector clients. The Construction segment performs construction management, as well as various civil construction projects with a large portion of the work focused on new construction and improvement of streets, roads, highways, bridges, site work, underground, power-related facilities, water-related facilities, utilities and other infrastructure projects. These projects are typically bid-build and construction management projects completed within two years with a contract value of less than $75 million. 

Large Project Construction: Revenue from our Large Project Construction segment was $812.7 million &#32;and $825.0 million &#32;( 34.3% &#32;and 36.3% &#32;of our total revenue) in 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. The Large Project Construction segment focuses on large, complex infrastructure projects which typically have a longer duration than our Construction segment work. These projects include major highways, mass transit facilities, bridges, tunnels, waterway locks and dams, pipelines, canals, power-related facilities, water-related facilities, utilities and airport infrastructure. This segment primarily includes bid-build, design-build and construction management/general contractor contracts, together with various contract methods relating to public-private partnerships, generally with contract values in excess of $75 million. 

We utilize the design-build construction management/general contractor, construction management at-risk, and other alternative procurement methods of project delivery. Unlike traditional projects where owners first hire a design firm or design a project themselves and then put the project out to bid for construction, design-build projects provide the owner with a single point of responsibility and a single contact for both final design and construction. Although design-build projects carry additional risk as compared to traditional bid/build projects, the profit potential can also be higher. Under the construction management/general contractor method of delivery, we contract with owners to manage the design phase of the contract with the understanding that we will negotiate a contract on the construction phase when the design nears completion. Revenue from alternative procurement method projects represented 83.6% &#32;and 74.5% of Large Project Construction revenue in 2015 and 2014 , respectively. 

We participate in joint ventures with other construction companies mainly on projects in our Large Project Construction segment. Joint ventures are typically used for large, technically complex projects, including design-build projects, where it is necessary or desirable to share risk and resources. Joint venture partners typically provide independently prepared estimates, shared financing and equipment, and often bring local knowledge and expertise. For more information see the &#8220;Joint Ventures&#8221; section below. 

Construction Materials: Revenue from our Construction Materials segment was $295.6 million &#32;and $263.8 million &#32;( 12.5% &#32;and 11.6% &#32;of our total revenue) in 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. The Construction Materials segment mines and processes aggregates and operates plants that produce construction materials for internal use and for sale to third parties. We have significant aggregate reserves that we own or lease through long-term leases. Sales to our construction projects represented 31.6% &#32;of our gross sales during 2015 , and ranged from 30.5% &#32;to 44.7% over the last five years. The remainder is sold to third parties. 

During 2013 and in connection with our 2010 Enterprise Improvement Plan (&#8220;EIP&#8221;), we recorded $14.7 million in restructuring charges related to non-performing quarry sites and incurred $3.2 million in lease termination charges, both related to the Construction Materials segment. In addition, during 2013 as part of the EIP we recorded $31.1 million of restructuring charges, including amounts attributable to non-controlling interests of $3.9 million, related to consolidated real estate assets. During 2015, we recorded restructuring gains of $5.0 million , including amounts attributable to non-controlling interests of $3.3 million , and $1.0 million &#32;from the sale of the consolidated real estate assets and the sale of a previously impaired quarry site, respectively. During 2014, we recorded a $1.3 million restructuring gain related to our release from the lease obligations. Separate from the EIP, we recorded $1.3 million in non-cash impairment gains and $3.2 million in non-cash impairment charges during 2014 and 2013, respectively, related to the Construction Materials segment. See Note 11 of &#8220;Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#8221; and &#8220;Restructuring and Impairment (Gains) Charges, Net&#8221; under &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; for additional information.

Business Strategy 

Our business strategy is to consistently deliver ideas, innovations and products and services to our clients to power today&#8217;s mobile society. Our most fundamental objective is to increase long-term shareholder value as measured by the appreciation of the value of our common stock over a period of time, as well as dividend payouts. In alphabetical order, the following are key factors in our ability to achieve these objectives: 

Aggregate Materials - We own and lease aggregate reserves and own processing plants that are vertically integrated into our construction operations. By ensuring availability of these resources and providing quality products, we believe we have a competitive advantage in many of our markets, as well as a source of revenue and earnings from the sale of construction materials to third parties. 

Controlled Growth - We intend to grow our business by working on many types of infrastructure projects, as well as by expanding into new geographic areas organically and through acquisitions. In addition, our financial strength and project experience provide us with a competitive advantage, as we focus our efforts on larger projects. 

Core Competency Focus &#160;- A core competency is to perform the myriad of tasks necessary to deliver major infrastructure projects. These projects include the building of roads, highways, bridges, dams, tunnels, mass transit facilities, airport and railroad infrastructure, underground utilities, power-related facilities, water-related facilities, materials management, construction management, staff augmentation and site preparation. This focus allows us to most effectively utilize our specialized strengths. 

Decentralized Profit Centers - Each of our operating groups is established as an individual profit center which encourages entrepreneurial activity while allowing the operating groups to benefit from centralized administrative, operational expertise and support functions. 

Diversification - To mitigate the risks inherent in the construction business as the result of general economic factors, we pursue projects: (i) in both the public and private sectors; (ii) in federal, rail, power, water and renewable energy markets; (iii) for a wide range of customers within each sector (from the federal government to small municipalities and from large corporations to individual homeowners); (iv) in diverse geographic markets; (v) that are construction management/general contractor, design-build and bid-build; (vi) at fixed price, time and materials, cost reimbursable and fixed unit price; and (vii) of various sizes, durations and complexity. In addition to pursuing opportunities with traditional project funding, we continue to evaluate other sources of project funding (e.g., public and private partnerships). 

Employee Development &#32;- We believe that our employees are the primary factor for the successful implementation of our business strategies. Significant resources are employed to attract, develop and retain extraordinary talent and fully promote each employee&#8217;s capabilities. 

Ownership of Construction Equipment &#160;- We own a large fleet of well-maintained heavy construction equipment. The ownership of a large portion of construction equipment enables us to compete more effectively by ensuring availability of the equipment at a favorable cost. 

Profit-based Incentives - Managers are incentivized with cash compensation and restricted equity awards, payable upon the attainment of pre-established annual financial and non-financial metrics. 

Selective Bidding &#160;- We focus our resources on bidding jobs that meet our selective bidding criteria, which include analyzing the risk of a potential job relative to: (i) available personnel to estimate and prepare the proposal as well as to effectively manage and build the project; (ii) the competitive environment; (iii) our experience with the type of work and with the owner; (iv) local resources and partnerships; (v) equipment resources; and (vi) the size, complexity and expected profitability of the job. 

Our operating principles include: 

Accident Prevention &#160;- We believe pro-active accident prevention is a moral obligation as well as good business. By identifying and concentrating resources to address jobsite hazards, we continually strive to eliminate our incident rates and the costs associated with accidents. 

Quality and High Ethical Standards &#160;- We believe in the importance of performing high quality work. Additionally, we believe in maintaining high ethical standards through an established code of conduct and an effective company-wide compliance program, while being guided by our Core Values at all times. 

Sustainability - Our focus on sustainability encompasses many aspects of how we conduct ourselves and practice our core values. We believe sustainability is important to our customers, employees, shareholders, and communities, and is also a long-term business driver. By focusing on specific initiatives that address social, environmental and economic challenges, we can minimize risk and increase our competitive advantage.

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Raw Materials 

We purchase raw materials, including but not limited to, aggregate products, cement, diesel and gasoline fuel, liquid asphalt, natural gas, propane and steel, from numerous sources. Our aggregate reserves supply a portion of the raw materials needed in our construction projects. The price and availability of raw materials may vary from year to year due to market conditions and production capacities. We do not foresee a lack of availability of any raw materials over the next twelve months. 

Seasonality 

Our operations are typically affected by weather conditions during the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year which may alter our construction schedules and can create variability in our revenues, profitability and the required number of employees. 

Customers 

Customers in our Construction segment include certain federal agencies, state departments of transportation, county and city public works departments, school districts and developers, utilities and owners of industrial, commercial and residential sites. Customers of our Large Project Construction segment are predominantly in the public sector and currently include various state departments of transportation, local transit authorities, utilities and federal agencies. Customers of our Construction Materials segment include internal usage by our own construction projects, as well as third-party customers. Our third party customers include, but, are not limited to, contractors, landscapers, manufacturers of products requiring aggregate materials, retailers, homeowners, farmers and brokers. 

During the year ended December 31, 2015 , our largest volume customer, including both prime and subcontractor arrangements, was the New York State Department of Transportation &#32;(&#8220; NYSDOT &#8221;). Revenue recognized from contracts with NYSDOT &#32;during 2015 &#32;represented $199.0 million &#32;( 8.4% &#32;of our total revenue), all of which was in our Large Project Construction segment ( 24.5% &#32;of segment revenue). During the years ended December 31, 2014 &#32;and 2013, our largest volume customer, including both prime and subcontractor arrangements, was the California Department of Transportation (&#8220;Caltrans&#8221;). Revenue from Caltrans represented $195.4 million &#32;( 8.6% &#32;of total revenue) in 2014 , of which $178.7 million &#32;( 15.1% &#32;of segment revenue) was in our Construction segment and $16.8 million &#32;( 2.0% &#32;of segment revenue) was in the Large Project Construction segment. Revenue from Caltrans totaled $265.8 million &#32;( 11.7% &#32;of total revenue) in 2013 , of which $239.9 million &#32;( 19.2% &#32;of segment revenue) was in the Construction segment and $25.9 million &#32;( 3.3% &#32;of segment revenue) was in the Large Project Construction segment. 

Contract Backlog 

Our contract backlog consists of the unearned revenue on awarded contracts, including 100% of our consolidated joint venture contracts and our proportionate share of unconsolidated joint venture contracts. We generally include a project in our contract backlog at the time a contract is awarded and to the extent we believe funding is probable. Certain federal government contracts where funding is appropriated on a periodic basis are included in contract backlog at the time of the award. Contracts that include unexercised contract options and unissued task orders are included in contract backlog as follows: 

Contract Options : Contract options represent the monetary value of option periods under existing contracts, which are exercisable at the option of our customers without requiring us to go through an additional competitive bidding process and would be canceled only if a customer decided to end the project (a termination for convenience) or through a termination for default. When the options are exercised and funding is in place or probable, the amount associated with the exercised option is recorded into contract backlog. 

Task Orders : Task orders represent the expected monetary value of signed master contracts under which we perform work only when the customer awards specific task orders to us. When such task orders are signed and funding is in place or probable, the amount associated with the task order is recorded into contract backlog. 

Substantially all of the contracts in our contract backlog, as well as unexercised contract options and unissued task orders, may be canceled or modified at the election of the customer; however, we have not been materially adversely affected by contract cancellations or modifications in the past (see &#8220;Contract Provisions and Subcontracting&#8221;). Many projects in our Construction segment are added to backlog and completed within the same fiscal year and therefore may not be reflected in our beginning or year-end contract backlog. Contract backlog by segment is presented in &#8220;Contract Backlog&#8221; under &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221; Our contract backlog was $2.9 billion &#32;and $2.7 billion &#32;at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 respectively. Approximately $1.5 billion &#32;of the December 31, 2015 &#32;contract backlog is expected to be completed during 2016 .

&#160; 

&#160; 

Equipment 

At December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , we owned the following number of construction equipment and vehicles: 

December 31, 

2014 

Heavy construction equipment 

2,439 

2,506 

Trucks, truck-tractors, trailers and vehicles 

3,709 

3,851 

&#160; 

Our portfolio of equipment includes backhoes, barges, bulldozers, cranes, excavators, loaders, motor graders, pavers, rollers, scrapers, trucks, special equipment for pipeline rehabilitation and tunnel boring machines that are used in our Construction, Large Project Construction and Construction Materials segments. We believe that ownership of equipment is generally preferable to leasing because it ensures the equipment is available as needed and normally results in lower costs. We pool certain equipment for use by our Construction, Large Project Construction and Construction Materials segments to maximize utilization. We continually monitor and adjust our fleet size so that it is consistent with the size of our business, considering both existing backlog and expected future work. On a short-term basis, we lease or rent equipment to supplement our portfolio of equipment in response to construction activity peaks. In 2015 &#32;and 2014 , we spent $20.0 million &#32;and $32.3 million , respectively, on purchases of construction equipment and vehicles. 

Employees 

On December 31, 2015 , we employed approximately 1,800 salaried employees who work in management, estimating and clerical capacities, plus approximately 1,400 hourly employees. The total number of hourly personnel is subject to the volume of construction in progress and is seasonal. During 2015 , the number of hourly employees ranged from approximately 1,400 &#32;to 3,000 and averaged approximately 2,500 . Four of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Granite Construction Company, Granite Construction Northeast, Inc., Granite Infrastructure Constructors, Inc., and Kenny Construction Company, are parties to craft collective bargaining agreements in many areas in which they work. 

We believe our employees are our most valuable resource, and our workforce possesses a strong dedication to and pride in our company. Among salaried and non-union hourly employees, this dedication is reinforced by a 4.8% &#32;equity ownership at December 31, 2015 &#32;through our 401(k) Plan. Our managerial and supervisory personnel have an average of approximately 10 years of service with Granite. 

Competition 

Competitors in our Construction segment typically range from small, local construction companies to large, regional, national and international construction companies. We compete with numerous companies in individual markets; however, there are few, if any, companies which compete in all of our market areas. Many of our Construction segment competitors have the ability to perform work in either the private or public sectors. When opportunities for work in one sector are reduced, competitors tend to look for opportunities in the other sector. This migration has the potential to reduce revenue growth and/or increase pressure on gross profit margins. 

The scale and complexity of jobs in the Large Project Construction segment preclude many smaller contractors from bidding such work. Consequently, our Large Project Construction segment competition is typically comprised of large, regional, national and international construction companies. 

We own and/or have long-term leases on aggregate resources that we believe provide a competitive advantage in certain markets for both the Construction and Large Project Construction segments. 

Competitors in our Construction Materials segment typically range from small local materials companies to large regional, national and international materials companies. We compete with numerous companies in individual markets; however, there are few, if any, companies which compete in all of our market areas. 

Factors influencing our competitiveness include price, estimating abilities, knowledge of local markets and conditions, project management, financial strength, reputation for quality, aggregate materials availability, and machinery and equipment. Historically, the construction business has not required large amounts of capital for the smaller size construction work pursued by our Construction segment, which can result in relative ease of market entry for companies possessing acceptable qualifications. By contrast, the construction work pursued and performed by our Large Project Construction segment typically requires large amounts of capital that may make entry into the market by future competitors more difficult. Historically, the required amount of capital has not had a significant impact on our ability to compete in the marketplace. Although the construction business is highly competitive, we believe we are well positioned to compete effectively in the markets in which we operate. 

&#32;6 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Contract Provisions and Subcontracting 

Our contracts with our customers are primarily &#8220;fixed unit price&#8221; or &#8220;fixed price.&#8221; Under fixed unit price contracts, we are committed to providing materials or services at fixed unit prices (for example, dollars per cubic yard of concrete placed or cubic yard of earth excavated). While the fixed unit price contract shifts the risk of estimating the quantity of units required for a particular project to the customer, any increase in our unit cost over the expected unit cost in the bid, whether due to inflation, inefficiency, errors in our estimates or other factors, is borne by us unless otherwise provided in the contract. Fixed price contracts are priced on a lump-sum basis under which we bear the risk of performing all the work for the specified amount. The percentage of fixed price contracts in our contract backlog was 67.2% &#32;at December 31, 2015 compared with 71.0% &#32;at December 31, 2014 . The percentage of fixed unit price contracts in our contract backlog was 28.1% &#32;and 19.9% &#32;at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. All other contract types represented 4.7% &#32;and 9.1% &#32;of our backlog at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. 

With the exception of contract change orders and affirmative claims, which is typically sole-source, our construction contracts are obtained through competitive bidding in response to solicitations by both public agencies and private parties and on a negotiated basis as a result of solicitations from private parties. Project owners use a variety of methods to make contractors aware of new projects, including posting bidding opportunities on agency websites, disclosing long-term infrastructure plans, advertising and other general solicitations. Our bidding activity is affected by such factors as the nature and volume of advertising and other solicitations, contract backlog, available personnel, current utilization of equipment and other resources, our ability to obtain necessary surety bonds and competitive considerations. Our contract review process includes identifying risks and opportunities during the bidding process and managing these risks through mitigation efforts such as contract negotiation, bid/no bid decisions, insurance and pricing. Contracts fitting certain criteria of size and complexity are reviewed by various levels of management and, in some cases, by the Executive Committee of our Board of Directors. Bidding activity, contract backlog and revenue resulting from the award of new contracts may vary significantly from period to period. 

There are a number of factors that can create variability in contract performance as compared to the original bid. Such factors can positively or negatively impact costs and profitability, may cause higher than anticipated construction costs and can create additional liability to the contract owner. The most significant of these include: 

&#8226; 

the completeness and accuracy of the original bid; 

&#8226; 

costs associated with scope changes; 

&#8226; 

costs of labor and/or materials; 

&#8226; 

extended overhead due to owner, weather and other delays; 

&#8226; 

subcontractor performance issues; 

&#8226; 

changes in productivity expectations; 

&#8226; 

site conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid (to the extent contract remedies are unavailable); 

&#8226; 

changes from original design on design-build projects; 

&#8226; 

the availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of the project; 

&#8226; 

a change in the availability and proximity of equipment and materials; 

&#8226; 

our ability to fully and promptly recover on claims and back charges for additional contract costs; and 

&#8226; 

the customer&#8217;s ability to properly administer the contract. 

The ability to realize improvements on project profitability at times is more limited than the risk of lower profitability. For example, design-build projects typically incur additional costs such as right-of-way and permit acquisition costs. In addition, design-build contracts carry additional risks such as those associated with design errors and estimating quantities and prices before the project design is completed. We manage this additional risk by adding contingencies to our bid amounts, obtaining errors and omissions insurance and obtaining indemnifications from our design consultants where possible. However, there is no guarantee that these risk management strategies will always be successful. 

Most of our contracts, including those with the government, provide for termination at the convenience of the contract owner, with provisions to pay us for work performed through the date of termination. We have not been materially adversely affected by these provisions in the past. Many of our contracts contain provisions that require us to pay liquidated damages if specified completion schedule requirements are not met, and these amounts could be significant. 

We act as prime contractor on most of our construction projects. We complete the majority of our projects with our own resources and subcontract specialized activities such as electrical and mechanical work. As prime contractor, we are responsible for the performance of the entire contract, including subcontract work. Thus, we may be subject to increased costs associated with the failure of one or more subcontractors to perform as anticipated. Based on our analysis of their construction and financial capabilities, among other criteria, we typically require the subcontractor to furnish a bond or other type of security to guarantee their performance and/or we retain payments in accordance with contract terms until their performance is complete. Disadvantaged business enterprise regulations require us to use our good faith efforts to subcontract a specified portion of contract work done for governmental agencies to certain types of disadvantaged contractors or suppliers. As with all of our subcontractors, some may not be able to obtain surety bonds or other types of performance security. 

&#32;7 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Joint Ventures 

We participate in various construction joint ventures, partnerships and one limited liability company of which we are a limited member (&#8220;joint ventures&#8221;) in order to share expertise, risk and resources for certain highly complex projects. Generally, each construction joint venture is formed to accomplish a specific project and is jointly controlled by the joint venture partners. We select our joint venture partners based on our analysis of their construction and financial capabilities, expertise in the type of work to be performed and past working relationships, among other criteria. The joint venture agreements typically provide that our interests in any profits and assets, and our respective share in any losses and liabilities, that may result from the performance of the contract are limited to our stated percentage interest in the project. 

Under each joint venture agreement, one partner is designated as the sponsor. The sponsoring partner typically provides all administrative, accounting and most of the project management support for the project and generally receives a fee from the joint venture for these services. We have been designated as the sponsoring partner in certain of our current joint venture projects and are a non-sponsoring partner in others. 

We also participate in various &#8220;line item&#8221; joint venture agreements under which each partner is responsible for performing certain discrete items of the total scope of contracted work. The revenue for these discrete items is defined in the contract with the project owner and each venture partner bears the profitability risk associated only with its own work. There is not a single set of books and records for a line item joint venture. Each partner accounts for its items of work individually as it would for any self-performed contract. We account for our portion of these contracts as project revenues and costs in our accounting system and include receivables and payables associated with our work in our consolidated financial statements. 

The agreements with our joint venture partners and limited liability company members (&#8220;partner(s)&#8221;) for both construction joint ventures and line item joint ventures define each partner&#8217;s management role and financial responsibility in the project. While the amount of exposure is generally limited to our stated ownership interest due to the joint and several nature of the performance obligations under the associated owner contract, if one of the partners fails to perform, we and the remaining partners, if any, would be responsible for performance of the outstanding work (i.e., we provide a performance guarantee). We estimate our liability for performance guarantees and include them in accrued expenses and other current liabilities with a corresponding increase in equity in construction joint ventures on the consolidated balance sheets. We reassess our liability when and if changes in circumstances occur. The liability and corresponding asset are removed from the consolidated balance sheets upon completion and customer acceptance of the project. Circumstances that could lead to a loss under these agreements beyond our stated ownership interest include the failure of a partner to contribute additional funds to the venture in the event the project incurs a loss or additional costs that we could incur should a partner fail to provide the services and resources that it had committed to provide in the agreement. We are not able to estimate amounts that may be required beyond the remaining cost of the work to be performed. These costs could be offset by billings to the customer or by proceeds from our partners&#8217; corporate and/or other guarantees. 

At December 31, 2015 , there was $5.1 billion &#32;of construction revenue to be recognized on unconsolidated and line item construction joint venture contracts, of which $1.6 billion &#32;represented our share and the remaining $3.5 billion &#32;represented our partners&#8217; share. See Note 6 of &#8220;Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#8221; for more information. 

Insurance and Bonding 

We maintain general and excess liability, construction equipment and workers&#8217; compensation insurance; all in amounts consistent with industry practice. 

In connection with our business, we generally are required to provide various types of surety bonds that provide an additional measure of security for our performance under certain public and private sector contracts. Our ability to obtain surety bonds depends upon our capitalization, working capital, past performance, management expertise and external factors, including the capacity of the overall surety market. Surety companies consider such factors in light of the amount of our contract backlog that we have currently bonded and their current underwriting standards, which may change from time to time. The capacity of the surety market is subject to market-based fluctuations driven primarily by the level of surety industry losses and the degree of surety market consolidation. When the surety market capacity shrinks it results in higher premiums and increased difficulty obtaining bonding, in particular for larger, more complex projects throughout the market. In order to help mitigate this risk, we employ a co-surety structure involving three sureties. Although we do not believe that fluctuations in surety market capacity have significantly affected our ability to grow our business, there is no assurance that it will not significantly affect our ability to obtain new contracts in the future (see &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221;). 

&#32;8 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Environmental Regulations 

Our operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment, including those relating to discharges to air, water and land, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, the handling of underground storage tanks and the cleanup of properties affected by hazardous substances. Certain environmental laws impose substantial penalties for non-compliance and others, such as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, impose strict, retroactive, joint and several liability upon persons responsible for releases of hazardous substances. We continually evaluate whether we must take additional steps at our locations to ensure compliance with environmental laws. While compliance with applicable regulatory requirements has not materially adversely affected our operations in the past, there can be no assurance that these requirements will not change and that compliance will not adversely affect our operations in the future. In addition, our aggregate materials operations require operating permits granted by governmental agencies. We believe that tighter regulations for the protection of the environment and other factors will make it increasingly difficult to obtain new permits and renewal of existing permits may be subject to more restrictive conditions than currently exist. 

In July 2007, the California Air Resources Board (&#8220;CARB&#8221;) approved a regulation that will require California equipment owners/operators to reduce diesel particulate and nitrogen oxide emissions from in-use off-road diesel equipment and to meet progressively more restrictive emission targets from 2010 to 2020. In December 2008, CARB approved a similar regulation for in-use on-road diesel equipment that includes more restrictive emission targets from 2010 to 2022. The emission targets require California off-road and on-road diesel equipment owners to retrofit equipment with diesel emission control devices or replace equipment with new engine technology as it becomes available, which has resulted in higher equipment-related expenses. In December 2010, CARB amended both regulations to grant economic relief to affected fleets by extending initial compliance dates as well as adding additional compliance requirements. To-date, costs to prepare the Company for compliance have totaled $18.4 million and costs of compliance in 2016 are expected to be $13.3 million. We will continue to manage compliance costs; however, it is not possible to determine the total future cost of compliance. 

As is the case with other companies in our industry, some of our aggregate products contain varying amounts of crystalline silica, a common mineral. Also, some of our construction and material processing operations release, as dust, crystalline silica that is in the materials being handled. Excessive, prolonged inhalation of very small-sized particles of crystalline silica has allegedly been associated with respiratory disease (including Silicosis). For 2016, the Mine Safety and Health Administration and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration are developing new proposed occupational thresholds for crystalline silica exposure as respirable dust at one-half the existing regulatory limits. The initial scope of new proposed occupational thresholds indicates that additional engineering controls will be required to reduce potential exposure in response to the reduced exposure limits. These proposed rule changes are being tracked and monitored to evaluate potential future compliance costs; however, it is not possible at this time to determine the future cost of compliance. However, we have implemented dust control procedures to measure compliance with current requisite thresholds and to verify that respiratory protective equipment is made available as necessary. We also communicate, through safety information sheets and other means, what we believe to be appropriate warnings and cautions to employees and customers about the risks associated with excessive, prolonged inhalation of mineral dust in general and crystalline silica in particular (see &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221;).
