 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Company Overview 

&#160; 

Patrick Industries, Inc., which was founded in 1959 and incorporated in Indiana in 1961, is a major manufacturer of component products and distributor of building products and materials for the recreational vehicle (&#8220;RV&#8221;) and manufactured housing (&#8220;MH&#8221;) industries. In addition, we are a supplier to certain other industrial markets, such as kitchen cabinet, office and household furniture, fixtures and commercial furnishings, marine, and other industrial markets. We manufacture a variety of products including decorative vinyl and paper laminated panels, solid surface, granite and quartz countertops, fabricated aluminum products, wrapped vinyl, paper and hardwood profile mouldings, slide-out trim and fascia, cabinet doors and components, hardwood furniture, fiberglass bath fixtures, fiberglass and plastic component products including front and rear caps and marine helms, softwoods lumber, interior passage doors, RV painting, simulated wood and stone products, and slotwall panels and components, among others. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

We are also an independent wholesale distributor of pre-finished wall and ceiling panels, drywall and drywall finishing products, electronics, wiring, electrical and plumbing products, cement siding, fiber reinforced polyester (&#8220;FRP&#8221;) products, interior passage doors, roofing products, laminate and ceramic flooring, shower doors, furniture, fireplaces and surrounds, interior and exterior lighting products, and other miscellaneous products. We have a nationwide network of manufacturing and distribution centers for our products, thereby reducing in-transit delivery time and cost to the regional manufacturing plants of our customers. We believe that we are one of the few suppliers to the RV and MH industries that has such a nationwide network. At December 31, 2015, we maintained 42 manufacturing plants and 16 warehouse and distribution facilities in 11 states. 

&#160; 

Approximately 80% and 84% of our consolidated net sales in 2015 and 2014, respectively, were decorative interior products and components, consisting primarily of manufactured panels, mouldings and trim, hardwood and pressed doors, furniture and fascia, countertops, and fiberglass products. We have no material patents, licenses, franchises, or concessions and do not conduct significant research and development activities . 

&#160; 

Over the last three years, we have executed on a number of strategic initiatives including: the completion of 10 acquisitions, the introduction of over 360 new products and product line extensions, the implementation of a branding strategy, increasing our market share, maintaining an appropriate level of leverage, investing in property, plant and equipment, operational restructuring at certain manufacturing and distribution facilities, disposition of underperforming operations and facilities, and aggressive management of inventory levels to changes in sales levels. The combination of improving economic conditions, particularly in the RV industry, and the execution of the strategic initiatives identified above, among others, resulted in our sales, operating income, net income and cash flows improving significantly in the three years ended December 31, 2015. In the Executive Summary section of Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,&#8221; we provide an overview of the impact that macroeconomic conditions had on our operations and in the RV, MH and industrial markets in 2015. 

&#160; 

We have continued to expand the breadth and the depth of our products and services through the integration of new and innovative product lines designed to bring value to our customers and create additional scale advantages. See &#8220;Strategic Acquisitions and Expansion&#8221; below and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for further details. 

&#160; 

Patrick had two reportable operating segments in 2015, Manufacturing and Distribution. Financial information about these operating segments is included in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and incorporated herein by reference. 

&#160; 

Competitive Position 

&#160; 

The RV and MH industries are highly competitive with low barriers to entry, which carries through to the suppliers to these industries. Across the Company&#8217;s range of products and services, competition exists primarily on price, product features, quality and service. Several competitors compete with us in each product line on a regional and local basis. However, in order for a competitor to compete with us on a national basis, we believe that a substantial capital commitment and investment in personnel and facilities would be required. The industrial markets that we serve are also highly competitive. 

&#160; 

Given the environment in the industries in which we operate, the Company has identified several operating strategies to maintain or enhance earnings through strategic acquisitions, productivity initiatives, expansion into new product lines, and optimization of capacity utilization. 

&#160; 

Strategy 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

We believe that we have developed strong working relationships with our customers and suppliers, and have oriented our business to their needs. Our customers include all of the larger RV and MH manufacturers and a number of large to medium-sized industrial customers. The majority of our industrial customers are generally directly linked to the residential housing markets. Our RV and MH customers generally demand competitive prices, high quality standards, short lead times, and a high degree of flexibility from their suppliers. Our industrial customers typically are less price sensitive than our RV and MH customers, and are focused on consistent high quality products, exceptional customer service, and quick response times. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

Our capital allocation strategy includes a balance of managing and utilizing our resources and leverage position to continue to grow and invest in the business model through strategic acquisitions, investment in infrastructure and capital expenditures to ensure both capacity and technology to support anticipated growth needs, and stock repurchases, among others. Additionally, because of the short lead times, which can include same day order, receipt and delivery, we continue to focus on managing our inventory levels to achieve a balance between increasing inventory turns and ensuring we have product on hand to meet customer demand levels. 

&#160; 

As we explore new markets and industries, we believe that our core competencies and focus on executing on our strategic plan provide us with a strong foundation for future growth. In 2015, approximately 75% of our net sales were to the RV industry, 14% to the MH industry, and 11% to the industrial markets. In 2014, approximately 74% of our net sales were to the RV industry, 15% to the MH industry, and 11% to the industrial markets. The increase in wholesale unit shipments in the RV market relative to the growth in the other primary market sectors in which Patrick operates, the introduction of new products to the marketplace, and the impact of the acquisitions completed in the last three years have led to an increase in our RV market sales concentration through 2015 when compared to prior periods. 

&#160; 

Operating Strategies 

&#160; 

Key operating strategies identified by management include the following: 

&#160; 

Strategic Acquisitions and Expansion 

&#160; 

We supply a broad variety of building materials and interior decorative component products to the RV, MH and industrial markets. With our nationwide manufacturing and distribution capabilities and capacities, we believe that we are well positioned for continued market improvement in all industry sectors and the introduction of new products to further bring value to our customer base. In order to facilitate this initiative, we are focused on driving growth in all three of our primary markets through the acquisition of companies with strong management teams with a strategic fit to our core values, business model and customer presence, as well as additional product lines, facilities, or other assets to complement or expand our existing businesses. We believe there continue to be acquisition opportunities in all three primary markets that we serve. 

&#160; 

From 2013 to 2015, we invested approximately $229 million, in the aggregate, to complete a total of 10 acquisitions, which directly complemented our core competencies and product lines. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the 2013 acquisitions. 

&#160; 

In 2014, we invested approximately $72 million to complete four acquisitions: Precision Painting, Inc., Carrera Custom Painting, Inc., and Millennium Paint, Inc., three related full service exterior full body painting operations that offer exterior painting and interior refurbishing for both original equipment manufacturers (&#8220;OEMs&#8221;) and existing RV and fleet owners, and TDM Transport, Inc., a transportation operation that services their in-house customers (collectively referred to as &#8220;Precision Painting Group&#8221; or &#8220;Precision&#8221;); Foremost Fabricators, LLC (&#8220;Foremost&#8221;), a fabricator and distributor of fabricated aluminum products, FRP sheet and coil, and custom laminated products primarily used in the RV market; PolyDyn3, LLC (&#8220;PolyDyn3&#8221;), a custom fabricator of simulated wood and stone products for the RV market; and Charleston Corporation (&#8220;Charleston&#8221;), a manufacturer of fiberglass and plastic components primarily used in the RV, marine, and vehicle aftermarket industries. 

&#160; 

In 2015, we invested approximately $140 million to complete three acquisitions: Better Way Partners, LLC d/b/a Better Way Products (&#8220;Better Way&#8221;), a manufacturer of fiberglass front and rear caps, marine helms and related fiberglass components primarily used in the RV, marine and transit vehicle markets; Structural Composites of Indiana, Inc. (&#8220;SCI&#8221;), a manufacturer of large, custom molded fiberglass front and rear caps and roofs, primarily used in the RV market, and specialty fiberglass components for the transportation, marine and other industrial markets; and North American Forest Products, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, North American Moulding, LLC (collectively, &#8220;North American&#8221;), a manufacturer and distributor, primarily for the RV market, of profile wraps, custom mouldings, laminated panels and moulding products. North American is also a manufacturer and supplier of raw and processed softwoods products primarily used in the RV and MH industries. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

In February 2016, we invested approximately $25 million to acquire Parkland Plastics, Inc. (&#8220;Parkland&#8221;), a fully integrated designer, green manufacturer and distributor of innovative polymer-based products including wall panels, lay-in ceiling panels, coated and rolled floors, protective moulding, and adhesives and accessories, primarily for the RV industry and the architectural and industrial markets. 

&#160; 

In March 2016, we invested approximately $11 million to acquire The Progressive Group (&#8220;Progressive&#8221;), a distributor and manufacturer&#8217;s representative for major name brand electronics to a customer base primarily consisting of small, mid-size and large retailers, distributors, and custom installers primarily serving the auto and home electronics, retail, custom integration, and commercial channels. 

&#160; 

D iversification into Other Markets 

&#160; 

While we continually seek to improve our position as a leading supplier to the RV and MH industries, we are also seeking to expand our product lines into other industrial, commercial, and institutional markets. Many of our products, such as countertops, hardwood and pressed cabinet doors, laminated panels and mouldings, drawer sides and fronts, slotwall, and shelving, have applications in the kitchen cabinet, retail fixtures, household furniture, and architectural markets. We have a dedicated sales force focused on increasing our industrial market penetration and on our diversification into additional commercial and institutional markets. 

&#160; 

We believe that diversification into other industrial markets provides opportunities for improved operating margins with complementary products that increase our capacity utilization. In addition, we feel that our nationwide manufacturing and distribution capabilities have enabled us to be well positioned for new product expansion. 

&#160; 

Additionally, we may explore strategic acquisition opportunities that are not directly tied to the three primary markets we serve in order to further leverage our core competencies in manufacturing and distribution and to diversify our end market exposure and presence. 

&#160; 

Utilization of Manufacturing Capacity 

&#160; 

Plant Consolidations / Closures and Plant Expansion 

&#160; 

Certain manufacturing and distribution operating facilities were either consolidated or expanded during 2014 and 2015 in an effort to continue to improve operating efficiencies in the plants through increased capacity utilization. In 2014, we closed our leased distribution facility in Madisonville, Tennessee and consolidated the business into the existing Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania and Decatur, Alabama distribution facilities that engage in similar activities. In 2015, we leased an existing production facility in Wakarusa, Indiana, as part of our Precision Painting Group, to support growing market opportunities and increase our capacity in the RV painting market. 

&#160; 

In addition, in an effort to support our continued focus on acquisitions and in capturing market share through the introduction of our existing product lines in markets outside of our core Midwest market, we have several new initiatives in process in 2016, which include the expansion of our manufacturing operations in Southern California and the Pacific Northwest in alignment with OEM facility expansions in those regions, and additional expansion opportunities in the Southeast and Northeast regions. 

&#160; 

Market and product expansion in these territories include expanding our geographic product reach by opening: (1) an additional manufacturing plant in Southern California to fabricate solid surface countertops, and (2) two new facilities in the Pacific Northwest, in Oregon and Idaho, to provide laminated products and interior doors to the growing customer base in that region. We expect operations in these areas to be fully functional by the end of the first quarter of 2016. Additionally, in 2016, we have plans to open a countertop manufacturing facility in the Southeast, and increase capacity and our footprint in Pennsylvania to support the growing industrial market opportunities in the Northeast. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

Product Development and New Product Introductions &#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

With our versatile manufacturing and distribution capabilities, we are continually striving to increase our presence in all of the markets that we serve and gain entrance into other markets. We remain committed to new product introduction and development initiatives. New product development is a key component of our strategy to grow our market share and revenue base, adapt to changing market conditions, and proactively address customer demand. 

&#160; 

In March 2016, we opened The Studio , our new Design/Innovation Center and Showroom located in Elkhart, Indiana. Our focus is to present the latest design trends and products, and provide a creative environment for our customers to design products and enhance their brand. The 45,000 square foot facility includes a large showroom devoted to the display of a majority of the products, capabilities and services offered by each of Patrick&#8217;s business units, in addition to offices and conference rooms. Our specialized team of designers, engineers and graphic artists works with our RV, MH and industrial customers to meet their creative design and product needs including creating new styles and utilizing new colors, patterns, products, and wood types for panels and mouldings, cabinet doors, furniture, lighting and other products. Other services provided at The Studio include product development, 3D CAD illustration, 3D printing, photography and marketing. 

&#160; 

In addition to the new product offerings stemming from acquisitions, we further enhanced our product offerings to our customers in the RV, MH and industrial markets through the introduction of several new products and the expansion of our existing product lines in 2015 including, on the manufacturing side, several new cabinet door styles and fascia, upgraded cabinetry and countertops, new slide-out trim, new styles of interior passage doors for RVs, pressed countertops, various fiberglass and plastic components, front and rear end caps, lighting packages, and backsplashes. Our distribution line of products was expanded to include new faucets modeled after the residential market, residential furniture, televisions and sound bars, ceramic tile, mattresses, fireplace surrounds, kitchen appliances, RV electrical control systems, flooring options and various building products. 

&#160; 

Branding 

&#160; 

In conjunction with our acquisition strategy, we continue to focus our efforts on providing specific product knowledge, expertise and support to our customers through a branding strategy which includes product managers for each of our key product lines, support staff, and strategic supplier relationships which allow us to partner with them as a supplier of choice to drive efficiency and maximize value by providing the expertise and support in the products that we sell. Our primary product brands include Adorn, Custom Vinyls, Patrick Distribution, AIA Countertops, Quest Audio Video, Interior Components Plus, Gravure Ink, Praxis Group, Infinity Graphics, D&#233;cor Manufacturing, Gustafson Lighting, Creative Wood Designs, Middlebury Hardwood Products, Frontline Manufacturing, Premier Concepts, West Side Furniture, Precision Painting, Carrera Custom Painting, Millennium Paint, Foremost Fabricators, PolyDyn3, Charleston, Better Way Products, SCI and North American. In addition, our industrial markets sector cross sells existing product lines and launches new products that are targeted to serve unique, consumer-driven channels under the Decorative Dynamics brand name. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing Processes and Operations 

&#160; 

Our lamination facilities utilize various materials such as lauan, medium-density fiberboard (&#8220;MDF&#8221;), gypsum, and particleboard, which are bonded by adhesives or a heating process to a number of products, including vinyl, paper, foil, and high-pressure laminates. Additionally, we offer high-pressure laminate bonded primarily to particleboard, which has many uses, including countertops, cabinetry, and office furniture, among others. We manufacture and fabricate solid surface, granite, quartz, and high-pressure laminate countertops for all of our primary markets, as well as slotwall panels and components for the retail store fixture markets. Roll-laminated products are used in the production of wall, cabinet, shelving, counter, and fixture products with a wide variety of finishes and textures. In conjunction with our manufacturing capabilities, we also provide value added processes, including custom fabrication, edge-banding, drilling, boring, and cut-to-size capabilities. We also manufacture various fiberglass bath and shower surrounds and fixtures. 

&#160; 

We manufacture three distinct cabinet door product lines in both raised and flat panel designs, as well as square, shaker style, cathedral and arched panels. Our primary cabinet door product line is manufactured from raw lumber using solid oak, maple, cherry and other hardwood materials, and comes in a variety of finishes and glazes. Another line of doors is made of laminated fiberboard, and a third line uses membrane press technology to produce doors and components with vinyls of various thicknesses. Doors are also made with a number of outside decorative components such as rosettes, hardwood moulding, arched window trim, blocks and windowsills, among others. Our doors are sold mainly to the RV and MH industries. We also market to the cabinet manufacturers and &#8220;ready-to-assemble&#8221; furniture manufacturers. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

Gravure Ink, our vinyl printing facility, produces a wide variety of decorative and textured printed wall vinyls that are laminated to gypsum, lauan, or other materials depending on customer needs in the RV and MH industries. The vinyls are generally 50&#8221; in width and 3.2 mil nominal thickness, and are shipped in rolls ranging from 300-800 yards in length. This facility produces material both for sale to external customers and for internal use. 

&#160; 

In 2014, we expanded our stable of products to include three related exterior full body painting operations (the Precision Group), a fabricator and distributor of fabricated aluminum and FRP products (Foremost), a custom fabricator of simulated wood and stone products (PolyDyn3), and a manufacturer of fiberglass and plastic components (Charleston). 

&#160; 

In 2015, we further expanded our fiberglass operations through the acquisition of two fabricators of various custom fiberglass components (Better Way and SCI). In addition, we acquired a fabricator and distributor of custom moulding and laminated products, and expanded into the raw and processed softwood products market through our acquisition of North American. 

&#160; 

Markets 

&#160; 

We are engaged in the manufacturing and distribution of building products and interior decorative component products for use primarily by the RV and MH industries, and in other industrial markets. We continue to capture market share through our strategic acquisitions and new product initiatives, which have resulted in sales levels growing at a rate significantly in excess of the general industry over the last five years. 

&#160; 

RV industry conditions continued to improve as the full year 2015 marked the sixth consecutive annual increase in RV wholesale unit shipments. We believe that industry-wide retail sales and the related production levels of RVs will be dependent on the overall strength of the economy, consumer confidence levels, conditions in the credit markets, and other demographic trends. Recreational vehicle purchases are generally consumer discretionary income purchases, and therefore, any situation which causes concerns related to discretionary income can have a negative impact on this market. 

&#160; 

Although growth in the MH industry, based upon improved levels of wholesale shipments, has improved in recent years, it continues to be suppressed by the lack of financing alternatives and by financing and regulatory constraints imposed on lenders. We continue to believe there is significant potential for the MH market in the long-term based on the current shipment level trends as discussed below. 

&#160; 

Approximately 50% of our industrial revenue base in 2015 was associated with the U.S. residential housing market, and therefore, there is a direct correlation between the demand for our products in this market and new residential housing construction and remodeling activities. 

&#160; 

Over the last several years, we have focused on diversification, strategic acquisitions, and bringing new and innovative products to the market. We have also targeted certain sales efforts towards market segments that are less directly tied to residential new home construction, including the retail fixture, furniture, and countertop markets. As a result, we have seen a shift in our product mix, which has had a positive impact on revenues from the industrial markets. Additionally, we have gained market share and expanded into new geographic territories as a result of investment in new team members with significant product knowledge, relationships, and expertise in the commercial markets. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

Recreational Vehicles &#160; 

&#160; 

The RV industry has been characterized by cycles of growth and contraction in consumer demand, reflecting prevailing general economic conditions, which affect disposable income for leisure time activities. The deeper cycles have been tied to major economic and world events including the 1991 Gulf War, September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, and the &#8220;Great Recession&#8221; of 2007-2009. We believe that consumer confidence, the level of disposable income, equity securities market trends, and significant fluctuations in interest rates have an impact on RV sales. Over the past several years, however, we believe there has been a level of resilience in the RV marketplace, where RV buyers appear to have prioritized the purchase of an RV over other discretionary items in an effort to pursue their desired &#8220;RV lifestyle&#8221;. Periods of lower gasoline prices can have a positive impact on RV retail purchases, however, extended periods of lower fuel prices followed by a sudden increase in prices could have a negative impact on retail RV purchases in the short term while the market adjusts. 

&#160; 

Demographic and ownership trends continue to point to favorable market growth in the long term, as there is a culture shift toward outdoor activities, with a large segment of the population&#8217;s &#8220;millennials&#8221; embracing this outdoor lifestyle and entering into the RV marketplace. In addition, the number of &#8220;baby-boomers&#8221; reaching retirement age is steadily increasing, and the RV owning population in the 35-54 year old demographic continues to grow. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that there are expected to be approximately 11,000 &#8220;baby-boomers&#8221; reaching age 65 every day through 2029. Additionally, products such as sports-utility RVs and &#8220;toy haulers,&#8221; with a rear section to store and transport motorcycles, snowmobiles, ATVs, sand rails, and other leisure products, are attractive to younger buyers, and RV manufacturers are also providing an array of product choices, including producing lightweight towables and smaller fuel-efficient motorhomes. Environmentally-conscious technologies, such as lightweight composite materials, solar panels, and energy-efficient components, are also options that can be added to an RV. 

&#160; 

Recreational vehicle classifications are based upon standards established by the Recreational Vehicle Industry Association (&#8220;RVIA&#8221;). The principal types of recreational vehicles include: (1) Towables: conventional travel trailers, folding camping trailers, fifth wheel trailers, and truck campers which are lighter and less expensive than standard gas or diesel powered motorized units, representing a more attractive solution for the cost-conscious buyer; and (2) Motorized: motor homes. Both towable and motorized RV units are distinct from mobile homes, which are manufactured houses designed for permanent and semi-permanent residential dwelling. The Company estimates that its mix of RV revenues related to towable units and motorized units is consistent with the overall RV production mix. In 2015 and 2014, towable unit shipments represented approximately 87% and 88%, respectively, of total RV wholesale shipments. Towable unit shipments increased approximately 5% and 11%, respectively, during those same time periods. On the motorized side, wholesale unit shipments represented approximately 13% and 12%, respectively, of total RV wholesale shipments in 2015 and 2014. Motorized unit shipments rose approximately 8% and 15% in the comparable periods. 

&#160; 

Sales of recreational vehicle products have been cyclical in the past. In the most recent major cycle, wholesale unit shipments in the RV industry declined from an all-time high of 390,500 units in 2006 to 165,700 units in 2009. In the period from 2010 to 2015, wholesale unit shipments per year averaged 305,000 units. In 2015, wholesale shipment levels rose 5% to 374,246 units, resulting in a cumulative gain of approximately 126% since 2009. The RVIA is currently forecasting full year 2016 wholesale unit shipments to increase by approximately 2% compared to the 2015 level. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

The following chart reflects historical wholesale unit shipment levels in the RV industry from 2006 through 2015 per RVIA statistics: &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

Manufactured Housing&#160; 

&#160; 

Manufactured homes historically have been one of the principal means for first-time homebuyers to overcome the obstacles of large down payments and higher monthly mortgage payments due to the lower cost of construction as compared to site-built homes. Manufactured housing also provides a cost effective alternative for those individuals and families seeking to establish home ownership or whose credit ratings have been impacted by the economic and job environment over the past several years. In addition, manufactured homes are an attractive option for those who have migrated to temporary and multi-family housing alternatives, an attractive entry point for many first-time homebuyers and individuals and families looking to re-enter the home ownership market, or for retirees and others desiring a lifestyle in which home ownership is less burdensome than in the case of site-built homes. 

&#160; 

Manufactured homes are constructed to the building standards of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (&#8220;HUD&#8221;) and are factory built and transported to a site where they are installed, often permanently. All manufactured homes have design limitations imposed by the constraints of efficient production and over-the-road transit. The cost of delivery limits the effective competitive shipping range of the manufactured homes to approximately 400 to 600 miles. Modular homes, which are built in accordance with state and local building codes, are factory built homes that are built in sections and transported to the site for installation. These homes and many HUD code homes are generally set on a foundation and are subject to land/home-financing terms and conditions. 

&#160; 

The MH industry is affected by the availability, cost, and in many cases, the credit requirements of alternative housing, such as apartments, town houses, condominiums and site-built housing, including repossessed residential housing inventory levels. The 2009 level of 49,789 wholesale units was the lowest level in the last 50 years. In the period from 2010 to 2015, MH unit shipments per year averaged 58,600 units. In 2015, MH unit shipments rose 10% to 70,519 units, resulting in a gain in annual shipments of approximately 42% since 2009, but still trending well below historical levels. 

&#160; 

While sales growth in the MH industry continues to be limited by the lack of financing alternatives and credit availability in the short term, we believe there is pent up demand being created and significant upside potential for this market in the long term based on current demographic trends including multi-family housing capacity, new home pricing, improving credit and financing conditions, and improved consumer savings levels, among other factors. We currently expect continued steady growth in this market for 2016 with more significant growth in the long term assuming improved availability of credit and recalibration of quality credit standards. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

Factors that may favorably impact production levels in this industry include quality credit standards in the residential housing market, job growth, favorable changes in financing regulations, higher interest rates on traditional residential housing loans, and improved conditions in the asset-backed securities markets for manufactured housing loans. While there is still some overhang related to the overall economic environment and the financing conditions mentioned above, we believe there is also long-term potential for this industry as residential housing demand continues to improve. On average, over the last 40 years, approximately three-fourths of total residential housing starts have been single-family housing starts. In addition, wholesale unit shipment levels in the MH industry have averaged approximately 9-11% of the level of single-family housing starts over the last 10 years . 

&#160; 

The following chart reflects the historical wholesale unit shipment levels in the MH industry from 2006 through 2015 per the Manufactured Housing Institute: 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Other Markets 

&#160; 

Many of our core manufacturing products, including paper/vinyl laminated panels, shelving, drawer-sides, high-pressure laminated panels, solid surface, granite, and quartz countertops, cut-to-size products, and fiberglass and plastic components, are utilized in the kitchen cabinet, office and household furniture, fixtures and commercial furnishings, marine, and other industrial markets. These markets are generally categorized by a more performance-than-price driven customer base, and provide an opportunity for us to diversify our customer base, while providing increased contribution to our core laminating and fabricating competencies. While the residential furniture markets have been impacted by import pressures, there has been a renewed interest in domestically produced products and the &#8220;Made in the USA&#8221; label. Additionally, other residential and commercial segments have been less vulnerable to import competition, and therefore, provide opportunities for increased sales penetration and market share gains. Over the past three years, the residential housing market in particular has shown signs of improving across the country and that trend is expected to continue in fiscal 2016 resulting in increased demand for our products. Our sales to the industrial market generally lag new housing starts by six to nine months and will vary based on differences in regional economic prospects. We believe that we have the available capacity to increase industrial revenue and benefit from the diversity of multiple market segments, unique regional economies and varied customer strategies. 

&#160; 

Marketing and Distribution 

&#160; 

Our sales are to RV and MH manufacturers and other industrial products manufacturers. We have over 800 active customers. The Company&#39;s RV products include consolidated sales to two major manufacturers of RVs that each account for over 10% of our consolidated net sales - Forest River, Inc., a Berkshire Hathaway Company (&#8220;Forest River&#8221;) and Thor Industries, Inc. (stock symbol: THO) (&#8220;Thor&#8221;). Both Forest River and Thor are comprised of various operating subsidiaries and brand names that operate within the parent company. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our combined sales to the operating subsidiaries of Forest River and Thor, on a consolidated basis, accounted for 55% and 58% of our consolidated net sales, respectively. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

A majority of products for distribution are generally purchased in railcar, container, or truckload quantities, warehoused, and then sold and delivered by us. In addition, approximately 19% and 18% of our distribution segment&#8217;s sales were from products shipped directly from the suppliers to our customers in 2015 and 2014, respectively. We typically experience a one to two week delay between issuing our purchase orders and the delivery of products to our warehouses or customers. We generally keep backup supplies of various commodity products in our warehouses to ensure that we have product on hand at all times for our distribution customers. Our customers do not maintain long-term supply contracts, and therefore, we bear the risk of accurate advanced estimation of customer orders. In periods of declining market conditions, customer order rates can decline, resulting in less efficient logistics planning and fulfillment and thus increasing delivery costs due to increased numbers of shipments with fewer products in each shipment. We have no significant backlog of orders. 

&#160; 

With the acquisitions completed in 2015 and in the first quarter of 2016, and with certain plant consolidations and expansions in 2015, we operate 23 warehouse and distribution centers and 43 manufacturing operations located in Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas and Utah. By using these facilities, we are able to minimize our in-transit delivery time and cost to the regional manufacturing plants of our customers. 

&#160; 

Patrick does not engage in significant marketing efforts nor does it incur significant marketing or advertising expenditures, other than attendance at certain trade shows and the activities of its sales personnel and the maintenance of customer relationships through price, quality of its products, service and customer satisfaction. Both our new design center and showroom, and our Company website, www. p atrickind.com , have allowed us to further showcase our primary product brands to both existing and potential customers and expand our Internet presence. 

&#160; 

Suppliers 

&#160; 

During the year ended December 31, 2015, we purchased approximately 49% of our raw materials and distributed products from 20 different suppliers. The five largest suppliers accounted for approximately 25% of our total purchases. We have terms and conditions with certain suppliers that specify exclusivity in certain areas, pricing structures, rebate agreements and other parameters. 

&#160; 

Raw materials are primarily commodity products, such as lauan, gypsum , particleboard, other lumber products, aluminum, resin, and overlays, among others which are available from many suppliers. We do not maintain long-term supply agreements. Our sales in the short-term could be negatively impacted in the event any unforeseen negative circumstances were to affect our major suppliers. We believe that we have a good relationship with all of our significant suppliers. Alternate sources of supply are available for all of our material purchases. 

&#160; 

Regulation and Environmental Quality 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s operations are subject to certain federal, state, and local regulatory requirements relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during their manufacturing processes. Over the past several years, Patrick has taken a proactive role in certifying that the composite wood substrate materials that it uses to produce products for its customers in the RV marketplace have complied with applicable emission standards developed by the California Air Resources Board (&#8220;CARB&#8221;). All suppliers and manufacturers of composite wood materials are required to comply with the current CARB regulations. 

&#160; 

The Company is certified to sell Forestry Stewardship Council (&#8220;FSC&#8221;) materials to its customers at certain of its manufacturing branches. The FSC certification provides a link between responsible production and consumption of materials from the world&#8217;s forests and it assists our customers in making socially and environmentally responsible buying decisions on the products they purchase. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

We believe that we are currently operating in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations and have made reports and submitted information as required. The Company believes that the expense of compliance with these laws and regulations with respect to environmental quality, as currently in effect, will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or competitive position, and will not require any material capital expenditures for plant or equipment modifications. 

&#160; 

Seasonality &#160; 

&#160; 

Manufacturing operations in the RV and MH industries historically have been seasonal and generally have been at their highest levels when the climate is moderate. Accordingly, the Company&#8217;s sales and profits had generally been the highest in the second and third quarters. Seasonal industry trends in the past several years have included the impact related to the addition of major RV manufacturer open houses for dealers to the September timeframe, whereby dealers are delaying purchases until new product lines are introduced at these shows. This has resulted in seasonal softening in the RV industry beginning in the third quarter and extending through October, and when combined with our increased concentration in the RV industry, led to a seasonal trend pattern in which the Company achieves its strongest sales and profit levels in the first half of the year. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 3,542 employees, 3,181 of which were engaged directly in production, warehousing, and delivery operations; 97 in sales; and 264 in office and administrative activities, which includes purchasing, inventory and production control, customer service, human resources, accounting, and information technology, among others. There were no manufacturing plants or distribution centers covered by collective bargaining agreements. Patrick continuously reviews benefits and other matters of interest to its employees and considers relations with its employees to be good.
