 ITEM 1. BUSINESS Corporate Overview 

We are an externally-managed, agricultural REIT that was re-incorporated in Maryland on March 24, 2011, having been originally incorporated in California on June 14, 1997, and having been previously re-incorporated in Delaware on May 25, 2004. We are primarily in the business of owning and leasing farmland; we are not a grower, nor do we farm the properties we own. Upon the pricing of our initial public offering (the &#147;IPO&#148;), on January 29, 2013, our shares of common stock began trading on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol &#147;LAND.&#148; 

&#160;

Prior to 2004, we were engaged in the owning and leasing of farmland, as well as an agricultural operating business whereby we engaged in the farming, contract growing, packaging, marketing and distribution of fresh berries, including commission selling and contract cooling services to independent berry growers. In 2004, we sold our agricultural operating business, and since then, our operations have consisted solely of leasing our farms to third-party tenants. 

We currently own 43 farms comprised of 16,810 total acres across six states in the U.S. (Arizona, California, Florida, Michigan, Nebraska and Oregon). We also own three cooling facilities and one facility utilized for the storage and assembly of boxes for shipping produce (a &#147;box barn&#148;). These properties are currently leased to 33 different, unrelated tenants that are either independent or corporate farming operations. We also lease a small parcel on one of our properties to an oil company. Historically, our farmland has predominantly been concentrated in locations where tenants are able to grow annual row crops, such as certain types of berries and vegetables, which are generally planted and harvested annually or more frequently. However, during 2013, we began to diversify the variety of crops grown on our properties, and we now own several farms that grow permanent crops, such as blueberries and almonds, as well as some farms that grow commodity crops, such as potatoes, corn and beans. While our focus remains on farmland growing fresh produce annual row crops, in the future, we may acquire land that grows additional permanent crops, such as fruit or nut trees or bushes and wine berries or grapes, as well as commodity crops, such as grains. We may also acquire more property related to farming, such as cooling facilities, freezer buildings, packinghouses, box barns, silos, storage facilities, greenhouses, processing plants and distribution centers. 

We generally lease our properties on a triple-net basis, an arrangement under which, in addition to rent, the tenant is required to pay the related taxes, insurance costs (including drought insurance if we were to acquire properties that depend upon rainwater for irrigation), maintenance and other operating costs. We may also elect to sell farmland at certain times, such as when the land could be developed by others for urban or suburban uses. We do not currently intend to enter the business of growing, packing or marketing farmed products; however, if we do so in the future, we expect that we would conduct such business through a taxable REIT subsidiary (&#147;TRS&#148;). 

To a lesser extent, we may provide senior secured first-lien mortgages to farmers for the purchase of farmland and farm-related properties. We expect that any mortgages we make would be secured by farming properties that have a successful history of crop production and profitable farming operations and that, over time, such mortgages would not exceed 5.0% of the fair value of our total assets. Currently, we do not hold any mortgages, and we have not identified any properties for which to make loans secured by mortgages. 

We conduct our business through an Umbrella Partnership Real Estate Investment Trust (&#147;UPREIT&#148;) structure in which our properties and the mortgage loans we make will be held directly or indirectly by Gladstone Land Limited Partnership (the &#147;Operating Partnership&#148;). We are the manager and 100% owner of Gladstone Land Partners, LLC (&#147;Land Partners&#148;), which is the sole general partner of our Operating Partnership, and we currently hold, directly and indirectly through Land Partners, 100% of its outstanding limited partnership units (&#147;OP Units&#148;). In the future, we may offer equity ownership in our Operating Partnership by issuing OP Units to farmland owners from time to time in consideration for acquiring their farms. Holders of OP Units in our Operating Partnership will be entitled to redeem these units for cash or, at our election, shares of our common stock on a one-for-one basis at any time after holding the OP Units for one year. Farmland owners who exchange their farms for OP Units may be able to do so in a tax-deferred exchange under U.S. federal income tax laws. 

On September 3, 2014, we filed our 2013 federal income tax return, on which we elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal tax purposes beginning with the year ended December 31, 2013. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax if we distribute at least 90% of our taxable income to our stockholders. In addition, we have elected for Gladstone Land Advisers, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of our Operating Partnership, to be taxed as a TRS. We may own or manage our assets and engage in other activities through Gladstone Land Advisors or another TRS we form or acquire when we deem it necessary or advisable. The taxable income generated by any TRS will be subject to regular corporate income tax. Currently, we do not conduct any operations through our TRS. 

Subject to certain restrictions and limitations, and pursuant to contractual agreements, our business and real estate portfolio investments are managed by Gladstone Management Corporation (our &#147;Adviser&#148;), a Delaware corporation, a registered investment adviser with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;SEC&#148;) and our affiliate. Administrative services are provided to us by Gladstone Administration, LLC (our &#147;Administrator&#148;), a Delaware limited liability company and our affiliate. Our Adviser and our Administrator are indirectly 100% owned and controlled by David Gladstone, our chief executive officer, president, chairman of our Board of Directors and our largest stockholder. 

&#160;

Our Investment Objectives and Our Strategy 

Our principal business objective is to maximize stockholder returns through a combination of: (1) monthly cash distributions to our stockholders, which we hope to sustain and increase through long-term growth in cash flows from increased rents; (2) appreciation of our land; and (3) capital gains derived from the sale of our properties. Our primary strategy to achieve our business objective is to invest in and diversify our current portfolio of primarily triple-net-leased farmland and properties related to farming operations. This strategy includes the following components: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Owning Farms and Farm-Related Real Estate for Income. We own and intend to acquire farmland and lease it to independent and corporate farming operations, including sellers who desire to continue farming the land after we acquire the property from them. We expect to hold acquired properties for many years and to generate stable and increasing rental income from leasing these properties. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Owning Farms and Farm-Related Real Estate for Appreciation. We intend to lease acquired properties over the long term. However, from time to time we may sell one or more properties if we believe it to be in the best interests of our stockholders. Potential purchasers may include real estate developers desiring to develop the property or financial purchasers seeking to acquire property for investment purposes. Accordingly, we will seek to acquire properties that we believe have potential for long-term appreciation in value. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Continue Expanding our Operations Geographically. While our properties are currently located in six states across the U.S., we expect that we will acquire properties in other farming regions of the U.S. in the future. We believe the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States offer attractive locations for expansion, and we also expect to seek farmland acquisitions in the Midwest, as well as other areas in the United States. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Continue Expanding our Crop Varieties. Currently, the majority of tenants who farm our properties grow annual row crops dedicated to berries, such as strawberries and raspberries, and fresh produce, such as tomatoes, lettuce and bell peppers. We have also expanded into certain permanent crops, such as blueberries and almonds; as well as into commodity crops, such as potatoes, corn and beans. In the future, we will seek to continue our recent expansion into other permanent crops, such as bush, tree and vine crops (e.g., fruits and nuts), and commodity crops (e.g., wheat, rice and corn), while maintaining our focus on annual row-crop properties growing berries and fresh produce. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Using Leverage. To make more investments than would otherwise be possible, we intend to borrow through loans secured by long-term mortgages on our properties, and we may also borrow funds on a short-term basis or incur other indebtedness. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Owning Mortgages on Farms and Farm-Related Real Estate. In circumstances where our purchase of farms and farm-related properties is not feasible, we may provide the owner of the property with a mortgage loan secured by the property along with an option to sell the property to us in the future at a predetermined price. We do not currently hold any mortgages, and we do not expect that, over time, our mortgages held will exceed 5.0% of the fair value of our total assets. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Joint Ventures. Some of our investments may be made through joint ventures that would permit us to own interests in large properties without restricting the diversity of our portfolio. We expect that most of our future tenants will be independent or corporate farming operations that are unrelated to us and that lease our properties under triple-net leases. We are actively seeking and evaluating other farm properties for potential purchase, and we are currently entered into agreements to purchase two farms totaling 6,664 acres of farmland in Colorado and California for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $41.4 million, which we intend to finance primarily through borrowings from existing borrowing facilities. We expect to close on one farm totaling 6,211 acres for approximately $25.9 million (a portion of which is expected to be paid in OP Units) during the three months ending March 31, 2016, and the other farm totaling 453 acres for approximately $15.5 million during the three months ending June 30, 2016. However, all of these potential acquisitions are subject to customary conditions and termination rights for these types of transactions, including a due diligence inspection period, and there can be no assurance that these prospective acquisitions will be consummated by that time, on the terms currently anticipated, or at all. 

&#160;

Our Investment Process 

Types of Investments 

We expect that substantially all of our investments will be in income-producing agricultural real property and, to a lesser extent, mortgages on agricultural real estate. We expect that the majority of our leases will be structured as triple-net leases. If we make mortgage loans, we expect the ratio of loan amount to value of the real estate to be greater than ratios for conventional mortgage loans on farms and the interest rate to be higher than those for conventional loans. Investments will not be restricted as to geographical areas. Currently, our properties are located across six states in the U.S. 

We anticipate that we will make substantially all of our investments through our Operating Partnership. Our Operating Partnership may acquire interests in real property in exchange for the issuance of common shares, OP Units, cash or through a combination of the three. OP Units issued by our Operating Partnership will be redeemable for cash or, at our election, shares of our common stock on a one-for-one basis at any time after holding the OP Units for one year. However, we currently, and may in the future, hold some or all of our interests in real properties through one or more wholly-owned subsidiaries, each classified as a qualified REIT subsidiary. 

Property Acquisitions and Leasing 

We anticipate that many of the farms we purchase will be acquired from independent farmers or agricultural companies and that they will simultaneously lease the properties back from us. These transactions will provide the tenants with an alternative to other financing sources, such as borrowing, mortgaging real property or selling securities. We anticipate that some of our transactions will be in conjunction with acquisitions, recapitalizations or other corporate transactions affecting our tenants. We also expect that many of the farms we acquire will be purchased from owners that do not farm the property but rather lease the property to tenant farmers. In situations such as these, we intend to have a lease in place prior to or simultaneously with acquiring the property. For a discussion of the risks associated with leasing property to leveraged tenants, see &#147; Risk Factors &#151; Risks Relating to Our Business and Operations &#151; Some of our tenants may be unable to pay rent, which could adversely affect our cash available to make distributions to our stockholders or otherwise impair the value of your investment .&#148; 

We intend to own primarily single-tenant, agricultural real property. Generally, we will lease properties to tenants that our Adviser deems creditworthy under triple-net leases that will be full-recourse obligations of our tenants or their affiliates. Most of our agricultural leases have original terms ranging from 3 to 10 years for properties growing annual row crops and 5 to 15 years for properties growing permanent crops, often with options to extend the lease further. Rent is generally payable to us on either an annual or semi-annual basis, with one-half due at the beginning of the year and the other half due later in the year. Further, most of our leases contain provisions that provide for annual increases in the rental amounts payable by the tenants, often referred to as escalation clauses. The escalation clauses may specify fixed dollar amount or percentage increases each year, or it may be variable, based on standard cost of living or inflation indices. In addition, some leases that are longer-term in nature may require a regular survey of comparable land rents, with the rent owed per the lease being adjusted to reflect current market rents. We also have leases that include variable rent based on the success of the harvest each year. For these types of variable rent agreements, we generally require the lease to include the guarantee of a minimum amount of rental income that satisfies our investment return criteria. Currently, our 43 farms are leased under agricultural leases with original terms ranging from 3 to 15 years, with 27 farms leased on a pure triple-net basis, and 16 farms leased on a partial-net basis, with the landlord responsible for all or a portion of the related property taxes. 

We believe that we can source farmland to purchase that will rent at annual rental rates providing net capitalization rates ranging from 4.5% to 6.5% of the properties&#146; market values. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve this level of rental rates. Since rental contracts in the farming business for annual row crops are customarily short-term agreements, rental rates are typically renegotiated regularly to then-current market rates. 

&#160;

Underwriting Criteria and Due Diligence Process 

Selecting the Property 

We consider selecting the right properties to purchase or finance as the most important aspect of our business. Buying quality farmland that can be used to grow a variety of different crops and that is located in desirable locations is essential to our success. 

Our Adviser works with real estate contacts in agricultural markets throughout the United States to assess available properties and farming areas. We believe that our Adviser is experienced in selecting valuable farmland and will use this expertise to identify promising properties. The following is a list of important factors in our selection of farmland: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Water availability. Availability of water is essential to farming. We will seek to purchase properties with ample access to water through an operating well on site or rights to use a well or other source that is located nearby. Additionally, we may, in the future, consider acquiring properties that rely on rainfall for water if the tenant on that property mitigates the drought risk by purchasing drought insurance. Typically, leases on properties that would rely on rainfall would be longer term in nature. We do not currently own any properties that rely on rainfall for water, nor do we have any plans to acquire such properties. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Soil composition. In addition to water, for farming efforts to be successful, the soil must be suitable for growing crops. We will not buy or finance any real property that does not have soil conditions that we believe are favorable for growing the crops farmed on the property, except to the extent that a portion of an otherwise suitable property, while not favorable for growing the crops farmed on the property, may be utilized to build structures used in the farming business, such as cooling facilities, packinghouses, silos, greenhouses, storage facilities and distribution centers. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Location. Farming also requires optimal climate and growing seasons. We typically seek to purchase properties in locations that take advantage of climate conditions that are needed to grow fresh produce row crops. We intend to continue to expand throughout the U.S. in locations with productive farmland and financially sound farming tenants. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Price. We intend to purchase and finance properties that we believe are a good value and that we will be able to profitably rent for farming over the long term. Generally, the closer a property is located to urban developments, the higher the value of the property. As a result, properties that are currently located in close proximity to urban developments are likely to be too expensive to justify farming over an extended period of time, and, therefore, we are unlikely to invest in such properties. Our Adviser will perform a due diligence review with respect to each potential property acquisition. Such review will include an evaluation of the physical condition of a property and an environmental site assessment to determine potential environmental liabilities associated with a property prior to its acquisition. One of the criteria that we look for is whether mineral rights to such property, which constitute a separate estate from the surface rights to the property, have been sold to a third party. We generally seek to invest in properties where mineral rights have not been sold to third parties; however, in cases where access to mineral rights would not affect the surface farming operations, we may enter into a lease agreement for the extraction of minerals or other subterranean resources, as we have done on one of our properties. We may seek to acquire mineral rights in connection with the acquisition of future properties to the extent such mineral rights have been sold off and the investment acquisition of such rights is considered to be favorable after our due diligence review. Despite the conduct of these reviews, there can be no assurance that hazardous substances or waste, as determined under present or future federal or state laws or regulations, will not be discovered on the property after we acquire it. See &#147; Risk Factors &#151; Risks Relating to our Business and Operations &#151; Potential liability for environmental matters could adversely affect our financial condition .&#148; 

Our Adviser will also physically inspect each property and the real estate surrounding it to estimate its value. Our Adviser&#146;s due diligence will be primarily focused on valuing each property independent of its rental value to particular tenants to whom we plan to rent. The real estate valuations our Adviser performs will consider one or more of the following items: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The comparable value of similar real property in the same general area of the prospective property. In this regard, comparable property is hard to define since each piece of real estate has its own distinct characteristics. But to the extent possible, comparable property in the area that has sold or is for sale will be used to determine if the price being paid for the property is reasonable. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The comparable real estate rental rates for similar properties in the same area of the prospective property. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Alternative uses for the property to determine if there is another use for the property that would give it higher value, including potential future conversion to urban or suburban uses such as commercial or residential development. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The assessed value as determined by the local real estate taxing authority. In addition, our Adviser may supplement its valuation estimate with an independent real estate appraisal in connection with each investment that it considers. These appraisals may take into consideration, among other things, the terms and conditions of the particular lease transaction, the quality of the tenant&#146;s credit and the conditions of the credit markets at the time the lease transaction is negotiated. However, the actual purchase price of a property may be greater or less than its appraised value. When appropriate, our Adviser may engage experts to undertake some or all of the due diligence efforts described above. 

Underwriting the Tenant, Due Diligence Process and Negotiating Lease Provisions 

In addition to property selection, underwriting the tenant that will lease the property will also be an important aspect of many of our investments. Our Adviser will evaluate the creditworthiness of the tenant and assess its ability to generate sufficient cash flow from its agricultural operations to cover its payment obligations to us pursuant to our lease. Because our tenants are in the farming industry, their cash flows may fluctuate according to season. The following is a list of criteria that our Adviser may consider when evaluating potential tenants for our properties, although not all criteria may be present for each lease: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Experience. We believe that experience is the most significant characteristic when determining the creditworthiness of a tenant. Therefore, we seek to rent our properties to farmers that have an extensive track record of farming their particular crops successfully. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Financial Strength. We seek to rent to farming operations that have financial resources to invest in planting and harvesting their crops. We generally require annual financial statements of the tenant to evaluate the financial capability of the tenant and its ability to perform its obligations under the lease. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Adherence to Quality Standards. We seek to lease our properties to those farmers that are committed to farming in a manner that will generate high-quality crops. We intend to identify such commitment through their track records of selling produce into established distribution chains and outlets. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Lease Provisions that Enhance and Protect Value . When deemed appropriate, our Adviser attempts to include lease provisions that require our consent to specified tenant activity or require the tenant to satisfy specific operating tests. These provisions may include, for example, requiring the tenant to meet operational or financial covenants or to indemnify us against environmental and other contingent liabilities. We believe that these provisions serve to protect our investments from changes in the operating and financial characteristics of a tenant that may impact its ability to satisfy its obligations to us or that could reduce the value of our properties. Our Adviser generally also seeks covenants requiring tenants to receive our consent prior to any change in control of the tenant. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Credit Enhancement. To mitigate risk and enhance the likelihood of tenants satisfying their lease obligations, our Adviser may also seek cross-default provisions if a tenant has multiple obligations to us or seek a letter of credit or a guaranty of lease obligations from each tenant&#146;s corporate affiliates, if any. We believe that these types of credit enhancements, if obtained, provide us with additional financial security. These same enhancements may apply to mortgage loans. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Diversification. Our Adviser will seek to diversify our portfolio to avoid dependence on any one particular tenant or geographic location. By diversifying our portfolio, our Adviser intends to reduce the adverse effect on our portfolio of a single underperforming investment or a downturn in any particular geographic region. Many of the areas in which we purchase or finance properties are likely to have their own microclimates and, although they appear to be in close proximity to one another, generally will not be similarly affected by weather or other natural occurrences at the same time. We currently own properties in six different states across the U.S., and over time, we expect to expand our geographic focus to other areas of the Southeast, Midwest and the Mid-Atlantic. We will also attempt to continue diversifying our portfolio of properties by seeking additional farmland that grows permanent crops, such as bush, tree and vine crops (e.g., fruits and nuts), and commodity crops (e.g., wheat, rice and corn), while maintaining our current focus of owning and leasing farmland that grows fresh produce row crops. While our Adviser seeks tenants it believes to be creditworthy, tenants are not required to meet any minimum rating established by an independent credit rating agency. Our Adviser&#146;s standards for determining whether a particular tenant is creditworthy will vary in accordance with a variety of factors relating to specific prospective tenants. The creditworthiness of a tenant is determined on a tenant-by-tenant and case-by-case basis. Therefore, general standards for creditworthiness cannot be applied. We monitor our tenants&#146; credit quality on an ongoing basis by, among other things, periodically conducting site visits to the properties to ensure farming operations are taking place and to assess the general maintenance of the properties. To date, no changes to credit quality of our tenants have been identified, and all tenants continue to pay pursuant to the terms of their respective leases. 

Mortgage Loans 

Borrower Selection 

Our value-oriented investment philosophy is primarily focused on maximizing yield relative to risk. Upon identifying a potential mortgage opportunity, our Adviser will perform an initial screening to determine whether pursuing intensive due diligence is merited. As part of this process, we have identified several criteria we believe are important in evaluating prospective borrowers. The following criteria provide general guidelines for our investment decisions; however, each prospective borrower may not meet all of these criteria: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Positive cash flow. Our investment philosophy begins with a credit analysis. We intend to generally focus on borrowers to which we can lend at relatively low multiples of operating cash flow and that have positive operating cash flows when the loan is originated. Although we will obtain liens on the underlying real estate and other collateral, we are primarily focused on the predictability of future cash flow from their operations. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Seasoned management with significant equity ownership. Strong, committed management teams are important to the success of any farm, and we intend to lend to farm businesses where strong management teams are already in place with a history of successful crop production and profitable farming operations. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Strong competitive position. We seek to lend to farm businesses that have developed competitive advantages and defensible market positions within their respective markets and are well-positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Exit strategy. We seek to lend to farm businesses that we believe will generate consistent cash flow to repay our loans and reinvest in their respective businesses. We expect such internally-generated cash flow in these farms to be a key means by which borrowers are able to pay off our loans. Mortgage Loan Terms 

We expect that most of the mortgage loans we make will contain some or all of the following terms and conditions: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Loan to value. We will consider the appraised value of each property when we consider a mortgage on that property. Our goal is to loan an amount that is no more than 75% of the appraised value of the real estate. However, there may be circumstances in which we may increase the percentage, such as for land that we would like to own or for a borrower that is well-capitalized. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Cash flow coverage. We expect most borrowers to have a farming operation that has and is expected to continue to have substantial cash flow from its operations. We will seek to loan to businesses that generate operating cash flows of at least 1.2 times the amount of the mortgage payments. However, there may be circumstances in which we may lower that ratio below 1.2, such as for land we would like to own and for borrowers that have cash flow from other operations. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Term. In general, we expect to make mortgage loans of three to five years that will be interest-only, with the entire principal amount due at the end of the term. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Guarantees. In general, we do not expect the owner of the property to personally guarantee the mortgage. However, we do expect the owner to pledge any assets or crops planted on the property as collateral for the loan. Property Review 

We expect to perform a standard review of the property that will be collateral for the mortgage, including many of the following: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; an independent appraisal; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; land record searches for possible restrictions; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; water samples and availability; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; soil samples; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; environmental analysis; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; zoning analysis; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; crop yields; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; possible future uses of the property; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; government regulation impacting the property, including taxes and other restrictions. Underwriting the Borrower 

We view underwriting a borrower in the same way as underwriting a tenant, with criteria similar to those for tenants described above. We believe that, for assessing credit risk, a borrower and tenant are functionally the same, as they each are operating a farm business and will owe us money, either as rent or as interest and principal on a loan. 

Currently, we do not hold any mortgages, and we have not identified any properties for which to make loans secured by mortgages. 

Other Investments 

From time to time, we may purchase cooling facilities, freezer buildings, packinghouses, silos, storage facilities, greenhouses and similar property improvements to rent to independent or corporate farming operations. We may also build these types of buildings on property that we purchase if there is sufficient business to make this worthwhile; however, we do not expect these to be a material portion of our assets. 

Temporary Investments 

Pending investments in real properties or mortgages, we intend to invest significant cash on hand, if any, in permitted temporary investments, which include short-term U.S. Government securities, bank certificates of deposit and other short-term liquid investments. We also may invest in securities that qualify as &#147;real estate assets&#148; and produce qualifying income under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;). 

&#160;

Our Adviser will continually review our investment activity and the composition of our portfolio to ensure that the character of our investments will not cause us to be deemed an &#147;investment&#148; company,&#148; as defined in the Investment Act of 1940. Our working capital and other reserves will be invested in permitted temporary investments. Our Adviser will evaluate the relative risks and rates of return, our cash needs and other appropriate considerations when making short-term investments on our behalf. Such temporary investments may have rates of return that are less or greater than we could obtain from real estate investments. 

Joint Ventures 

We may enter into joint ventures, partnerships and other mutual arrangements with real estate developers, property owners and others for the purpose of obtaining an equity interest in a property in accordance with our investment policies. Many REITs have used joint ventures as sources of capital during periods where debt or equity capital was either unavailable or not available on favorable terms. Joint venture investments could permit us to own interests in large properties without unduly restricting the diversity of our portfolio. We will not enter into a joint venture to make an investment that we would not otherwise be permitted to make on our own. We expect that in any joint venture the cost of structuring joint investments would be shared ratably by us and the other participating investors. 

Use of Leverage 

Our strategy is to use borrowings as a financing mechanism in amounts that we believe will maximize the return to our stockholders. We generally expect to enter into borrowing arrangements directly or indirectly through our Operating Partnership. There is no limitation on the amount we may borrow against any single investment property. Neither our charter nor our bylaws impose any limitation on our borrowing. 

We believe that, by operating on a leveraged basis, we will have more funds available and, therefore, will be able to make more investments than would otherwise be possible. We believe that this will result in a more diversified portfolio. Our Adviser and Administrator will use its best efforts to obtain financing on the most favorable terms available to us. 

We anticipate that our prospective lenders may also seek to include loan provisions whereby the termination or replacement of our Adviser would result in an event of default or an event requiring the immediate repayment of the full outstanding balance of the loan. The replacement or termination of our Adviser may, however, require the prior consent of a lender. 

We may refinance properties during the term of a loan when, in the opinion of our Adviser, a decline in interest rates makes it advisable to prepay an existing mortgage loan, when an existing mortgage loan matures or if an attractive investment becomes available and the proceeds from the refinancing can be used to make such investment. The benefits of the refinancing may include an increase in cash flow resulting from reduced debt service requirements, an increase in distributions to stockholders from proceeds of the refinancing, if any, or an increase in property ownership if some refinancing proceeds are reinvested in real estate. 

Other Investment Policies 

Working Capital Reserves 

We may establish a working capital reserve in an amount that we anticipate to be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements. Our liquidity could be adversely affected by unanticipated costs, greater-than-anticipated operating expenses or cash shortfalls in funding our distributions. To the extent that the working capital reserve is insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, additional funds may be produced from cash generated from operations or through short-term borrowings. In addition, subject to limitations described in this Form 10-K, we may incur indebtedness in connection with: 

&#160;

Holding Period For and Sale of Investments; Reinvestment of Sale Proceeds 

We intend to hold each property we acquire for an extended period until it can be sold for conversion into urban or suburban uses, such as residential or commercial development. However, circumstances might arise which could result in the earlier sale of some properties. We may sell a property before the end of its expected holding period if, in the judgment of our Adviser, the sale of the property is in the best interest of our stockholders. The determination of whether a particular property should be sold or otherwise disposed of will be made after consideration of several relevant factors, including prevailing economic conditions, with a view to achieving maximum capital appreciation. No assurance can be given that the foregoing objective will be realized. The selling price of a property which is subject to a net lease will be determined in large part by the amount of rent payable under the lease and the creditworthiness of the tenant. In connection with our sales of properties we may lend the purchaser all or a portion of the purchase price. In these instances, our taxable income may exceed the cash received in the sale, which could cause us to delay required distributions to our stockholders. 

The terms of any sale will be dictated by market terms customary in the area in which the property being sold is located and the then-prevailing economic conditions. A decision to provide financing to any purchaser would be made only after an investigation into and consideration of the same factors considered in underwriting tenants, such as creditworthiness and likelihood of future financial stability, as are undertaken when we consider a net lease transaction; see &#147; Our Investment Process &#151; Underwriting Criteria and Due Diligence Process &#151; Underwriting the Tenant, Due Diligence Process and Negotiating Lease Provisions .&#148; We may continually reinvest the proceeds of property sales in investments that either we or our Adviser believe will satisfy our investment policies. 

Investment Limitations 

There are numerous limitations on the manner in which we may invest our funds. We have adopted a policy that without the permission of our Board of Directors, we will not: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; invest 50% or more of our total assets in a particular property or mortgage at the time of investment; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; invest in real property owned by our Adviser, any of its affiliates or any business in which our Adviser or any of its affiliates have invested; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; invest in commodities or commodity futures contracts, with this limitation not being applicable to futures contracts when used solely for the purpose of hedging in connection with our ordinary business of investing in properties and making mortgage loans; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; invest in contracts for the sale of real estate unless the contract is in recordable form and is appropriately recorded in the chain of title; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; issue equity securities on a deferred payment basis or other similar arrangement; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; grant warrants or options to purchase shares of our stock to our Adviser or its affiliates; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; engage in trading, as compared with investment activities, or engage in the business of underwriting, or the agency distribution of, securities issued by other persons; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; invest more than 5% of the value of our assets in the securities of any one issuer if the investment would cause us to fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; invest in securities representing more than 10% of the outstanding securities (by vote or value) of any one issuer if the investment would cause us to fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; acquire securities in any company holding investments or engaging in activities prohibited in the foregoing clauses; or &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; make or invest in mortgage loans that are subordinate to any mortgage or equity interest of any of our affiliates. Future Revisions in Policies and Strategies 

Our independent directors will review our investment policies at least annually to determine whether the policies continue to be in the best interest of our stockholders. The methods of implementing our investment policies also may vary as new investment techniques are developed. The methods of implementing our investment procedures, objectives and policies, except as otherwise provided in our bylaws or articles of incorporation, may be altered by a majority of our directors, including a majority of our independent directors, without the approval of our stockholders, to the extent that our Board of Directors and the independent directors thereon determine that such modification is in the best interest of the stockholders. 

Conflict of Interest Policy 

We have adopted policies to reduce potential conflicts of interest. In addition, our directors are subject to certain provisions of Maryland law that are designed to minimize conflicts. However, we cannot assure you that these policies or provisions of law will reduce or eliminate the influence of these conflicts. 

We have adopted a policy that, without the approval of a majority of our independent directors, we will not: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; acquire from or sell to any of our officers or directors, the employees of our Adviser or Administrator, or any entity in which any of our officers, directors or such employees has an interest of more than 5%, any assets or other property; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; borrow from any of our directors or officers, the employees of our Adviser or Administrator, or any entity in which any of our officers, directors or such employees has an interest of more than 5%; or &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; engage in any other transaction with any of our directors or officers, the employees of our Adviser or Administrator, or any entity in which any of our directors, officers or such employees has an interest of more than 5%. Consistent with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we will not extend credit, or arrange for the extension of credit, to any of our directors and officers. Under the Maryland General Corporation Law, a contract or other transaction between us and one of our directors or officers or any other entity in which one of our directors or officers is also a director or officer or has a material financial interest is not void or voidable solely on the grounds of the common directorship or interest, the fact that the director or officer was present at the meeting at which the contract or transaction was approved or the fact that the director&#146;s vote was counted in favor of the contract or transaction if: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the material facts relating to the common directorship or interest and as to the transaction are disclosed to our Board of Directors or a committee of our Board, and our Board or the committee in good faith authorizes the contract or transaction by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors not interested in the contract or transaction, even if the disinterested directors do not constitute a quorum of the Board or committee; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the fact of the common directorship or interest is disclosed to our stockholders entitled to vote on the contract or transaction, and the contract or transaction is approved or ratified by a majority of the votes cast by the stockholders entitled to vote on the matter, other than shares owned of record or beneficially by the interested director, corporation or entity; or &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the contract or transaction is fair and reasonable to us as of the time authorized, approved or ratified by the Board of Directors, a committee or the stockholders. &#160;

Our policy also prohibits us from purchasing any real property from, or co-investing in any real property with, our Adviser, any of its affiliates or any business in which our Adviser or any of its subsidiaries have invested. If we decide to change this policy on co-investments with our Adviser or its affiliates, we will seek approval of our independent directors. 

Code of Ethics 

The Company and its affiliates, including, but not limited to, Gladstone Capital Corporation (&#147;Gladstone Capital&#148;), Gladstone Investment Corporation (&#147;Gladstone Investment&#148;), Gladstone Commercial Corporation (&#147;Gladstone Commercial&#148;), our Adviser, our Administrator and Gladstone Securities, LLC, have adopted a code of ethics and business conduct applicable to all personnel of such companies that complies with the guidelines set forth in Item 406 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act. This code, among other things, establishes procedures for personal investments, restricts certain transactions by such personnel and requires the reporting of certain transactions and holdings by such personnel. A copy of this code is available for review, free of charge, at our website at www.GladstoneLand.com . We intend to provide any required disclosure of any amendments to or waivers of the provisions of this code by posting information regarding any such amendment or waiver to our website within four days of its effectiveness. 

Our Adviser and Administrator 

We are externally managed by our Adviser, which was incorporated in 2002. The officers, directors and employees of our Adviser have significant experience in making investments in and lending to businesses of all sizes, including investing in real estate and making mortgage loans. We entered into an amended and restated Advisory Agreement with our Adviser (the &#147;Amended Advisory Agreement&#148;), under which our Adviser is responsible for managing our assets and liabilities, for operating our business on a day-to-day basis and for identifying, evaluating, negotiating and consummating investment transactions consistent with our investment policies as determined by our Board of Directors from time to time. 

Our Administrator employs our chief financial officer, treasurer, chief compliance officer, general counsel and secretary (who also serves as our Administrator&#146;s president) and their respective staffs and provides administrative services to us under the amended and restated Administration Agreement (the &#147;Amended Administration Agreement&#148;). 

David Gladstone, our chairman, chief executive officer, president and largest stockholder, is also the chairman, chief executive officer and the controlling stockholder of our Adviser and our Administrator. Terry Lee Brubaker, our vice chairman and chief operating officer and a member of our Board of Directors, also serves in the same capacities for our Adviser and Administrator. 

Our Adviser maintains an investment committee that evaluates each of our investments. This investment committee is currently comprised of Messrs. Gladstone and Brubaker. We believe that the review process of our Adviser&#146;s investment committee gives us a unique competitive advantage over other agricultural real estate companies because of the substantial experience that the members possess and their unique perspective in evaluating the blend of corporate credit, real estate and lease terms that collectively combine to provide an acceptable risk for our investments. 

Our Adviser&#146;s board of directors has empowered the investment committee to authorize and approve our investments, subject to the terms of the Amended Advisory Agreement. Before we acquire any property, the transaction will be reviewed by the investment committee to ensure that, in its view, the proposed transaction satisfies our investment criteria and is within our investment policies. Approval by the investment committee will generally be the final step in the property acquisition approval process, although the separate approval of our Board of Directors is required in certain circumstances described below. 

Our Adviser and Administrator are headquartered in McLean, Virginia, a suburb of Washington D.C., and our Adviser also has offices in several other states. 

Amended and Restated Advisory and Administration Agreements 

Through January 31, 2013, we were managed pursuant to an investment advisory agreement with our Adviser, under which our Adviser directly employed certain of our personnel and paid their payroll, benefits and general expenses directly. Through January 31, 2013, our Administrator provided administrative services to us pursuant to a separate administration agreement. Upon the closing of our IPO, on January 31, 2013, we entered into amended and restated versions of each of the advisory and administration agreements. Summaries of the Amended Advisory and Administration Agreements are below. 

&#160;

Amended Advisory Agreement 

Base Management Fee 

Pursuant to the Amended Advisory Agreement that went into effect on February 1, 2013, we pay an annual base management fee equal to a percentage of our adjusted stockholders&#146; equity, which is defined as our total stockholders&#146; equity at the end of each quarter less the recorded value of any preferred stock we may issue and, for 2013 only, any uninvested cash proceeds from the IPO. For 2013, the base management fee was set at 1.0% of our adjusted stockholders&#146; equity; however, beginning January 1, 2014, we pay a base management fee equal to 2.0% of our adjusted stockholders&#146; equity, which no longer excludes uninvested cash proceeds from the IPO. 

Incentive Fee 

Pursuant to the Amended Advisory Agreement, we also pay an additional quarterly incentive fee based on funds from operations (&#147;FFO&#148;). For purposes of calculating the incentive fee, our FFO, before giving effect to any incentive fee (our &#147;Pre-Incentive Fee FFO&#148;) will include any realized capital gains or losses, less any distributions paid on preferred stock we may issue, but will not include any unrealized capital gains or losses. The incentive fee will reward our Adviser if our Pre-Incentive Fee FFO for a particular calendar quarter exceeds a hurdle rate of 1.75% (7% annualized) of our total stockholders&#146; equity at the end of the quarter. We pay our Adviser an incentive fee with respect to our Pre-Incentive Fee FFO quarterly, as follows: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; no incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which our Pre-Incentive fee FFO does not exceed the hurdle rate of 1.75% (7% annualized); &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; 100% of the amount of the Pre-Incentive fee FFO that exceeds the hurdle rate, but is less than 2.1875% in any calendar quarter (8.75% annualized); and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; 20% of the amount of our Pre-Incentive fee FFO that exceeds 2.1875% in any calendar quarter (8.75% annualized). Quarterly Incentive Fee Based on FFO

Adviser Duties and Authority under the Amended Advisory Agreement 

Under the terms of the Amended Advisory Agreement, our Adviser is required to use its best efforts to present to us investment opportunities consistent with our investment policies and objectives as adopted by our Board of Directors. In performing its duties, our Adviser, either directly or indirectly by engaging an affiliate: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; finds, evaluates, presents and recommends to us a continuing series of real estate investment opportunities consistent with our investment policies and objectives; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; provides advice to us and acts on our behalf with respect to the negotiation, acquisition, financing, refinancing, holding, leasing and disposition of real estate investments; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; enters into contracts to purchase real estate on our behalf in compliance with our investment procedures, objectives and policies, subject to approval of our Board of Directors, where required; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; takes the actions and obtains the services necessary to effect the negotiation, acquisition, financing, refinancing holding, leasing and disposition of real estate investments; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; provides day-to-day management of our real estate activities and other administrative services. Our Board of Directors has authorized our Adviser to make investments in any property on our behalf without the prior approval of our Board if the following conditions are satisfied: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; our Adviser has determined that the total cost of the property does not exceed its determined value; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; our Adviser has provided us with a representation that the property, in conjunction with our other investments and proposed investments, is reasonably expected to fulfill our investment objectives and policies as established by our Board of Directors then in effect. The actual terms and conditions of transactions involving investments in properties shall be determined in the sole discretion of our Adviser, subject at all times to compliance with the foregoing requirements. Some types of transactions, however, will require the prior approval of our Board of Directors, including a majority of our independent directors, including, but not limited to, the following: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; any acquisition which at the time of investment would have a cost exceeding 50% of our total assets; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; transactions that involve conflicts of interest with our Adviser (other than reimbursement of expenses in accordance with the Amended Advisory Agreement). Amended Administration Agreement 

Pursuant to the Amended Administration Agreement that went into effect on February 1, 2013, we pay for our allocable portion of the Administrator&#146;s expenses incurred while performing services to us, including, but not limited to, rent and the salaries and benefits expenses of our Administrator&#146;s employees, including our chief financial officer, treasurer, chief compliance officer, general counsel and secretary (who also serves as our Administrator&#146;s president) and their respective staffs. From February 1, 2013, through June 30, 2014, our allocable portion of these expenses was generally derived by multiplying that portion of the Administrator&#146;s expenses allocable to all funds managed by the Adviser by the percentage of our total assets at the beginning of each quarter in comparison to the total assets of all funds managed by our Adviser. 

As approved by our Board of Directors, effective July 1, 2014, our allocable portion of the Administrator&#146;s expenses is now generally derived by multiplying our Administrator&#146;s total expenses by the approximate percentage of time the Administrator&#146;s employees perform services for us in relation to their time spent performing services for all companies serviced by our Administrator under similar contractual agreements. This change in methodology resulted in an increase in the fee we paid to our Administrator of approximately 137% for the six months ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the first six months of fiscal year 2014 and an increase of 135% for the six months ended June 30, 2015, as compared to the respective prior-year period. Management believes that the new methodology of allocating the Administrator&#146;s total expenses by approximate percentages of time services were performed more accurately approximates the fees incurred for the actual services performed. 

Our Adviser and Administrator also engage in other business ventures and, as a result, their resources are not dedicated exclusively to our business. For example, our Adviser and Administrator also serve as the external adviser and administrator, respectively, to Gladstone Capital and Gladstone Investment, both publicly-traded business development companies affiliated with us, and Gladstone Commercial, a publicly-traded REIT, also affiliated with us. However, under the Amended Advisory Agreement, our Adviser is required to devote sufficient resources to the administration of our affairs to discharge its obligations under the agreement. The Amended Advisory Agreement is not assignable or transferable by either us or our Adviser without the consent of the other party, except that our Adviser may assign the Amended Advisory Agreement to an affiliate for whom our Adviser agrees to guarantee its obligations to us. Either we or our Adviser may assign or transfer the Amended Advisory Agreement to a successor entity. 

&#160;

Employees 

We do not currently have any employees and do not expect to have any employees in the foreseeable future. Currently, services necessary for our business are provided by individuals who are employees of our Adviser and our Administrator pursuant to the terms of the Amended Advisory Agreement and the Amended Administration Agreement, respectively. Each of our executive officers is an executive officer of each our Adviser and our Administrator. We expect that approximately 15% to 20% of the full-time employees of our Adviser and our Administrator will spend substantial time on our matters during the 2015 calendar year. To the extent that we acquire more investments, we anticipate that the number of employees of our Adviser and our Administrator who devote time to our matters will increase and the number of our Adviser&#146;s employees working out of local offices, if any, where we buy land will also increase. 

As of December 31, 2015, our Adviser and our Administrator, collectively, had 66 full-time employees. A breakdown thereof is summarized by functional area in the table below: 

&#160;

Number of Individuals 

&#160; Functional Area 

11 &#160; Executive Management 38 &#160; Investment Management, Portfolio Management and Due Diligence 17 &#160; Administration, Accounting, Compliance, Human Resources, Legal and Treasury Competition 

Competition to our efforts to acquire farmland can come from many different entities. Developers, municipalities, individual farmers, agriculture corporations, institutional investors and others compete for farmland acreage. Investment firms that we might compete directly against could include agricultural investment firms, such as Hancock Agricultural Investment Group, Prudential Agricultural Investments and UBS Agrivest, LLC. These firms engage in the acquisition, asset management, valuation and disposition of farmland properties. Further competition may also come from other publicly-traded agricultural REITs, such as American Farmland Company and Farmland Partners, Inc. In addition to competition for direct investment in farmland we also expect to compete for mortgages with many local and national banks, such as Rabobank, N.A., Bank of America, N.A., Wells Fargo Foothill, Inc., and others. 

Environmental Matters 

As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances and also could be liable to third parties resulting from environmental contamination or noncompliance at our properties. Environmental laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of the contaminants. The costs of any required investigation or cleanup of these substances could be substantial. The liability is generally not limited under such laws and could exceed the property&#146;s value and the aggregate assets of the liable party. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our properties also may expose us to third-party liability for personal injury or property damage or adversely affect our ability to lease the real property or to borrow using the real estate as collateral. These and other risks related to environmental matters are described in more detail in &#147; Item 1A. Risk Factors .&#148; 

Tenants 

We rent our properties to 33 different independent and corporate farming operations, all of which are unrelated to us. 2 of our 38 leases currently in place are with Dole Food Company (&#147;Dole&#148;) and expire in 2020. These two leases represented approximately 24.8% of our rental revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, down from 40.4% for the prior-year period. In addition, a separate tenant accounted for approximately $1.3 million, or 10.7% of the total rental revenue recorded during the year ended December 31, 2015. We expect that our tenant base will become more diversified in the future as we acquire more farmland.
