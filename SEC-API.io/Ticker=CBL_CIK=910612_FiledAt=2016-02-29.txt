 ITEM 1. BUSINESS &#160; 

Background 

CBL &#38; Associates Properties, Inc. (&#8220;CBL&#8221;) was organized on July 13, 1993, as a Delaware corporation, to acquire substantially all of the real estate properties owned by CBL &#38; Associates, Inc., which was formed by Charles B. Lebovitz in 1978, and by certain of its related parties. On November 3, 1993, CBL completed an initial public offering (the &#8220;Offering&#8221;). Simultaneously with the completion of the Offering, CBL &#38; Associates, Inc., its shareholders and affiliates and certain senior officers of the Company (collectively, &#8220;CBL&#8217;s Predecessor&#8221;) transferred substantially all of their interests in its real estate properties to CBL &#38; Associates Limited Partnership (the &#8220;Operating Partnership&#8221;) in exchange for common units of limited partner interest in the Operating Partnership. The interests in the Operating Partnership contain certain conversion rights that are more fully described in Note 7 &#32;to the consolidated financial statements. The terms &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; refer to the Company or the Company and the Operating Partnership collectively, as the context requires. 

The Company&#8217;s Business 

We are a self-managed, self-administered, fully integrated REIT. We own, develop, acquire, lease, manage, and operate regional shopping malls, open-air and mixed-use centers, outlet centers, associated centers, community centers and office properties. Our Properties are located in 27 &#32;states, but are primarily in the southeastern and midwestern United States. We have elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. 

We conduct substantially all of our business through the Operating Partnership. We are the 100% &#32;owner of two &#32;qualified REIT subsidiaries, CBL Holdings I, Inc. and CBL Holdings II, Inc. CBL Holdings I, Inc. is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. At December 31, 2015 , CBL Holdings I, Inc. owned a 1.0% &#32;general partner interest and CBL Holdings II, Inc. owned an 84.3% &#32;limited partner interest in the Operating Partnership, for a combined interest held by us of 85.3% . 

As of December 31, 2015 , we owned interests in the following Properties:

Category consists of regional malls, open-air centers and outlet centers (including one mixed-use center) (the "Malls"). 

(2) 

Includes CBL's corporate office buildings. 

(3) 

The Operating Partnership accounts for these investments using the equity method because one or more of the other partners have substantive participating rights. 

At December 31, 2015 , we had interests in the following Properties under development ("Construction Properties"):

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8212; 

We also hold options to acquire certain development properties owned by third parties. 

As of December 31, 2015 , we owned mortgages on five &#32;Properties, each of which is collateralized by either a first mortgage, a second mortgage or by assignment of 100% of the ownership interests in the underlying real estate and related improvements (the &#8220;Mortgages&#8221;). 

The Malls, Associated Centers, Community Centers, Office Buildings, Construction Properties and Mortgages are collectively referred to as the &#8220;Properties&#8221; and individually as a &#8220;Property.&#8221; 

&#32;2 

We conduct our property management and development activities through CBL &#38; Associates Management, Inc. (the &#8220;Management Company&#8221;) to comply with certain requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Internal Revenue Code"). The Operating Partnership owns 100% &#32;of the Management Company&#8217;s outstanding preferred stock and common stock. 

The Management Company manages all but nine of the Properties. Governor&#8217;s Square and Governor&#8217;s Plaza in Clarksville, TN, Kentucky Oaks Mall in Paducah, KY and Fremaux Town Center in Slidell, LA are all owned by unconsolidated joint ventures and are managed by a property manager that is affiliated with the third party partner, which receives a fee for its services. The third party partner of each of these Properties controls the cash flow distributions, although our approval is required for certain major decisions. The Outlet Shoppes at Oklahoma City in Oklahoma City, OK, The Outlet Shoppes at Gettysburg in Gettysburg, PA, The Outlet Shoppes at El Paso in El Paso, TX, The Outlet Shoppes at Atlanta in Woodstock, GA and The Outlet Shoppes of the Bluegrass in Simpsonville, KY are owned by consolidated joint ventures and managed by a property manager that is affiliated with the third party partner, which receives a fee for its services. 

Revenues are primarily derived from leases with retail tenants and generally include fixed minimum rents, percentage rents based on tenants&#8217; sales volumes and reimbursements from tenants for expenditures related to real estate taxes, insurance, common area maintenance and other recoverable operating expenses, as well as certain capital expenditures. We also generate revenues from management, leasing and development fees, sponsorships, sales of peripheral land at the Properties and from sales of operating real estate assets when it is determined that we can realize an appropriate value for the assets. Proceeds from such sales are generally used to retire related indebtedness or reduce outstanding balances on our credit facilities.

Growth Strategy 

Our objective is to achieve growth in funds from operations (see page 76 for a discussion of funds from operations) and reduce our overall cost of debt and equity by maximizing same-center net operating income ("NOI"), total earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") and cash flows through a variety of methods as further discussed below. 

&#32;4 

Leasing, Management and Marketing &#160; 

Our objective is to maximize cash flows from our existing Properties through: 

&#9642; 

aggressive leasing that seeks to increase occupancy and facilitate an optimal merchandise mix, 

&#9642; 

originating and renewing leases at higher gross rents per square foot compared to the previous lease, 

&#9642; 

merchandising, marketing, sponsorship and promotional activities and 

&#9642; 

actively controlling operating costs. 

Redevelopments &#160; 

Redevelopments represent situations where we capitalize on opportunities to add incremental square footage or increase the productivity of previously occupied space through aesthetic upgrades, retenanting and/or changing the use of the space. Many times, redevelopments result from acquiring possession of Anchor space (such as former Sears and JC Penney stores) and subdividing it into multiple spaces. The following presents the redevelopments we completed during 2015 &#32;and those under construction at December 31, 2015 &#32;(dollars in thousands):

Renovations 

Renovations usually include remodeling and upgrading existing facades, uniform signage, new entrances and floor coverings, updating interior d&#233;cor, resurfacing parking lots and improving the lighting of interiors and parking lots. Renovations can result in attracting new retailers, increased rental rates, sales and occupancy levels and maintaining the Property's market dominance. Our 2015 renovation program included upgrades at five of our malls including Dakota Square Mall in Minot, ND; Janesville Mall in Janesville, WI; Laurel Park Place in Livonia, MI; Monroeville Mall in Pittsburgh, PA and Sunrise Mall in Brownsville, TX. Renovation expenditures for 2015 included certain capital expenditures related to the parking decks at West County Center. We invested $30.8 million in renovations in 2015. The total investment in the renovations that are scheduled for 2016 is projected to be $15.0 million, which includes approximately $7.0 million, at our share, of a $13.8 million renovation at CoolSprings Galleria in Nashville, TN as well as other eco-friendly green renovations. 

&#32;5 

Development of New Retail Properties and Expansions 

In general, we seek development opportunities in middle-market trade areas that we believe are under-served by existing retail operations. These middle-markets must also have sufficient demographics to provide the opportunity to effectively maintain a competitive position. The following presents the new developments we opened during 2015 &#32;and those under construction at December 31, 2015 &#32;(dollars in thousands):

We can also generate additional revenues by expanding a Property through the addition of department stores, mall stores and large retail formats. An expansion also protects the Property's competitive position within its market.

Shadow Development Pipeline 

We are continually pursuing new development opportunities and have projects in various stages of pre-development. Our shadow pipeline consists of projects for Properties on which we have completed initial project analysis and design but which have not commenced construction as of December 31, 2015 . The following presents our shadow development pipeline at December 31, 2015 &#32;(dollars in thousands):

Acquisitions 

We believe there is opportunity for growth through acquisitions of regional malls and other associated properties that complement our portfolio. We selectively acquire properties we believe can appreciate in value by increasing NOI through our development, leasing and management expertise. 

Environmental Matters 

A discussion of the current effects and potential future impacts on our business and Properties of compliance with federal, state and local environmental regulations is presented in Item 1A &#32;of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the subheading &#8220;Risks Related to Real Estate Investments.&#8221; 

Competition 

The Properties compete with various shopping facilities in attracting retailers to lease space. In addition, retailers at our Properties face competition from discount shopping centers, outlet centers, wholesale clubs, direct mail, television shopping networks, the internet and other retail shopping developments. The extent of the retail competition varies from market to market. We work aggressively to attract customers through marketing promotions and campaigns. Many of our retailers have adopted an omni-channel approach which leverages sales through both on-line and in-store retailing channels. 

Seasonality 

The shopping center business is, to some extent, seasonal in nature with tenants typically achieving the highest levels of sales during the fourth quarter due to the holiday season, which generally results in higher percentage rent income in the fourth quarter. Additionally, the Malls earn most of their &#8220;temporary&#8221; rents (rents from short-term tenants) during the holiday period. Thus, occupancy levels and revenue production are generally the highest in the fourth quarter of each year. Results of operations realized in any one quarter may not be indicative of the results likely to be experienced over the course of our fiscal year. 

Recent Developments 

Acquisitions 

In June 2015, we acquired Mayfaire Town Center and Community Center for $192.0 million in cash. We subsequently sold Mayfaire Community Center in December 2015 for $56.3 million. See Note 3 &#32;and Note 4 &#32;to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

&#32;7 

Dispositions 

We sold a mall, three associated centers and two community centers in 2015 &#32;for an aggregate gross sales price of $104.9 million . After loan repayment, commissions and closing costs, the sales generated an aggregate $103.5 million &#32;of net proceeds. See Note 4 &#32;to the consolidated financial statements for further information. We also sold two apartment complexes for an aggregate $29.0 million net sales price and received approximately $29.0 million from outparcel sales. 

Impairment Losses 

During the year ended December 31, 2015 , we recorded a loss on impairment totaling $105.9 million. Of this total, $100.0 million relates to Chesterfield Mall, a Non-Core Property, $2.6 million is attributable to one Mall disposition, $1.9 million relates to the disposition of an Associated Center and $1.4 million is from the sale of two outparcels and a building at a formerly owned Mall. See Note 4 &#32;and Note 15 &#32;to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

Financing and Capital Markets Activity &#160; 

We continue to progress in our strategy to build a high-quality unencumbered pool of Properties in addition to balancing our leverage structure. Highlights of financing and capital markets activity for the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;include the following: 

&#8226; 

obtained an investment grade rating of BBB- from Standard &#38; Poor's Rating Services ("S&#38;P"); 

&#8226; 

extended and modified our three unsecured credit facilities totaling $1.1 billion , reducing the borrowing spread to a rate of LIBOR plus 120 &#32;basis points and also reducing the annual facility fee to 25 basis points, based upon our current credit ratings, which represents an aggregate 25 basis points improvement over the rate on the previous facilities; 

&#8226; 

closed on a new four-year (including extensions) $350.0 million &#32;unsecured term loan, bearing interest at LIBOR plus 135 &#32;basis points, based upon our current credit ratings; 

&#8226; 

completed $314.5 million of new secured non-recourse financings at a weighted-average interest rate of 4.07%, representing a 178 basis point improvement over the interest rate borne by the maturing loans; 

&#8226; 

retired approximately $432 million of consolidated property-specific loans, adding more than $742 million of undepreciated book value to our unencumbered pool; and 

&#8226; 

sold one mall, three associated centers, two community centers, interests in two Class-A apartment complexes and outparcels to generate gross proceeds of over $150 million, which were used to reduce the balances on our lines of credit.
