 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

We are the world's largest bedding provider. We develop, manufacture, market, and distribute bedding products, which we sell globally in approximately 100 countries. Our brand portfolio includes many highly recognized brands in the industry, including TEMPUR&#174;, Tempur-Pedic&#174;, Sealy&#174;, Sealy Posturepedic&#174;, and Stearns &#38; Foster&#174;. Our comprehensive suite of bedding products offers a variety of products to consumers across a broad range of channels. 

Prior to January 1, 2015, the Company operated under three reportable segments: Tempur North America, Tempur International and Sealy. Effective January 1, 2015, the Company realigned its organizational structure and updated its segments in light of the progress made in 2013 and 2014 integrating Sealy into its historical business. The Company's updated reportable segments are North America and International. Corporate operating expenses are not included in either of the segments and are presented separately as a reconciling item to consolidated results. These segments are strategic business units that are managed separately based on geography. Our North America segment consists of Tempur and Sealy manufacturing and distribution subsidiaries, joint ventures and licensees located in the U.S. and Canada. Our International segment consists of Tempur and Sealy manufacturing and distribution subsidiaries, joint ventures and licensees located in Europe, Asia-Pacific and Latin America. The Company evaluates segment performance based on net sales, gross profit and operating income. Financial information about our segments and geographic areas is included in Part II, ITEM 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 18, Business Segment Information, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, ITEM 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Report.

Strategy 

&#160; 

We believe our future growth potential is significant in our existing markets and through expansion into new markets. Our goal is to improve the sleep of more people, every night, all around the world. It is our goal to become the share leader in every country we compete in. In order to achieve our long-term growth potential while managing the current economic and competitive environment, we will focus on investing in our brands, developing consumer-preferred products, expanding distribution and striving for highest dealer advocacy and, where appropriate, making strategic acquisitions. In addition, we will focus on improving our cost competitiveness to fund our investments, expand margins and grow stockholder value. 

&#160; 

Acquisition of Sealy 

On March 18, 2013, we completed the acquisition of Sealy (&#8220;Sealy Acquisition&#8221;) and its subsidiaries, which manufacture and market a broad range of mattresses and foundations under the Sealy&#174;, Sealy Posturepedic&#174;, Optimum&#8482; and Stearns &#38; Foster&#174; brands. Our acquisition of Sealy is more fully described in Note 3 , &#8220; Acquisitions and Divestitures &#8221;, in our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, ITEM 8 of this Report. 

&#160; 

Our Products and Brands 

We have a comprehensive offering of products that appeal to a broad range of consumers, some of which are covered by one or more patents and/or patent applications. We also routinely introduce new mattress models, launch new products and update our existing mattress products in each of our segments. Our products are divided into two categories, as described below: 

&#8226; 

Bedding &#32;- Our bedding product category includes mattresses, foundations and adjustable foundations and represented 91.6% &#32;of our net sales in 2015. 

&#8226; 

Other - Our other products include pillows, mattress covers, sheets, cushions and various other comfort products and represented 8.4% &#32;of our net sales in 2015. 

In order to achieve our goal to improve the sleep of more people, every night, all around the world, one of our strategic initiatives is to leverage and strengthen our comprehensive portfolio of iconic brands and products. We offer a complete and complementary portfolio of brands, which are described below: 

&#8226; 

Tempur-Pedic &#32;- Founded in 1991, the Tempur brand is our specialty innovation category leader designed to provide life changing sleep for our wellness seeking consumers. Our proprietary Tempur material precisely adapts to the shape, weight and temperature of the consumer and creates fewer pressure points, reduces motion transfer and provides personalized comfort and support. 

&#8226; 

Stearns &#38; Foster &#32;- The Stearns &#38; Foster brand offers our consumers high quality mattresses built by certified craftsmen who have been specially trained. Founded in 1846, the brand is designed and built with precise engineering and relentless attention to detail and fuses new innovative technologies with time-honored techniques, creating supremely comfortable beds. 

&#8226; 

Posturepedic &#32;- The Posturepedic brand, introduced in 1950, is engineered to provide all-over support and body alignment to allow full relaxation and deliver a comfortable night's sleep. 

&#8226; 

Sealy &#32;- The Sealy brand originated in 1881 in Sealy, Texas, and for over a century has focused on offering trusted comfort, durability and excellent value while maintaining contemporary styles and great support. 

Our 2015 product introductions included the TEMPUR-Flex collection, which provides all of the famous adaptive sleep benefits of TEMPUR&#174; material with a slightly springy feel. The TEMPUR-Flex collection uses hybrid construction to deliver a unique new TEMPUR feel with more responsive support. The TEMPUR-Flex collection also features an EasyRefresh&#8482; removable cover and a cool-to-the-touch SmartClimate&#8482; system. In addition, we updated our Sealy Posturepedic line in 2015, which includes the Posturepedic Series, Posturepedic Plus Series and Posturepedic Premier Hybrid Series. The new Sealy Posturepedic mattresses feature encased coils, gel memory foam and a core support center. We also introduced a limited edition collection of Stearns &#38; Foster mattresses and, internationally, introduced Tempur North, a new bed system that will be marketed primarily in Northern European markets. 

Our 2016 product introductions included the new Stearns &#38; Foster&#174; Reserve Collection, which offers our exclusive Hybrid Pillow Top featuring our Nano Comfort&#8482; Quilt Layer. The innovative mattress top design delivers precise support, superior adaptability and light-as-air comfort. The specially engineered Nano Comfort&#8482; Quilt Layer places thousands of super-small coils between layers of memory foam for durable and conforming support. In addition, we updated our existing Stearns &#38; Foster&#174; Estate, Lux Estate and Lux Estate Hybrid product lines, which, along with the Reserve Collection, now offer four exclusive features: IntelliCoil&#174; Advanced coil design, PrecisionEdge&#8482; high-density border system, PrimaCool&#8482; performance fabric and Advanced Adapt&#8482; memory foam. We also updated our TEMPUR-Breeze line to include a state-of-the art PureCool&#8482; Comfort technology, an ultra breathable design and a premium cooling cover. These upgrades provide more refreshing sleep for consumers seeking a cooler sleeping environment. 

Our Channels 

We sell our products through two channels: Retail and Other. 

Retail &#32; 

Our Retail channel sells to furniture and bedding retailers, department stores and warehouse clubs, among others and represented 91.2% &#32;of net sales in 2015 . Our top five customers accounted for approximately 39.4% &#32;of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 . Mattress Firm Holding Corp., which is represented in the North America segment, is our largest customer. On February 5, 2016, Mattress Firm Holding Corp. acquired all of the outstanding equity interests in HMK Mattress Holdings, LLC ("Sleepy&#8217;s"). Sleepy&#8217;s was also one of our top 5 customers in 2015 and as a result of this acquisition, based on 2015 net sales, the combined companies will be our largest customer, and will represent a significant portion of our overall sales. Mattress Firm and Sleepy&#8217;s together represented approximately 25% of our overall net sales for 2015. Additionally, we have a long-term supply agreement in place with Mattress Firm, which we have recently extended. The loss of one or more of these customers could negatively impact our profitability. 

Other 

Our Other channel sells directly to consumers through e-commerce platforms, company owned stores and call centers, and to third party, healthcare and hospitality customers and represented 8.8% &#32;of net sales in 2015 . Third party includes sales to distributors in countries where we do not sell directly through our own subsidiaries. Healthcare includes sales to hospitals, nursing homes, healthcare professionals and medical retailers. Hospitality sales include hotels. 

Marketing 

Our overall marketing strategy is to drive consumer demand through the use of effective marketing. We invest across multiple media platforms to build brand awareness and drive consumer interest in our products. Our strategy varies by segment; however the majority of our advertising programs are created on a centralized basis through our in-house advertising organization. In 2016 we plan to drive growth through continued investments in new products, marketing and other initiatives. 

North America 

Our North America segment sells primarily through the Retail channel, which contributed 95.5% &#32;of North America segment sales in 2015 . In North America, we advertise nationally on television, digitally and through consumer and trade print. In addition, we participate in cooperative advertising on a shared basis with some of our retail customers. Throughout the year, we relied on a series of strategic initiatives, which included: new product introductions, advertising and in-store marketing investments. 

International 

Our International segment sells primarily through the Retail channel, which contributed 72.0% &#32;of International segment net sales in 2015 . Our advertising strategy in our International segment focuses on building brand awareness, which we believe is important to increasing our overall market share. We advertise on television, digitally and through consumer and trade print, as well as cooperative advertising on a shared basis with some of our retail customers. We believe there is significant opportunity to drive sales growth in our International segment through the expansion of product lines within existing channels, increasing our market share in previously underpenetrated markets and, where appropriate, entering into new markets. 

&#32; &#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

We believe that our sales of products to furniture and bedding stores are typically subject to modest seasonality inherent in the bedding industry, with sales expected to be generally lower in the second and fourth quarters and higher in the first and third quarters. Internationally, we are subject to seasonality with European net sales lower in the third quarter as compared to the other quarters during the year. Typical seasonality patterns may be affected by significant new product launches, which also generate an increase in floor model discounts as we deploy new products to our customers. In 2015 and 2014, we experienced stronger sales in the third and fourth quarters due to product launches in the first half of the year. 

Operations 

&#160; 

Manufacturing and Distribution. Our products are currently manufactured and distributed through our global network of facilities. 

&#160; 

Suppliers. We obtain the raw materials used to produce our pressure-relieving TEMPUR&#174; material from outside sources. We currently acquire chemicals and proprietary additives for Tempur products from a number of suppliers with manufacturing locations around the world. These supplier relationships may be revised in order to maintain quality, cost, and delivery expectations. We do not consider ourselves dependent upon any single outside vendor as a source of raw materials for Tempur products and believe that sufficient alternative sources of supply for the same or similar raw materials are available. Additionally, we source a portion of the manufacturing of our adjustable bed bases and foundations from third party manufacturers. We do not consider ourselves dependent upon any single outside manufacturer as a source of these products. 

In our Sealy products, our raw materials consist of polyurethane foam, polyester, polyethylene foam and steel innerspring components that we purchase from various suppliers. In the U.S. and Canada, we source the majority of our requirements for polyurethane foam components and spring components for our Sealy mattress units from a key supplier for each component. In the U.S. and Canada, we rely upon a single supplier for certain polyurethane foam components and spring components in our Sealy mattress units. These components are purchased under a supply agreement. We also purchase a significant portion of our Sealy foundation parts from third party sources under supply agreements, which require that we maintain certain volume allocations based on a proportional amount of material purchases. These volume allocations do not represent fixed purchase commitments. We are also dependent on a single supplier for the visco-elastic components and assembly of our Optimum&#8482; &#32; specialty product lines. Except for our dependence regarding polyurethane foam, visco-elastic components and assembly of our Optimum&#8482; specialty product lines, we do not consider ourselves to be dependent upon any single outside vendor as a source of supply to our bedding business, and we believe that sufficient alternative sources of supply for the same, similar or alternative components are available. 

&#160; 

Research and Development. We have four research and development centers, three in the U.S. and one in Denmark, which conduct technology and product development. Additionally, we have a product testing facility that conducts hundreds of consumer tests annually. We believe our consumer-research driven approach to innovation results in best-in-class products that benefit the consumer. Research and development expenses were $28.7 million , $21.6 million &#32;and $21.0 million &#32;in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. 

Industry 

We compete in the global bedding industry, comprised of mattresses and foundations, pillows and accessories. The mattress market category is comprised of traditional innerspring mattresses, as well as non-innerspring mattresses that include visco-elastic and foam mattresses, innerspring/foam hybrid mattresses, airbeds and latex mattresses. The foundation category is comprised of traditional foundations and adjustable foundations. The primary distribution channels for mattresses and foundations are retail furniture and bedding stores, department stores and warehouse clubs. Additionally, the pillow market is comprised of traditional foam and feather pillows, as well as pillows made of visco-elastic, latex, foam, sponge, rubber and down. 

The U.S. is the largest market in which we compete. Since 1995, U.S. wholesale bedding sales, which include mattresses and foundations, have grown at a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 4.9% , reaching approximately $7,524.0 million &#32;in 2014 according to the International Sleep Products Association (&#8220;ISPA&#8221;). This growth has been driven by the increase in the U.S. population, natural replacement cycle of mattresses and an increase in the average unit selling prices (&#8220;AUSPs&#8221;). 

The U.S. mattress industry has benefited from a steady increase in AUSP over the past three decades, due in particular to the growth in premium priced non-innerspring mattresses but also due to various other factors, including an increase in the percentage of larger sized mattresses sold. As consumers have become increasingly aware of the health benefits of a good night&#8217;s sleep, which is often associated with the quality of their mattress, consumers have demonstrated a growing willingness to increase spending for higher quality mattresses and related bedding products. This trend has been further supported by the demographic shift in the population to consumers who are 45-64 years old and typically have a higher level of disposable income. The U.S. mattress industry has responded with the development of new, innovative technologies. Mattresses with enhanced features are typically sold at higher prices than traditional innerspring mattresses. 

The traditional mattress innerspring category continues to account for the majority of industry mattress revenues; however the market for non-innerspring mattresses continues to grow. In 2014, traditional innerspring mattresses, excluding foundations, represented approximately $4,400.0 million &#32;of the bedding industry, and non-innerspring mattresses, excluding foundations, represented approximately $1,900.0 million &#32;of the industry, according to ISPA. The market for non-innerspring mattresses was 

30.0% &#32;of the overall U.S. mattress industry in 2014, according to ISPA. 

The U.S. mattress industry has historically been correlated with the health of the overall economy and a significant portion of new mattress purchases are typically driven by the replacement cycle. Factors that have shown some level of association with industry sales include overall GDP, housing turnover, personal disposable income, consumer confidence, interest rates and employment levels. As such, during recessionary periods, demand for mattresses declines as consumers reduce spending and delay discretionary purchases. During the most recent recession in 2008 and 2009, wholesale bedding sales experienced the greatest year-over-year decline in the past 20 years. Although demand improved in subsequent years, the increase in units sold was slower than in years following prior recessionary periods. Assuming the health of the overall economy continues to improve, we believe the mattress industry is well positioned for future growth. 

Competition 

The global bedding industry is highly competitive. We encounter competition from a number of mattress and foundation manufacturers in both domestic and international markets, as well as competition from a number of pillow and other bedding accessories manufacturers. Participants in each of these markets compete primarily on price, quality, brand name recognition, product availability and product performance. 

We have a portfolio of brands and a complementary product offering, addressing most price points, consumer preferences and points of distribution. Our mattress products compete with a number of different types of mattresses, including innerspring mattresses, visco-elastic mattresses, foam mattresses, hybrid innerspring/foam mattresses, futons, air beds and other air-supported mattresses. These competing products are sold through a variety of channels, including furniture and bedding stores, department stores, mass merchants, wholesale clubs, Internet, telemarketing programs, television infomercials and catalogs. The U.S. pillow industry is characterized by a large number of competitors, none of which are dominant. 

The U.S. mattress market has experienced consolidation in recent years. We, together with Serta Simmons, collectively accounted for a significant share of the wholesale bedding industry revenues in 2014 based on figures obtained from ISPA and Furniture/Today &#32;industry publications. The balance of the mattress market in the U.S. is served by a large number of other manufacturers, including Select Comfort Corporation, which focuses on air beds and other air-supported mattresses, and many others operating on a regional basis. 

The international market for mattresses and pillows is generally served by a large number of manufacturers, primarily operating on a regional and local basis. These manufacturers offer a broad range of mattress and pillow products. 

The highly competitive nature of the mattress and pillow industries means we are continually subject to the risk of loss of market share, loss of significant customers, reductions in margins, and the inability to acquire new customers. 

Intellectual Property 

Patents, Trademarks and Licensing 

&#160; 

We hold various U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications regarding certain elements of the design and function of many of our mattress and pillow products. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015 , we held trademark registrations worldwide, which we believe have significant value and are important to the marketing of our products to retailers. TEMPUR&#174; and Tempur-Pedic&#174; are trademarks registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In addition, we have U.S. applications pending for additional trademarks. Several of our trademarks have been registered, or are the subject of pending applications, in various foreign countries. Each U.S. trademark registration is renewable indefinitely as long as the trademark remains in use. We also own numerous of trademarks, trade names, service marks, logos and design marks, including Sealy&#174;, Stearns &#38; Foster&#174; and Sealy Posturepedic&#174;. We also license the Bassett&#174; trade name in various territories under a long term agreement. 

&#160; 

We derive income from royalties by licensing Sealy&#174; brands, technology and trademarks to other manufacturers. Our licenses include rights for the licensees to use trademarks as well as current proprietary or patented technology utilized by us. We also provide our licensees with product specifications, research and development, statistical services and marketing programs. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , the licensing group as a whole generated unaffiliated net royalties of approximately $18.3 million . 

Governmental Regulation 

&#160; 

Our operations are subject to state, local and foreign consumer protection and other regulations relating to the mattress and pillow industry. These regulations vary among the states and countries in which we do business. The regulations generally impose requirements as to the proper labeling of bedding merchandise, restrictions regarding the identification of merchandise as &#8220;new&#8221; or otherwise, controls as to hygiene and other aspects of product handling and sale and penalties for violations. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has adopted rules relating to fire retardancy standards for the mattress industry. Many foreign jurisdictions also regulate fire retardancy standards. Future changes to these standards may require modifications to our products to comply with these additional standards. We are also subject to environmental and health and safety requirements with regard to the manufacture of our products and conduct of our operations and facilities. We have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures necessary to comply with these requirements. Currently these expenditures are immaterial to our financial results. 

Our principal waste products are foam and fabric scraps, wood, cardboard and other non-hazardous materials derived from product component supplies and packaging. We also periodically dispose of (primarily by recycling) small amounts of used machine lubricating oil and air compressor waste oil. In the United States, we are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental health and safety, including the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act. We believe that we are in compliance with all applicable international, federal, state and local environmental statutes and regulations. Except as set forth in &#8220;Legal Proceedings&#8221;, included in Part I, ITEM 3 of this Report, compliance with international, federal, state or local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, should not have any material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. We are not aware of any pending federal environmental legislation which would have a material impact on our operations. Except as set forth in &#8220;Legal Proceedings&#8221;, included in Part I, ITEM 3 of this Report, we have not been required to make and do not expect to make any material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in the foreseeable future. 

&#32;Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015 &#32;we had approximately 7,200 Tempur Sealy employees, approximately 4,700 of which are located in North America and 2,500 in the rest of world. Approximately 40.0% &#32;of our employees are represented by various labor unions with separate collective bargaining agreements. Due to the large number of collective bargaining agreements, we are periodically in negotiations with certain of the unions representing our employees. We consider our overall relations with our workforce to be satisfactory. Our current collective bargaining agreements, which are typically three years in length, expire at various times beginning in 2016 through 2019. As of December 31, 2015 , our domestic operations employed approximately 770 &#32;individuals covered under collective bargaining agreements expiring in 2016. Our international operations employed approximately 400 &#32;individuals covered under collective bargaining agreements expiring in 2016.
