BUSINESS 

Overview 

As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221;, &#8220;our&#8221;, &#8220;the Company&#8221; and &#8220;BSQUARE&#8221; refer to BSQUARE Corporation. We primarily resell software from Microsoft Corporation (&#8220;Microsoft&#8221;) and provide software solutions and related engineering services to companies that develop smart, connected systems. A smart, connected system is a dedicated purpose computing device that typically has a display, runs an operating system (e.g., Microsoft &#174; Windows &#174; CE or Google Android TM platform) and is usually connected to a network or data cloud via a wired or wireless connection. Examples of smart, connected systems include set-top boxes, home gateways, point-of-sale terminals, kiosks, voting machines, gaming platforms, tablets, handheld data collection devices, personal media players, smart phones, smart vending machines, ATM machines, casino gaming machines, digital signs and in-vehicle telematics and entertainment devices. We focus on smart, connected systems that utilize various Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems as well as devices running other popular operating systems such as Android, Linux, and QNX. 

We have been providing software solutions for smart, connected systems since our inception. Our customers include world class original equipment manufacturers (&#8220;OEMs&#8221;), original design manufacturers (&#8220;ODMs&#8221;) and corporate enterprises (&#8220;Enterprises&#8221;), as well as silicon vendors (&#8220;SVs&#8221;) and peripheral vendors which purchase our software solutions for purposes of facilitating processor and peripheral sales. In the case of Enterprises, our customers include those that develop, market and distribute smart, connected systems on their own behalf as well as those that purchase systems from OEMs or ODMs and require additional software, integration and/or testing. The software solutions we provide are utilized and deployed throughout various phases of our customers&#8217; device life cycle, including design, development, customization, quality assurance and deployment. 

Increasingly, we are focusing on developing and offering our own products such as DataV TM to address the emerging Internet of Things (&#8220;IoT&#8221;) market, which is the interconnection of uniquely identifiable embedded computing devices within the existing internet infrastructure. DataV is an actionable data solution for the IoT market that includes software products, applications and services that turn raw device data into useful, meaningful and actionable data.

We were incorporated in the State of Washington in July 1994. Our principal office is located at 110 110th Avenue NE, Suite 300, Bellevue, Washington 98004, and our telephone number is (425) 519-5900. 

&#160;

Industry Background 

The increasing opportunity for connectivity and exchange of data coupled with the rise of cloud storage and cloud computing infrastructure is driving new applications for smart, connected systems of all kinds. 

The smart, connected systems industry is characterized by a wide variety of software and hardware configurations and end-user applications, often designed to address a specific vertical market. To accommodate these diverse characteristics in a cost-effective manner, OEMs, ODMs and Enterprises require operating systems and software that can support a diverse set of hardware requirements and connect to a wide variety of networks, systems, peripherals, content and applications. 

The smart, connected systems marketplace is being influenced by the following factors: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Continuing demand by business professionals and consumers for integrated mobile devices, which combine telephony, data (such as email and internet browsing), multimedia, location awareness and cameras; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Businesses are increasingly deploying specialized devices in stores, shopping centers, shop floors, etc., or to their employees who work in the field but need connectivity to business systems and data; 

&#160;

&#183; 

The ubiquity of cellular and wireless local area networks (&#8220;WLANs&#8221;) is driving rapid adoption of smart connected systems that leverage broadband and high-speed wireless data networks, including Internet Protocol (&#8220;IP&#8221;) set-top boxes, voice-over-IP (&#8220;VoIP&#8221;) phones, residential gateways, and home networking solutions linking smart connected systems with personal computers; 

&#160;

&#183; 

The vastly increasing number of sensors and similar devices requires new solutions for these devices to interact with other devices autonomously through the &#8220;Internet of Things&#8221; and to provide data to applications, both those that reside local to the device and those running in the cloud; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Expectations for device functionality continue to grow. Users expect to be able to access email and the internet, synchronize their devices with cloud and corporate data sources and deploy multiple applications on their devices; 

&#160;

&#183; 

The availability of multimedia content has increased demand for high-performance, multimedia-capable devices that are able to access, share and play audio, video and application content located on remote computers; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Security is an increasingly important concern as devices are now often able to access networks and store sensitive information locally such as email, spreadsheets and other documents. Users are demanding that these types of information be protected in the same ways they are protected on the desktop; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Higher bandwidth networks coupled with larger displays and increased processing power found on new devices means that more multimedia content will be available to devices&#8212;increasing demand for digital rights management, content management and related technologies; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

Increase in device complexity is being driven by rising user expectations of functionality, complex device interactions with wireless networks and updated versions of embedded operating systems and silicon processors, all of which are driving OEMs, ODMs and Enterprises to continually refresh and update their device designs. 

Software Solutions and Related Engineering Services for Smart Connected Systems 

Our customers include world class OEMs and ODMs, Enterprises, SVs and peripheral vendors which are developing smart connected systems or assisting others in doing so. Representative customer engagements in 2015 included the following: 

&#160;

&#183; 

We continued support of the second generation of MyFord Touch, a product of Ford Motor Company (&#8220;Ford&#8221;). The MyFord Touch infotainment system is an in-car communications and entertainment system which enables drivers of Ford&#8217;s car offerings to access a wide range of connected information and entertainment experiences including music and multi-media services, hands-free telephony, internet-enabled applications, language services, news and navigation; 

&#160;

&#183; 

The Coca-Cola Company (&#8220;Coca-Cola&#8221;) continues to engage us in the development and support of Freestyle &#174; , its next generation drink dispensing machine; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

We continued work with Google to assist in the development of their advanced technology &#8220;Project Tango.&#8221; We have expanded our work with Google to include additional projects. 

The software we deliver to our customers as part of our smart connected software solutions takes three forms. The first is our own proprietary software products, the second is best-of-class third-party software products and the last is custom software delivered through our engineering services teams. The majority of the software we sell is from Microsoft. Due to the complexity of embedded software, the integration of our own proprietary software, third-party software products and customer software on 

&#160;

customers&#8217; devices often requires us to provide addi tional engineering services addressing systems integration, customization and/or optimization as well as quality assurance testing. Our goal is to increase the breadth and depth of our software product and engineering service offerings to our customers to enhance our position as an overall smart connected software solutions provider.

Sales and Marketing 

We market our software solutions and engineering services utilizing a direct sales model. We have sales personnel throughout the United States and in Taiwan, the United Kingdom and Japan. Historically, we have not made significant use of resellers, channel partners, representative agents or other indirect channels. 

Key elements of our sales and marketing strategy include direct marketing, content marketing, trade shows, event marketing, public relations, analyst relations, social media properties, customer and strategic alliance partner co-marketing programs and a comprehensive website. We rely significantly on lead referral and other marketing support programs from strategic partners. 

&#160;

We perform our research and development primarily utilizing engineering staff located in the United States. Research and development expense was $1.6 million and $1.7 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our primary focus in 2015 has been research and development on our new DataV products.

Competition 

The market for smart, connected systems software and services is extremely competitive. We face competition from the following: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating system distributors such as Arrow Electronics, Inc., Avnet, Inc. and Synnex Corporation in Taiwan; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Our current and potential customers&#8217; internal research and development departments, which may seek to develop their own software solutions which compete with our proprietary software products and engineering services; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Engineering service firms, including off-shore development companies, such as Adeneo, SymphonyTeleca division of Harmon Industries and Wipro; 

&#160;

&#183; 

ODMs, particularly those in Taiwan and China, which have added or are adding software development capabilities to their offerings; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Contract manufacturers which have added or are adding software development capabilities to their offerings; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Mobile and embedded test automation providers including Perfecto Mobile, mVerify, JAMO Solutions, SmartBear Software (AutomatedQA), TestPlant (eggPlant) and Keynote. In this market we also compete against customers&#8217; internally created tools and against manual testing; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Marketing agencies and specialized vendors who provide mobile application services; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

The growing Internet of Things market will provide increasing competition from a number of additional software and service providers as we focus on this market in 2016 and beyond. 

Some of our competitors focus on only one aspect of our business or offer complementary products which can be integrated with our products. As we develop and bring to market new software products and service offerings, we may begin competing with companies with which we have not previously competed. Further, as we expand the geographic markets into which we sell our software solutions and related services, or increase our penetration therein, we may expect to increasingly compete with companies with which we have not previously competed. It is also possible that new competitors will enter the market or that our competitors will form alliances, including alliances with Microsoft, that may enable them to rapidly increase their market share. 

Microsoft has not agreed to any exclusive arrangement with us, nor has it agreed not to compete with us. Microsoft may decide to bring more of the core embedded development services and expertise that we provide in-house, possibly resulting in reduced software and service revenue opportunities for us. The barrier to entering the market as a provider of Microsoft-based smart connected systems software and services is low. In addition, Microsoft has created marketing programs to encourage systems integrators to work on Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating system software and services. These systems integrators are given substantially the same access by Microsoft to the Microsoft technology as we are. New competitors may have lower overhead than we do and may be able to undercut our pricing. We expect that competition will increase as other established and emerging companies enter the connected device market, and as new products and technologies are introduced. 

International Operations 

Our international operations outside of North America consist principally of engineering services operations in Taipei, Taiwan and Trowbridge, England. We have a sales and sales support office in Tokyo, Japan. Because our OEM Distribution Agreement with Microsoft for the sale of Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems (e.g. Windows Embedded Compact) has been, until relatively recently, restricted to North America, including Mexico, the majority of our revenue continues to be generated from North America. In 2015, revenue generated from customers located outside of North America was 8% of total revenue, compared to 10% in 2014. The decrease in revenue from outside of North America in 2015 was primarily attributable to lower service revenue in Asia as a result of the completion of a large handheld project in Japan during 2014.

&#160;

See Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors,&#8221; and Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,&#8221; for more information regarding our international operations.

Intellectual Property and Other Proprietary Rights 

In general, we strive to protect our intellectual property rights through patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and through contractual arrangements. However, we cannot be certain that our efforts will be effective to prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property, or to prevent the development and design by others of products or technologies similar to, or competitive with, those developed by us. 

Additionally, because a significant portion of our revenue relates to the sale of third-party software products, we also rely on our partners, particularly Microsoft, to appropriately protect their own intellectual property. 

As of December 31, 2015 we had eight issued United States (&#8220;US&#8221;) patents and one pending US patent application that has been allowed and that we expect will issue in 2016. We also have a number of registered trademarks in various jurisdictions. We will continue to pursue appropriate protections for our intellectual property. 

See Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors,&#8221; for more information regarding our intellectual property and other proprietary rights.
