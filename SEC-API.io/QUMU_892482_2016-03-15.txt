History 

The Company was founded in 1978, incorporated as IXI, Inc. in Minnesota in February 1987 and changed its name to Rimage Corporation in April 1988. From 1995 to 2011, the Company focused its business on the development and sale of its CD recordable publishing systems and DVD recordable publishing systems. 

In response to declines in the disc publishing business due to technology substitutions and the rise of video as a communication and collaboration tool, in October 2011, the Company acquired Qumu, Inc., a leader in the enterprise video content management software market and changed its name to Qumu Corporation in September 2013. Qumu completed the transition to an enterprise video content management software company in July 2014, when the Company closed on the sale of its disc publishing assets to Equus Holdings, Inc. and Redwood Acquisition, Inc. (now known as Rimage Corporation). 

On October 3, 2014, the Company acquired Kulu Valley Ltd., a private limited company incorporated in England and Wales (&#8220;Kulu Valley&#8221;). The acquisition was made to expand Qumu&#8217;s addressable market through the offering of Kulu Valley&#8217;s best-in-class video content creation capabilities and easy-to-deploy pure cloud solution, and provides Kulu Valley&#8217;s customers with access to industry leading video content management and delivery capability. 

Enterprise Video Content Management and Delivery Software 

To increase communication, engagement and collaboration between employees and stakeholders, organizations have invested significantly in content and network infrastructure that connects these employees and stakeholders across offices, conference rooms, computers, tablets and smart phones. As part of this, enterprises are adopting video as a mainstream communication and collaboration tool because they understand its benefits over other forms of content. 

Qumu video content management software solutions allow organizations to create, capture, organize and deliver content across the extended enterprise to a wide variety of end points, including mobile devices and thick or thin clients. Qumu's video platform supports both live and on-demand streaming, and also secure download capabilities, a critical component for mobile video solutions. Qumu provides information technology administrators and corporate communication leaders a way to securely address the challenges of video that might otherwise overwhelm their data networks while utilizing their existing information technology infrastructures, thereby maximizing their investment and enabling the rapid adoption of video in their content, collaboration, communication and marketing infrastructures. 

Qumu provides an end-to-end solution with an intuitive and rich user-experience to create, manage and deliver live and on-demand video content both behind and beyond the secure firewall. 

Capabilities and Products 

Qumu Platform - Creating a Global Video Infrastructure for Organizations 

The Qumu platform is a video content management software solution that can be deployed as a perpetual software license, a term software license or a cloud-hosted software as a service (SaaS). Qumu&#8217;s implementations can range in size from tens of thousands to millions of dollars, and they integrate with customers' existing video services (e.g., videoconferencing systems), business applications and broader IT infrastructures using Qumu's extensive application services or "APIs". Deployments also range from a single customer location to a global infrastructure serving over one hundred thousand corporate employees. Qumu&#8217;s platform solution components are deployed as needed to serve different capabilities of the enterprise video content lifecycle of creating, capturing, managing, delivering and experiencing video content. 

Video Capture 

&#8226; 

Qumu Capture Studio is a portable software-enabled device that quickly and easily records, edits, and publishes video and presentation content. 

&#8226; 

Qumu Quick Capture is a browser-based applet for the simple creation of videos captured from a user's computer screen and/or webcam. 

&#8226; 

Qumu's encoder control facilitates live encoding and can leverage popular encoders from multiple vendors. 

&#8226; 

Qumu also integrates with videoconferencing systems or Unified Communication software to enable their use as &#8220;studios&#8221; for the creation of live or on-demand video content. 

&#8226; 

Qumu&#8217;s Creator provides ease of use for anyone to create slides and video at the desktop to produce their own rich content. 

Video Management 

Qumu&#8217;s platform is an enterprise scalable solution that provides central control for all video applications, content and resources involved in the production and delivery of enterprise video. Video Control Center manages both live streamed video and video on-demand workflows. This comprehensive business video platform includes numerous industry leading features: 

&#8226; 

Patent pending Qumu Pathfinder technology for intelligent routing to multiple device types with different bitrates, enabling more efficient use of the network and improved user experience. 

&#8226; 

Qumu Speech Search for searching and indexing the spoken dialogue within video programs, greatly reducing time-to-knowledge. 

&#8226; 

Live Broadcast Console for managing and deploying live streamed videos across an organization. 

&#8226; 

Broad and deep security capabilities encompassing single-sign-on ("SSO"), Active Directory/LDAP integration, and Security Assertion Markup Language ("SAML") that make it easy to create a secure video application and network based on the enterprise's existing security standards. 

Video Delivery 

&#8226; 

The combination of Pathfinder with Qumu&#8217;s VideoNet Edge software creates a unique, highly secure, fault tolerant video delivery network with advanced streaming and caching features to provide outstanding performance for an unlimited number of users. By ensuring that only one stream crosses the WAN on its way to viewers in remote locations, VideoNet Edge minimizes the strain placed on the network by live webcasting or video on demand. VideoNet Edge can work as the sole distribution platform for video or in conjunction with other enterprise or internet-based content distribution networks (&#8220;CDNs&#8221;). Qumu VideoNet Edge provides caching of H.264/MPEG-4, Windows Media &#38; Flash video, Video on Demand and live broadcast content, reducing traffic from the centrally-located origin server. Importantly, Qumu offers VideoNet Edge software in a variety of form factors (Windows Software, virtual machine, appliance, and integrated with Citrix CloudBridge and Riverbed VSP) to provide customers with the most deployment options. 

&#8226; 

Qumu VideoNet Edge software solutions can federate existing CDNs into a single system for intranet and internet content distribution of video and related media assets. The federation capability includes Internet-based CDNs like Akamai and Amazon CloudFront as well as intranet based devices like Riverbed Steelhead, Cisco ACNS/WaaS/CDS, and Blue Coat Director. This federation capability allows customers and partners to execute an &#8220;embrace and replace&#8221; strategy for upgrading their networks as opposed to &#8220;rip and replace&#8221; from other vendors. 

&#8226; 

Qumu Secure Download allows video to be securely delivered to mobile devices, viewed offline, and managed/disposed automatically based on prescribed policies. 

Mobility and Integration 

&#8226; 

Qumu provides Mobile Apps for iOS, Android and Windows phones and tablets. The apps are complete out-of-the-box native video applications built using the Qumu Mobile SDKs.

Qumu&#8217;s HTML5-based video portal also provides native support for all device platforms. 

&#8226;

&#8226;

Analytics on origin and viewership are easily captured and integrated back for targeted marketing and sales.

Marketing and Distribution 

Qumu&#8217;s solutions serve a growing customer base of large enterprises across a wide range of vertical and horizontal markets. Qumu has primarily targeted enterprises with 10,000+ employees and a history of video use for corporate communications. Beginning in 2014, Qumu increased its efforts and ability in targeting mid-size businesses with less than 10,000 employees by promoting the new cloud deployment model. 

Qumu serves its customer base via direct sales and channel partners offering a variety of deployment methodologies and business models to meet customer demand including software, software on server appliance, software-enabled devices, SaaS and managed services. During 2014, Qumu increased its focus and investment on channel and technology partners to expand the reach of the Company&#8217;s solutions. 

In 2015, Qumu was selected as a leader in the industry by three leading industry analysts: 

&#8226; 

Gartner selected Qumu as a leader in their Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Video Content Management. 

&#8226; 

Forrester selected Qumu as a leader in their Forrester Wave report for Enterprise Webcast, Enterprise Video Portal, and Enterprise Webcast and Video Portal combined Wave. 

&#8226; 

Aragon Research named Qumu a leader in their Video Content Management report. 

These selections are visible proof points in the market that had a positive impact on Qumu&#8217;s market awareness and lead generation activities. 

Qumu sells products and services internationally through its U.S. operation and its subsidiaries in Europe and Japan. International sales comprised approximately 27% , 15% and 25% of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Customers in the United Kingdom, where Kulu Valley is located, are a significant source of international sales. 

Competition 

Major competitors of Qumu's include Kaltura, Kontiki, Cisco, Polycom, vBrick, Brightcove and MediaPlatform. Due to Qumu's unique focus on a complete video infrastructure that includes support for mobile devices and existing IT infrastructure, Qumu believes it is able to compete effectively with these competitors. Qumu also differentiates itself from its competitors through its video delivery technology and flexibility as to solution deployment and service options. 

Research and Development 

Qumu develops its software internally and also licenses or purchases the intellectual property ownership rights of programs developed by others with license or technology transfer agreements that may obligate Qumu to pay a flat license fee or royalties, typically based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of the revenue generated by those programs. 

As of December 31, 2015, the Company employed 57 &#32;employees in research and development. This staff engages in research and development of new products and enhancements to existing products. In addition, Qumu partners with third parties to utilize their competencies in creating products to enhance its product offerings.

The Company defines contracted commitments as the dollar value of signed non-cancellable customer purchase commitments. Of the total at December 31, 2015, the Company expects to recognize between $20.0 million and $22.0 million as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016. Actual amounts could differ depending on timing of customer deployments and other factors. 

Intellectual Property and Government Regulation 

Qumu currently maintains two U.S. patents and has three non-provisional utility patent applications pending in the U.S. Further, Qumu protects the proprietary nature of its software primarily through copyright and license agreements.

In addition, Qumu has registered and may in the future register trademarks and other marks used in its business. 

As the number of Qumu's products increases and the functionality of those products expand, Qumu believes that it may become increasingly subject to attempts by others to duplicate its proprietary technology and to the possibility of infringement of its patents. In addition , although Qumu does not believe that any of its products infringe on the rights of others, third parties have claimed, and may in the future claim, Qumu's products infringe on their rights and these third parties may assert infringement claims against Qumu in the future. Qumu may litigate to enforce patents issued to it and to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others or to determine the ownership, scope, or validity of Qumu's proprietary rights and the rights of others. Any claim of infringement against Qumu could involve significant liabilities to third parties, could require Qumu to seek licenses from third parties and could prevent Qumu from developing, selling or using its products.
