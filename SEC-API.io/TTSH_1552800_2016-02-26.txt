&#160; 

The Tile Shop was founded in 1985. We offer a wide selection of manufactured and natural stone tiles, setting and maintenance materials, and related accessories in retail locations across much of the United States. Our assortment includes over 4,000 products from around the world that consist of natural stone, ceramic, porcelain, glass, and metal tiles. Natural stone products including marble, granite, quartz, sandstone, travertine, slate, and onyx tiles. The majority of our tile products are sold under our proprietary Rush River and Fired Earth brands. We purchase our tile products, accessories and tools directly from our network of vendors. We manufacture our own setting and maintenance materials, such as thinset, grout and sealers under our Superior brand name. As of December 31, 2015, we operated 114 stores in 31 states, with an average size of approximately 21,800 square feet. We also sell our products on our website. 

&#160; 

We believe that our long-term vendor relationships, together with our design, manufacturing and distribution capabilities, enable us to offer a broad assortment of high-quality products to our customers, who are primarily homeowners and professionals, at competitive prices. We have invested significant resources to develop our proprietary brands and product sources and believe that we are a leading retailer of stone and ceramic tiles, accessories, and related materials in the United States.

&#160; 

Competitive Strengths 

&#160; 

We believe that the following factors differentiate us from our competitors and position us to continue to grow our specialty tile business. 

&#160; 

Inspiring Customer Experience In each store, our products are brought to life by showcasing a broad array of the items we offer in approximately 50 different mockups, or vignettes, of bathrooms, kitchens, fireplaces, foyers, and other distinct spaces. Our stores are spacious, well-lit, and organized by product type to simplify our customers&#8217; shopping experience. 

&#160; 

Broad Product Assortment at Attractive Prices We offer over 4,000 manufactured and natural tile products, setting and maintenance materials, accessories, and tools. We are able to maintain competitive prices by purchasing tile and accessories directly from producers and manufacturing our own setting and maintenance materials. 

&#160; 

Customer Service and Satisfaction Our sales personnel are highly-trained and knowledgeable about the technical and design aspects of our products. We offer weekly do-it-yourself classes in all of our stores. In addition, we provide one-on-one installation training as required to meet customer needs. We accept returns up to six months following the date of the sale, with no restocking fees. 

&#160; 

Worldwide Sourcing Capabilities We have long-standing relationships with our tile vendors throughout the world and work with them to design products exclusively for us. We believe that these direct relationships differentiate us from our competitors. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Proprietary Branding We sell the majority of our products under our proprietary brand names, which help us to differentiate our products from those of our competitors. We offer products across a range of price points and quality levels that allow us to target discrete market segments and to appeal to diverse groups of customers. 

&#160; 

Centralized Distribution System We service our retail locations from four distribution centers. Our distribution centers, located in Michigan, Oklahoma, Virginia, and Wisconsin, are positioned to cost effectively service our existing stores. 

&#160; &#160; 

Strategic Plan 

&#160; 

Key elements of our strategy include: 

&#160; 

Develop Store Talent &#8211; During 2015, our initiatives to improve hiring and training practices resulted in significant reductions in sales associate turnover and increases to average manager tenure. We plan to continue placing an emphasis on cultivating talent in our stores through recruiting, ongoing education and mentorship efforts. A key element of this strategy involves our Market Managers who are responsible for developing talent and driving profitability within a market. Market Managers are seasoned store managers who reinforce best practices to grow sales, expand product knowledge, enhance profitability and develop a team that is able to produce new leadership candidates. We plan to have Market Managers assigned to all stores in 2016. Additionally, we have created a new Senior Assistant Store Manager position for our top performing Assistant Store Managers who complete all requisite training programs and also distinguish themselves as high profile Store Manager candidates. We believe the ongoing emphasis placed on the combination of recruiting, training and mentorship will continue to reduce turnover and produce the next generation of store leaders to support our long-term growth plans. 

Grow Professional Sales &#8211; During 2015, our initiatives focused on the professional customer resulted in a significant increase in professional customer sales and mix relative to total company sales. The professional customer includes tile contractors, custom home builders and designers. Key elements of this strategy included joining national and local trade organizations, developing marketing strategies, hosting in-store events, enhancing our assortment of tool products and refining our credit policies. We believe that our value propositions including a six month return policy, no restocking fees, store hours, tiered discounts, product availability, wide assortment, private label setting material, in house credit, free design support and job site delivery are un-paralleled in the marketplace. Our professional strategy enables our store associates to develop relationships with professionals in their trade area. Our corporate marketing team supports the stores by developing traffic and &#8220;leads&#8221; through trade organization memberships, direct marketing, co-hosting events in our showrooms and other forms of digital marketing primarily, email marketing. We continuously expand our assortment and merchandising square footage of installation materials and tools to meet the changing and growing needs of our professional customers. We have also implemented training programs and a standard operating process to assist new store sales associates to quickly and successfully develop revenues from professional customers. Creating awareness and increasing the frequency of professional visits to our stores continue to be important elements of our revenue growth plans in 2016 and future periods. 

&#160; 

Increase Store Unit Growth &#8211; We believe we have exceptional opportunities to continue to add stores in existing markets and expand into new markets. We plan to increase our existing store base by 8 to 12 percent each year over the next several years. During 2016, we will focus on opening new stores in existing markets where we will be able to leverage economies of scale in marketing, distribution, and store talent. Additionally, we plan to pursue opportunities to further enhance the return on our new store investments by selecting smaller retail spaces that provides us the opportunity to reduce the initial investment to build a new store and the ongoing occupancy costs. 

&#160; 

Sales Model 

&#160; 

We principally sell our products directly to homeowners and professionals. With regard to individual customers, we believe that due to the average cost and relative infrequency of a tile purchase, many of our individual customers conduct extensive research using multiple channels before making a purchase decision. Our sales strategy emphasizes customer service by providing comprehensive and convenient educational tools on our website and in our stores for our customers to learn about our products and the tile installation process. Our website contains a broad range of information regarding our tile products, setting and maintenance materials, and accessories. Customers can order samples, view catalogs, or purchase products from either our stores or website. Customers can choose to have their purchases delivered or picked up at one of our stores. We believe this strategy also positions us well with professional customers who are influenced by the preferences of individual homeowners. 

&#160; 

Our stores are designed to emphasize our products in a visually appealing showroom format. Our average store is approximately 21,800 square feet, with approximately 19,000 square feet devoted to the showroom and the balance being warehouse space, which is used primarily to hold customer orders waiting to be picked up or delivered. Our stores are typically accessible from major roadways and have significant visibility to passing traffic. We can adapt to a range of existing buildings, whether free-standing or in shopping centers. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Unlike many of our competitors, we devote a substantial portion of our retail store space to showrooms, including samples of our over 4,000 products and approximately 50 different vignettes of bathrooms, kitchens, fireplaces, foyers, outdoor living, and other distinct spaces that showcase our products. Our showrooms are designed to provide our customers with a better understanding of how to integrate various types of tile in order to create an attractive presentation in their homes. Most stores are also equipped with a training center designed to teach customers how to properly install tile. 

&#160; 

A typical store staff consists of a manager, an assistant manager, and five to fifteen staff, including both sales and warehouse associates. Our store managers are responsible for store operations and for overseeing our customers&#8217; shopping experience. 

&#160; 

We offer financing to customers through a branded credit card provided by a third-party consumer finance company. These credit cards, which can only be used in our stores and on our website, give customers the opportunity to purchase tile from our stores at a discounted price. 

&#160; 

Marketing 

&#160; 

We utilize a variety of marketing strategies and programs to acquire and retain customers. Our customers include both consumers and trade professionals. Our advertising primarily consists of digital media, direct marketing including email and postal mail, in store events, mobile and traditional media vehicles including newspaper circular/print ads, radio, television and video. We continually test and learn from new media and adjust our programs based on performance. 

&#160; 

Our e-commerce site, tileshop.com supports desktop, tablet and mobile devices and is designed for consumers, trade professionals and industry stakeholders to learn about; our brand, our value propositions, our product assortment and installation techniques, and to look up our store locations. On social media, #TheTileShop provides current and prospective customers a high level of brand engagement to share their designs and finished projects in our inspiration gallery. Tileshop.com also serves as a commerce platform for our customers who want to purchase products within or outside of our physical store footprint. Products can be delivered to a job site, home or store location. 

&#160; 

Products 

&#160; 

We offer a complete assortment of tile products, generally sourced directly from our vendors, including natural stone, ceramic, porcelain, glass, and metal tiles. Natural stone products include, marble, granite, quartz, sandstone, travertine, slate, and onyx tiles. Our wide assortment of trim pieces, mosaics, pencils, listellos and other unique products encourage our customers to make a fashion statement with their tile project. This also helps deliver a high level of customer satisfaction and drives repeat business. We also offer a broad range of setting and maintenance materials, such as thinset, grout, sealers, and accessories, including installation tools, shower and bath shelves, drains, and similar products. We sell most of our products under our proprietary brand names, including Superior Adhesives &#38; Chemicals, Superior Tools &#38; Supplies, Rush River, and Fired Earth. In total, we offer over 4,000 different tile, setting and maintenance materials and accessory products. In 2015, our net sales were 53% from natural stone products, 35% from ceramic and porcelain products, and 12% from setting, maintenance and related accessory products. These amounts compare to 52% from natural stone products, 34% from ceramic and porcelain products, and 14% from setting, maintenance and other related accessory products in 2014. 

&#160; 

Manufacturers 

&#160; 

We have long-standing relationships with our vendors throughout the world and work with them to design products exclusively for us. We believe that these direct relationships differentiate us from our competitors, who generally purchase products through distributors. 

&#160; 

We currently purchase tile products from approximately 165 different suppliers. Our top ten tile vendors accounted for 41% of our tile purchases in 2015. We believe that alternative and competitive suppliers are available for most of our products. In 2015, 68% of our purchased product was sourced from Asia, 13% from Europe, 17% from North America and 2% from South America. Our foreign purchases are primarily negotiated and paid for in U.S. dollars. 

&#160; 

Distribution and Order Fulfillment 

&#160; 

We take possession of our products in the country of origin and arrange for transportation to our distribution centers located in Michigan, Oklahoma, Virginia and Wisconsin. We also manufacture our setting and maintenance materials at these locations. We maintain a large inventory of products in order to quickly fulfill customer orders. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

We fulfill customer orders primarily by shipping our products to our stores where customers can either pick them up or arrange for home delivery. Orders placed on our website are shipped directly to customers&#8217; homes from our distribution centers or a local store. We continue to evaluate logistics alternatives to best service our retail store base and our customers. We believe that our existing distribution facilities will continue to play an integral role in our growth strategy, and we expect to establish one or more additional distribution centers in the next five years to support geographic expansion of our retail store base. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The retail tile market is highly-fragmented. We compete directly with large national home centers that offer a wide range of home improvement products. In addition, we also compete with regional and local specialty retailers of tile, factory-direct stores, a large number of privately-owned, single-site stores, and on-line only competitors. We also compete indirectly with companies that sell other types of floor coverings, including wood floors, carpet, and vinyl sheet. The barriers to entry into the retail tile industry are relatively low and new or existing tile retailers could enter our markets and increase the competition that we face. Many of our competitors enjoy competitive advantages over us, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more varied product offerings, and greater financial, technical, and other resources. 

&#160; 

We believe that the key competitive factors in the retail tile industry include: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

product assortment; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

product presentation; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

customer service; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

store location; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

immediacy of inventory; and 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

price. 

&#160; 

We believe that we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors by providing a highly diverse selection of products to our customers, at an attractive value, in appealing and convenient retail store locations, with exceptional customer service and on-site instructional opportunities. Further, while some larger factory-direct competitors manufacture their own products, many of our competitors purchase their tile from domestic manufacturers or distributors when they receive an order from a customer. As a result, we believe that it takes these retailers longer than us to deliver products to customers and that their prices tend to be higher than our prices. We also believe that we offer a broader range of products and stronger in-store customer support than these competitors. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 1,410 employees, 1,330 of whom were full-time and none of whom were represented by a union. Of these employees, 1,077 work in our stores, 67 work in corporate, store support, infrastructure or similar functions, and 266 work in distribution and manufacturing facilities. We believe that we have good relations with our employees. 

&#160; 

Property and Trademarks 

&#160; 

We have registered and unregistered trademarks for all of our brands, including 18 registered trademarks. We regard our intellectual property as having significant value and our brands are an important factor in the marketing of our products. Accordingly, we have taken, and continue to take, appropriate steps to protect our intellectual property. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

We are subject to extensive and varied federal, state and local government regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including laws and regulations relating to our relationships with our employees, public health and safety, zoning, and fire codes. We operate each of our stores, offices, and distribution and manufacturing facilities in accordance with standards and procedures designed to comply with applicable laws, codes, and regulations. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Our operations and properties are also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, handling, generation, transportation, treatment, emission, release, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials, substances and wastes and relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties, including off-site disposal locations. We do not incur significant costs complying with environmental laws and regulations. However, we could be subject to material costs, liabilities, or claims relating to environmental compliance in the future, especially in the event of changes in existing laws and regulations or in their interpretation. 

&#160; 

Products that we import into the United States are subject to laws and regulations imposed in conjunction with such importation, including those issued and enforced by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. We work closely with our suppliers to ensure compliance with the applicable laws and regulations in these areas. 

&#160; 

Financial Information about Geographic Areas 

&#160; 

Nearly all of our revenues are generated within the United States and nearly all of our long-lived assets are located within the United States as well. In 2014, we opened a sourcing office based in China.
