General 

&#160;

Tel-Instrument Electronics Corp. (&#8220;Tel&#8221;, &#8220;TIC&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) has been in business since 1947, and is a leading designer and manufacturer of avionics test and measurement solutions for the global commercial air transport, general aviation, and government/military aerospace and defense markets. The Company designs, manufactures and sells instruments to test and measure, and calibrates and repairs a wide range of airborne navigation and communication equipment.

&#160;

Tel&#8217;s instruments are used to test navigation and communications equipment installed in aircraft, both on the flight line (&#8220;ramp testers&#8221;) and in the maintenance shop (&#8220;bench testers&#8221;), and range in list price from $7,500 to $80,750 per unit. Tel continues to develop new products in anticipation of customers&#8217; needs, and to maintain its strong market position. Its development of multifunction testers has made it easier for customers to perform ramp tests with less operator training, a fewer number of test sets, and lower product support costs.

The Company has become a major manufacturer and supplier of Identification Friend or Foe (&#8220;IFF&#8221;) flight line test equipment. The Company has been awarded two major contracts from both the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Army for IFF flight line test equipment (see below). The products under these contracts represent cutting edge technology and, together with derivative products, should provide Tel with a competitive advantage for years to come. Revenues from these programs will be the foundation for our profitability.

It is important that we capture the major share of the large international IFF market which should generate substantial revenues starting in the 2018 fiscal year timeframe. We believe that we are well positioned as our CRAFT and TS-4530A flight-line test sets have been endorsed by the U.S. military and we have already delivered test sets into 18 international markets. The commercial avionics industry is undergoing a great deal of change and we believe our new hand-held products that we are planning to introduce within the next 12 months will generate increased market share at very attractive gross margin levels. We are also working closely with our military customers on new potential market opportunities that will be needed to maintain our sales and profitability.

Tel believes it has built a solid infrastructure to support its business, and the outlook for the Company to be positive as a result of its improved financial position, core technologies, and customer relations.

We continue to evaluate other attractive potential market opportunities.

Communications/Navigation (COMM/NAV) Radio Frequency (RF) Avionics Flight line Tester&#8221;) (&#8220;CRAFT&#8221;) (AN/USM-708 and AN/USM-719) with the U.S. Navy 

The AN/USM-708, the basic CRAFT test set, is a key product for the Company as it represents a new generation technology product. The AN/USM-708 and AN/USM-719 (IFF only) contract was competitively awarded to the Company by the United States Navy. The AN/USM-708 CRAFT unit combines advanced IFF (including Mode 5 encryption technology) navigation, communication, and sonobuoy test capabilities in a portable test set, which will utilize a flexible and expandable digital-signal-processing-based architecture. Both the AN/USM-708 and the AN/USM-719 have been certified by the AIMS Program Office. This program represented the culmination of a multi-year, multi-million dollar investment by the Company in Mode 5 technology and may provide a significant competitive advantage in the years to come. Management believes that the CRAFT program also has significant potential for sales into the balance of the U.S. Military, NATO, and internationally, as the new Mode 5 IFF systems are installed in overseas aircraft platforms. The Joint Strike Fighter (&#8220;JSF&#8221;) program by itself is expected to generate significant CRAFT orders as this program continues to ramp up limited rate production.

&#160;

The contract for the AN/USM-708 and AN/USM-719 was a significant milestone for the Company because the development of this proprietary technology, which has been funded by the Company, establishes Tel&#8217;s position as a leader in the industry, and will meet the U.S. Navy&#8217;s test requirements for years to come. The Company believes that, given the unique nature of this design, this product will generate sales to other military customers. The CRAFT test set replaces seven obsolete U.S. Navy test sets that collectively cost approximately $300,000, making the CRAFT test set an excellent value to the government. This unit has been well received by the end users. The Company believes that the core technology in the AN/USM-708 can be the foundation for additional military and commercial products.

Communications/Navigation (COMM/NAV) Radio Frequency (RF) Avionics Flight line Tester&#8221;) (&#8220;CRAFT&#8221;) (AN/USM-708 and AN/USM-719) with the U.S. Navy (continued) 

&#160;

The initial contract was for 1,200 test sets with a contract value of approximately $31 million. The Company has received orders for all 1,200 test sets, as well as approximately $4.7 million for testing, documentation and qualification units. In October 2013, the Company received an additional award for CRAFT products with a maximum value of $9.5 million. This new contract is in support of the U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Army and various Foreign Military Sales customers under the Foreign Military Sales program. The Company has received orders totaling approximately $9.2 million under this new contract. This brings the total contract value and orders received to over $40 million.

The Company has received orders from Lockheed Martin for the AN/USM-708 units, totalling approximately $4.4 million. These units are to be used on the JSF F-35 Program. The Company also receives orders from other customers for this product.

As of March 31, 2016, the Company had open orders for AN/USM-708 and AN/USM-719 for 90 test sets, totaling approximately $3 million. This does not include the 36 unit $1.3 million order from the U.S. Special Forces or other Navy orders received after March 31, 2016.

TS-4530A IFF test set with the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command 

&#160;

In February 2009, the Company was awarded a firm fixed price indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity (&#8220;IDIQ&#8221;) contract by the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command with a maximum dollar value of approximately $44 million, depending on the number of units purchased (see Item 3, Legal Proceedings). The Company&#8217;s win of the critical TS-4530A Mode 5 U.S. Army program represented another major event for our future. Management believes that this award, in conjunction with our U.S. Navy CRAFT Mode 5 program, provides Tel with market leadership in the Mode 5 IFF flight-line test business and should provide a significant constant revenue stream going forward. This program takes full advantage of the significant investment that the Company has made in its proprietary Mode 5 technology.

&#160;

The program is for Mode 5 conversion kits and new IFF test sets, which incorporate the Company&#8217;s proprietary electronics and IFF technology in addition to Mode S Enhanced Surveillance (&#8220;EHS&#8221;) and Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (&#8220;ADS-B&#8221;) test functionality. The U.S. Army completed its production assurance review, and the Company has successfully completed testing conducted by the United States Department of Defense (&#8220;DOD&#8221;) AIMS Program Office to approve its TS-4530A Flight Line Test Set authorizing its use for Mark XIIA IFF Mode S (ELS/EHS/ADS-B) and TCAS systems. The TS-4530A program is a critical program which should help drive TIC&#8217;s revenue growth and profitability. (Please see Item 7, Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)

&#160;

The Company has received approximately $26.9 million in delivery orders on the TS-4530A program out of a maximum contract value of approximately $44 million. The Company received a full production release for the kits, and commenced shipment of these kits in July 2014. The U.S. Army has ordered about 50% of the maximum quantity of sets, so any additional U.S. Army kit or set orders would be at higher commercial prices. In August 2015, we received the full rate production release for the TS-4530A SETS from the U.S. Army. The Company continues to explore opportunities for this product in both the domestic and international markets and has received 43 orders at a value of $931,680 outside the contract with the U.S. Army.

As of March 31, 2016, the Company has open orders for 74 kits and 538 sets, totaling $6.5 million.

Intermediate Level TACAN Test Set (&#8220;ITATS&#8221;) ((AN/ARM-206) with the U.S. Navy) 

The AN/ARM-206 or ITATS is a bench test set combining advanced digital technology with state of the art automated testing capabilities. The ITATS product is a fully automated TACAN test set for use in U.S. Navy Intermediate Level repair locations. This product represents an important expansion to Tel&#8217;s current product line, and the automated testing capabilities will provide a significant labor savings benefit to our customers. This contract with the U.S. Navy has options for approximately 148 units with a total value of over $12 million. Given the unique nature of the design, this unit could also generate sales to other military customers, both domestically and overseas.

U.S. Navy issued a production release in February 2013 for 102 units at a contract value of $5.3 million.

In January 2014, the Company received a $2.14 million contract modification on the ITATS program This contract modification entails the sale of certain intellectual property (&#8220;IP&#8221;) to the U.S. Navy plus the sale of ancillary test support equipment, and a modest increase in the recurring price to reflect several product enhancements. As part of this contract modification, the Company sold certain IP in the aggregate amount of $1,526,795 of which $1,200,000 of the IP sale proceeds was paid to the Company&#8217;s subcontractor on this program. As part of this agreement with the Company&#8217;s subcontractor, upon payment of the $1,200,000, the outstanding amount due to the subcontractor in the amount of $790,535 was discharged. The Company also received $117,095 for engineering enhancements for this program. The sale of the IP for the ITATS program should have no impact on sales of these units to the U.S. Navy or other customers. As of March 31, 2016, the Company has open orders for 14 units, totaling $787,000, including enhancements.

We also continue to market this unit to other domestic and international customers and have received interest in this test set from both the U.S. Air Force and various international customers.

Future Prospects 

The Company has built a very solid position in the Mode 5 IFF and TACAN test set market. We believe that we are well positioned as our CRAFT and TS-4530A flight-line test sets have been endorsed by the U.S. military and we have already delivered test sets into 18 international markets. The commercial avionics industry is undergoing a great deal of change, and we believe our new hand-held products, that we are planning to introduce in twelve months, will generate increased market share at very attractive gross margin levels. We are also working closely with our military customers on new potential market opportunities that will be needed to maintain our sales and profitability growth.

During fiscal 2016, the Company received the following significant orders for our legacy products:

&#160;

&#183;

$277,000 from India for T-47G and our new TR-36 Test Sets;

&#160;

&#183;

$102,200 from a U.S. Company for our TR-100AF Test Sets;

&#160;

&#183;

$245,000 from Italy for upgrades to its Precision DME Test Sets;

&#160;

&#183;

$212,000 from our commercial U.S. distributor for TR-220 Test Sets.

&#160;

Historically, the Company receives regular smaller orders for both its commercial and government products, as these products are widely used in the Avionics Test Equipment market.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The Company manufactures and sells commercial and military products as a single avionics business, and its designs and products cross both markets.

&#160;

The general aviation market consists of some 1,000 avionics repair and maintenance service shops at private and commercial airports in the United States which purchase test equipment to assist in the repair of aircraft electronics. The commercial aviation market consists of approximately 80 domestic and foreign commercial airlines.

&#160;

The civilian market for avionic test equipment is dominated by two designers and manufacturers, the Company and Aeroflex, Inc., a division of Cobham (a U.K. company), (&#8220;Aeroflex&#8221;), with Aeroflex being substantially larger than Tel. This market is relatively narrow and highly competitive. Tel has been successful because of its high quality, new technology, user friendly products and competitive prices. 

&#160;

The military market is large and is dominated by large corporations with substantially greater resources than the Company, including Aeroflex. Tel competitively bids for government contracts on the basis of the engineering quality and innovation of its products, competitive price, and "small business set asides" (i.e., statutory provisions requiring the military to entertain bids only from statutorily defined small businesses), and on bids for sub-contracts from major government suppliers. There are a limited number of competitors who are qualified to bid for &#8220;small business set asides.&#8221; The military market consists of many independent purchasing agencies and offices. The process of awarding contracts is heavily regulated by the U.S. Department of Defense. 

Over the last ten years, the Company has won several large, competitively bid contracts from the military and has become the primary supplier for the U.S. Military, as well as the NATO countries, of flight line IFF test equipment. The CRAFT AN/USM-708, CRAFT AN/USM-719,TS-4530A, and TR-47M5 programs, discussed previously, involve a new generation of technology, including the next generation of IFF testing, and is expected to enable the Company to continue to be a major supplier of avionics test equipment to the military for years to come. Tel believes its new technology will also allow it to increase sales to the commercial, avionics market in the future and expand into the very large secure communication test market.

&#160;

Marketing and Distribution 

&#160;

Domestic commercial sales are made throughout the U.S. to commercial airlines and general aviation businesses directly or through distributors. No direct commercial customer accounted for more than 10% of commercial sales in fiscal years 2016 and 2015. Domestic distributors receive a 15%-20% discount for stocking, selling, and, in some cases, providing product calibration and repairs. Tel gives a 5% to 15% discount to non-stocking distributors, and to independent sales representatives, depending on their sales volume and promotional effort. The loss of any one of these distributors would not have a material adverse effect on the Company or its operations. Commercial sales represented 7% and 12% of total sales, respectively, for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015. A commercial distributor represented more than 21% and 22%, respectively, of commercial sales during fiscal years 2016 and 2015.

&#160;

Marketing to the U.S. Government is made directly by employees of the Company or through independent sales representatives, who receive similar commissions to the commercial distributors. For the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, sales to the U.S. Government, including shipments through the government&#8217;s logistics centers, represented approximately 79% and 77%, respectively, of avionics sales. No other government customer represented over 10% of government sales for fiscal years 2016 and 2015.

&#160;

International sales are made throughout the world to government and commercial customers, directly through American export agents, or through the Company&#8217;s overseas distributors at a discount reflecting a 20% to 22% selling commission, under written or oral, year-to-year arrangements. The Company has an exclusive distribution agreement with Muirhead Avionics and Accessories, Ltd (&#8220;Muirhead&#8221;), based in the United Kingdom, to represent the Company in parts of Europe, and with Victory Aerospace in Australia and New Zealand. Tel also sells its products through exclusive distributors in Spain, Portugal, and the Far East and is exploring distribution in other areas. For the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, total international sales were 8% and 10%, respectively, of sales. Additionally, the Company has an agreement with M.P.G. Instruments s.r.l., based in Italy, wherein this distributor has the exclusive sales rights for DME/P ramp and bench test units. The Company continues to explore additional marketing opportunities in other parts of the world, including the Far East. No international distributor accounted for more than 10% of total sales for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015. The Company has no material assets overseas. &#160;

Marketing and Distribution (continued) 

Tel also provides customers with calibration and repair services. Repairs and calibrations accounted for 4% and 5% of sales for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

&#160;

Future domestic market growth, if any, will be affected in part by whether the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (&#8220;FAA&#8221;) implements additional plans to upgrade the U.S. air traffic control system regulations and by continuing recent industry trends towards more sophisticated avionics systems, both of which would require the design and manufacture of new test equipment. The major development in the commercial marketplace is the ADS-B requirement for all aircraft after January 1, 2020. TIC&#8217;s new products will address this testing requirement. Military contracts are awarded and implemented by extensive government regulation. The Company believes its test equipment is recognized by its customers for its quality, durability, reliability, affordability, and by its advanced technology.

Backlog 

&#160;

Set forth below is Tel&#8217;s avionics backlog at March 31, 2016 and 2015:

28,739,776

&#160; &#160;

Tel believes that most of its backlog at March 31, 2016 will be delivered during the next 12-18 months. The backlog is pursuant to purchase orders, and all of the government contracts are fully funded. However, government contracts are always susceptible to termination for convenience by the government. Historically, the Company obtains orders which are required to be filled in less than 12 months, and therefore, these anticipated orders are not reflected in the backlog.

Suppliers 

&#160;

Tel obtains its purchased parts from a number of suppliers. These materials are standard in the industry, and the Company foresees no difficulty in obtaining purchased parts, as needed, at acceptable prices.

&#160;

Patents and Environmental Laws 

&#160;

Tel has no patents or licenses which are material to its business, and there are no material costs incurred to comply with environmental laws.

Engineering, Research, and Development 

In the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, Tel spent $2,038,126 and $1,961,275, respectively, on the engineering, research, and development of new and improved products. None of these amounts were sponsored by customers. Engineering, research, and development expenditures in fiscal year 2016 were made primarily for the TR-36, a new commercial navigation/communication test set, the T47-M5 test set, development of smaller hand-held products utilizing CRAFT and TS-4530A technology, continuing engineering for the CRAFT and TS-4530A programs, and the incorporation of other product enhancements in existing designs as well as an upgrade of our T-760 Precision DME (Distance Measuring Equipment) Test Set. The Company owns all of these designs with the exception of the AN/ARM-206 product.

&#160;

Tel's management believes that continued significant expenditures for engineering, research, and development are necessary to enable Tel to expand its products, sales, and profits, and to remain competitive.

&#160;

Personnel 

&#160;

At June 11, 2016, Tel had forty full-time employees in manufacturing, materials management, and quality assurance, eleven in administration and sales, including customer services and product support, and fourteen in engineering, research and development, none of whom belongs to a union. From time to time, the Company also employs independent contractors to support its manufacturing, engineering, and sales organizations. At June 11, 2016, the Company utilized one independent contractor in manufacturing for assembly and test, and one in sales and in program management. Tel has been successful in attracting skilled and experienced management, sales and engineering personnel.
