Origination of Loans. &#160; The lending activities of Quaint Oak Bank are subject to the written underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by the board of directors and management. New loans are generated primarily through the efforts of Quaint Oak Bank's loan officers, referrals from brokers and existing customers. Loan applications are underwritten and processed by Quaint Oak Bank's credit administration department.

All loans are presented to the loan committee for review. Quaint Oak Bank's loan approval process is intended to assess the borrower's ability to repay the loan, the viability of the loan and the value of the property that will secure the loan. Individual loans and loan relationships over $1.0 million must be approved by Quaint Oak Bank's loan committee, which currently consists of our President and Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of the Board, two other members of the Board of Directors, and three other officers of Quaint Oak Bank.

Scheduled contractual maturities of loans do not necessarily reflect the actual expected term of the loan portfolio. The average life of mortgage loans is substantially less than their average contractual terms because of prepayments. The average life of mortgage loans tends to increase when current mortgage loan rates are higher than rates on existing mortgage loans and, conversely, decrease when rates on current mortgage loans are lower than existing mortgage loan rates (due to refinancing of adjustable-rate and fixed-rate loans at lower rates). Under the latter circumstance, the weighted average yield on loans decreases as higher yielding loans are repaid or refinanced at lower rates.

One-to-Four Family Residential Owner Occupied Real Estate Loans. &#160; As part of our strategy of diversifying our loan portfolio with higher yielding and shorter-term loan products, Quaint Oak Bank does not emphasize the origination of one-to-four family owner occupied residential loans to be held in our loan portfolio. At December 31, 2015, $5.8 million, or 4.0%, of our total loan portfolio, before net items, consisted of one-to-four family owner occupied residential loans. All of these loans originated for portfolio have fixed rates of interest.

One-to-Four Family Residential Non-Owner Occupied Real Estate Loans. &#160; A significant part of Quaint Oak Bank's lending activity is the origination of loans secured by single-family residences for non-owner occupied properties. At December 31, 2015, $51.0 million, or 35.1%, of our total loan portfolio, before net items, consisted of one-to-four family residential non-owner occupied loans.

It is our policy to lend in a first lien position on non-owner occupied residential property with fixed and variable rates and terms generally up to 15 years or longer amortizations. Generally, such loans are originated at a fixed rate with a three or five year maturity. Such loans are generally limited to 75%, or less, of the appraised value, or sales price plus improvement costs of the secured real estate property.

One-to-Four Family Residential Loans Originated for Sale. &#160; Quaint Oak Bank through its subsidiary, Quaint Oak Mortgage LLC, brokers and originates one-to-four family residential fixed and variable rate first mortgages with amortizing terms less than or equal to 30 years in accordance with secondary market standards. Loans originated by Quaint Oak Mortgage LLC are sold into the secondary market along with the loans' servicing rights. For the year ended December 31, 2015, Quaint Oak Mortgage LLC originated $52.7 million of owner and non-owner occupied loans for sale and sold $50.2 million of loans in the secondary market. For the year ended December 31, 2014, loans originated for sale through Quaint Oak Mortgage LLC totaled $53.3 million and $51.8 million of these loans were sold in the secondary market.

&#160;

&#160;

Multi-Family Residential Loans. Quaint Oak Bank originates loans for multi-unit (five or more) residential properties. These loans are offered with fixed and adjustable interest rates and amortizations not to exceed 25 years. Generally, the loan-to-value ratio does not exceed 75%. These loans are underwritten with the same criteria and procedures as commercial real estate loans. At December 31, 2015, $12.4 million, or 8.5%, of our total loan portfolio, before net items, consisted of multi-family residential loans.

Commercial Real Estate Loans and Lines of Credit. Quaint Oak Bank also originates loans secured by commercial real estate. At December 31, 2015, $47.6 million, or 32.8% of our total loan portfolio, before net items, consisted of commercial real estate loans and $2.2 million or 1.5% of our loan portfolio, before net items, consisted of commercial lines of credit. Although commercial real estate loans and lines of credit are generally considered to have greater credit risk than other certain types of loans, we intend to continue to originate such loans in our market area.

It is generally our policy to lend in a first lien position on real property occupied as a commercial business property or mixed use properties. However, in rare instances, we may take a second lien position if approved by the loan committee. Quaint Oak Bank offers fixed and variable rate mortgage loans with terms up to 15 years with longer amortizations. Commercial real estate loans are limited to 70%, or less, of the appraised value, or sales price plus improvement costs of the secured real estate property. Commercial real estate loans are presented to the loan committee for review and approval, including analysis of the creditworthiness of the borrower. The loan committee reviews the cash flows from the property to determine if the proceeds will adequately cover debt service. A Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) is calculated using gross income minus operating expenses vs. debt service. Quaint Oak Bank uses a DSCR of 1.20. We obtain copies of leases to document income. Assignments of rents and leases as well as the requirement to provide annual updates of financial information and rent rolls are included in the loan documentation.

Construction Loans. &#160; Our construction loans are generally originated for the purpose of building or renovating a single family residential home. Generally, we do not make construction loans for speculative development. Funds are advanced incrementally as work is completed. The borrower is required to make monthly interest payments. When the construction is finished, the amount of the outstanding loan is less than 70% of the completed value of the property. Quaint Oak Bank is paid in full when the borrower seeks permanent financing or the property is sold. At December 31, 2015, $16.1 million, or 11.1% of Quaint Oak Bank's total loan portfolio, before net items, consisted of construction loans.

Home Equity Loans. &#160; Quaint Oak Bank is authorized to make loans for a wide variety of personal or consumer purposes. Quaint Oak Bank originates home equity loans and home equity lines of credit in order to accommodate its customers and because such loans generally have shorter terms than residential mortgage loans. At December 31, 2015, $7.4 million, or 5.1% of Quaint Oak Bank's total loan portfolio, before net items, consisted of home equity loans.

Commercial Business Loans. &#160; Quaint Oak Bank originates loans to businesses primarily for the purchase of business essential equipment. Business essential equipment is equipment necessary for a business to support or assist with the day-to-day operation or profitability of the business. At December 31, 2015, $2.6 million, or 1.8% of Quaint Oak Bank's total loan portfolio, before net items, consisted of commercial business loans.

Other Consumer Loans. Quaint Oak Bank originates auto loans and loans secured by savings accounts in order to accommodate its existing customers. At December 31, 2015, $71,000, or 0.1% of Quaint Oak Bank's total loan portfolio, before net items, consisted of other consumer loans.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Loan Origination and Other Fees. &#160; In addition to interest earned on loans, Quaint Oak Bank generally receives loan origination fees or " points " for originating loans. Loan points are a percentage of the principal amount of the mortgage loan and are charged to the borrower in connection with the origination of the loan. Such origination fees, net of certain direct loan origination costs, are deferred and recognized as an adjustment to the yield (interest income) of the related loans over the contractual life of the loans.

Asset Quality

General. &#160; Quaint Oak Bank's collection procedures provide that when a loan is 17 days past due, a telephone call is made to the borrower by our collections specialist to determine the reason for the delinquency and to work out a possible solution. Late charges will be assessed based on the number of days specified in the note beyond the due date. The Board of Directors is notified of all delinquencies thirty days past due. In most cases, deficiencies are cured promptly. While we generally prefer to work with borrowers to resolve such problems, we will institute foreclosure or other collection proceedings when necessary to minimize any potential loss.

Loans are placed on non-accrual status when management believes the probability of collection of interest is doubtful. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, previously accrued but unpaid interest is deducted from interest income. Quaint Oak Bank generally discontinues the accrual of interest income when the loan becomes 90 days past due as to principal or interest unless the credit is well secured and we believe we will fully collect. There were $186,000 and $2.0 million of non-accrual loans at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Real estate and other assets acquired by Quaint Oak Bank as a result of foreclosure or by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure are classified as real estate owned until sold. Real estate owned totaled $1.4 million and $111,000 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

(1)

Non-performing loans consist of non-accruing loans plus accruing loans 90 days or more past due.

(2)

Troubled debt restructurings not included in non-accruing loans and accruing loans 90 days or more past due.

At December 31, 2015, we had nine loans totaling $781,000 that were identified as troubled debt restructurings ("TDR") and were performing in accordance with their modified terms. There was a $32,000 allowance for loan losses allocated to these loans at December 31, 2015. If a TDR is placed on non-accrual it is not reverted back to accruing status until the borrower makes timely payments as contracted for at least six months and future collection under the revised terms is probable.

Classified Assets. &#160; Federal regulations require that each insured savings institution classify its assets on a regular basis. In addition, in connection with examinations of insured institutions, federal examiners have authority to identify problem assets and, if appropriate, classify them. There are three classifications for problem assets: " substandard, " &#160; " doubtful " and " loss. " Substandard assets have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values questionable, and there is a higher possibility of loss. An asset classified loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the institution is not warranted. Another category designated " special mention " also must be established and maintained for assets which do not currently expose an insured institution to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification as substandard, doubtful or loss. Assets classified as substandard or doubtful require the institution to establish general allowances for loan losses. If an asset or portion thereof is classified as loss, the insured institution must either establish specific allowances for loan losses in the amount of 100% of the portion of the asset classified loss, or charge-off such amount. General loss allowances established to cover possible losses related to assets classified substandard or doubtful may be included in determining an institution's regulatory capital, while specific valuation allowances for loan losses do not qualify as regulatory capital. Federal examiners may disagree with an insured institution's classifications and amounts reserved.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Allowance for Loan Losses. &#160; At December 31, 2015, Quaint Oak Bank's allowance for loan losses amounted to $1.3 million. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for losses that can be reasonably anticipated. Management performs a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance. The allowance is based on our past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. 

While management believes that it determines the amount of the allowance based on the best information available at the time, the allowance will need to be adjusted as circumstances change and assumptions are updated. Future adjustments to the allowance could significantly affect net income.

The following table shows changes in our allowance for loan losses during the periods presented.

&#160; The allowance consists of specific, general and unallocated components. The specific component relates to loans that are classified as impaired. For loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value or observable market price) of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. The general component covers pools of loans by loan class. These pools of loans are evaluated for loss exposure based upon historical loss rates for each of these categories of loans, adjusted for qualitative factors. These loss factors may include changes in lending policies and procedures, changes in existing general economic and business conditions affecting our primary lending areas, credit quality trends, collateral value, loan volumes and concentrations, seasoning of the loan portfolio, recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio, duration of the current business cycle and bank regulatory examination results. The applied loss factors are reevaluated quarterly to ensure their relevance in the current economic environment. Residential mortgage lending generally entails a lower risk of default than other types of lending. Consumer loans and commercial real estate loans generally involve more risk of collectability because of the type and nature of the collateral and, in certain cases, the absence of collateral. It is our policy to establish a specific reserve for loss on any delinquent loan when we determine that a loss is probable. An unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect our estimate of probable losses. The unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio.

Investment Activities

General. We invest in securities pursuant to our investment policy, which has been approved by our Board of Directors. Our investment policy is reviewed annually by our Asset-Liability Committee (ALCO). All policy changes recommended by ALCO must be approved by the Board of Directors. ALCO is authorized by the Board to make investments consistent with the investment policy. While general investment strategies are developed and authorized by ALCO, the execution of specific actions rests with the Chief Financial Officer and the President and Chief Executive Officer.

Our investment policy is designed primarily to manage the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities, to generate a favorable return without incurring undue interest rate and credit risk, to complement our lending activities and to provide and maintain liquidity.

Our securities are classified as available for sale, held to maturity, or trading, at the time of acquisition. Securities classified as held to maturity must be purchased with the intent and ability to hold that security until its final maturity and can be sold prior to maturity only under rare circumstances. Held to maturity securities are accounted for based upon the amortized cost of the security. Available for sale securities can be sold at any time based upon our needs or market conditions. Available for sale securities are accounted for at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses on these securities, net of income tax provisions, reflected in stockholders' equity as accumulated other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2015, we had $3.0 million of securities classified as available for sale and no securities classified as held to maturity or trading.

Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) stock is a restricted investment security, carried at cost. The purchase of FHLB stock provides banks with the right to be a member of the FHLB and to receive the products and services that the FHLB provides to member banking institutions. Unlike other types of stock, FHLB stock is acquired primarily for the right to receive advances from the FHLB, rather than for the purpose of maximizing dividends or stock growth. FHLB stock is an activity-based stock that is directly proportional to the volume of advances taken by a member institution. The FHLB will repurchase capital stock at $1.00 per share from Quaint Oak Bank. The FHLB has paid dividends on the capital stock in each quarter of 2014 and 2015.

Sources of Funds

General. &#160; Deposits are the primary source of Quaint Oak Bank's funds for lending and other investment purposes. In addition to deposits, principal and interest payments on loans are a source of funds. Loan payments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows are significantly influenced by general interest rates and money market conditions. Borrowings may also be used on a short-term basis to compensate for reductions in the availability of funds from other sources and on a longer-term basis for general business purposes.

Deposits. &#160; Deposits are attracted by Quaint Oak Bank principally from southwestern Bucks and southeastern Montgomery Counties, northeast Philadelphia and Lehigh Valley areas of Pennsylvania , although we also attract deposits from outside our market area and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. &#160; Deposit account terms vary, with the principal differences being the minimum balance required, the time periods the funds must remain on deposit, and the interest rate. Quaint Oak Bank offers a variety of deposit accounts with a range of rates and terms. Our deposit accounts consist of certificates of deposit and various savings products. In December 2014, we introduced non-interest bearing business and consumer checking accounts.

Quaint Oak Bank has not solicited deposits from outside Pennsylvania or paid fees to brokers to solicit funds for deposit. At December 31, 2015, approximately 10% of Quaint Oak Bank's total deposits were held by customers outside the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

Interest rates paid, maturity terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties are established on a periodic basis. Management determines the rates and terms based on rates paid by competitors, the need for funds or liquidity, growth goals and federal regulations. Management attempts to control the flow of deposits by pricing the accounts to remain generally competitive with other financial institutions in our market area.

The following table shows the distribution of, and certain other information relating to, our deposits by type of deposit, as of the dates indicated.

Borrowings. &#160; Quaint Oak Bank may obtain advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh upon the security of the common stock it owns in that bank and certain of its residential mortgage loans and mortgage-backed and other investment securities, provided certain standards related to creditworthiness have been met. These advances are made pursuant to several credit programs, each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities. Federal Home Loan Bank advances are generally available to meet seasonal and other withdrawals of deposit accounts and to permit increased lending.

&#160;

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, Quaint Oak Bank has a maximum borrowing capacity with the Federal Home Loan Bank of approximately $72.4 million.

Market Area

As of December 31, 2015, our primary market area for loans and deposits is in Bucks and Montgomery Counties, Pennsylvania, northeast Philadelphia and the surrounding area and the Lehigh Valley area of Pennsylvania, although we also attract deposits from outside our market area and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Our operating strategy is based on strong personal service and operating efficiency.

Quaint Oak Bank is headquartered in Southampton in Bucks County, Pennsylvania and operates one regional office in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Bucks County lies north of Philadelphia, bordering Montgomery County on the west and New Jersey to the east. In recent years, population growth has been above Pennsylvania averages in both Bucks and Montgomery Counties. We expect population growth and new housing growth will likely remain above the state average in the near term. Income and wealth demographics are also above both national and Pennsylvania averages. The Lehigh Valley area is one of the fastest growing regions in Pennsylvania due in part to its reasonable business climate and lower cost of living in comparison to its surrounding areas and states. The Lehigh Valley is particularly noteworthy for its unusually balanced and multi-faceted economy. Far from depending on a single industry, the top four sub-sectors of the regional GDP are all extremely close to one another, which ultimately means a healthier and more vibrant regional economy. In March 2015, the Lehigh Valley was recognized by a leading business publication as the top performing region for economic development for metropolitan regions of similar size in the Northeastern United States.

Competition

Quaint Oak Bank faces significant competition both in attracting deposits and in making loans. Its most direct competition for deposits has come historically from commercial banks, credit unions and other savings institutions located in its primary market area, including many large financial institutions which have greater financial and marketing resources available to them. In addition, Quaint Oak Bank faces significant competition for investors' funds from short-term money market securities, mutual funds and other corporate and government securities. Also, given Quaint Oak Bank's operating strategies and reliance on savings accounts and certificates, Quaint Oak Bank also faces intense competition from the money market mutual funds and national savings products. Quaint Oak Bank does not rely upon any individual group or entity for a material portion of its deposits. The ability of Quaint Oak Bank to attract and retain deposits depends on its ability to generally provide a rate of return, liquidity and risk comparable to that offered by competing investment opportunities.

Quaint Oak Bank's competition for real estate loans comes principally from mortgage banking companies, commercial banks, other savings institutions and credit unions. Quaint Oak Bank competes for loan originations primarily through the interest rates and loan fees it charges, and the efficiency and quality of services it provides borrowers. Factors that affect competition include general and local economic conditions, current interest rate levels and volatility in the mortgage markets.

REGULATION

Regulation of Quaint Oak Bancorp

General. Quaint Oak Bancorp is subject to regulation as a savings and loan holding company under the Home Owners' Loan Act, as amended, because we made an election under Section 10(l) of the Home Owners' Loan Act to be treated as a "savings association" for purposes of Section 10 of the Home Owners' Loan Act. As a result, Quaint Oak Bancorp is currently regulated by the Federal Reserve Board and is subject to the regulations, examinations, supervision and reporting requirements relating to savings and loan holding companies. Quaint Oak Bancorp is also required to file certain reports with, and otherwise comply with the rules and regulations of, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the Securities and Exchange Commission. As a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, Quaint Oak Bank is subject to certain restrictions in its dealings with Quaint Oak Bancorp and affiliates thereof, including the Federal Reserve Board's Qualified Thrift Lender test, dividend restrictions and transactions with affiliates regulations.

Restrictions Applicable to Quaint Oak Bancorp. &#160; As a non-grandfathered savings and loan holding company, Quaint Oak Bancorp is permitted to engage only in the following activities:

&#9679;

furnishing or performing management services for a subsidiary savings institution;

&#9679;

conducting an insurance agency or escrow business;

&#9679;

holding, managing, or liquidating assets owned or acquired from a subsidiary savings institution;

&#9679;

holding or managing properties used or occupied by a subsidiary savings institution;

&#9679;

acting as trustee under a deed of trust;

&#9679;

any other activity (i) that the Federal Reserve Board, by regulation, has determined to be permissible for bank holding companies under Section 4(c) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, unless the Federal Reserve Board, by regulation, prohibits or limits any such activity for savings and loan holding companies, or (ii) in which multiple savings and loan holding companies were authorized by regulation to directly engage in on March 5, 1987;

&#9679;

purchasing, holding, or disposing of stock acquired in connection with a qualified stock issuance if the purchase of such stock by such holding company is approved by the Federal Reserve Board; and

&#9679;

any activity permissible for financial holding companies under section 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act.

Permissible activities which are deemed to be financial in nature or incidental thereto under section 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act include:

&#9679;

lending, exchanging, transferring, investing for others, or safeguarding money or securities;

&#160;

&#160;

&#9679;

insurance activities or providing and issuing annuities, and acting as principal, agent, or broker;

&#9679;

financial, investment, or economic advisory services;

&#9679;

issuing or selling instruments representing interests in pools of assets that a bank is permitted to hold directly;

&#9679;

underwriting, dealing in, or making a market in securities;

&#9679;

activities previously determined by the Federal Reserve Board to be closely related to banking;

&#9679;

activities that bank holding companies are permitted to engage in outside of the U.S.; and

&#9679;

portfolio investments made by an insurance company.

In addition, Quaint Oak Bancorp cannot be acquired unless the acquirer is engaged solely in financial activities or acquire a company unless the company is engaged solely in financial activities.

If a savings and loan holding company acquires or merges with another holding company, the holding company acquired or the holding company resulting from such merger or acquisition may only invest in assets and engage in the activities listed above, and it has a period of two years to cease any non-conforming activities and divest any non-conforming investments. As of December 31, 2015, Quaint Oak Bancorp was not engaged in any non-conforming activities and it did not have any non-conforming investments.

If the subsidiary savings association fails to meet the Qualified Thrift Lender test set forth in Section 10(m) of the Home Owners' Loan Act, as discussed below, then the savings and loan holding company must register with the Federal Reserve Board as a bank holding company, unless the savings institution requalifies as a Qualified Thrift Lender within one year thereafter.

Qualified Thrift Lender Test. A savings association can comply with the Qualified Thrift Lender test by either meeting the Qualified Thrift Lender test set forth in the Home Owners' Loan Act and implementing regulations or qualifying as a domestic building and loan association as defined in Section 7701(a)(19) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Currently the Qualified Thrift Lender test in the Home Owners' Loan Act requires that 65% of an institution's portfolio assets (as defined) consist of certain housing and consumer-related assets on a monthly average basis in nine out of every twelve months. To be a Qualified Thrift Lender under the IRS test, the savings institution must meet the "business operations test" and a "60 percent assets test", each defined in the Internal Revenue Code. A savings association subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company that does not comply with the Qualified Thrift Lender test is immediately subject to the following restrictions on its operations:

&#160; &#9679; 

the institution may not engage in any new activity or make any new investment, directly or indirectly, unless such activity or investment is permissible for both a national bank and a savings association;

&#160; &#9679; 

the branching powers of the institution shall be restricted to those of a national bank; and

&#160; &#9679; 

payment of dividends by the institution shall be subject to the rules regarding payment of dividends by a national bank and must be necessary to meet the obligations of its holding company.

&#160;

Upon the expiration of three years from the date the institution ceases to meet the Qualified Thrift Lender test, it must cease any activity and not retain any investment not permissible for both a national bank and a savings association (subject to safety and soundness considerations). &#160; Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, a savings institution not in compliance with the Qualified Thrift Lender test is also subject to an enforcement action for violation of the Home Owners' Loan Act, as amended.

Quaint Oak Bank believes that it meets the provisions of the Qualified Thrift Lender test and for the year ended December 31, 2015, 96% of its portfolio assets meet the requirements.

Regulatory Capital Requirements . &#160; The Federal Reserve Board has adopted capital adequacy guidelines pursuant to which it assesses the adequacy of capital in examining and supervising a savings and loan holding company and in analyzing applications to it under the Savings and Loan Holding Company Act. The Federal Reserve Board's capital adequacy guidelines for Quaint Oak Bancorp, on a consolidated basis, are similar to those imposed on Quaint Oak by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. See "-Regulation of Quaint Oak Bank - Capital Requirements." Moreover, certain of the savings and loan holding company capital requirements promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board in 2013 became effective as of January 1, 2015. Those requirements establish four minimum capital ratios that Quaint Oak Bancorp had to comply with as of that date as set forth in the table below. However, in May 2015, amendments to the Federal Reserve Board's small bank holding company policy statement (the "SBHC Policy") (which also applies to small savings and loan holding companies) became effective which increased the asset threshold to qualify to utilize the provisions of the SBHC Policy from $500 million to $1.0 billion. Savings and loan holding companies which are subject to the SBHC Policy are not subject to compliance with the regulatory capital requirements set forth in the table below until they exceed $1.0 billion in assets. As a consequence, as of December 31, 2015, Quaint Oak Bancorp was not required to comply with the requirements set forth below until such time that its consolidated total assets exceed $1.0 billion or the Federal Reserve Board determines that Quaint Oak Bancorp is no longer deemed to be a small savings and loan holding company. However, if Quaint Oak Bancorp had been subject to the requirements, it would have been in compliance with such requirements. 

Limitations on Transactions with Affiliates. &#160; Transactions between savings associations and any affiliate are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act as made applicable to savings associations by Section 11 of the Home Owners' Loan Act. An affiliate of a savings association includes any company or entity which controls the savings association or that is controlled by a company that controls the savings association. In a holding company context, the holding company of a savings association (such as Quaint Oak Bancorp) and any companies which are controlled by such holding company are affiliates of the savings association. Generally, Section 23A limits the extent to which the savings association or its subsidiaries may engage in " covered transactions " with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10% of such association's capital stock and surplus, and contains an aggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20% of such capital stock and surplus. Section 23B applies to " covered transactions " as well as certain other transactions and requires that all transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the savings association as those provided to a non-affiliate. The term " covered transaction " includes the making of loans to, purchase of assets from and issuance of a guarantee to an affiliate and similar transactions. Section 23B transactions also include the provision of services and the sale of assets by a savings association to an affiliate. In addition to the restrictions imposed by Sections 23A and 23B, Section 11 of the Home Owners' Loan Act prohibits a savings association from (i) making a loan or other extension of credit to an affiliate, except for any affiliate which engages only in certain activities which are permissible for bank holding companies, or (ii) purchasing or investing in any stocks, bonds, debentures, notes or similar obligations of any affiliate, except for affiliates which are subsidiaries of the savings association.

&#160;

&#160;

In addition, Sections 22(g) and (h) of the Federal Reserve Act as made applicable to savings associations by Section 11 of the Home Owners' Loan Act, place restrictions on loans to executive officers, directors and principal stockholders of the savings association and its affiliates. Under Section 22(h), loans to a director, an executive officer and to a greater than 10% stockholder of a savings association, and certain affiliated interests of either, may not exceed, together with all other outstanding loans to such person and affiliated interests, the savings association's loans to one borrower limit (generally equal to 15% of the association's unimpaired capital and surplus). Section 22(h) also requires that loans to directors, executive officers and principal stockholders be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons unless the loans are made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that (i) is widely available to employees of the association and (ii) does not give preference to any director, executive officer or principal stockholder, or certain affiliated interests of either, over other employees of the savings association. Section 22(h) also requires prior board approval for certain loans. In addition, the aggregate amount of extensions of credit by a savings association to all insiders cannot exceed the association's unimpaired capital and surplus. Furthermore, Section 22(g) places additional restrictions on loans to executive officers. As an insured state-chartered savings bank, Quaint Oak Bank currently is subject to Sections 22(g) and (h) of the Federal Reserve Act and at December 31, 2015, was in compliance with the above restrictions.

Restrictions on Acquisitions . &#160; Except under limited circumstances, savings and loan holding companies are prohibited from acquiring, without prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board, (i) control of any other savings association or savings and loan holding company or substantially all the assets thereof or (ii) more than 5% of the voting shares of a savings association or holding company thereof which is not a subsidiary. Except with the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board, no director or officer of a savings and loan holding company or person owning or controlling by proxy or otherwise more than 25% of such company's stock, may acquire control of any savings association, other than a subsidiary savings association, or of any other savings and loan holding company.

The Federal Reserve Board may only approve acquisitions resulting in the formation of a multiple savings and loan holding company which controls savings associations in more than one state if (i) the multiple savings and loan holding company involved controls a savings association which operated a home or branch office located in the state of the association to be acquired as of March 5, 1987; (ii) the acquirer is authorized to acquire control of the savings association pursuant to the emergency acquisition provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act ; or (iii) the statutes of the state in which the association to be acquired is located specifically permit associations to be acquired by the state-chartered associations or savings and loan holding companies located in the state where the acquiring entity is located (or by a holding company that controls such state-chartered savings associations).

Federal Securities Laws . Quaint Oak Bancorp's common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Quaint Oak Bancorp is subject to information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions, and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act . As a public company, Quaint Oak Bancorp is subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 which addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. As directed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer are required to certify that our quarterly and annual reports do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact. The rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act have several requirements, including having these officers certify that: they are responsible for establishing, maintaining and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting; they have made certain disclosures to our auditors and the audit committee of the Board of Directors about our internal control over financial reporting; and they have included information in our quarterly and annual reports about their evaluation and whether there have been changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could materially affect internal control over financial reporting.

&#160;

2010 Regulatory Reform

On July 21, 2010, the President signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The financial reform and consumer protection act imposes new restrictions and an expanded framework of regulatory oversight for financial institutions, including depository institutions. In addition, the new law changed the jurisdictions of existing bank regulatory agencies and in particular transferred the regulation of federal savings associations from the Office of Thrift Supervision to the Office of Comptroller of the Currency, effective July 21, 2011. At this time savings and loan holding companies became regulated by the Federal Reserve Board. The new law also established an independent federal consumer protection bureau within the Federal Reserve Board. The following discussion summarizes significant aspects of the new law that may affect Quaint Oak Bank and Quaint Oak Bancorp. Many regulations implementing these changes have not been promulgated, so we cannot determine the full impact on our business and operations at this time.

The following aspects of the financial reform and consumer protection act are related to the operations of Quaint Oak Bank:

&#9679;

A new independent consumer financial protection bureau was established within the Federal Reserve Board, empowered to exercise broad regulatory, supervisory and enforcement authority with respect to both new and existing consumer financial protection laws. However, smaller financial institutions, like Quaint Oak Bank, are subject to the supervision and enforcement of their primary federal banking regulator with respect to the federal consumer financial protection laws.

&#9679;

Tier 1 capital treatment for "hybrid" capital items like trust preferred securities is eliminated subject to various grandfathering and transition rules.

&#9679;

The prohibition on payment of interest on demand deposits was repealed.

&#9679;

Deposit insurance is permanently increased to $250,000.

&#9679;

The deposit insurance assessment base calculation now equals the depository institution's total assets minus the sum of its average tangible equity during the assessment period.

&#9679;

The minimum reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund increased to 1.35 percent of estimated annual insured deposits or assessment base; however, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is directed to "offset the effect" of the increased reserve ratio for insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion.

The following aspects of the financial reform and consumer protection act are related to the operations of Quaint Oak Bancorp:

&#9679;

Authority over savings and loan holding companies was transferred to the Federal Reserve Board.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#9679;

Leverage capital requirements and risk based capital requirements applicable to depository institutions and bank holding companies are extended to thrift holding companies. However, certain smaller savings and loan holding companies such as Quaint Oak Bancorp, are exempt from those capital requirements.

&#9679;

The Federal Deposit Insurance Act was amended to direct federal regulators to require depository institution holding companies to serve as a source of strength for their depository institution subsidiaries.

&#9679;

The Securities and Exchange Commission is authorized to adopt rules requiring public companies to make their proxy materials available to shareholders for nomination of their own candidates for election to the board of directors.

&#9679;

Public companies are now required to provide their shareholders with a non-binding vote: (i) at least once every three years on the compensation paid to executive officers, and (ii) at least once every six years on whether they should have a "say on pay" vote every one, two or three years.

&#9679;

A separate, non-binding shareholder vote is now required regarding golden parachutes for named executive officers when a shareholder vote takes place on mergers, acquisitions, dispositions or other transactions that would trigger the parachute payments.

&#9679;

Securities exchanges are now required to prohibit brokers from using their own discretion to vote shares not beneficially owned by them for certain "significant" matters, which include votes on the election of directors, executive compensation matters, and any other matter determined to be significant.

&#9679;

Stock exchanges are prohibited from listing the securities of any issuer that does not have a policy providing for (i) disclosure of its policy on incentive compensation payable on the basis of financial information reportable under the securities laws, and (ii) the recovery from current or former executive officers, following an accounting restatement triggered by material noncompliance with securities law reporting requirements, of any incentive compensation paid erroneously during the three-year period preceding the date on which the restatement was required that exceeds the amount that would have been paid on the basis of the restated financial information.

&#9679;

Disclosure in annual proxy materials will be required concerning the relationship between the executive compensation paid and the financial performance of the issuer.

&#9679;

Item 402 of Regulation S-K will be amended to require companies to disclose the ratio of the Chief Executive Officer's annual total compensation to the median annual total compensation of all other employees.

&#9679;

Smaller reporting companies are exempt from complying with the internal control auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

Volcker Rule Regulations

Regulations were adopted in 2013 by the federal banking agencies to implement the provisions of the Dodd Frank Act commonly referred to as the Volcker Rule. The regulations contain prohibitions and restrictions on the ability of financial institutions holding companies and their affiliates to engage in proprietary trading and to hold certain interests in, or to have certain relationships with, various types of investment funds, including hedge funds and private equity funds. The regulations became effective on April 1, 2014 with full compliance being phased in over a period ending on July 21, 2015. Quaint Oak's investment portfolio is in compliance with the Volcker Rule regulations as of December 31, 2015.

Regulation of Quaint Oak Bank

Pennsylvania Banking Law. &#160; The Pennsylvania Banking Code contains detailed provisions governing the organization, location of offices, rights and responsibilities of directors, officers and employees, as well as corporate powers, savings and investment operations and other aspects of Quaint Oak Bank and its affairs. The Pennsylvania Banking Code delegates extensive rulemaking power and administrative discretion to the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities so that the supervision and regulation of state-chartered savings banks may be flexible and readily responsive to changes in economic conditions and in savings and lending practices.

One of the purposes of the Pennsylvania Banking Code is to provide savings banks with the opportunity to be competitive with each other and with other financial institutions existing under other Pennsylvania laws and other state, federal and foreign laws. A Pennsylvania savings bank may locate or change the location of its principal place of business and establish an office anywhere in the Commonwealth, with the prior approval of the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities.

The Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities generally examines each savings bank not less frequently than once every two years. Although the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities may accept the examinations and reports of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in lieu of its own examination, the present practice is for the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities to conduct individual examinations. The Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities may order any savings bank to discontinue any violation of law or unsafe or unsound business practice and may direct any director, trustee, officer, attorney or employee of a savings bank engaged in an objectionable activity, after the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities has ordered the activity to be terminated, to show cause at a hearing before the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities why such person should not be removed.

Insurance of Accounts. &#160; The deposits of Quaint Oak Bank are insured to the maximum extent permitted by the Deposit Insurance Fund, administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. The 2010 financial institution reform legislation permanently increased deposit insurance on most accounts to $250,000. As insurer, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is authorized to conduct examinations of, and to require reporting by, insured institutions. It also may prohibit any insured institution from engaging in any activity determined by regulation or order to pose a serious threat to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's risk-based premium system provides for quarterly assessments. Each insured institution is placed in one of four risk categories based upon supervisory and capital evaluations. Within its risk category, an institution is assigned to an initial base assessment rate which is then adjusted to determine its final assessment rate based on its brokered deposits, secured liabilities and unsecured debt. To implement the 2010 legislation, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation amended its deposit insurance regulations (1) to change the assessment base for insurance from domestic deposits to average assets minus average tangible equity and (2) to lower overall assessment rates. The revised assessment rates are between 2.5 and 9 basis points for banks in the lowest risk category and between 30 to 45 basis points for banks in the highest risk category.

&#160;

&#160;

In addition, all institutions with deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation are required to pay assessments to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, a mixed-ownership government corporation established to recapitalize a predecessor to the Deposit Insurance Fund. The assessment rate is adjusted quarterly. These assessments will continue until the Financing Corporation bonds mature in 2019.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution, including Quaint Oak Bank, if it determines after a hearing that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, order or any condition imposed by an agreement with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. It also may suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for the permanent termination of insurance, if the institution has no tangible capital. If insurance of accounts is terminated, the accounts at the institution at the time of the termination, less subsequent withdrawals, shall continue to be insured for a period of six months to two years, as determined by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Management is aware of no existing circumstances which would result in termination of Quaint Oak Bank's deposit insurance.

Recent Regulatory Capital Regulations . In July of 2013 the respective U.S. federal banking agencies issued final rules implementing Basel III and the Dodd-Frank Act capital requirements to be fully-phased in on a global basis on January 1, 2019. The new regulations establish a new tangible common equity capital requirement, increase the minimum requirement for the current Tier 1 risk-weighted asset ("RWA") ratio, phase out certain kinds of intangibles treated as capital and certain types of instruments and change the risk weightings of certain assets used to determine required capital ratios. The new common equity Tier 1 capital component requires capital of the highest quality &#8211; predominantly composed of retained earnings and common stock instruments. For community banks, such as Quaint Oak Bank, a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5% became effective on January 1, 2015. The new capital rules also increased the current minimum Tier 1 capital ratio from 4.0% to 6.0% beginning on January 1, 2015. In addition, in order to make capital distributions and pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers without restriction, an institution must also maintain greater than 2.5% in common equity attributable to a capital conservation buffer to be phased in from January 1, 2016 until January 1, 2019. The new rules also increase the risk weights for several categories of assets, including an increase from 100% to 150% for certain acquisition, development and construction loans and more than 90-day past due exposures. The new capital rules maintain the general structure of the prompt corrective action rules (described below), but incorporate the new common equity Tier 1 capital requirement and the increased Tier 1 RWA requirement into the prompt corrective action framework.

Regulatory Capital Requirements . Federally insured state-chartered non-member banks and savings banks are required to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital. Current Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation capital standards require these institutions to satisfy a common equity Tier 1 capital requirement, a leverage capital requirement and a risk-based capital requirement. The common equity Tier 1 capital component generally consists of retained earnings and common stock instruments and must equal at least 4.5% of risk-weighted assets. Leverage capital, also known as "core" capital, must equal at least 3.0% of adjusted total assets for the most highly rated state-chartered non-member banks and savings banks. Core capital generally consists of common stockholders' equity (including retained earnings). An additional cushion of at least 100 basis points is required for all other institutions, which effectively increases their minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio to 4.0% or more. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's regulations, the most highly-rated banks are those that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation determines are strong banking organization and are rated composite 1 under the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System. Under the risk-based capital requested, "total" capital (a combination of core and "supplementary" capital) must equal at least 8.0% of "risk-weighted" assets. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation also is authorized to impose capital requirements in excess of these standards on individual institutions on a case-by-case basis.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

In determining compliance with the risk-based capital requirement, a savings bank is allowed to include both core capital and supplementary capital in its total capital, provided that the amount of supplementary capital included does not exceed the savings bank's core capital. Supplementary capital generally consists of general allowances for loan losses up to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, together with certain other items. In determining the required amount of risk-based capital, total assets, including certain off-balance sheet items, are multiplied by a risk weight based on the risks inherent in the type of assets. The risk weights range from 0% for cash and securities issued by the U.S. Government or unconditionally backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government to 100% for loans (other than qualifying residential loans weighted at 80%) and repossessed assets.

Savings banks must value securities available for sale at amortized cost for regulatory capital purposes. This means that in computing regulatory capital, savings banks should add back any unrealized losses and deduct any unrealized gains, net of income taxes, on debt securities reported as a separate component of capital, as defined by generally accepted accounting principles.

Any savings bank that fails any of the capital requirements is subject to possible enforcement action by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Such action could include a capital directive, a cease and desist order, civil money penalties, the establishment of restrictions on the institution's operations, termination of federal deposit insurance and the appointment of a conservator or receiver. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's capital regulations provide that such actions, through enforcement proceedings or otherwise, could require one or more of a variety of corrective actions.

At December 31, 2015, Quaint Oak Bank's capital ratios exceeded each of its capital requirements. See Note 16 to the notes to our financial statements included in Exhibit 13.0 hereto.

Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities Capital Requirements . Quaint Oak Bank is also subject to more stringent Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities capital guidelines. Although not adopted in regulation form, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities utilizes capital standards requiring a minimum of 6% leverage capital and 10% risk-based capital. The components of leverage and risk-based capital are substantially the same as those defined by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. At December 31, 2015, Quaint Oak Bank's capital ratios exceeded each of its capital requirements.

&#160; &#160; Prompt Corrective Action . &#160; The following table shows the amount of capital associated with the different capital categories set forth in the prompt corrective action regulations. 

Capital Category

&#160; Total Risk-Based 

Capital

Significantly undercapitalized

&#160; Less than 6%

&#160; Less than 4%

&#160; Less than 3%

&#160; Less than 3%

In addition, an institution is "critically undercapitalized" if it has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%. Under specified circumstances, a federal banking agency may reclassify a well capitalized institution as adequately capitalized and may require an adequately capitalized institution or an undercapitalized institution to comply with supervisory actions as if it were in the next lower category (except that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation may not reclassify a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized).

An institution generally must file a written capital restoration plan which meets specified requirements within 45 days of the date that the institution receives notice or is deemed to have notice that it is undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized. A federal banking agency must provide the institution with written notice of approval or disapproval within 60 days after receiving a capital restoration plan, subject to extensions by the agency. An institution which is required to submit a capital restoration plan must concurrently submit a performance guaranty by each company that controls the institution. In addition, undercapitalized institutions are subject to various regulatory restrictions, and the appropriate federal banking agency also may take any number of discretionary supervisory actions.

At December 31, 2015, Quaint Oak Bank was deemed a well capitalized institution for purposes of the prompt corrective regulations and as such is not subject to the above mentioned restrictions.

Activities and Investments of Insured State-Chartered Savings Banks. &#160; The activities and equity investments of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-insured, state-chartered savings banks are generally limited to those that are permissible for national banks. Under regulations dealing with equity investments, an insured state bank generally may not directly or indirectly acquire or retain any equity investment of a type, or in an amount, that is not permissible for a national bank. An insured state bank is not prohibited from, among other things:

&#9679;

acquiring or retaining a majority interest in a subsidiary;

&#9679;

investing as a limited partner in a partnership the sole purpose of which is direct or indirect investment in the acquisition, rehabilitation or new construction of a qualified housing project, provided that such limited partnership investments may not exceed 2% of the bank's total assets;

&#9679;

acquiring up to 10% of the voting stock of a company that solely provides or reinsures directors', trustees' and officers' liability insurance coverage or bankers' blanket bond group insurance coverage for insured depository institutions; and

&#160;

&#9679;

acquiring or retaining the voting shares of a depository institution if certain requirements are met.

&#160;

&#160;

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has adopted regulations pertaining to the other activity restrictions imposed upon insured state banks and their subsidiaries. Pursuant to such regulations, insured state banks engaging in impermissible activities may seek approval from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to continue such activities. State banks not engaging in such activities but that desire to engage in otherwise impermissible activities either directly or through a subsidiary may apply for approval from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to do so; however, if such bank fails to meet the minimum capital requirements or the activities present a significant risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund, such application will not be approved by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Pursuant to this authority, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has determined that investments in certain majority-owned subsidiaries of insured state banks do not represent a significant risk to the deposit insurance funds. Investments permitted under that authority include real estate activities and securities activities.

Restrictions on Capital Distributions. Federal Reserve Board and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation regulations govern capital distributions by savings institutions, which include cash dividends, stock repurchases and other transactions charged to the capital account of a savings institution to make capital distributions. These regulations apply to Quaint Oak Bancorp because Quaint Oak Bank is considered a savings association for certain purposes under Home Owners' Loan Act, as amended. Under applicable regulations, a savings association must file an application for Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation approval of the capital distribution if:

&#160; &#9679; 

the total capital distributions for the applicable calendar year exceed the sum of the institution's net income for that year to date plus the institution's retained net income for the preceding two years;

&#160; &#9679; 

the institution would not be at least adequately capitalized following the distribution;

&#160; &#9679; 

the distribution would violate any applicable statute, regulation, agreement or Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-imposed condition; or

&#160; &#9679; 

the institution is not eligible for expedited treatment of its filings with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

If an application is not required to be filed, state savings banks that elect to be treated as savings associations such as Quaint Oak Bank must still file a notice with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation at least 30 days before the board of directors declares a dividend or approves a capital distribution if either (1) the institution would not be well-capitalized following the distribution; or (2) the proposed distribution would reduce the amount or retire any part of its common or preferred stock or retire any part of a debt instrument included in its regulatory capital. In addition, a savings institution, such as Quaint Oak Bank, that is the subsidiary of a stock saving and loan holding company, must also file a notice with the appropriate Federal Reserve Bank at least 30 days before the proposed declaration of a dividend by its board of directors.

A savings association that either before or after a proposed capital distribution fails to meet its then applicable minimum capital requirement or that has been notified that it needs more than normal supervision may not make any capital distributions without the prior written approval of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation may prohibit a proposed capital distribution, which would otherwise be permitted by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation regulations, if the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation determines that such distribution would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice.

&#160;

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation prohibits an insured depository institution from paying dividends on its capital stock or interest on its capital notes or debentures (if such interest is required to be paid only out of net profits) or distributing any of its capital assets while it remains in default in the payment of any assessment due the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Quaint Oak Bank is currently not in default in any assessment payment to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

Privacy Requirements of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. &#160; Federal law places limitations on financial institutions like Quaint Oak Bank regarding the sharing of consumer financial information with unaffiliated third parties. Specifically, these provisions require all financial institutions offering financial products or services to retail customers to provide such customers with the financial institution's privacy policy and provide such customers the opportunity to "opt out" of the sharing of personal financial information with unaffiliated third parties. Quaint Oak Bank currently has a privacy protection policy in place and believes such policy is in compliance with the regulations.

Anti-Money Laundering. &#160; Federal anti-money laundering rules impose various requirements on financial institutions intended to prevent the use of the U.S. financial system to fund terrorist activities. These provisions include a requirement that financial institutions operating in the United States have anti-money laundering compliance programs, due diligence policies and controls to ensure the detection and reporting of money laundering. Such compliance programs supplement existing compliance requirements, also applicable to financial institutions, under the Bank Secrecy Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulations. Quaint Oak Bank has established policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the federal anti-laundering provisions.

Regulatory Enforcement Authority. &#160; The federal banking laws provide substantial enforcement powers available to federal banking regulators. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease-and-desist or removal orders and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and institution-affiliated parties, as defined. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices.

TAXATION

Federal Taxation

General. &#160; Quaint Oak Bancorp and Quaint Oak Bank are subject to federal income tax provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, in the same general manner as other corporations with some exceptions listed below. For federal income tax purposes, Quaint Oak Bancorp files a consolidated federal income tax return with its wholly owned subsidiaries on a fiscal year basis. The applicable federal income tax expense or benefit will be properly allocated to each entity based upon taxable income or loss calculated on a separate company basis.

Method of Accounting. &#160; For federal income tax purposes, income and expenses are reported on the accrual method of accounting and Quaint Oak Bancorp files its federal income tax return using a December 31 fiscal year end.

Bad Debt Reserves. &#160; The Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 eliminated the use of the reserve method of accounting for bad debt reserves by savings institutions, effective for taxable years beginning after 1995. Prior to that time, Quaint Oak Bank was permitted to establish a reserve for bad debts and to make additions to the reserve. These additions could, within specified formula limits, be deducted in arriving at taxable income. As a result of the Small Business Job Protection Act, savings associations must use the specific charge-off method in computing their bad debt deduction beginning with their 1996 federal tax return.

Taxable Distributions and Recapture. &#160; Prior to the Small Business Job Protection Act, bad debt reserves created prior to January 1, 1988 were subject to recapture into taxable income if a savings bank failed to meet certain thrift asset and definitional tests. New federal legislation eliminated these thrift related recapture rules. However, under current law, pre-1988 reserves remain subject to recapture should a savings bank make certain non-dividend distributions or cease to maintain a savings bank charter. At December 31, 2015, Quaint Oak Bank did not have federal pre-1988 reserves subject to recapture.

&#160;

Minimum Tax. &#160; The Internal Revenue Code imposes an alternative minimum tax ( " AMT " ) at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences ( " alternative minimum taxable income " or " AMTI " ). The AMT is payable to the extent such AMTI is in excess of an exemption amount. Net operating losses can offset no more than 90% of AMTI. Certain payments of alternative minimum tax may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years. Quaint Oak Bancorp has not been subject to the AMT nor does it have any such amounts available as credits for carryover.

Corporate Dividends Received Deduction. &#160; Quaint Oak Bancorp may exclude from income 100% of dividends received from a member of the same affiliated group of corporations. The corporate dividends received deduction is 80% in the case of dividends received from corporations, which a corporate recipient owns less than 80%, but at least 20% of the distribution corporation. Corporations that own less than 20% of the stock of a corporation distributing a dividend may deduct only 70% of dividends received.

Other Matters. The Company is no longer subject to examination by taxing authorities for the years before January 1, 2012.

Pennsylvania Taxation. &#160; Quaint Oak Bancorp is subject to the Pennsylvania Corporate Net Income Tax and Capital Stock and Franchise Tax. The Corporation Net Income Tax rate for 2014 is 9.99% and is imposed on unconsolidated taxable income for federal purposes with certain adjustments. In general, the Capital Stock and Franchise Tax is a property tax imposed on a corporation 's capital stock value at a statutorily defined rate, such value being determined in accordance with a fixed formula based upon average net income and net wort h.

Quaint Oak Bank is subject to tax under the Pennsylvania Mutual Thrift Institutions Tax Act (the " MTIT " ), as amended to include thrift institutions having capital stock. Pursuant to the MTIT, the tax rate is 11.5%. The MTIT exempts Quaint Oak Bank from other taxes imposed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for state income tax purposes and from all local taxation imposed by political subdivisions, except taxes on real estate and real estate transfers. The MTIT is a tax upon net earnings, determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles with certain adjustments. The MTIT, in computing income under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, allows for the deduction of interest earned on state and federal obligations, while disallowing a percentage of thrift's interest expense deduction in the proportion of interest income on those securities to the overall interest income of Quaint Oak Bank. Net operating losses, if any, thereafter can be carried forward three years for MTIT purposes.

Quaint Oak Bank's four active subsidiaries (Quaint Oak Mortgage, Quaint Oak Real Estate, Quaint Oak Abstract, and QOB Properties, LLC) and one inactive subsidiary (Quaint Oak Insurance) are subject to the Pennsylvania Capital Stock and Franchise Tax.
