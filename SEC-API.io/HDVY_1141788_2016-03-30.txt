 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160;

Our Company Overview 

&#160;

Health Discovery Corporation (&#8220;HDC&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a machine learning company that uses advanced mathematical techniques to analyze large amounts of data to uncover patterns that might otherwise be undetectable. The Company operates primarily in the field of molecular diagnostics where such tools are critical to scientific discovery. The terms artificial intelligence and machine learning are sometimes used to describe pattern recognition tools.

&#160;

HDC&#8217;s mission is to use its patents, intellectual prowess, and clinical partnerships principally to identify patterns that can advance the science of medicine, as well as to advance the effective use of our technology in other diverse business disciplines, including the high-tech, financial, and healthcare technology markets.

&#160;

Our historical foundation lies in the molecular diagnostics field where we have made a number of discoveries that may play a role in developing more personalized approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of certain diseases. However, our Support Vector Machines (&#8220;SVM&#8221;) assets in particular have broad applicability in many other fields. Intelligently applied, HDC&#8217;s pattern recognition technology can be a portal between enormous amounts of otherwise undecipherable data and truly meaningful discovery. A good example of this is the Company&#8217;s joint venture, SVM Capital, LLC (&#8220;SVM Capital&#8221;), that applies SVM technology to the financial markets.

&#160;

Our Company&#8217;s principal asset is its intellectual property, which includes advanced mathematical algorithms called SVM and Fractal Genomic Modeling (&#8220;FGM&#8221;), as well as biomarkers that we discovered by applying our SVM and FGM techniques to complex genetic and proteomic data. Biomarkers are biological indicators or genetic expression signatures of certain disease states. Our intellectual property is protected by 61 patents that have been issued or are currently pending around the world.

&#160;

Our business model has evolved over time to respond to business trends that intersect with our technological expertise and our capacity to professionally manage these opportunities. In the beginning, we sought only to use our SVMs internally in order to discover and license our biomarker signatures to various diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies. Today, our commercialization efforts include: utilization of our discoveries and knowledge to help develop diagnostic and prognostic predictive tests; licensing of the SVM and FGM technologies directly to diagnostic companies; and, the potential formation of new ventures with domain experts in other fields where our pattern recognition technology holds commercial promise.

&#160; 

Our Technology 

&#160;

HDC owns a patent portfolio of machine learning technology, including certain pioneer patents on SVM. We also have consulting arrangements with clinical specialists and mathematicians responsible for developing our SVM patents for the analysis of data.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s SVM technology is commonly considered within the context of artificial intelligence. This is a branch of computer science concerned with giving computers the ability to perform functions normally associated with human intelligence, such as reasoning and optimization through experience. Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that enables the development of algorithms and techniques that allow computers to learn. Pattern recognition is machine learning with a wide spectrum of applications including medical diagnosis, bioinformatics, classifying DNA sequences, detecting credit card fraud, stock market analysis, object recognition in computer vision, and robotics. 

&#160;

Support Vector Machines Overview 

&#160;

SVMs are mathematical algorithms that allow computers to sift through large, complex datasets to identify patterns. SVMs are known for their ability to discover hidden relationships in these complex datasets. With the ability to handle what is known as infinite dimensional space, SVMs are broadly considered to be an improvement to neural networks and other mathematical techniques. SVM is a core machine learning technology with strong theoretical foundations and excellent empirical successes.

&#160;

With their introduction in 1992, SVMs marked the beginning of a new era in the learning from examples paradigm in artificial intelligence. Rooted in the Statistical Learning Theory developed by Professor Vladimir Vapnik, SVMs quickly gained attention from the math and science communities due to a number of theoretical and computational merits. This development advanced a new framework for modeling learning algorithms. Within this framework, the fields of machine learning and statistics were merged introducing powerful algorithms designed to handle the difficulties of prior computational techniques.

&#160;

&#160; 1 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The generation of learning algorithms that were developed based on this theory have proved to be resistant to the problems imposed by noisy data and high dimensionality. They are computationally efficient, have an inherent modular design that simplifies their implementation and analysis and allows the insertion of domain knowledge, and, more importantly, they have theoretical guarantees about their generalization ability. SVMs have been validated in numerous independent academic publications and presentations.

&#160;

SVMs have become widely established as one of the leading approaches to pattern recognition and machine learning worldwide and have replaced other technologies in a variety of fields, including engineering, information retrieval and bioinformatics. This technology has been incorporated into product and research applications by many biomedical, pharmaceutical, software, computer and financial companies. Educational and research institutions throughout the world have applied SVMs to a wide array of applications, including gene and protein expression analysis, medical image analysis, flow cytometry, and mass spectrometry.

&#160; 

Recursive Feature Elimination - Support Vector Machine Overview 

&#160;

Recursive Feature Elimination (&#8220;RFE-SVM&#8221;) is an application of SVM that was created by members of HDC&#8217;s science team to find discriminate relationships within clinical datasets, as well as within gene expression and proteomic datasets created from micro-arrays of tumor versus normal tissues. In general, SVMs identify patterns &#8211; for instance, a biomarker/genetic expression signature of a disease. The RFE-SVM utilizes this pattern recognition capability to identify and rank order the data points that contribute most to the desired results. The Company believes that its RFE-SVM patents are currently the only properly issued RFE patents in the world.

&#160;

Using RFE-SVM, we have been able to access information in micro-array datasets that the most advanced bioinformatics techniques missed. In one micro-array experiment, RFE-SVMs were able to filter irrelevant tissue-specific genes from those related to the malignancy. RFE-SVM has also been used to determine gene expression patterns that correlate to the severity of a disease, not just its existence. It has been shown to improve both diagnosis and prognosis by providing physicians with an enhanced decision tool. The Company believes that these analytic methods are effective for finding genes and proteins implicated in several cancers, as well as in assisting with the pharmacogenetic and toxicological profiling of patients. The RFE-SVM method is also capable of finding those specific genes and proteins that are unhindered by ever-increasing patent protection.

&#160; 

Fractal Genomic Modeling Overview 

&#160;

On September 30, 2003, we acquired the assets of Fractal Genomics, LLC, a company with patented FGM software. The fractal technology is used to find discriminate relationships within clinical datasets as well as within gene expression datasets created from micro-arrays of disease versus normal tissues.

&#160;

The Fractal Genomic Modeling (&#8220;FGM&#8221;) data analysis technique has been shown to improve the mapping of genetic pathways involved in the diagnosis and prevention of certain diseases. HDC scientists believe that these analytic methods are effective for finding genes implicated in several cancers, HIV infection, lymphedema, Down's syndrome, and a host of other diseases, as well as the pharmacogenetic profiling of patients.

&#160;

FGM technology is designed to study complex networks. A complex network can be made up of genes inside a living organism, web pages on the Internet, stocks within a financial market, or any group of objects or processes that appear to be connected together in some intricate way. FGM uses an approach toward modeling network behavior to rapidly generate diagrams and software simulations that facilitate prediction and analysis of the process, which is the particular object of a study.

Our Business Activity 

&#160; 

NeoGenomics License 

&#160;

On January 6, 2012, we entered into a Master License Agreement (the &#8220;NeoGenomics License&#8221;) with NeoGenomics Laboratories, Inc. (&#8220;NeoGenomics Laboratories&#8221;), a wholly owned subsidiary of NeoGenomics, Inc. (&#8220;NeoGenomics&#8221;). Pursuant to the terms of the NeoGenomics License, we granted to NeoGenomics Laboratories and its affiliates an exclusive worldwide license to certain of our patents and know-how to use, develop and sell products in the fields of laboratory testing, molecular diagnostics, clinical pathology, anatomic pathology and digital image analysis (excluding non-pathology-related radiologic and photographic image analysis) relating to the development, marketing production or sale of any &#8220;Laboratory Developed Tests&#8221; or LDTs or other products used for diagnosing, ruling out, predicting a response to treatment, and/or monitoring treatment of any or all hematopoietic and solid tumor cancers excluding cancers affecting the retina and breast cancer. We retain all rights to in-vitro diagnostic (&#8220;IVD&#8221;) test kit development.

&#160;

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Upon execution of the NeoGenomics License, NeoGenomics paid us $1,000,000 in cash and issued to us 1,360,000 shares of NeoGenomic&#8217;s common stock, par value $0.001 per share, which had a market value of $1,945,000 using the closing price of $1.43 per share for NeoGenomic&#8217;s common stock on the OTC Bulletin Board on January 6, 2012. In addition, the NeoGenomics License provides for milestone payments in cash or stock, based on sublicensing revenue and revenue generated from products and services developed as a result of the NeoGenomics License. Milestone payments will be in increments of $500,000 for every $2,000,000 in United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) revenue recognized by NeoGenomics up to a total of $5,000,000 in potential milestone payments. After $20,000,000 in cumulative GAAP revenue has been recognized by NeoGenomics, we will receive a royalty of (i) 6.5% (subject to adjustment under certain circumstances) on net revenue generated from all Licensed Uses except for the Cytogenetic Interpretation System and the Flow Cytometry Interpretation System and (ii) a royalty of 50% of net revenue (after the recoupment of certain development and commercialization costs) that NeoGenomics derives from any sublicensing arrangements it may put in place for the Cytogenetic Interpretation System and the Flow Cytometry Interpretation System.

&#160;

NeoGenomics agreed to use it best efforts to commercialize certain products within one year of the date of the license, subject to two one-year extensions per product if needed, including a &#8220;Plasma Prostate Cancer Test&#8221;, a &#8220;Pancreatic Cancer Test&#8221;, a &#8220;Colon Cancer Test&#8221;, a &#8220;Cytogenetic Interpretation System&#8221;, and a &#8220;Flow Cytometry Interpretation System.&#8221; NeoGenomics has completed both of its one-year extension terms of the license. While those one-year extension terms are complete, the Company and NeoGenomics continue to collaborate on efforts to commercialize the licensed technologies.

&#160;

If NeoGenomics has not generated $5.0 million of net revenue from products, services and sublicensing arrangements by January 2017, we may, at our option, revoke the exclusivity with respect to any one or more of the initial licensed products, subject to certain conditions.

&#160;

The Company believes our relationship with NeoGenomics is instrumental in our medical and diagnostic testing development. We further believe the majority, if not all, of our applications in the medical field will be implemented in conjunction with NeoGenomics.

&#160; 

Plasma Test for Prostate Cancer 

&#160; 

NeoGenomics is developing a Blood Test for Prostate Cancer under the direction of Dr. Maher Albitar using the genes patented by HDC. The test is performed on blood plasma and urine rather than only prostate tissue biopsies. NeoGenomics completed Phase I of their research and published the results in 2014. Additionally, NeoGenomics completed Phase II of their prostate test validation in 2014. The results were largely the same as those published regarding Phase I. NeoGenomics is currently concluding a clinical trial for this test, named NeoLAB&#8482; Prostate &#8211; Liquid Alternative to Biopsy. NeoGenomics announced in March 2016 the test is now commercially available.

&#160;

Cytogenetic Analysis 

&#160;

Cytogenetic analysis is the science of studying chromosomes. Microscopic evaluation of individual chromosomes remains the first step in the evaluation of the human genome. Cytogenetic analysis is performed on almost all patients with hematopoietic diseases (blood cancers such as leukemia and lymphoma) and on a significant number of patients with solid tumors. The collected data is useful for diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of diseases. Currently, specially trained technicians perform most of the analysis manually. The work is labor-intensive and subjective. Computer automation of this work could significantly reduce cost and improve the quality of the test.

&#160;

NeoGenomics is currently working on development, validation and commercialization of this new image analysis tool for cytogenetic analysis under the direction of Dr. Maher Albitar. The Company and NeoGenomics have spent a considerable amount of time using SVM Technology to create significant improvement in cytogenetic analysis. NeoGenomics is currently beta testing this co-developed technology within their facilities. One of the goals with this technology is for NeoGenomics to sub-license this technology after successful internal testing and validation. Per the license agreement, HDC will receive a portion of the sub-license revenue generated by NeoGenomics.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Flow Cytometry 

&#160;

Management believes that our efforts to develop an SVM-based diagnostic test to help interpret flow cell cytometry data for myelodysplastic syndrome (pre-leukemia) has resulted in a successful proof of concept. The Company, along with NeoGenomics, is now capable of completing development, final validation and commercialization of the new diagnostic test for the interpretation of flow cytometry data. This test has been licensed to NeoGenomics for final development and work has begun on the further development of this technology.

&#160;

SVM Capital, LLC 

&#160;

In January 2007, SVM Capital, LLC (&#8220;SVM Capital&#8221;) was formed as a joint venture between HDC and Atlantic Alpha Strategies, LLC (&#8220;Atlantic Alpha&#8221;) to explore and exploit the potential applicability of our SVM technology to quantitative investment management techniques. Atlantic Alpha&#8217;s management has over thirty years of experience in commodity and futures trading. 

&#160;

In November 2012, Atlantic Alpha began auditable formal live trading by applying SVM technology to quarterly fundamental corporate data such as sales, earnings and projected earnings. The SVM algorithm is utilized to select U.S. stocks which are expected to outperform or underperform in the next quarter based on current data while at the same time rendering superior portfolio risk metrics. This application of SVM technology allows the creation of a variety of equity portfolios. SVM Capital has been pleased with the results of the application of the SVM technology.

&#160;

On June 16, 2015, SVM Capital joined Manifold Partners, LLC (&#8220;Manifold Partners&#8221;) as a partner. Manifold Partners is a San Francisco-based multi-strategy portfolio management firm specializing in quantitative investment methodologies. As a part of the partnership, SVM Capital will contribute their proprietary service to the collaboration with Manifold Partners. This new collaboration will be known as Manifold Vector. SVM Capital specializes in the application of an artificial intelligence technique to investment strategies. SVM Capital has developed mathematical algorithms to rank-order S&#38;P 500 stocks to determine investment desirability, including long and short equity positions. Importantly, only fundamental corporate data is analyzed, which Manifold Partners believes to be unique in the quantitative investment field. This technology is an outgrowth of the machine learning techniques created by the Company. A thorough exposition of SVM Capital may be found on the appropriate link in HDC's web page.

&#160;

Governmental Regulation 

&#160;

Our business plan involves discovery in the field of molecular diagnostics. This early discovery process does not involve any governmental regulations or approvals. If we are successful in licensing our discoveries to other companies, FDA approvals may be required before the ultimate product may be sold to consumers. Our current plan is to require the companies licensing our discoveries or technologies to be responsible for the costs involved in such approvals. If we are not successful in licensing these discoveries on these terms or choose to take these discoveries to market ourselves, we may then be subject to applicable FDA regulations and would then bear the costs of such approvals.

&#160;

We know of no current governmental regulations that will materially affect the Company&#8217;s current operations or products. However, if the FDA changes its current position, and decides to regulate laboratory-developed tests (LDT's) currently regulated by CLIA certification, this could materially affect the development costs and commercialization timelines for our products.

There is intense competition among countless healthcare, biotechnology and diagnostics companies attempting to discover potential new diagnostic products. These companies may:

&#183; develop new diagnostic products before we or our collaborators are able to; &#183; develop diagnostic products that are more effective or cost-effective than those developed by us or our collaborators; or &#183; patent protect other intellectual property rights that would limit our ability to develop and commercialize our technology by limiting the ability to use, ours, or our collaborators&#8217;, diagnostic products. &#160;

The Company competes with companies in the United States and abroad that are engaged in the development and commercialization of diagnostic tests that utilize biomarker discovery and image analysis techniques. These companies may develop products that are competitive with and/or perform the same or similar to the products offered by our collaborators or us. Also, clinical laboratories may offer testing services that are competitive with the products sold by our collaborators or us. The testing services offered by clinical laboratories may be easier to develop and market than test kits developed by us or our collaborators because the testing services are not subject to the same clinical validation requirements that are applicable to FDA-cleared or approved diagnostic test kits.

&#160;

While a number of companies perform biomarker discovery, we believe that our SVM and SVM-RFE technologies give us a distinct advantage over competing technologies. Neither classical statistical analysis nor neural networks (the competing technologies) can effectively handle the large amounts of inputs necessary to produce fully validated biomarkers like the Company&#8217;s technology.
