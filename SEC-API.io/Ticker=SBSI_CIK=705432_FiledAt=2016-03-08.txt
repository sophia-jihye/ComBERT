FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION 

The disclosures set forth in this item are qualified by the section captioned &#8220;Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; in &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other cautionary statements set forth elsewhere in this report. 

GENERAL 

Southside Bancshares, Inc., incorporated in Texas in 1982, is a bank holding company for Southside Bank, a Texas state bank headquartered in Tyler, Texas that was formed in 1960. We operate through 60 &#32;banking centers, 18 &#32;of which are located in grocery stores, and 26 &#32;motor bank facilities. 

At December 31, 2015 , our total assets were $5.16 billion , total loans were $2.43 billion , deposits were $3.46 billion , and total equity was $444.1 million . For the years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , our net income was $44.0 million &#32;and $20.8 million &#32;and diluted earnings per common share were $1.73 &#32;and $1.04 , respectively. We have paid a cash dividend every year since 1970 (including dividends paid by Southside Bank prior to the incorporation of Southside Bancshares). 

We are a community-focused financial institution that offers a full range of financial services to individuals, businesses, municipal entities, and nonprofit organizations in the communities that we serve. These services include consumer and commercial loans, deposit accounts, trust services, safe deposit services and brokerage services. 

Our consumer loan services include 1-4 family residential loans, home equity loans, home improvement loans, automobile loans and other installment loans. Commercial loan services include short-term working capital loans for inventory and accounts receivable, short and medium-term loans for equipment or other business capital expansion, commercial real estate loans and municipal loans. We also offer construction loans for 1-4 family residential and commercial real estate. 

We offer a variety of deposit accounts with a wide range of interest rates and terms, including savings, money market, interest and noninterest bearing checking accounts and certificates of deposit (&#8220;CDs&#8221;). Our trust services include investment management, administration and advisory services, primarily for individuals and, to a lesser extent, partnerships and corporations. At December 31, 2015 , our trust department managed approximately $878.3 million &#32;of trust assets. 

Our business strategy includes evaluating expansion opportunities through acquisitions of financial institutions in market areas that could complement our existing franchise. We generally seek merger partners that are culturally similar, have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management, economies of scale and expanded services. During 2014, we acquired OmniAmerican Bancorp, Inc., a bank holding company traded on the NASDAQ Global Market and the holding company for OmniAmerican Bank, a federal savings association, headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas. See "Note 2 - Acquisition" in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. 

We and our subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive regulation, examination and supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;), the Texas Department of Banking (the &#8220;TDB&#8221;) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the &#8220;FDIC&#8221;) and are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to internal controls, the extension of credit, making of loans to individuals, deposits, and all other facets of our operations. 

Our administrative offices are located at 1201 South Beckham Avenue, Tyler, Texas 75701, and our telephone number is 903-531-7111. Our website can be found at www.southside.com . Our public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission 

(the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) may be obtained free of charge on either our website, https://www.southside.com/about/investor-relations &#32; under the topic Documents, or the SEC&#8217;s website, www.sec.gov, &#32;as soon as reasonably practicable after filing with the SEC. 

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 

During April 2015, we dissolved SFG. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we closed one of our leased grocery store branches in Seven Points and branch locations in Ft. Worth and Forney, both of which were leased. 

MARKET AREA 

We are headquartered in Tyler, Texas. The Tyler metropolitan area has a population of approximately 210,000 &#32;and is located approximately 90 miles east of Dallas, Texas and 90 miles west of Shreveport, Louisiana. 

We consider our primary market areas to be East Texas, the greater Fort Worth, Texas area and the greater Austin, Texas area. Our expectation is that our presence in all of the market areas we serve should grow in the future. In addition, we continue to explore new markets in which we believe we can expand successfully. 

The principal economic activities in our market areas include retail, distribution, manufacturing, medical services, education, government and oil and gas industries. Additionally, the industry base includes conventions and tourism, as well as retirement relocation. These economic activities support a growing regional system of medical service, retail and education centers. Tyler, Longview, Fort Worth, Austin and Arlington are home to several nationally recognized health care systems that represent all major specialties. 

Our 60 &#32;branches and 26 &#32;motor bank facilities are located in and around Tyler, Longview, Lindale, Gresham, Jacksonville, Bullard, Chandler, Hawkins, Palestine, Gun Barrel City, Athens, Whitehouse, Fort Worth, Arlington, Cleburne, Euless, Flower Mound, Granbury, Grapevine, Irving, Watauga, Weatherford and Austin. Our advertising is designed to target the market areas we serve. The type and amount of advertising in each market area is directly attributable to our market share in that market area combined with overall cost. 

Additionally, our customers may access various banking services through a network of over 74 automated teller machines (&#8220;ATMs&#8221;) and ATMs owned by others, through debit cards, and through our automated telephone, internet and electronic banking products. These products allow our customers to apply for loans from their computers, access account information and conduct various other transactions from their telephones, smart phones and computers. 

THE BANKING INDUSTRY IN TEXAS 

The banking industry is affected by general economic conditions such as interest rates, inflation, recession, unemployment and other factors beyond our control. During the last thirty years the Texas economy has continued to diversify, decreasing the overall impact of fluctuations in oil and gas prices; however, the oil and gas industry is still a significant component of the Texas economy. Since 2010, economic growth and business activity across a wide range of industries and regions in the U.S. has been slow and uneven. During a majority of that time economic growth and business activity in Texas exceeded the U.S. average. However in 2014, decisions by certain members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (&#8220;OPEC&#8221;) to maintain higher crude oil production levels, combined with increased production levels in the United States led to increased global oil supplies which has resulted in significant declines in market oil prices. Decreased market oil prices have compressed margins for many U.S. and Texas-based oil producers, particularly those that utilize higher-cost production technologies such as hydraulic fracking and horizontal drilling, as well as oilfield service providers, energy equipment manufacturers and transportation suppliers, among others. As of December 31, 2015, the price per barrel of crude oil was approximately $37 compared to approximately $98 as of December 31, 2013. A prolonged period of low oil prices could have a negative impact on the U.S. economy and, in particular, the economies of energy-dominant states such as Texas. We cannot predict whether current economic conditions will improve, remain the same or decline. 

COMPETITION 

The activities we are engaged in are highly competitive. Financial institutions such as credit unions, consumer finance companies, insurance companies, brokerage companies and other financial institutions with varying degrees of regulatory restrictions compete vigorously for a share of the financial services market. During 2015, the number of financial institutions in our market areas increased, a trend that we expect will continue. Brokerage and insurance companies continue to become more competitive in the financial services arena and pose an ever-increasing challenge to banks. Legislative changes also greatly affect the level of competition we face. Federal legislation allows credit unions to use their expanded membership capabilities, combined with tax-free status, to compete more fiercely for traditional bank business. The tax-free status granted to credit unions provides them with a significant competitive advantage. Many of the largest banks operating in Texas, including some of the largest banks in the country, have offices in our market areas with capital resources, broader geographic markets, and legal lending limits substantially in excess of those available to us. We face competition from institutions that offer products and services we do not or cannot currently offer. Some institutions we compete with offer interest rate levels on loan and deposit products that we are unwilling to offer due to interest rate risk and overall profitability concerns. We expect the level of competition to continue to increase. 

EMPLOYEES 

At February 19, 2016 , we employed approximately 683 &#32;full time equivalent persons. None of our employees are represented by any unions or similar groups, and we have not experienced any type of strike or labor dispute. We consider the relationship with our employees to be good. 

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 

General 

Banking is a complex, highly regulated industry. As a bank holding company under federal law, the Company is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve. In addition, under state law, as the parent company of a Texas-chartered state bank that is not a member of the Federal Reserve System, the Company is subject to supervision and examination by the TDB. As a Texas-chartered state bank, Southside Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the TDB, as its chartering authority, and by the FDIC, as its primary federal regulator and deposit insurer. This system of regulation and supervision applicable to us establishes a comprehensive framework for our operations and is intended primarily for the protection of bank depositors, the FDIC&#8217;s Deposit Insurance Fund (&#8220;DIF&#8221;) and the public, rather than our shareholders and creditors. 

In addition to the system of regulation and supervision outlined above, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;), which is discussed in greater detail below, created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the &#8220;Bureau&#8221;), a federal regulatory body with broad authority to regulate the offering and provision of consumer financial products. The Bureau officially came into being on July 21, 2011, and rulemaking authority for a range of consumer financial protection laws (such as the Truth in Lending Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, among others) transferred from the federal prudential banking regulators to the Bureau on that date. The Dodd-Frank Act gives the Bureau authority to supervise and examine depository institutions with more than $10 billion in assets for compliance with these federal consumer laws. The authority to supervise and examine depository institutions with $10 billion or less in assets for compliance with federal consumer laws will remain largely with those institutions&#8217; primary regulators. However, the Bureau may participate in examinations of these smaller institutions on a &#8220;sampling basis&#8221; and may refer potential enforcement actions against such institutions to their primary regulators. The Bureau will also have supervisory and examination authority over certain nonbank institutions that offer consumer financial products. The Dodd-Frank Act identifies a number of covered nonbank institutions, and also authorizes the Bureau to identify additional institutions that will be subject to its jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Bureau may participate in examinations of Southside Bank, and could supervise and examine other direct or indirect subsidiaries of the Company that offer consumer financial products. 

The earnings of Southside Bank and, therefore, the earnings of the Company, are affected by general economic conditions, changes in federal and state laws and regulations and actions of various regulatory authorities, including those referenced above. Additional changes to the laws and regulations applicable to us are frequently proposed at both the federal and state levels. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, which was enacted on July 21, 2010, the regulatory framework under which we operate has changed and will continue to change substantially over the next several years. The Dodd-Frank Act represents a significant overhaul of many aspects of the regulation of the financial services industry, addressing, among other things, systemic risk, capital adequacy, deposit insurance assessments, consumer financial protection, interchange fees, derivatives, lending limits, mortgage lending practices, registration of investment advisors and changes among the bank regulatory agencies. Among the provisions that have impacted or are likely to affect the operations of the Company and Southside Bank are the following: 

&#8226; 

Creation of the Bureau with centralized authority, including supervisory, examination and enforcement authority, for consumer protection in the banking industry; 

&#8226; 

New limitations on federal preemption; 

&#8226; 

New prohibitions and restrictions on the ability of a banking entity and nonbank financial company to engage in proprietary trading and have certain interests in, or relationships with, a hedge fund or private equity fund; 

&#8226; 

Application of new regulatory capital requirements, including changes to leverage and risk-based capital standards and changes to the components of permissible tiered capital; 

&#8226; 

Requirement that holding companies and their subsidiary banks be well capitalized and well managed in order to engage in activities permitted for financial holding companies; 

&#8226; 

Changes to the assessment base for deposit insurance premiums; 

&#8226; 

Permanently raising the FDIC&#8217;s standard maximum deposit insurance amount to $250,000; 

&#8226; 

Repeal of the prohibition on the payment of interest on demand deposits, thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts; 

&#8226; 

Restrictions on compensation, including a prohibition on incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by covered financial institutions and are deemed to be excessive, or that may lead to material losses; 

&#8226; 

Requirement that sponsors of asset-backed securities retain a percentage of the credit risk underlying the securities; and 

&#8226; 

Requirement that banking regulators remove references to and requirements of reliance upon credit ratings from their regulations and replace them with appropriate alternatives for evaluating creditworthiness. 

Some of these and other major changes could materially impact the profitability of our business, the value of assets we hold or the collateral available for our loans, require changes to business practices, or force us to discontinue businesses and expose us to additional costs, taxes, liabilities, enforcement actions and reputational risk. Many of these provisions became effective upon enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, while others were subject to further study, rulemaking, and the discretion of regulatory bodies and have only recently taken effect or will take effect in the coming years. In light of these significant changes and the discretion afforded to federal regulators, we cannot fully predict the effect that compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act or any implementing regulations will have on the Company or Southside Bank&#8217;s businesses or their ability to pursue future business opportunities. Additional regulations resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition or results of operations. 

The likelihood, timing, and scope of any such change and the impact any such change may have on us are impossible to determine with any certainty. Also, additional changes to the laws and regulations applicable to us are frequently proposed at both the federal and state levels. We cannot predict whether new legislation or regulations will be enacted and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any regulations, would have on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Set forth below is a brief description of the significant federal and state laws and regulations to which we are currently subject. These descriptions do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular statutory or regulatory provision. 

Holding Company Regulation 

As a bank holding company regulated under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (&#8220;BHCA&#8221;), as amended, the Company is registered with and subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve. The Company is required to file annual and other reports with, and furnish information to, the Federal Reserve, which makes periodic inspections of the Company. 

Permitted Activities . &#32;Under the BHCA, a bank holding company is generally permitted to engage in, or acquire direct or indirect control of more than five percent of the voting shares of any company engaged in, the following activities: 

&#8226; 

banking or managing or controlling banks; 

&#8226; 

furnishing services to or performing services for our subsidiaries; and 

&#8226; 

any activity that the Federal Reserve determines to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking, including: 

&#9702; 

factoring accounts receivable; 

&#9702; 

making, acquiring, brokering or servicing loans and usual related activities; 

&#9702; 

leasing personal or real property; 

&#9702; 

operating a nonbank depository institution, such as a savings association; 

&#9702; 

performing trust company functions; 

&#9702; 

conducting financial and investment advisory activities; 

&#9702; 

conducting discount securities brokerage activities; 

&#9702; 

underwriting and dealing in government obligations and money market instruments; 

&#9702; 

providing specified management consulting and counseling activities; 

&#9702; 

performing selected data processing services and support services; 

&#9702; 

acting as agent or broker in selling credit life insurance and other types of insurance in connection with credit transactions; 

&#9702; 

performing selected insurance underwriting activities; 

&#9702; 

providing certain community development activities (such as making investments in projects designed primarily to promote community welfare); and 

&#9702; 

issuing and selling money orders and similar consumer-type payment instruments. 

The Federal Reserve has the authority to order a bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any of these activities or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when the Federal Reserve has reasonable cause to believe that the bank holding company&#8217;s continued ownership, activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of it or any of its bank subsidiaries. 

Under the BHCA, a bank holding company meeting certain eligibility requirements may elect to become a &#8220;financial holding company,&#8221; which is a form of bank holding company with authority to engage in additional activities. Specifically, a financial holding company and companies under its control may engage in activities that are &#8220;financial in nature,&#8221; as defined by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (&#8220;GLBA&#8221;) and Federal Reserve interpretations, and therefore may engage in a broader range of activities than those permitted for bank holding companies and their subsidiaries. Financial activities specifically include insurance brokerage and underwriting, securities underwriting and dealing, merchant banking, investment advisory and lending activities. Financial holding companies and their subsidiaries also may engage in additional activities that are determined by the Federal Reserve, in consultation with the U.S. Department of the Treasury, to be &#8220;financial in nature or incidental to&#8221; a financial activity or are determined by the Federal Reserve unilaterally to be &#8220;complementary&#8221; to financial activities. 

In order to offer broker-dealer services through our subsidiary, Southside Securities, Inc., on February 8, 2011, we filed with the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas a declaration of financial holding company status and were granted financial holding company status on March 22, 2011. Election of financial holding company status is not automatic and it was granted based upon consideration of a number of factors, including that all of our depository institution subsidiaries satisfy the Federal Reserve&#8217;s &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; and &#8220;well managed&#8221; standards and have at least a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act (&#8220;CRA&#8221;) (discussed below). Now that we have succeeded in attaining financial holding company status, that status could be impacted by the condition of Southside Bank and/or other factors. For example, if Southside Bank ceases to be &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; or &#8220;well managed&#8221; under applicable regulatory standards, the Federal Reserve may, among other things, place limitations on our ability to conduct broader financial activities or, if the deficiencies persist, require us to divest Southside Bank. In addition, if Southside Bank were to receive a rating of less than satisfactory under the CRA, we would be prohibited from engaging in any additional activities other than those permissible for bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies. If we undertake expanded financial activities (that are not permissible for a bank holding company) and we fail to continue to meet any of the prerequisites for &#8220;financial holding company&#8221; status, including those described above, the financial holding company would be required to enter into an agreement with the Federal Reserve to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements. If we do not return to compliance within 180 days, the Federal Reserve may order the financial holding company to divest its Bank or the Company may discontinue or divest investments in companies engaged in activities permissible only for a bank holding company that has elected to be treated as a financial holding company. We began engaging in broker-dealer activities through Southside Securities, Inc. on June 16, 2011. In early 2013, to further concentrate on our primary business of banking, a management decision was made to close Southside Securities, Inc. We ceased engaging in broker-dealer activities through Southside Securities, Inc. in the second quarter of 2013. However, our financial holding company status has been maintained. 

Capital Adequacy . Each of the federal banking agencies, including the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, has issued substantially similar risk-based and leverage capital guidelines applicable to the banking organizations they supervise. As a result of new regulations, we were required to begin complying with higher minimum capital requirements as of January 1, 2015. The new capital rules (&#8220;Updated Capital Rules&#8221;), which are discussed below, implement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and a separate, international regulatory capital initiative known as &#8220;Basel III.&#8221; These Updated Capital Rules also make important changes to the &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; framework discussed below in Bank Regulation - Prompt Corrective Action and Undercapitalization . 

The agencies&#8217; prior risk-based guidelines, applicable to the Company before January 1, 2015, defined a three-tier capital framework. Risk-based capital ratios were calculated by dividing, as appropriate, total capital and Tier 1 capital by risk-weighted assets. Assets and off-balance sheet exposures were assigned to one of four categories of risk weights, based primarily on relative credit risk. Under these prior risk-based capital requirements, the Company and Southside Bank were each generally required to maintain a minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8% and a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4%. To the extent we engaged in trading activities, we were required to adjust our risk-based capital ratios to take into consideration market risks that may result from movements in market prices of covered trading positions in trading accounts, or from foreign exchange or commodity positions, whether or not in trading accounts, including changes in interest rates, equity prices, foreign exchange rates or commodity prices. 

Each of the federal bank regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, also had established minimum leverage capital requirements for the banking organizations they supervise. These requirements provided that banking organizations that met certain criteria, including excellent asset quality, high liquidity, low interest rate exposure and good earnings, and that had received the highest regulatory rating must maintain a ratio of Tier 1 capital to total adjusted average assets of at least 3%. Institutions not meeting these criteria, as well as institutions with supervisory, financial or operational weaknesses, were expected to maintain a minimum Tier 1 capital to total adjusted average assets ratio equal to 100 to 200 basis points above this stated minimum. Holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions were expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets. The Federal Reserve also considered a &#8220;tangible Tier 1 capital leverage ratio&#8221; (deducting all intangibles) and other indicators of capital strength in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activity. 

The Updated Capital Rules, which became applicable to the Company and the Bank on January 1, 2015, made substantial changes to these previous standards. Among other things, the new regulations (i) introduced a new capital requirement known as &#8220;Common Equity Tier 1&#8221; (&#8220;CET1&#8221;), (ii) stated that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and &#8220;Additional Tier 1 capital&#8221; instruments meeting certain requirements, (iii) defined CET1 to require that most deductions and adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital and (iv) revised the scope of the deductions and adjustments from capital as compared to regulations that previously applied to the Company and other banking organizations. 

The Updated Capital Rules also established the following minimum capital ratios: 4.5 percent CET1 to risk-weighted assets; 6.0 percent Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets; 8.0 percent total capital to risk-weighted assets; and 4.0 percent Tier 1 leverage ratio to average consolidated assets. In addition, the Updated Capital Rules also introduced a minimum &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; equal to 2.5% of an organization&#8217;s total risk-weighted assets, which exists in addition to these new required minimum CET1, Tier 1, and total capital ratios. The &#8220;capital conservation buffer,&#8221; which must consist entirely of CET1, is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. The Updated Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1, which include the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1. 

Certain regulatory capital ratios of the Company and Southside Bank, as of December 31, 2015, are shown in the following table.

Under the previous capital framework, the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income items included in shareholders&#8217; equity under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP ") were excluded for the purposes of determining capital ratios. However, the effects of certain accumulated other comprehensive items are not excluded under the Updated Capital Rules. The Updated Capital Rules permitted most banking organizations, including the Company and Southside Bank, to make a one-time permanent election on the institution&#8217;s first call report filed after January 1, 2015 to continue to exclude these items, which Southside Bank did in its March 31, 2015 call report. 

Under the Updated Capital Rules, certain hybrid securities, such as trust preferred securities, do not qualify as Tier 1 capital. However, for bank holding companies like us that had assets of less than $15 billion as of December 31, 2009, trust preferred securities issued prior to May 19, 2010 can be treated as Tier 1 capital to the extent that they do not exceed 25% of Tier 1 capital after the application of capital deductions and adjustments. 

In addition, reflecting the importance that regulators place on managing capital and other risks, in May 2012 the banking agencies also issued guidance on stress testing for banking organizations with more than $10 billion in total consolidated assets. This guidance outlines four &#8220;high-level&#8221; principles for stress testing practices that should be a part of a banking organization&#8217;s stress-testing framework. Specifically, the guidance calls for the framework to (i) include activities and exercises that are tailored to and sufficiently capture the banking organization&#8217;s exposures, activities and risks; (ii) employ multiple conceptually sound stress testing activities and approaches; (iii) be forward-looking and flexible; and (iv) be clear, actionable, well-supported, and used in the decision-making process. Moreover, the federal bank regulators have issued a series of guidance and rulemakings applicable to &#8220;large banks.&#8221; While many of these do not currently apply to us due to our asset size, these issuances could impact industry capital standards and practices in many, potentially unforeseeable, ways. 

Source of Strength . Federal Reserve policy requires a bank holding company to act as a source of financial strength and to take measures to preserve and protect bank subsidiaries in situations where additional investments in a troubled bank may not otherwise be warranted. As a result, a bank holding company may be required to contribute additional capital to its subsidiaries in the form of capital notes or other instruments which qualify as capital under regulatory rules. Any loans from the holding company to its subsidiary banks likely will be unsecured and subordinated to the bank&#8217;s depositors and perhaps to other creditors of the bank. Notably, the Dodd-Frank Act codified the Federal Reserve&#8217;s &#8220;source of strength&#8221; policy; this statutory change became effective July 21, 2011. In addition to the foregoing requirements, the Dodd-Frank Act&#8217;s provisions authorize the Federal Reserve and other federal banking regulators to require a company that directly or indirectly controls a bank to submit reports that are designed both to assess the ability of such company to comply with its &#8220;source of strength&#8221; obligations and to enforce the company&#8217;s compliance with these obligations. As of December 31, 2015 the Federal Reserve and other federal banking regulators have not yet issued rules implementing this requirement. 

In addition, if a bank holding company enters into bankruptcy or becomes subject to the orderly liquidation process established by the Dodd-Frank Act, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee or the FDIC, as appropriate, and entitled to a priority of payment. In addition, the FDIC provides that any insured depository institution generally will be liable for any loss incurred by the FDIC in connection with the default of, or any assistance provided by the FDIC to, a commonly controlled insured depository institution. Southside Bank is an FDIC-insured depository institution and thus subject to these requirements. See also Bank Regulation - Prompt Corrective Action and Undercapitalization . 

Dividends . The principal source of our liquidity at the parent company level is dividends from Southside Bank. Southside Bank is subject to federal and state restrictions on its ability to pay dividends to the Company. We must pay essentially all of our operating expenses from funds we receive from Southside Bank. Therefore, shareholders may receive dividends from us only to the extent that funds are available after payment of our operating expenses. Consistent with its &#8220;source of strength&#8221; policy, the Federal Reserve discourages bank holding companies from paying dividends except out of operating earnings and prefers that dividends be paid only if, after the payment, the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the bank holding company&#8217;s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. 

Among other things, the ability of banks and bank holding companies to pay dividends, and the contents of their respective dividend policies, could be impacted by a range of changes imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act, many of which will require implementing rules to become effective. See also Bank Regulation - Dividends &#32;for additional information. 

Change in Control . Subject to certain exceptions, under the BHCA and the Change in Bank Control Act (&#8220;CBCA&#8221;), and the regulations promulgated thereunder, persons who intend to acquire direct or indirect control of a depository institution or a bank holding company are required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve prior to acquiring control. With respect to the Company, &#8220;control&#8221; is conclusively presumed to exist where an acquiring party directly or indirectly owns, controls or has the power to vote at least 25% of our voting securities. Under the Federal Reserve&#8217;s CBCA regulations, a rebuttable presumption of control would arise with respect to an acquisition where, after the transaction, the acquiring party owns, controls or has the power 

to vote at least 10% (but less than 25%) of our voting securities. In certain cases, a company may also be presumed to have control under the BHCA if it acquires five percent or more of any class of voting securities. 

On September 22, 2008, the Federal Reserve issued a policy statement on minority equity investments in banks and bank holding companies, that permits investors to (1) acquire up to 33 percent of the total equity of a target bank or bank holding company, subject to certain conditions, including that the acquiring investor does not acquire 15 percent or more of any class of voting securities, and (2) designate at least one director, without triggering the various regulatory requirements associated with control. 

Acquisitions . The BHCA provides that a bank holding company must obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve (i) for the acquisition of more than five percent of the voting stock in any bank or bank holding company, (ii) for the acquisition of substantially all the assets of any bank or bank holding company, or (iii) in order to merge or consolidate with another bank holding company. 

Regulatory Examination . Federal and state banking agencies require the Company and Southside Bank to prepare annual reports on financial condition and to conduct an annual audit of financial affairs in compliance with minimum standards and procedures. Southside Bank, and in some cases the Company and any nonbank affiliates, must undergo regular on-site examinations by the appropriate regulatory agency, which will examine for adherence to a range of legal and regulatory compliance responsibilities. A bank regulator conducting an examination has complete access to the books and records of the examined institution, and the results of the examination are confidential. The cost of examinations may be assessed against the examined organization as the agency deems necessary or appropriate. The FDIC has developed a method for insured depository institutions to provide supplemental disclosure of the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities, to the extent feasible and practicable, in any balance sheet, financial statement, report of condition or any other report. 

Enforcement Authority . The Federal Reserve has broad enforcement powers over bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries, as well as &#8220;institution-affiliated parties,&#8221; including management, employees, agents, independent contractors and consultants, such as attorneys and accountants and others who participate in the conduct of the institution&#8217;s affairs, and has authority to prohibit activities that represent unsafe or unsound banking practices or constitute knowing or reckless violations of laws or regulations. These powers may be exercised through the issuance of cease and desist orders, civil money penalties or other actions. Civil money penalties can be as high as $1,000,000 for each day the activity continues and criminal penalties for some financial institution crimes may include imprisonment for 20 years. Regulators have flexibility to commence enforcement actions against institutions and institution-affiliated parties, and the FDIC has the authority to terminate deposit insurance. When issued by a banking agency, cease and desist and similar orders may, among other things, require affirmative action to correct any harm resulting from a violation or practice, including restitution, reimbursement, indemnifications or guarantees against loss. A financial institution may also be ordered to restrict its growth, dispose of certain assets, rescind agreements or contracts, or take other actions determined to be appropriate by the ordering agency. The federal banking agencies also may remove a director or officer from an insured depository institution (or bar them from the industry) if a violation is willful or reckless. 

Bank Regulation 

Southside Bank is a Texas-chartered commercial bank, the deposits of which are insured up to the applicable limits by the DIF of the FDIC. Southside Bank is not a member of the Federal Reserve System. The Bank is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the TDB, as its chartering authority, and by the FDIC, as its primary federal regulator and deposit insurer. In addition, the Bureau could participate in examinations of the Bank (as described above) in the near term regarding the Bank&#8217;s offering of consumer financial products and services. The federal and state laws applicable to banks regulate, among other things, the scope of their business and investments, lending and deposit-taking activities, borrowings, maintenance of retained earnings and reserve accounts, distribution of earnings and payment of dividends. 

Permitted Activities and Investments . Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (&#8220;FDIA&#8221;), the activities and investments of state nonmember banks are generally limited to those permissible for national banks, notwithstanding state law. With FDIC approval, a state nonmember bank may engage in activities not permissible for a national bank if the FDIC determines that the activity does not pose a significant risk to the DIF and that the bank meets its minimum capital requirements. Similarly, under Texas law, a state bank may engage in those activities permissible for national banks domiciled in Texas. The TDB may permit a Texas state bank to engage in additional activities so long as the performance of the activity by the bank would not adversely affect the safety and soundness of the bank. 

On December 10, 2013, federal regulators, including the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, issued final rules to implement Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, known as the &#8220;Volcker Rule,&#8221; to prohibit insured depository institutions, such as Southside Bank, and their affiliates, such as the Company, from proprietary trading and acquiring certain interests in hedge or private equity funds. The final rules contain certain exemptions from the prohibition and permit the retention of certain ownership interests. 

Insured depository institutions were generally required to conform their activities and investments to the requirements by July 21, 2015, though the conformance period for legacy investments in and relationships with a covered fund will end on July 21, 2016. 

Brokered Deposits . Southside Bank also may be restricted in its ability to accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits, depending on its capital classification. Only &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; banks are permitted to accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits. The FDIC may, on a case-by-case basis, permit banks that are adequately capitalized to accept brokered deposits if the FDIC determines that acceptance of such deposits would not constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice with respect to the bank. Undercapitalized banks generally may not accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits. 

Loans to One Borrower . Under Texas law, without the approval of the TDB and subject to certain limited exceptions, the maximum aggregate amount of loans that Southside Bank is permitted to make to any one borrower is 25% of Tier 1 capital. 

Insider Loans . Under Regulation O of the Federal Reserve, as made applicable to state nonmember banks by section 18(j)(2) of the FDIA, Southside Bank is subject to quantitative restrictions on extensions of credit to its executive officers and directors, the executive officers and directors of the Company, any owner of 10% or more of its stock or the stock of Southside Bancshares, Inc. and certain entities affiliated with any such persons. In general, any such extensions of credit must (i) not exceed certain dollar limitations, (ii) be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties, and (iii) not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. Additional restrictions are imposed on extensions of credit to executive officers. Certain extensions of credit also require the approval of a bank&#8217;s board of directors. 

Deposit Insurance and Assessments . The deposits of Southside Bank are insured by the DIF of the FDIC, up to the applicable limits established by law and are subject to the deposit insurance premium assessments of the DIF. The Dodd-Frank Act amended the statutory regime governing the DIF. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act established a minimum designated reserve ratio (&#8220;DRR&#8221;) of 1.35 percent of estimated insured deposits (which the FDIC has set at 2.0 percent each year since 2010), required that the fund reserve ratio reach 1.35 percent by September 30, 2020 and directed the FDIC to amend its regulations to redefine the assessment base used for calculating deposit insurance assessments. Specifically, the Dodd-Frank Act requires the assessment base to be an amount equal to the average consolidated total assets of the insured depository institution during the assessment period, minus the sum of the average tangible equity of the insured depository institution during the assessment period and an amount the FDIC determines is necessary to establish assessments consistent with the risk-based assessment system found in the FDIA. 

Furthermore, on February 7, 2011, the FDIC issued a final rule changing its assessment system from one based on domestic deposits to one based on the average consolidated total assets of a bank minus its average tangible equity during each quarter. This rule modified two adjustments added to the risk-based pricing system in 2009 (an unsecured debt adjustment and a brokered deposit adjustment), discontinued a third adjustment added in 2009 (the secured liability adjustment), and added an adjustment for long-term debt held by an insured depository institution where the debt is issued by another insured depository institution. Under these revisions to the DIF rules, the total base assessment rates will vary depending on the DIF reserve ratio. For example, for banks in the best risk category, the initial total base assessment rates will be between 2.5 and 9 basis points when the DIF reserve ratio is below 1.15 percent, between 1.5 and 7 basis points when the DIF reserve ratio is between 1.15 percent and 2 percent, between 1 and 6 basis points when the DIF reserve ratio is between 2 percent and 2.5 percent and between 0.5 and 5 basis points when the DIF reserve ratio is 2.5 percent or higher. On June 16, 2015, the FDIC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would refine the deposit insurance assessment system for small insured depository institutions that have been federally insured for at least five years. The proposed rule would revise the financial ratios method, update the financial measures used, and eliminate risk categories for such banks. 

In addition, all FDIC-insured institutions are required to pay a pro rata portion of the interest due on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation (&#8220;FICO&#8221;) to fund the closing and disposal of failed thrift institutions by the Resolution Trust Corporation. FICO assessment rates, which are calculated off the assessment base established by the Dodd-Frank Act, are set quarterly. The rate was &#32;. 600 (annual) basis points for the first, second, and fourth quarters of 2015 and .580 (annual) basis points for the third quarter of 2015. It was 0.580 (annual) basis points for the first quarter of 2016. These assessments will continue until the FICO bonds mature in 2017 through 2019. 

Capital Adequacy . 

See Holding Company Regulation - Capital Adequacy . 

Prompt Corrective Action and Undercapitalization . The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (the &#8220;FDICIA&#8221;) established a system of prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized insured depository institutions. Under this system, the federal banking regulators are required to rate insured depository institutions on the basis of five capital categories as described below. The federal banking regulators are also required to take mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions, with respect to insured depository institutions in the three undercapitalized categories, the severity of which will depend upon the capital category in which the insured depository institution is assigned. Generally, subject to a narrow exception, the FDICIA requires the banking regulator to appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured depository institution that is critically undercapitalized. The federal banking agencies have specified by regulation the relevant capital level for each category. The thresholds for each of these categories were recently revised pursuant to the Basel III Capital Rules, which are discussed above in &#8220; Holding Company Regulation - Capital Adequacy .&#8221; These revised categories started to apply to Southside Bank on January 1, 2015. 

Under the regulations, all insured depository institutions are assigned to one of the following capital categories: 

&#8226; 

Well Capitalized - The insured depository institution exceeds the required minimum level for each relevant capital measure. Under the Updated Capital Rules, a well-capitalized insured depository institution is one (1) having a total risk-based capital ratio of 10 percent or greater, (2) having a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8 percent or greater, (3) having a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5 percent or greater, (4) having a leverage capital ratio of 5 percent or greater and (5) that is not subject to any order or written directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. 

&#8226; 

Adequately Capitalized - The insured depository institution meets the required minimum level for each relevant capital measure. Under the Updated Capital Rules, an adequately-capitalized depository institution is one having (1) a total risk based capital ratio of 8 percent or more, (2) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6 percent or more, (3) a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5 percent or more, and (4) a leverage ratio of 4 percent or more. 

&#8226; 

Undercapitalized - The insured depository institution fails to meet the required minimum level for any relevant capital measure. Under the Updated Capital Rules, an undercapitalized depository institution is one having (1) a total capital ratio of less than 8 percent, (2) a Tier 1 capital ratio of less than 6 percent, (3) a CET1 capital ratio of less than 4.5 percent, or (4) a leverage ratio of less than 4 percent. 

&#8226; 

Significantly Undercapitalized - The insured depository institution is significantly below the required minimum level for any relevant capital measure. Under the Updated Capital Rules, a significantly undercapitalized institution is one having (1) a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6 percent (2) a Tier 1 capital ratio of less than 4 percent, (3) a CET1 ratio of less than 3 percent or (4) a leverage capital ratio of less than 3 percent. 

&#8226; 

Critically Undercapitalized - The insured depository institution fails to meet a critical capital level set by the appropriate federal banking agency. A critically undercapitalized institution is one having a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2 percent. 

The prompt corrective action regulations permit the appropriate federal banking regulator to downgrade an institution to the next lower category if the regulator determines after notice and opportunity for hearing or response that (1) the institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition or (2) that the institution has received and not corrected a less-than-satisfactory rating for any of the categories of asset quality, management, earnings or liquidity in its most recent examination. Supervisory actions by the appropriate federal banking regulator depend upon an institution&#8217;s classification within the five categories. Our management believes that we and our Bank subsidiary have the requisite capital levels to qualify as well-capitalized institutions under the FDICIA regulations. 

If an institution fails to remain well capitalized, it will be subject to a variety of enforcement remedies that increase as the capital condition worsens. For instance, the FDICIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution, including payment of a dividend, or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized as a result. Undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to restrictions on borrowing from the Federal Reserve System. In addition, adequately-capitalized depository institutions may not accept brokered deposits absent a waiver from the FDIC and undercapitalized depository institutions may not accept brokered deposits, are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit capital restoration plans for regulatory approval. A depository institution&#8217;s holding company must guarantee any required capital restoration plan, up to an amount equal to the lesser of 5 percent of the depository institution&#8217;s assets at the time it becomes undercapitalized or the amount of the capital deficiency when the institution fails to comply with the plan. Federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution&#8217;s capital. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized. 

Significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. Critically undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator. 

In addition to the &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; directives, failure to meet capital guidelines may subject a banking organization to a variety of other enforcement remedies, including additional substantial restrictions on its operations and activities, termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC and, under certain conditions, the appointment of a conservator or receiver. 

Standards for Safety and Soundness . The FDIA also requires the federal banking regulatory agencies to prescribe, by regulation or guideline, operational and managerial standards for all insured depository institutions relating to: (i) internal controls; (ii) information systems and internal audit systems; (iii) loan documentation; (iv) credit underwriting; (v) interest rate risk exposure; and (vi) asset quality. The agencies also must prescribe standards for asset quality, earnings, and stock valuation, as well as standards for compensation, fees and benefits. The federal banking agencies have adopted regulations and Interagency Guidelines Prescribing Standards for Safety and Soundness (&#8220;Guidelines&#8221;) to implement these required standards. The Guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. Under the regulations, if the FDIC determines that Southside Bank fails to meet any standards prescribed by the Guidelines, it may require Southside Bank to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance, consistent with deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness compliance plans. Notably, the Dodd-Frank Act contains separate requirements relating to compensation arrangements. Specifically, the Dodd-Frank Act requires federal banking regulators to issue regulations or guidelines to prohibit incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by providing excessive compensation or that may lead to material loss at certain financial institutions with $1 billion or more in assets. A proposed rule was published in the Federal Register on April 14, 2011; however, regulators have yet to issue the final rule on the topic. 

Dividends . All dividends paid by Southside Bank are paid to the Company, as the sole shareholder of Southside Bank. The ability of Southside Bank, as a Texas state bank, to pay dividends is restricted under federal and state law and regulations. As an initial matter, the FDICIA and the regulations of the FDIC generally prohibit an insured depository institution from making a capital distribution (including payment of dividend) if, thereafter, the institution would not be at least adequately capitalized. Under Texas law, Southside Bank generally may not pay a dividend reducing its capital and surplus without the prior approval of the Texas Banking Commissioner. All dividends must be paid out of net profits then on hand, after deducting expenses, including losses and provisions for loan losses. 

Southside Bank&#8217;s general dividend policy is to pay dividends at levels consistent with maintaining liquidity and preserving applicable capital ratios and servicing obligations. Southside Bank&#8217;s dividend policies are subject to the discretion of its board of directors and will depend upon such factors as future earnings, financial conditions, cash needs, capital adequacy, compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and general business conditions. The exact amount of future dividends paid by Southside Bank will be a function of its general profitability (which cannot be accurately estimated or assured), applicable tax rates in effect from year to year and the discretion of its board of directors. 

As described above under Holding Company Regulation - Dividends , the ability of banks and bank holding companies to pay dividends, and the contents of their respective dividend policies, could be impacted by a range of changes imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act, many of which will require implementing rules to become effective. 

Transactions with Affiliates . Southside Bank is subject to sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (&#8220;FRA&#8221;) and the Federal Reserve&#8217;s Regulation W, as made applicable to state nonmember banks by section 18(j) of the FDIA. Sections 23A and 23B of the FRA restrict a bank&#8217;s ability to engage in certain transactions with its affiliates. An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the bank. In a holding company context, the parent bank holding company and any companies controlled by such parent bank holding company are generally affiliates of the bank. 

Specifically, section 23A places limits on the amount of &#8220;covered transactions,&#8221; which include loans or extensions of credit to, and investments in or certain other transactions with, affiliates. It also limits the amount of any advances to third parties that are collateralized by the securities or obligations of affiliates. The aggregate of all covered transactions is limited to 10 percent of the bank&#8217;s capital and surplus for any one affiliate and 20 percent for all affiliates. Additionally, within the foregoing limitations, each covered transaction must meet specified collateral requirements ranging from 100 to 130 percent of the loan amount, depending on the type of collateral. Further, banks are prohibited from purchasing low quality assets from an affiliate. Section 608 of the Dodd-Frank Act broadened the definition of &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; to include derivative transactions and the borrowing or lending of securities if the transaction will cause a bank to have credit exposure to an affiliate. The revised definition also includes the acceptance of debt obligations of an affiliate as collateral for a loan or extension of credit to a third party. Furthermore, reverse repurchase transactions are viewed as extensions of credit (instead of asset purchases) and thus become subject to collateral requirements. The expanded definition of &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; took effect on July 21, 2012. 

Section 23B, among other things, prohibits a bank from engaging in certain transactions with affiliates unless the transactions are on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliated companies. Except for limitations on low quality asset purchases and transactions that are deemed to be unsafe or unsound, Regulation W generally excludes affiliated depository institutions from treatment as affiliates. 

Anti-Tying Regulations . Under the BHCA and the Federal Reserve&#8217;s regulations, a bank is prohibited from engaging in certain tying or reciprocity arrangements with its customers. In general, a bank may not extend credit, lease, sell property, or furnish any services or fix or vary the consideration for these products or services on the condition that either: (i) the customer obtain or provide some additional credit, property, or services from or to the bank, the bank holding company or subsidiaries thereof or (ii) the customer not obtain credit, property, or service from a competitor, except to the extent reasonable conditions are imposed to assure the soundness of the credit extended. A bank may, however, offer combined-balance products and may otherwise offer more favorable terms if a customer obtains two or more traditional bank products. Also, certain foreign transactions are exempt from the general rule. 

Community Reinvestment Act . Under the CRA, Southside Bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with safe and sound banking practices, to help meet the needs of our entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for banks nor does it limit a bank&#8217;s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community. 

On a periodic basis, the FDIC is charged with preparing a written evaluation of our record of meeting the credit needs of the entire community and assigning a rating - outstanding, satisfactory, needs to improve or substantial noncompliance. Banks are rated based on their actual performance in meeting community credit needs. The FDIC will take that rating into account in its evaluation of any application made by the bank for, among other things, approval of the acquisition or establishment of a branch or other deposit facility, an office relocation, a merger or the acquisition of shares of capital stock of another financial institution. A bank&#8217;s CRA rating may be used as the basis to deny or condition an application. In addition, as discussed above, a bank holding company may not become a financial holding company unless each of its subsidiary banks has a CRA rating of at least &#8220;satisfactory.&#8221; As of January 1, 2014, the most recent exam date, Southside Bank has a CRA rating of &#8220;outstanding.&#8221; 

Branch Banking . Pursuant to the Texas Finance Code, all banks located in Texas are authorized to branch statewide. Accordingly, a bank located anywhere in Texas has the ability, subject to regulatory approval, to establish branch facilities near any of our facilities and within our market area. If other banks were to establish branch facilities near our facilities, it is uncertain whether these branch facilities would have a material adverse effect on our business. 

The Dodd-Frank Act substantially amended the legal framework that had previously governed interstate branching activities. Formerly, under the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, a bank&#8217;s ability to branch into a particular state was largely dependent upon whether the state &#8220;opted in&#8221; to de novo interstate branching. Many states did not &#8220;opt in,&#8221; which resulted in branching restrictions in those states. The Dodd-Frank Act removed the &#8220;opt-in&#8221; concept and permits banks to engage in de novo branching outside of their home states, provided that the laws of the target state permit banks chartered in that state to branch within that state. Accordingly, de novo interstate branching by Southside Bank is subject to these new standards. All branching in which Southside Bank may engage remains subject to regulatory approval and adherence to applicable legal and regulatory requirements. 

Consumer Protection Regulation . The activities of Southside Bank are subject to a variety of statutes and regulations designed to protect consumers. Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by the banks are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. Loan operations are also subject to federal laws and regulations applicable to credit transactions, such as: 

&#8226; 

the Truth In Lending Act and Regulation Z, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers; 

&#8226; 

the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and Regulation C, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves; 

&#8226; 

the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit; 

&#8226; 

the Fair Credit Reporting Act and Regulation V, governing the use and provision of information to consumer reporting agencies; 

&#8226; 

the Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies; and 

&#8226; 

the guidance of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal laws. 

Deposit and other operations also are subject to: 

&#8226; 

the Truth in Savings Act and Regulation DD, governing disclosure of deposit account terms to consumers; 

&#8226; 

the Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; and 

&#8226; 

the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Regulation E, which governs automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers&#8217; rights and liabilities arising from the use of ATMs and other electronic banking services, which the Bureau has expanded to include a new compliance regime that governs consumer-initiated cross border electronic transfers. 

Many of the foregoing laws and regulations have recently changed and are subject to further change resulting from the provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act and other developments. In addition to numerous new disclosure requirements, the Dodd-Frank Act imposed new standards for mortgage loan originations on all lenders, including banks, in an effort to encourage lenders to verify a borrower&#8217;s ability to repay. The Bureau issued a rule, which took effect on January 10, 2014, to implement this &#8220;ability-to-repay&#8221; requirement and provide lenders with protection from liability for &#8220;qualified mortgages,&#8221; as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The rule has impacted our residential mortgage lending practices, and the residential mortgage market generally. Most significantly, the new &#8220;qualified mortgage&#8221; standards generally limit the total points and fees that financial institutions and/or a broker may charge on conforming and jumbo loans to 3 percent of the total loan amount. Also, the Dodd-Frank Act, in conjunction with the Federal Reserve&#8217;s final rule on loan originator compensation issued August 16, 2010 and effective April 1, 2011, prohibits certain compensation payments to loan originators and steering consumers to loans not in their interest because it will result in greater compensation for a loan originator. In addition, the Bureau recently issued additional rules pertaining to loan originator compensation, and that established qualification, registration and licensing requirements for loan originators. These standards will result in a myriad of new system, pricing, and compensation controls in order to ensure compliance and to decrease repurchase requests and foreclosure defenses. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act generally requires lenders or securitizers to retain an economic interest in the credit risk relating to loans the lender sells and other asset-backed securities that the securitizer issues if the loans have not complied with the ability to repay standards. The final rule, which took effect on December 24, 2015 for residential mortgage-backed securitizations, generally requires the securitizer to retain not less than 5 percent of the credit risk. 

Moreover, the Bureau has republished the transferred regulations in a new section of the Code of Federal Regulations and has requested comments regarding an effort to &#8220;streamline&#8221; these regulations. It is also anticipated that the Bureau will be making substantive changes to a number of consumer protection regulations and associated disclosures in the near term including significant changes to certain requirements related to lending. The Bureau has also established a series of mechanisms to collect, track and make public consumer complaints, including complaints against individual financial institutions and is using this, and other information it has gathered, in connection with a variety of initiatives to address issues in markets for consumer financial products and services. The Bureau also has broad authority to prohibit unfair, deceptive and abusive acts and practices (&#8220;UDAAP&#8221;) and to investigate and penalize financial institutions that violate this prohibition. 

We cannot predict the effect that being regulated by a new, additional regulatory authority focused on consumer financial protection, or any new implementing regulations or revisions to existing regulations that may result from the establishment of this new authority, will have on our businesses. Additional regulations resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, Southside Bank also may be subject to certain state laws and regulations designed to protect consumers. 

Commercial Real Estate Lending . Lending operations that involve concentration of commercial real estate loans are subject to enhanced scrutiny by federal banking regulators. The regulators have issued guidance with respect to the risks posed by commercial real estate lending concentrations. Real estate loans generally include land development, construction loans, land and lot loans to individuals, loans secured by multi-family property and nonfarm nonresidential real property where the primary source of repayment is derived from rental income associated with the property. The guidance prescribes the following guidelines for examiners to help identify institutions that are potentially exposed to concentration risk and may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny: 

&#8226; 

total reported loans for construction, land development and other land represent 100 percent or more of the institution&#8217;s total capital, or 

&#8226; 

total commercial real estate loans represent 300 percent or more of the institution&#8217;s total capital and the outstanding balance of the institution&#8217;s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by 50 percent or more during the prior 36 months. 

In October 2009, the federal banking agencies issued additional guidance on real estate lending that emphasizes these considerations. 

In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act contains provisions that may impact our business by reducing the amount of our commercial real estate lending and increasing the cost of borrowing, including rules relating to risk retention of securitized assets. Section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act requires, among other things, a loan originator or a securitizer of asset-backed securities to retain a percentage of the credit risk of securitized assets. The banking agencies have jointly issued a final rule to implement these requirements, which will become effective on December 24, 2016 for classes of asset-backed securities other than residential mortgage-backed securitizations. 

Anti-Money Laundering . Southside Bank is subject to the regulations of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (&#8220;FinCEN&#8221;), a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, which implement the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the &#8220;USA PATRIOT Act&#8221;). The USA PATRIOT Act gives the federal government the power to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing, and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act includes measures intended to encourage information sharing among banks, regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies. Further, certain provisions of Title III impose affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions, including state-chartered banks like Southside Bank. 

The USA PATRIOT Act and the related FinCEN regulations impose certain requirements with respect to financial institutions, including the following: 

&#8226; 

establishment of anti-money laundering programs, including adoption of written procedures and an ongoing employee training program, designation of a compliance officer and auditing of the program; 

&#8226; 

establishment of a program specifying procedures for obtaining information from customers seeking to open new accounts, including verifying the identity of customers within a reasonable period of time; 

&#8226; 

establishment of enhanced due diligence policies, procedures and controls designed to detect and report money laundering, for financial institutions that administer, maintain or manage private bank accounts or correspondent accounts for non-U.S. persons; 

&#8226; 

prohibitions on correspondent accounts for foreign shell banks and compliance with recordkeeping obligations with respect to correspondent accounts of foreign banks; 

&#8226; 

filing of suspicious activities reports if a bank believes a customer may be violating U.S. laws and regulations; and 

&#8226; 

requirements that bank regulators consider bank holding company or bank compliance in connection with merger or acquisition transactions. 

Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and have been active in imposing cease and desist and other regulatory orders and money penalty sanctions against institutions found to be violating these obligations. In addition, FinCEN issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on August 4, 2014 that would require financial institutions to obtain beneficial ownership information for certain accounts, however, it has yet to issue a final rule on this topic. 

The Federal Bureau of Investigation can send bank regulatory agencies lists of the names of persons suspected of involvement in terrorist activities. Southside Bank can be requested to search its records for any relationships or transactions with persons on those lists and required to report any identified relationships or transactions. 

OFAC . The U.S. Department of the Treasury&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (&#8220;OFAC&#8221;) is responsible for helping to insure that U.S. entities do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties, as defined by various Executive Orders and Acts of Congress. OFAC publishes, and routinely updates, lists of names of persons and organizations suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, including the Specially Designated Nationals List. If we find a name on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, we must undertake certain specified activities, which could include blocking or freezing the account or transaction requested, and we must notify the appropriate authorities. 

Privacy and Data Security . Under federal law, financial institutions are generally prohibited from disclosing consumer information to non-affiliated third parties unless the consumer has been given the opportunity to object and has not objected to such disclosure. Financial institutions are further required to disclose their privacy policies to consumers annually. To the extent state laws are more protective of consumer privacy, financial institutions must comply with state law privacy provisions. 

In addition, federal and state banking agencies have prescribed standards for maintaining the security and confidentiality of consumer information. Southside Bank is subject to such standards, as well as standards for notifying consumers in the event of a security breach. Under existing federal law, Southside Bank must disclose its privacy policy for collecting and protecting confidential customer information to consumers, permit consumers to &#8220;opt out&#8221; of having nonpublic customer information disclosed to non-affiliated third parties, with some exceptions, and allow customers to opt out of receiving marketing solicitations based on information about the customer received from another subsidiary. On October 28, 2014, the Bureau amended the annual privacy notice requirement to permit a financial institution to provide the annual privacy notice through posting the annual notice on its website if the financial institution meets certain conditions. On December 4, 2015, the GLBA was amended to provide additional circumstances under which a financial institution is not required to provide an annual notice. States may adopt more extensive privacy protections. Southside Bank is similarly required to have an information security program to safeguard the confidentiality and security of customer information and to ensure proper disposal. Customers must be notified when unauthorized disclosure involves sensitive customer information that may be misused. 

Regulatory Examination . 

See Holding Company Regulation - Regulatory Examination. 

Enforcement Authority . Southside Bank and its &#8220;institution-affiliated parties,&#8221; including management, employees, agents, independent contractors and consultants, such as attorneys and accountants and others who participate in the conduct of the institution&#8217;s affairs, are subject to potential civil and criminal penalties for violations of law, regulations or written orders of a government agency. Violations can include failure to timely file required reports, filing false or misleading information or submitting inaccurate reports. Civil penalties may be as high as $1,000,000 a day for such violations, and criminal penalties for some financial institution crimes may include imprisonment for 20 years. Regulators have flexibility to commence enforcement actions against institutions and institution-affiliated parties, and the FDIC has the authority to terminate deposit insurance. When issued by a banking agency, cease and desist orders may, among other things, require affirmative action to correct any harm resulting from a violation or practice, including restitution, reimbursement, indemnifications or guarantees against loss. A financial institution may also be ordered to restrict its growth, dispose of certain assets, rescind agreements or contracts, or take other actions determined to be appropriate by the ordering agency. The federal banking agencies also may remove a director or officer from an insured depository institution (or bar them from the industry) if a violation is willful or reckless. 

Governmental Monetary Policies . The commercial banking business is affected not only by general economic conditions but also by the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve. Changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings, control of borrowings, open market operations, the imposition of and changes in reserve requirements against member banks, deposits and assets of foreign branches, the imposition of and changes in reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates and the placing of limits on interest rates which member banks may pay on time and savings deposits are some of the instruments of monetary policy available to the Federal Reserve. These monetary policies influence to a significant extent the overall growth of all bank loans, investments and deposits and the interest rates charged on loans or paid on time and savings deposits. In response to the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve established several innovative programs to stabilize certain financial institutions and to ensure the availability of credit, which the Federal Reserve has begun to modify as a result of improving economic conditions. The nature of future monetary policies and the effect of such policies on Southside Bank&#8217;s future business and earnings, therefore, cannot be predicted accurately. 

Evolving Legislation and Regulatory Action . Proposals for new statutes and regulations are frequently circulated at both the federal and state levels, and may include wide-ranging changes to the structures, regulations and competitive relationships of financial institutions. We cannot predict whether new legislation or regulations will be enacted and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any regulations, would have on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

Other Regulatory Matters . The Company and its affiliates are subject to oversight by the SEC, the NASDAQ Stock Market, various state securities regulators and other regulatory authorities. The Company and its subsidiaries have from time to time received requests for information from regulatory authorities in various states, including state attorneys general, securities regulators and other regulatory authorities, concerning their business practices. Such requests are considered incidental to the normal conduct of business.
