 Item 1. Business 

Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms &#8220;the Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; and &#8220;us&#8221; refer to Alamo Group Inc. and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

The Company is a leader in the design and manufacture of high quality agricultural equipment and infrastructure maintenance equipment for governmental and industrial use. The Company&#8217;s products include tractor-mounted mowing and other vegetation maintenance equipment, street sweepers, excavators, vacuum trucks, snow removal equipment, pothole patchers, zero turn radius mowers, agricultural implements and related aftermarket parts. The Company emphasizes high quality, cost-effective products for its customers and strives to develop and market innovative products while constantly monitoring and seeking to contain its manufacturing and overhead costs. The Company has a long-standing strategy of supplementing its internal growth through acquisitions of businesses or product lines that currently complement, command, or have the potential to achieve a meaningful share of their niche markets. The Company has approximately 3,030 &#32;employees and operates a total of twenty-five plants in North America, Europe, Australia and Brazil. The Company sells its products primarily through a network of independent dealers and distributors to governmental end-users, related independent contractors, as well as to the agricultural and commercial turf markets. The primary markets for our products are North America and Western Europe. 

&#160; 

&#32;&#32;The predecessor corporation to Alamo Group Inc. was incorporated in the State of Texas in 1969, as a successor to a business that began selling mowing equipment in 1955, and Alamo Group Inc. was reincorporated in the State of Delaware in 1987. 

History 

&#32;Since its founding in 1969, the Company has focused on satisfying customer needs through geographic market expansion, product development and refinement, and selected acquisitions. The Company&#8217;s first products were based on rotary cutting technology. Through acquisitions, the Company added flail cutting technology in 1983 and sickle-bar cutting technology in 1984. The Company added to its presence in the industrial and governmental vegetation markets with the acquisition of Tiger Corporation (&#8220;Tiger&#8221;) &#32;in late 1994. 

&#32;The Company entered the agricultural mowing markets in 1986 with the acquisition of Rhino Products Inc. (&#8220;Rhino&#8221;) , a leading manufacturer in this field. With this acquisition, the Company embarked on a strategy to increase the Rhino &#32;dealer distribution network during a period of industry contraction. The addition of M&#38;W Gear Company (&#8220;M&#38;W&#8221;) &#32;in early 1995 allowed the Company to enter into the manufacturing and distribution of tillage equipment, which complements the Rhino &#32;distribution network. M&#38;W &#32;has been integrated into the agricultural marketing group. 

&#32;In 1991, the Company began its international expansion with the acquisition of McConnel Ltd . (&#8220;McConnel&#8221;) , a United Kingdom (&#8220;U.K.&#8221;) manufacturer of vegetation maintenance equipment, principally hydraulic boom-mounted hedge and grass cutters and related parts. Bomford-Turner Ltd . (&#8220;Bomford&#8221;) , also a U.K. company, was acquired in 1993. Bomford &#32;is a manufacturer of heavy-duty, tractor-mounted grass and hedge mowing equipment. McConnel &#32;and Bomford &#32;sell their products to dealers and distributors through their respective sales forces. 

&#32;In 1994, the Company acquired Signalisation Moderne Autoroutiere S.A . (&#8220;SMA&#8221;) &#32;located in Orleans, France. SMA &#32;manufactures and sells principally a line of heavy-duty, tractor-mounted grass and hedge mowing equipment and associated replacement parts primarily to departments of the French government. This acquisition, along with the acquisitions of Forges Gorce, a flail blade manufacturer in France, in 1996 and Rousseau Holdings S.A. (&#8220; Rousseau &#8221;), a leading French manufacturer of hedge and verge mowers, in 2004, when combined with McConnel &#32;and Bomford, &#32;has made the Company one of the largest manufacturers in the European market for the kind of equipment sold by the Company. 

In 1995, the Company expanded its business in the agricultural market with the acquisition of Herschel Corporation (&#8220;Herschel&#8221;) , a manufacturer and distributor of aftermarket farm equipment replacement and wear parts. 

In 2000, the Company acquired Schwarze Industries, Inc . (&#8220;Schwarze&#8221;) . Schwarze &#32;is a manufacturer of a broad range of street sweeping equipment which is sold to governmental agencies and contractors. The Company believes the Schwarze &#32;sweeper products fit the Company&#8217;s strategy of identifying product offerings with brand recognition in the industrial markets the Company serves. In 2004, the Company purchased the pothole patcher product line from Wildcat Manufacturing, Inc. The product line was merged into the Schwarze &#32;operation and is complementary to its current product offerings. 

In 2000, the Company purchased the product line and associated assets of Twose of Tiverton Ltd. (&#8220;Twose&#8221;) &#32;in the U.K. and incorporated its production into the existing facilities at McConnel &#32;and Bomford &#32;while maintaining its own sales force and dealer distribution network. Twose &#32;was a small regional manufacturer of power arm flail mowers and parts, as well as harrows and rollers, which strengthened the Company&#8217;s market leadership position in the U.K. 

In 2000, the Company acquired Schulte Industries Ltd. and its related entities (&#8220;Schulte&#8221;) . Schulte &#32;is a Canadian manufacturer of mechanical rotary mowers, snow blowers, and rock removal equipment. Schulte &#32;strengthened the Company&#8217;s Canadian presence in both marketing and manufacturing. It also expanded the Company&#8217;s range of large, heavy-duty rotary mowers. 

In 2001, the Company acquired all of the assets of SMC Corporation (&#8220;SMC&#8221;). SMC &#32;manufactures front-end loaders and backhoes principally for Original Equipment Manufacturer (&#8220;OEM&#8221;) customers and its own SMC &#32;brand. This acquisition expanded the product range of our agricultural division and has since been consolidated into the Company's Gibson City, Illinois location. 

In 2002, the Company purchased inventory, fixed assets and certain other assets of Valu-Bilt Tractor Parts (&#8220;Valu-Bilt&#8221;) , a subsidiary of Quality Stores, Inc., located in Des Moines, Iowa. Valu-Bilt &#32;is a distributor of new, used and rebuilt tractor parts and other agricultural spare and wear parts sold directly to customers through its catalog and the internet and on a wholesale basis to dealers. Subsequent to the purchase, the operations of Valu-Bilt &#32;in Des Moines, Iowa, were consolidated into the Company&#8217;s Herschel &#32;facility in Indianola, Iowa. 

In 2002, the Company purchased substantially all of the assets of Faucheux Industries S.A. (&#8220;Faucheux&#8221;) , a French manufacturer of front-end loaders and attachments. The Company acquired Faucheux &#32;out of administration, a form of bankruptcy in France. This acquisition broadened the range of our agricultural implements offered in the French market and is currently being restructured and consolidated into the Company's Neuville, France location. 

In 2005, the Company, through its European subsidiary Alamo Group (EUR) Ltd., acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding stock of Spearhead Machinery Limited (&#8220;Spearhead&#8221;) &#32;and subsequently merged its manufacturing operations into Bomford &#8217; s &#32;facility. Spearhead &#32;manufactures a range of tractor-mounted vegetation maintenance equipment, including reach mowers, flail mowers and rotary cutters. This acquisition extended our product lines and market coverage in Europe. 

In early 2006, the Company purchased substantially all of the assets of the Gradall excavator business (&#8220;Gradall&#8221;) &#32;of JLG Industries, Inc., including their manufacturing plant in New Philadelphia, Ohio. Gradall &#32;is a leading manufacturer of both wheeled and crawler telescopic excavators in North America. This acquisition enhanced our Industrial Division product offering sold to governmental buyers and related contractors for maintenance along right-of-ways. 

In 2006, the Company purchased the vacuum truck and sweeper lines of Clean Earth Environmental Group, LLC and Clean Earth Kentucky, LLC (collectively referred to as &#8220;VacAll&#8221; ) . &#32;This included the product lines, inventory and certain other assets that relate to this business. The production of the vacuum truck and sweeper lines were moved to the Gradall &#32;facility in New Philadelphia, Ohio. 

In 2006, the Company acquired 100% of the ownership interests in Nite-Hawk Sweepers LLC (&#8220;Nite-Hawk&#8221;) , a manufacturer of truck mounted sweeping equipment primarily for the contract sweeping market, which expanded its presence in that market and complements our Schwarze &#32;sweeper line.

This acquisition, combined with the Company&#8217;s existing range of agricultural mowers, created one of the largest manufacturers of agricultural mowers in the world. 

In 2011, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain specified liabilities of Tenco Group, Inc. ( "Tenco" ) and its subsidiaries. Tenco &#32;is a Canadian-based manufacturer of snow removal equipment including snow blades, blowers, dump bodies, spreaders and associated parts and service.

Fairfield ") as well as several related entities ( "Specialized" ), including all brand names and related product names and trademarks. The primary reason for the Specialized &#32;acquisition was to broaden the Company's existing equipment lines. This acquisition increased our product offering and enhanced our market position both in vacuum trucks and snow removal equipment primarily in North America. 

On March 10, 2015, the Company acquired Herder Implementos e Maquinas Agricolas Ltda. ( "Herder" ). Herder is a manufacturer of flail mowers and other agricultural implements which are sold direct and through dealers to the sugar cane, orchard and other agricultural markets as well as the roadside maintenance market.

&#160; 

Replacement Parts 

The Company derives a significant portion of its revenues from sales of replacement parts for each of its wholegoods lines. Replacement parts represented approximately 18% , 20% &#32;and 21% &#32;of the Company&#8217;s total sales for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. The majority of the decline in percentage sales of spare parts relates to the 2014 acquisition of the units of Specialized &#32;which has a lower mix of parts as a percentage of sales. Proprietary replacement parts generally are more profitable and less cyclical than wholegoods. 

&#160; 

Product Development 

The Company&#8217;s ability to provide innovative responses to customer needs, to develop and manufacture new products, and to enhance existing product lines is important to its success. The Company continually conducts research and development activities in an effort to improve existing products and develop new products. As of December 31, 2015 , the Company employed 163 &#32;people in its various engineering departments, 96 &#32;of whom are degreed engineers and the balance of whom are support staff. Amounts expended on research and development activities were approximately $ 8,590,000 &#32;in 2015 , $ 8,427,000 &#32;in 2014 &#32;and $ 7,164,000 &#32;in 2013 . As a percentage of sales, research and development was approximately 1.0% &#32;in 2015 , 1.0% &#32;in 2014 &#32;and 1.1% &#32;in 2013 , and is expected to continue at similar levels in 2016 . 

Seasonality 

&#32;The Company&#8217;s sales, for both product and replacement parts, are generally higher in the second and third quarters of the year, because a substantial number of the Company&#8217;s products are used for maintenance activities such as vegetation maintenance, highway right-of-way maintenance, construction, and street and parking lot sweeping. Usage of this equipment is typically lower in harsh weather. The Company utilizes an annual twelve-month sales forecast provided by the Company&#8217;s marketing departments which is updated quarterly in order to develop a production plan for its manufacturing facilities. In addition, many of the Company&#8217;s marketing departments attempt to equalize demand for products throughout the calendar year by offering seasonal sales programs which may provide additional incentives, including discounts and extended payment terms. 

Competition 

The Company&#8217;s products are sold in highly competitive markets throughout the world. The principal competitive factors are price, quality, availability, service and reputation. The Company competes with several large national and international companies that offer a broad range of equipment and replacement parts, as well as with numerous small, privately-held manufacturers and suppliers of a limited number of products, mainly on a regional basis. Some of the Company&#8217;s competitors are significantly larger than the Company and have substantially greater financial and other resources at their disposal. The Company believes that it is able to compete successfully in its markets by effectively managing its manufacturing costs, offering high quality products, developing and designing innovative products and, to some extent, avoiding direct competition with significantly larger potential competitors. There can be no assurance that the Company&#8217;s competitors will not substantially increase the resources devoted to the development and marketing of products competitive with the Company&#8217;s products or that new competitors with greater resources will not enter the Company&#8217;s markets. 

Unfilled Orders 

As of December 31, 2015 , the Company had unfilled customer orders of $ 162,959,000 &#32;compared to $ 160,910,000 &#32;at December 31, 2014 . Management expects that substantially all of the Company&#8217;s backlog as of December 31, 2015 &#32;will be shipped during fiscal year 2016 . The amount of unfilled orders at a particular time is affected by a number of factors, including manufacturing and shipping schedules which, in most instances, are dependent on the Company&#8217;s seasonal sales programs and the requirements of its customers. Certain of the Company&#8217;s orders are subject to cancellation at any time before shipment; therefore, a comparison of unfilled orders from period to period is not necessarily meaningful and may not be indicative of future actual shipments. No single customer is responsible for 10% or more of the aggregate revenue of the Company. 

Sources of Supply 

The principal raw materials used by the Company include steel, other metal components, hydraulic hoses, paint and tires. During 2015 , the raw materials needed by the Company were available from a variety of sources in adequate quantities and at prevailing market prices. No one supplier is responsible for supplying more than 10% of the principal raw materials used by the Company. 

&#160; 

While the Company manufactures many of the parts for its products, a significant percentage of parts, including most drivelines, gearboxes, industrial engines, and hydraulic components, are purchased from outside suppliers which manufacture to the Company&#8217;s specifications. In addition, the Company, through its subsidiaries, purchases tractors and truck chassis as a number of the Company&#8217;s products are mounted and shipped with a tractor or truck chassis. Tractors and truck chassis are generally available, but some delays in receiving tractors or truck chassis can occur throughout the year. The Company sources its purchased goods from international and domestic suppliers. No single supplier is responsible for supplying more than 10% of the purchased goods used by the Company. 

&#160; 

Patents and Trademarks 

&#160; 

&#32;The Company owns various U.S. and international patents. While the Company considers its patents to be advantageous to its business, it is not dependent on any single patent or group of patents. The net book value of patents and trademarks was $27,590,000 &#32;and $28,916,000 &#32;as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively.

Environmental and Other Governmental Regulations 

&#32;Like other manufacturers, the Company is subject to a broad range of federal, state, local and foreign laws and requirements, including those concerning air emissions, discharges into waterways, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste materials, as well as the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances at the Company&#8217;s facilities and off-site disposal locations, workplace safety and equal employment opportunities. These laws and regulations are constantly changing, and it is impossible to predict with accuracy the effect that changes to such laws and regulations may have on the Company in the future. Like other industrial concerns, the Company&#8217;s manufacturing operations entail the risk of noncompliance, and there can be no assurance that the Company will not incur material costs or other liabilities as a result thereof. 

&#160; 

&#32;The Company knows that its Indianola, Iowa property is contaminated with chromium which most likely resulted from chrome plating operations which were discontinued before the Company purchased the property. Chlorinated volatile organic compounds have also been detected in water samples on the property, though the source is unknown at this time. The Company voluntarily worked with an environmental consultant and the state of Iowa with respect to these issues and believes it completed its remediation program in June 2006. The work was accomplished within the Company&#8217;s environmental liability reserve balance. We requested a &#8220;no further action&#8221; classification from the state. We received a conditional &#8220;no further action&#8221; letter in January of 2009. When we demonstrate stable or improving conditions below residential standards for a certain period of time by monitoring existing wells, we will request an unconditional &#8220;no further action&#8221; letter. 

&#160; 

The Company knows that Bush Hog&#8217;s &#32;main manufacturing property in Selma, Alabama was contaminated with chlorinated volatile organic compounds which most likely resulted from painting and cleaning operations during the 1960s and 1970s. The contaminated areas were primarily in the location of underground storage tanks and underneath the former waste storage area. Under the Asset Purchase Agreement, Bush Hog&#8217;s &#32;prior owner agreed to and has removed the underground storage tanks at its cost and has remediated the identified contamination in accordance with the regulations of the Alabama Department of Environmental Management. An environmental consulting firm was retained by the prior owner to administer the cleanup and monitor the site on an ongoing basis until the remediation program is complete and approved by the applicable authorities. The remediation process has been completed. On August 6, 2015, Bush Hog &#32;received a letter of concurrence from the Alabama Department of Environmental Management concluding that Bush Hog &#32;had successfully remediated that property and that the site was eligible for liability protection under the Land Recycling and Economic Redevelopment Act for contamination discovered and addressed under Bush Hog's &#32;voluntary cleanup plan. 

&#32;Certain assets of the Company contain asbestos that may have to be remediated over time. The Company believes that any subsequent change in the liability associated with the asbestos removal will not have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial position or results of operations. 

The Company is subject to various other federal, state, and local laws affecting its business, as well as a variety of regulations relating to such matters as working conditions, equal employment opportunities, and product safety. A variety of state laws regulate the Company&#8217;s contractual relationships with its dealers, some of which impose restrictive standards on the relationship between the Company and its dealers, including events of default, grounds for termination, non-renewal of dealer contracts, and equipment repurchase requirements. The Company believes it is currently in material compliance with all such applicable laws and regulations. 

Employees 

&#32;As of December 31, 2015 , the Company employed approximately 3,030 &#32;employees. In North America, the Company has collective bargaining agreements at the Gradall &#32;facility which cover 184 employees and will expire on March 12, 2017, and at the Tenco &#32;facility in Canada covering 82 employees which expired on December 31, 2015 &#32; and is operating under the expired contract terms for the next twelve months. The Company&#8217;s European operations, McConnel, &#32; Bomford , &#32;Spearhead, Twose, AMS-UK, Kellands, SMA , Forges Gorce, &#32; Faucheux, Rousseau &#32;and Rivard, &#32;also have various collective bargaining agreements covering 910 employees. The Company considers its employee relations to be satisfactory.
