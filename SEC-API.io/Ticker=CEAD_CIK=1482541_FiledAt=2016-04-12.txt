 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

Surna develops, designs, and distributes cultivation technologies for controlled environment agriculture (&#8220;CEA&#8221;). The Company&#8217;s customers include state-regulated cannabis cultivation facilities as well as traditional indoor agricultural facilities, including organic herb and vegetable producers. 

&#160; 

Surna&#8217;s technologies include a comprehensive line of optimized lighting, environmental control, air sanitation, and cultivation facilities. These technologies are designed to meet the specific environmental conditions required for indoor cultivation and dramatically reduce energy and water consumption. 

&#160; 

In addition, Surna offers mechanical design services specific to hydronic cooling including mechanical equipment and piping design. 

&#160; 

Products and Services 

&#160; 

Surna Chillers 

&#160; 

Surna&#8217;s liquid-based process cooling system provides a more reliable and efficient thermal cooling solution compared to typical air conditioning products: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Liquid-based cooling systems are more efficient. Surna&#8217;s hydronic cooling systems and proprietary technologies rely on liquid, instead of air, as a medium for heat exchange. Surna&#8217;s systems can dramatically reduce the costs associated with cooling indoor cultivation facilities compared to traditional air conditioning products, depending on the specific environment and system design. 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Redundancy is essential. Due to the high value of indoor crops like cannabis, Surna&#8217;s systems are designed to mitigate crop loss due to equipment failure. Surna&#8217;s chillers are easily scalable and allow for redundant system design for a nominal increase in cost relative to ducted systems. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Closed-loop cooling systems reduce opportunities for contamination. Surna&#8217;s system provides for room isolation during the heat exchange process, thereby reducing the risk of cross-contamination between rooms. Surna&#8217;s system uses chilled water delivered through a closed loop and does not require ducting. Traditional air conditioning systems use ducted air for heat removal, which disseminate contaminants between rooms. This greatly increases the risk of spreading the contamination throughout the entire grow space. 

&#160; 

Surna Reflectors 

&#160; 

Surna&#8217;s reflector optimizes light delivery to the plant canopy. Thanks to the reflector&#8217;s internal technology, the bulb is able to produce up to 9.1% more usable light without any increase in energy consumption. Light-on-target reflectivity is also increased due to the unique design and shape of the reflector, eliminating light wasted illuminating walls and aisles. 

&#160; 

Hybrid Building 

&#160; 

Surna&#8217;s comprehensive cultivation facility combines the advantages of a greenhouse with those of an indoor grow operation for indoor cultivators seeking efficiency and accelerated time to market. The Hybrid Building uses the sun as its primary light source and high power LED lights for supplemental lighting while maintaining the environmental and security controls of an indoor facility. 

&#160; 

Air Sanitation 

&#160; 

Surna offers air sanitation technology for mold and mildew risk mitigation to cultivators. This technology uses a process of photocatalytic oxidation to destroy harmful airborne microbes without the production of byproducts. 

&#160; 

Services 

&#160; 

Surna offers full mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (&#8220;MEP&#8221;) services including designing and engineering commercial scale thermodynamic systems specific to indoor grow facility conditions. Surna also offers workflow design to decrease the risk of facility and crop contamination. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Product Development 

&#160; 

Surna engages in new product development and improvement both through its internal product development staff and in partnership with other commercial entities. In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, the Company spent $707,517 towards the development of new products such as the lighting reflector, the hybrid building, and integrated software systems, and, in 2014, the Company spent $319,430 on product development. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

Surna relies on a combination of patent and trademark rights, trade secrets, laws that protect intellectual property, confidentiality procedures, and contractual restrictions with its employees and others to establish and protect its intellectual property rights. As of March 31, 2016, the Company has eight pending patent applications and four issued patents. The pending patent applications are a combination of PCT, provisional, utility and design patent applications that are directed to certain core Company technology. The Company&#8217;s four issued patents are U.S. design patents related to the Company&#8217;s Reflector. The U.S. design patents provide protection for 14 years from the date of issue. Utility patents provide protection for 20 years from the earliest non-provisional application filing date. The Company also is actively pursuing trademark registration around its core brand (&#8220;Surna&#8221;) in the United States and select foreign jurisdictions, as well as the Surna logo and the combined Surna logo and name in the United States. These are contained in three applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (&#8220;USPTO&#8221;). Subject to ongoing use and renewal, trademark protection is potentially perpetual. 

&#160; 

Operating segments 

&#160; 

Surna currently operates in one primary business segment, which encompasses designing, manufacturing, and distributing indoor climate control systems, including but not limited to chillers, lights, reflectors, and irrigation systems, for use in conjunction with the state-regulated cannabis and CEA industry. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Surna&#8217;s chilled water system products and services compete with various national and local HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) providers who traditionally resell, design, and implement climate control systems for comfort cooling of schools, offices, or other large buildings. Surna differs from these competitors by providing hydronic cooling systems tailored specifically for managing the distinct challenges of managing the significant heat and humidity loads associated with cultivation of indoor crops. 

&#160; 

Surna&#8217;s dehumidification products face competition from other dehumidification manufacturers. Surna provides its customers and clients with dehumidification options that it believes are more cost effective and more efficient at removing humidity than its competitors in the indoor cultivation space. 

&#160; 

Few manufacturers have expertise in the cannabis market and understand the needs of growers. Surna, however, is equipped to customize products for the cannabis market and advise growers on appropriate products to maximize crop yield. The Company expects increased competition in both the climate control and services divisions in the cannabis sector as an increasing number of states legalize the cultivation, distribution, and consumption of the crop. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of March 31, 2016, Surna has 32 full-time employees and one part-time employee. The Company may, however, utilize the services of a number of consultants, independent contractors, and professionals. Proceeding in this manner allows the Company to operate efficiently and pragmatically. Additional employees will be hired in the future depending on need and the Company&#8217;s expansion. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

Surna&#8217;s chillers are subject to state and municipal regulations regarding energy-efficiency standards often incorporated into building codes. Many states and municipalities have adopted some version of Standard 90.1 as published by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (&#8220;ASHRAE&#8221;); however, some states and municipalities have or may in the future adopt alternative standards that may be more or less restrictive than Standard 90.1. Similarly, Standard 90.1 is itself regularly updated&#8212;most recently in 2013. Each update of the standard generally reflects the availability of increasingly efficient technologies, resulting in stricter energy-efficiency requirements. The Company anticipates that its products will comply with these standards. With every product line, Surna offers a product that meets or exceeds the Standard 90.1. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Otherwise, the Company is subject substantially to the same government regulations that affect businesses generally. See, however, Item 1A - Risk Factors &#8211; &#8220;Federal regulation and enforcement may adversely affect the implementation of marijuana laws and regulations may negatively impact our revenue and profit,&#8221; &#8220;We could be found to be violating laws related to marijuana,&#8221; and &#8220;Variations in state and local regulation and enforcement in states that have legalized cannabis that may restrict marijuana-related activities, including activities related to cannabis, may negatively impact our revenue and profit.&#8221; 

&#160;
