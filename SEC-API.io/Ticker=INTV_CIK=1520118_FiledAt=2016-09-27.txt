General Overview 

&#160;

We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 22, 2013 under the name Lightcollar, Inc. On March 22, 2015, we changed our name to EMS Find, Inc. (&#8220;EMS Find&#8221;). Effective March 31, 2015, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with the sole shareholder of EMS Factory, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation (&#8220;EMS Factory&#8221;), and following the closing under the Share Exchange Agreement, EMS Factory became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, with the former stockholder of EMS Factory owning approximately 35% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the combined company. Our offices are located at 73 Buck Road, Suite 2, Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania 19006.

&#160;

The Company has developed and plans to market B2B &#38; B2C on-demand mobile platform, designed to connect health care providers and consumers to a network of medical transport companies throughout the United States and Canada and, on the internet and through mobile applications, and to provide specialized online marketing solutions for these businesses that boost customer awareness and merchant visibility on the internet and through mobile applications. Our application is currently in beta testing phase. Our mobile and internet platform will facilitate and speed up connections of health care providers and the public with medical transportation providers for the benefit of the patients. The platform enables users (hospitals, medical offices, dialysis centers, nursing homes, home care agencies and other medical providers) and the public to schedule medical transportation in a timely and efficient way based on the type of medical transportation that best fits each patient's needs. The EMS Find app will work on any smart device including smart phones, tablets or laptops. The app is available in iOS, Android and desktop versions and allows users to connect in real time to local and nearby pre-screened medical transportation companies wherever the medical transport is needed and that fit the medical, logistical and financial criteria for the user. 

&#160;

Corporate Developments 

&#160;

On March 31, 2015, the Company signed the Share Exchange Agreement (&#8220;Agreement&#8221;) with EMS Factory, a company incorporated under the laws of the State of Pennsylvania, and the sole shareholder of EMS Factory, Steve Rubakh (&#8220;Rubakh&#8221;), pursuant to which the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding securities of EMS Factory in exchange for the issuance of 10,000,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s restricted common stock and 500,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s Series A preferred stock. The Company also agreed to fund $300,000 to support the continued development and commercialization of EMS Factory&#8217;s technologies. 

&#160;

As a result of the closing under the Agreement, EMS Factory became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and the Company thereby acquired the business and operations of EMS Factory. Further, on the closing date under the Agreement, Rubakh was appointed the president, chief executive officer, chief financial officer, treasurer, secretary, and a director of the Company. 

&#160;

As of June 30, 2016, the Company has completed development of the EMS Find App in the following platforms: iOS, Android, and on the Web. The phase one of the beta testing has been completed by a major ambulance transportation company. The second phase is being planned to be launched in collaboration with a major healthcare plan and healthcare facility, to be completed by December 31, 2016. In addition, we signed a non-disclosure agreement with a major on-demand transportation company with the goal of integration both platforms to provide a patent pending, all-in-one, scheduling solution. The application is available in Apple (iPhone and iPad versions) and Google Play Store.

Market Information 

&#160;

Ambulances help rescue injured or medically ill patients by transporting them to medical treatment centers with adequate medical services such as monitoring of health condition and administration of drugs. This service is provided with the help of healthcare professionals and medical equipment installed in the ambulance. The global ambulance services market based on the mode of transport has been segmented as: ground ambulance services, air ambulance services and water ambulance services. On the basis of emergency type, the global market has been segmented as: emergency ambulance services and non-emergency ambulance services.

&#160;

Ambulance services, emergency and non-emergency, are provided to patients based on the medical condition and emergency of transportation. Ambulances are equipped with various types of medical equipment to cater to the need of patients by providing first-line treatment. Based on the type of equipment installed in ambulances, the ambulance services market is segmented into advanced life support (&#8220;ALS&#8221;) ambulance services and basic life support (&#8220;BLS&#8221;) ambulance services. 

&#160;

A BLS ambulance provides patients with basic medical equipment and services. A BLS ambulance is equipped with medical devices such as automatic external defibrillator oxygen delivery devices, pulse oximetry and blood pressure monitoring equipment. Medical services are provided by emergency medical practitioners and partially-trained personnel in a BLS ambulance. BLS ambulance services are usually provided to patients with complex fractures, medical or surgical patients, discharge for home or some sub-acute care facilities and psychiatrist patients. 

&#160;

Patients seeking immediate medical help are provided with emergency ambulance services as their critical medical condition demands medical treatment at an initial stage (before reaching the hospital). Emergency ambulances are incorporated with emergency siren and lights that enable the vehicle to avoid traffic and reach quickly at the hospital. Emergency ambulances are generally equipped with advanced life support systems and are provided with medical professionals who are able to provide first-line treatment including drug administration and monitoring.
