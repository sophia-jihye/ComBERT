 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. ("IBG, Inc." or the "Company") is an automated global electronic broker and market maker. We custody and service accounts for hedge and mutual funds, registered investment advisors, proprietary trading groups, introducing brokers and individual investors. We specialize in routing orders while striving to achieve best executions and processing trades in securities, futures, foreign exchange instruments, bonds and mutual funds on more than 100 electronic exchanges and market centers around the world. In the United States ("U.S."), we conduct our business primarily from our headquarters in Greenwich, Connecticut and from Chicago, Illinois. Abroad, we conduct our business through offices located in Canada, England, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, India, China (Hong Kong and Shanghai), Japan and Australia. As of December 31, 2015 we had 1,087 employees worldwide. 

IBG, Inc. is a holding company and our primary assets are our ownership of approximately 15.7% of the membership interests of IBG LLC (the "Group"), the current holding company for our businesses. We are the sole managing member of IBG LLC. On May 3, 2007, IBG, Inc. priced its initial public offering (the "IPO") of shares of common stock. In connection with the IPO, IBG, Inc. purchased 10.0% of the membership interests in IBG LLC and began to consolidate IBG LLC's financial results into its financial statements. 

When we use the terms "we," "us," and "our," we mean IBG LLC and its subsidiaries for periods prior to the IPO, and IBG, Inc. and its subsidiaries (including IBG LLC) for periods from and after the IPO. Unless otherwise indicated, the term "common stock" refers to the Class A common stock of IBG, Inc. 

We are a successor to the market making business founded by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Thomas Peterffy, on the floor of the American Stock Exchange in 1977. Since our inception, we have focused on developing proprietary software to automate broker-dealer functions. During that time, we have been a pioneer in developing and applying technology as a financial intermediary to increase liquidity and transparency in the capital markets in which we operate. The proliferation of electronic exchanges in the last 25 years has provided us with the opportunity to integrate our software with an increasing number of exchanges and market centers into one automatically functioning, computerized platform that requires minimal human intervention. Over three decades of developing our automated trading platforms and our automation of many middle and back office functions have allowed us to become one of the lowest cost providers of broker-dealer services and significantly increase the volume of trades we handle. 

Our activities are divided into two principal business segments: (1) electronic brokerage and (2) market making: 

&#149; As a direct market access broker, we serve the customers of both traditional brokers and prime brokers. We provide our customers with an advanced order management, trade execution and portfolio management platform at a very low cost. Our customers can simultaneously access many financial markets worldwide and trade across multiple asset classes (stocks, options, futures, foreign exchange ("forex"), bonds and mutual funds) denominated in 23 different currencies, on one screen, from a single account based in any major currency. Our large financial advisor and broker-dealer customers may "white brand" our trading interface (i.e., make our trading interface available to their customers without referencing our name), or they can select from among our modular functionalities, such as order routing, trade reporting or clearing on specific products or exchanges where they may not have up-to-date technology to offer their customers a comprehensive, global range of services and products. The emerging 2 

complexity of multiple market centers provided us with the opportunity of building and continuously adapting our order routing software to secure excellent execution prices for our customers. This has become our major focus. 

&#149; As a market maker, we provide continuous bid and offer quotations on over one million securities and futures products listed on electronic exchanges around the world. Our quotes are driven by proprietary mathematical models that assimilate market data and reevaluate our outstanding quotes each second. Unlike firms that trade over-the-counter ("OTC") derivative products, our business creates liquidity and transparency on electronic exchanges. In the past several years our market making business has suffered from competitive pressures and along with the rapid increase of our electronic brokerage business, its significance has diminished. Our electronic brokerage and market making businesses are complementary. Both benefit from our combined scale and volume, as well as from our proprietary technology. Our brokerage customers benefit from the technology and market structure expertise developed in our market making business. The expense of developing and maintaining our unique technology, clearing, settlement, banking and regulatory structure required by any specific exchange or market center is shared by both of our businesses. These economies, in turn, enable us to provide lower transaction costs to our customers than our competitors. In addition, we believe we gain a competitive advantage by applying the software features we have developed for a specific product or market to newly-introduced products and markets over others who may have less automated facilities in one or both of our businesses or who operate only in a subset of the exchanges and market centers on which we operate. Our trading system contains unique architectural aspects that, together with our massive trading volume in markets worldwide, may impose a significant barrier to entry for firms wishing to compete in our specific businesses and permit us to compete favorably against our competitors. In addition, many of our regulatory and compliance functions have been built into our integrated market making, order routing and custodial systems.

Our Organizational Structure and Overview of Recapitalization Transactions 

The graphic below illustrates our current ownership structure and reflects current ownership percentages. The graphic below does not display the subsidiaries of IBG LLC. 

Prior to the IPO, we had historically conducted our business through a limited liability company structure. Our primary assets are our ownership of approximately 15.7% of the membership interests of IBG LLC, the current holding company for our businesses, and our controlling interest and related contractual rights as the sole managing member of IBG LLC. The remaining approximately 84.3% of IBG LLC membership interests are held by IBG Holdings LLC ("Holdings"), a holding company that is owned by our founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Thomas Peterffy and his affiliates, management and other employees of IBG LLC, and certain other members. The IBG LLC membership interests held by Holdings will be subject to purchase by us over time in connection with 

offerings by us of shares of our common stock. The below table shows the amount of IBG LLC membership interests held by IBG, Inc. and Holdings as of December 31, 2015. 

&#160; &#160; Public &#160; Holdings &#160; Total &#160; Ownership % &#160; &#160; 15.7 % &#160; 84.3 % &#160; 100.0 % Membership interests &#160; &#160; 63,991,705 &#160; &#160; 343,040,504 &#160; &#160; 407,032,209 &#160; 

Purchases of IBG LLC membership interests, held by Holdings, by the Company are governed by the exchange agreement among us, IBG LLC, Holdings and the historical members of IBG LLC, (the "Exchange Agreement"), a copy of which was filed as an exhibit to our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2009 and filed with the SEC on November 9, 2009. The Exchange Agreement, as amended June 6, 2012, provides that the Company may facilitate the redemption by Holdings of interests held by its members through the issuance of shares of common stock through a public offering in exchange for the interests in IBG LLC being redeemed by Holdings. The June 6, 2012 amendment (the "Amendment"), which was filed as an exhibit to our Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 6, 2012, eliminated from the Exchange Agreement an alternative funding method, which provided that upon approval by the board of directors and by agreement of the Company, IBG LLC and Holdings, redemptions could be made in cash. 

At the time of the Company's IPO in 2007, three hundred sixty (360) million shares of authorized common stock were reserved for future sales and redemptions. From 2008 through 2010, Holdings redeemed 5,013,259 IBG LLC shares for a total of $114 million, which redemptions were funded using cash on hand at IBG LLC. Upon cash redemption these IBG LLC shares were retired. 

In June 2011, with the consent of Holdings and the Company (on its own behalf and acting as the sole managing member of IBG LLC), IBG LLC agreed to redeem certain membership interests from Holdings through the sale of common stock and to distribute the proceeds of such sale to the beneficial owners of such membership interests. On August 4, 2011, the Company filed a "shelf" Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File Number 333-176053) with the SEC for the issuance of additional shares in connection with Holdings requesting redemption of a portion of its member interests in IBG LLC. Under this shelf registration statement, in 2011, the Company issued 1,983,624 shares of common stock (with a fair value of $29 million) to Holdings in exchange for an equivalent number of shares of member interests in IBG LLC. 

On November 12, 2013, the Company filed a "shelf" Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File Number 333-192275) with the SEC for the issuance of additional shares in connection with Holdings requesting redemption of a portion of its member interests in IBG LLC. Under this shelf registration statement, from 2013 through 2015, the Company issued 9,063,671 shares of common stock (with a fair value of $277 million) to Holdings in exchange for an equivalent number of shares of member interests in IBG LLC.

Electronic Brokerage&#151;Interactive Brokers 

Electronic brokerage represented 79% of net revenues and 80% of income before income taxes from electronic brokerage and market making combined during 2015. We conduct our electronic brokerage business through our Interactive Brokers ("IB") subsidiaries. As an electronic broker, we execute, clear and settle trades globally for both institutional and individual customers. Capitalizing on the technology originally developed for our market making business, IB's systems provide our customers with the capability to monitor multiple markets around the world simultaneously and to execute trades electronically in these markets at a low cost in multiple products and currencies from a single trading account. 

Since launching this business in 1993, we have grown to approximately 331 thousand institutional and individual brokerage customers. We provide our customers with what we believe to be one of the most effective and efficient electronic brokerage platforms in the industry. The following are key highlights of our electronic brokerage business: 

&#149; Low Costs&#151; We provide our customers with among the industry's lowest overall transaction costs in two ways. First, we offer among the lowest execution, commission and financing costs in the industry. Second, our customers benefit from our advanced routing of orders designed to achieve the best available trade price. In order to illustrate this advantage, we publish monthly brokerage metrics including our customers' average net trade cost for Reg.-NMS stocks. In 2015, customers' total all-in cost of executing and clearing U.S. Reg.-NMS stocks through IB, including brokerage commissions, regulatory and exchange fees and market impact, was 0.8 basis points of trade money, as measured against a daily volume-weighted average price ("VWAP") benchmark. &#149; Automated Risk Controls&#151; Throughout the trading day, we calculate margin requirements for each of our customers on a real-time basis across all product classes (stocks, options, futures, bonds, forex, and mutual funds) and across all currencies. Our customers are alerted to approaching margin violations and if a customer's equity falls below what is required to support that customer's margin, we attempt to automatically liquidate positions on a real-time basis to bring the customer's account into margin compliance. This is done to protect IB, as well as the customer, from excessive losses. &#149; IB Universal Account SM &#151; From a single point of entry in one IB Universal Account SM our customers are able to trade products denominated in 23 currencies, across multiple classes of tradable, exchange-listed products, including stocks, options, futures, bonds, forex and mutual funds traded on more than 100 exchanges and market centers and in 24 countries around the world seamlessly. &#149; IB SmartRouting SM &#151; Our customers benefit from our advanced order routing technology. IB SmartRouting SM retains control of the customer's order, continuously searches for the best available price and, unlike most other routers, dynamically routes and re-routes all or parts of a customer's order to achieve optimal execution and among the lowest execution and commission costs in the industry. To highlight the quality of our price executions, we publish on our website independent measurements performed by a third party provider of transaction analysis to illustrate IB's net price improvement versus the industry. We also offer Transaction Cost Analysis reporting to allow customers to track execution performance by criteria including trade date, trade price, underlying and exchange. &#149; Flexible and Customizable System&#151; Our platform is designed to provide an efficient customer experience, beginning with a highly automated account opening process and ending with a fast trade execution, with real-time position monitoring. Our sophisticated interface provides interactive real-time views of account balances, positions, profits or losses, buying power and "what-if" scenarios to enable our customers to more easily make informed investment decisions and trade efficiently. Our system is configured to remember the user's preferences and is specifically designed for multi-screen systems. When away from their main workstations, customers are able to access their accounts through our IB WebTrader SM or MobileTrader SM interfaces. &#149; Interactive Analytics SM and IB Options Analytics SM &#151; We offer our customers state-of-the-art tools, which include a customizable trading platform, advanced analytic tools and over 60 sophisticated order types and algorithms. We also provide a real-time option analytics window which displays values that reflect the rate of change of an option's price with respect to a unit change in each of a number of risk dimensions. 7 

&#149; Probability Lab SM (Patent Pending)&#151; The Probability Lab provides clients with an intuitive, visual method to analyze market participants' future stock price forecasts based on current option prices. This tool compares a client's stock price forecast versus that of the market, and scans the entire option universe for the highest Sharpe ratio multi-leg option strategies that take advantage of the client's forecast. &#149; IB Risk Navigator SM &#151; We offer free to all customers our real-time market risk management platform that unifies exposure across multiple asset classes around the globe. The system is capable of identifying overexposure to risk by starting at the portfolio level and drilling down into successively greater detail within multiple report views. Report data is updated every ten seconds or upon changes to portfolio composition. Predefined reports allow the summarization of a portfolio from different risk perspectives, and allow views of Exposure, Value at Risk ("VaR"), Delta, Gamma, Vega and Theta, profit and loss and position quantity measures for the different portfolio views. The system also offers the customer the ability to modify positions through "what-if" scenarios that show hypothetical changes to the risk summary. &#149; White Branding&#151; Our large financial advisor and broker-dealer customers may "white brand" our trading interface, account management and reports with their firm's identity. Broker-dealer clients can also select from among our modular functionalities, such as order routing, trade reporting or clearing, on specific products or exchanges where they may not have up-to-date technology, in order to offer to their customers a complete global range of services and products. &#149; Securities Financing Services&#151; We offer a suite of automated Stock Borrow and Lending tools, including our depth of availability, transparent rates, global reach and dedicated service representatives. Our Stock Yield Enhancement Program allows our customers to lend their fully-paid stock shares to us in exchange for cash collateral. In turn, we lend these stocks in exchange for collateral and earn stock lending fees. Our customers receive generally 50% of the fees collected from lending their stocks. This allows customers holding fully-paid long stock positions to enhance their returns. &#149; Investors' Marketplace&#151; The Investors' Marketplace is an expansion of our Money Manager Marketplace and our Hedge Fund Capital Introduction program. This program is the first electronic meeting place that brings together individual investors, financial advisors, money managers, fund managers, research analysts, technology providers, business developers and administrators, allowing them to interact to form connections and conduct business. &#149; Trade Desk&#151; We offer broker-assisted trading through our block trade desk, which is ideal when customers are away from their computer, or if they just want another set of eyes watching their orders and updating them on market changes. &#149; Model Portfolios&#151; Model Portfolios offer advisors an efficient and time-saving approach to investing client assets. They allow advisors to create groupings of financial instruments based on specific investment themes, and then invest client funds into these models. &#149; Portfolio Builder&#151; Portfolio Builder allows our customers to set up an investment strategy based on research and rankings from top buy-side providers and fundamental data; use filters to define the universe of equities that will comprise their strategy and back-test their strategy using up to three years of historical performance; work in hypothetical mode to adjust the strategy until the historical performance meets their standards; and with the click of a button let the system create the orders to invest in a strategy and track its performance in their portfolio. 8 

&#149; Registered Investment Advisors ("RIA") Compliance Center&#151; RIA Compliance Center provides information to assist advisors with registration and compliance obligations. This functionality includes an overview for advisor's registration and compliance obligations; a series of spotlights, providing an in-depth look at compliance issues of interest to investment advisors; links to key regulatory websites; information on preferred providers for RIAs; and sample documents, such as client agreements and disclosers, along with other beneficial information. &#149; Covestor&#151; Covestor recruits registered financial advisors, vets them, analyzes their investment track records, and groups them by their risk profile. Retail investors who are interested in having their individual accounts robo-traded are grouped by their risk return preferences, and members of matching groups are electronically introduced to each other. Retail investors can assign their accounts to be traded by one or more advisors. We are able to provide our customers with high-speed trade execution at low commission rates, in large part because we utilize the backbone technology developed for our market making operations. As a result of our advanced electronic brokerage platform, we attract sophisticated and active investors. No single customer represented more than 1% of our commissions and execution fees in 2015. 

Market Making&#151;Timber Hill 

Market making represented 21% of net revenues and 20% of income before income taxes from electronic brokerage and market making combined during 2015. We conduct our market making business primarily through our Timber Hill ("TH") subsidiaries. As one of the largest market makers on many of the world's leading electronic exchanges, we provide liquidity by offering competitively tight bid/offer spreads over a broad base of over one million tradable, exchange-listed products, including equity derivative products, equity index derivative products, equity securities and futures. As principal, we commit our own capital and derive revenues or incur losses from the difference between the price paid when securities are bought and the price received when those securities are sold. Historically, our profits have been principally a function of transaction volume and price volatility of electronic exchange-traded products rather than the direction of price movements. Other factors, including the ratio of actual to implied volatility and shifts in foreign currency exchange rates, can also have a meaningful impact on our results, as described further in "Business Environment" in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Our strategy is to calculate quotes at which supply and demand for a particular security are likely to be in balance a few seconds ahead of the market and execute small trades at tiny but favorable differentials. Because we provide continuous bid and offer quotations and we are continuously both buying and selling quoted securities, we may have either a long or a short position in a particular product at a given point in time. As a matter of practice, we will generally not take portfolio positions in either the broad market or the financial instruments of specific issuers in anticipation that prices will either rise or fall. Our entire portfolio is evaluated each second and continuously rebalanced throughout the trading day, thus minimizing the risk of our portfolio at all times. This real-time rebalancing of our portfolio, together with our real-time proprietary risk management system, enables us to curtail risk and to be profitable in both up-market and down-market scenarios. Our quotes are based on our proprietary model rather than customer order flow, and we believe that this approach provides us with a competitive advantage. 

We are a market leader in exchange-traded equity options and equity-index options and futures. Together with our electronic brokerage customers, in 2015 we accounted for approximately 7.8% of exchange-listed equity options traded worldwide according to data received from exchanges worldwide. Our ability to make markets in such a large number of exchanges and market centers simultaneously around the world is one of our core strengths and has contributed to the large volumes in our market 

making business. We engage in market making operations in North and South America, Europe and in the Asia/Pacific regions as described below. 

North and South American Market Making Activities. Our U.S. market making activities are conducted through Timber Hill LLC ("TH LLC"), a SEC-registered securities broker-dealer that conducts market making in equity derivative products, equity index derivative products and equity securities. Since its inception in 1982, TH LLC has grown to become one of the largest listed options market makers in the U.S. As of December 31, 2015, TH LLC held specialist, primary market maker or lead market maker designations in options on approximately 1,010 underlying securities listed in the U.S. TH LLC is a member of the Boston Options Exchange, BATS exchange, Chicago Board Options Exchange, Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Chicago Board of Trade, International Securities Exchange, NYSE AMEX Options Exchange, NYSE Arca, OneChicago, NASDAQ OMX's PHLX and NOM option markets and the New York Mercantile Exchange. TH LLC also conducts market making activities in Mexico at the MEXDER and the Mexican Stock Exchange; and in Brazil at BM&#38;F BOVESPA S.A. We conduct market making activities in Canada through our Canadian subsidiary, Timber Hill Canada Company ("THC") at the Toronto Stock Exchange and Montreal Exchange. In addition, we participate in stock trading at various notable Electronic Communications Networks ("ECNs") in both the U.S. and Canada. 

European, Asian, and Australian Market Making Activities. Our European, Asian, and Australian market making subsidiaries, the largest of which is Timber Hill Europe AG ("THE"), conduct operations in 19 countries, comprising the major securities markets in these regions. 

We began our market making operations in Europe in 1990. In Germany and Switzerland, we have been among the largest equity options market makers in terms of volume on Eurex, one of the world's largest futures and options exchanges, which is jointly operated by Deutsche B&#246;rse AG and SIX Swiss Exchange. We have also been active in trading German stocks and warrants as a member of XETRA, the German electronic stock trading system, and the Frankfurt and Stuttgart stock exchanges; and in Switzerland as a member of the SIX Swiss Exchange. Our other European operations are conducted on the London Stock Exchange; the Weiner B&#246;rse AG; the Euronext exchanges in Amsterdam, Paris, Brussels and London; NASDAQ OMX Nordic exchanges in Sweden, Finland and Denmark; the MEFF and Bolsa de Valores Madrid in Spain; the IDEM and Borsa Valori de Milano in Milan; and the &#214;TOB in Vienna. 

Since 1995, we have conducted market making operations in Hong Kong. Our Hong Kong subsidiary, Interactive Brokers Hong Kong Limited (formerly Timber Hill Securities Hong Kong Ltd), is a member of the cash and derivatives markets of the Hong Kong Exchanges. Since 1997, we have conducted operations in Australia. Our Australian subsidiary, Timber Hill Australia Pty Ltd ("THA"), is a member of the Australian Stock Exchange, and routes orders for its trading on ASX 24 through its affiliate, Interactive Brokers LLC ("IB LLC"). We commenced trading in Japan in 2002, Korea and Singapore in 2004 and Taiwan in 2007. In 2008, we began our market making operation and, subsequently, brokerage activities in India through our subsidiary, Interactive Brokers (India) Private Limited ("IBI"), which is a member of the National Stock Exchange of India and the Bombay Stock Exchange. 

Most of the above trading activities take place on exchanges and all securities and commodities that we trade are cleared by exchange owned or authorized clearing houses. Recently, the emergence of high frequency traders ("HFTs") and others who compete with us but do not regularly provide liquidity have put our market making operations under pressure and the relative significance of market making to our business has diminished. 

Technology 

Our proprietary technology is the key to our success. We built our business on the belief that a fully computerized market making system that could integrate pricing and risk exposure information quickly and continuously would enable us to make markets profitably in many different financial instruments simultaneously. We believe that integrating our system with electronic exchanges and market centers results in transparency, liquidity and efficiencies of scale. Together with the IB SmartRouting SM system and our low commissions, these features reduce overall transaction costs to our customers and, in turn, increases our transaction volume and profits. Over the past 38 years, we have developed an integrated trading system and communications network and have positioned our company as an efficient conduit for the global flow of risk capital across asset and product classes on electronic exchanges around the world, permitting us to have one of the lowest cost structures in the industry. We believe that developing, maintaining and continuing to enhance our proprietary technology provides us and our customers with the competitive advantage of being able to adapt quickly to the changing environment of our industry and to take advantage of opportunities presented by new exchanges, products or regulatory changes before our competitors. 

The quotes that we provide as market makers are driven by proprietary mathematical models that assimilate market data and re-evaluate our outstanding quotes each second. Because our technology infrastructure enables us to process large volumes of pricing and risk exposure information rapidly, we are able to make markets profitably in securities with relatively low spreads between bid and offer prices. As market makers, we must ensure that our interfaces connect effectively and efficiently with each exchange and market center where we make markets and that they are in complete conformity with all the applicable rules of each local venue. Utilizing up-to-date computer and telecommunications systems, we transmit continually updated pricing information directly to exchange computer devices and receive trade and quote information for immediate processing by our systems. As a result, we are able to maintain more effective control over our exposure to price and volatility movements on a real-time basis than many of our competitors. This control is important, not only because our system must process, clear and settle several hundred thousand market maker trades per day with a minimal number of errors, but also because the system monitors and manages the risk on the entire portfolio, which generally consists of more than ten million open contracts distributed among many hundreds of thousands of different products. Using our system, which we believe affords an optimal interplay of decentralized trading activity and centralized risk management, we quote markets in over one million securities and futures products traded around the world. 

In our electronic brokerage business, our proprietary technology infrastructure enables us to provide our customers with the ability to execute trades at among the lowest commission costs in the industry. Additionally, our customers benefit from real-time systems optimization for our market making business. Customer trades are both automatically captured and reported in real time in our system. Our customers trade on more than 100 exchanges and market centers in 24 countries around the world. All of these exchanges are partially or fully electronic, meaning that a customer can buy or sell a product traded on that exchange via an electronic link from his or her computer terminal through our system to the exchange. We offer our products and services through a global communications network that is designed to provide secure, reliable and timely access to the most current market information. We provide our customers with a variety of means to connect to our brokerage systems, including dedicated point-to-point data lines, virtual private networks and the Internet. 

Specifically, our customers receive worldwide electronic access connectivity through our Trader Workstation (our real-time Java-based trading platform), our proprietary Application Programming Interface ("API"), and/or industry standard Financial Information Exchange ("FIX") connectivity. Customers who want a professional quality trading application with a sophisticated user interface utilize our Trader Workstation which can be accessed through a desktop or variety of mobile devices. Customers interested in developing program trading applications in MS-Excel, Java, Visual Basic or 

C++ utilize our API. Large institutions with FIX infrastructure prefer to use our FIX solution for seamless integration of their existing order gathering and reporting applications. 

While many brokerages, including some online brokerages, rely on manual procedures to execute many day-to-day functions, IB employs proprietary technology to automate, or otherwise facilitate, many of the following functions: 

&#149; account opening process; &#149; order routing and best execution; &#149; seamless trading across all types of securities and currencies around the world from one account; &#149; order types and analytical tools offered to customers; &#149; delivery of customer information, such as confirmations, customizable real-time account statements and audit trails; &#149; customer service; and &#149; risk management through automated real-time credit management of all new orders and margin monitoring. Research and Development 

One of our core strengths is our expertise in the rapid development and deployment of automated technology for the financial markets. Our core software technology is developed internally, and we do not generally rely on outside vendors for software development or maintenance. To achieve optimal performance from our systems, we are continuously rewriting and upgrading our software. Use of the best available technology not only improves our performance but also helps us attract and retain talented developers. Our software development costs are low because the employees who oversee the development of the software are the same employees who design the application, evaluate its performance, and participate along with our quality assurance professionals in our robust quality assurance testing procedures. The involvement of our developers in each of these processes enables us to add features and further refine our software rapidly. 

Our internally-developed, fully integrated trading and risk management systems are unique and transact across all product classes on more than 100 electronic exchanges and market centers and in 23 currencies around the world. These systems have the flexibility to assimilate new exchanges and new product classes without compromising transaction speed or fault tolerance. Fault tolerance, or the ability to maintain system performance despite exchange malfunctions or hardware failures, is crucial to successful market making and ensuring best executions for brokerage customers. Our systems are designed to detect exchange malfunctions and quickly take corrective actions by re-routing pending orders. 

Our company is technology-focused, and our management team is hands-on and technology-savvy. Most members of the management team write detailed program specifications for new applications. The development queue is prioritized and highly disciplined. Progress on programming initiatives is generally tracked on a weekly basis by a steering committee consisting of senior executives. This enables us to prioritize key initiatives and achieve rapid results. All new business starts as a software development project. We generally do not engage in any business that we cannot automate and incorporate into our platform prior to entering into the business. 

The rapid software development and deployment cycle is achieved by our ability to leverage a highly integrated, object oriented development environment. The software code is modular, with each object providing a specific function and being reusable in multiple applications. New software releases are tracked and tested with proprietary automated testing tools. We are not hindered by disparate and often limiting legacy systems assembled through acquisitions. Virtually all of our software has been developed and maintained with a unified purpose. 

For over 37 years, we have built and continuously refined our automated and integrated, real-time systems for world-wide trading, risk management, clearing and cash management, among others. We have also assembled a proprietary connectivity network between us and exchanges around the world. Efficiency and speed in performing prescribed functions are always crucial requirements for our systems. As a result, our trading systems are able to assimilate market data, recalculate and distribute streaming quotes for tradable products in all product classes each second. 

Risk Management Activities 

The core of our risk management philosophy is the utilization of our fully integrated computer systems to perform critical, risk-management activities on a real-time basis. In our market making business, our real-time integrated risk management system seeks to ensure that our overall positions are continuously hedged at all times, curtailing risk. In our electronic brokerage business, integrated risk management seeks to ensure that each customer's positions are continuously credit checked and brought into compliance if equity falls short of margin requirements, curtailing bad debt losses. 

We actively manage our global currency exposure on a continuous basis by maintaining our equity in a basket of currencies we call the GLOBAL. In 2011, we expanded the composition of the GLOBAL from six to 16 currencies to better reflect the expanding breadth of our businesses around the world. We define the GLOBAL as consisting of fractions of a U.S. dollar, Euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Swiss franc, Hong Kong dollar, Swedish krona, Mexican peso, Danish krone, Norwegian krone, South Korean won, Brazilian real, Indian rupee and Singapore dollar. We currently transact business and are required to manage balances in each of these 16 currencies. The currencies comprising the GLOBAL and their relative proportions can change over time. Additional information regarding our currency diversification strategy is set forth in "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in Part II, Item 7A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Electronic Brokerage 

We calculate margin requirements for each of our customers on a real-time basis across all product classes (stocks, options, futures, forex, bonds and mutual funds) and across all currencies. Recognizing that our customers are experienced investors, we expect our customers to manage their positions proactively and we provide tools to facilitate our customers' position management. However, if a customer's equity falls below what is required to support that customer's margin, we will automatically liquidate positions on a real-time basis to bring the customer's account into margin compliance. We do this to protect us, as well as the customer, from excessive losses. These systems further contribute to our low-cost structure. The entire credit management process is completely automated. 

As a safeguard, all liquidations are displayed on custom built liquidation monitoring screens that are part of the toolset our technical staff uses to monitor performance of our systems at all times the markets around the world are open. In the event our systems absorb erroneous market data from exchanges, which prompts liquidations, risk specialists on our technical staff have the capability to halt liquidations that meet specific criteria. The liquidation halt function is highly restricted. 

Our customer interface includes color coding on the account screen and pop-up warning messages to notify customers that they are approaching their margin limits. This feature allows customers to take action, such as entering margin reducing trades, to avoid having us liquidate their positions. These tools and real-time margining allow our customers to understand their trading risk at any moment of the day and help us maintain low commissions. 

Market Making 

We employ certain hedging and risk management techniques to protect us from a severe market dislocation. Our risk management policies are developed and implemented by our Chairman and our steering committee, which is comprised of senior executives of our various companies. Our strategy is to calculate quotes a few seconds ahead of the market and execute small trades at a tiny but favorable differential as a result. This strategy is made possible by our proprietary pricing model, which evaluates and monitors the risks inherent in our portfolio, assimilates market data and reevaluates the outstanding quotes in our portfolio each second. Our model automatically rebalances our positions throughout each trading day to manage risk exposures both on our options and futures positions and the underlying securities, and it will price the increased risk that a position would add to the overall portfolio into the bid and offer prices we post. Under risk management policies implemented and monitored primarily through our computer systems, reports to management, including risk profiles, profit and loss analysis and trading performance, are prepared on a real-time basis as well as daily and periodical bases. Although our market making is completely automated, the trading process and our risk are monitored by a team of individuals who, in real-time, observe various risk parameters of our consolidated positions. Our assets and liabilities are marked-to-market daily for financial reporting purposes and re-valued continuously throughout the trading day for risk management and asset/liability management purposes. 

We trade primarily the options on stocks (and individual stocks) whose underlying equity market capitalization is greater than $500 million. Throughout the trading day we produce online, real-time profit and loss, risk evaluation, activity and other management reports. Our systems compile a daily balance sheet and income statements for our accounting department to review and to reconcile to our trading system results and data from external sources. 

The adaptability of our portfolio risk management system and our trading methods allow us to trade a large number of financial instruments across many markets using the same risk management system and similar trading methods. 

Operational Controls 

We have automated the full cycle of controls surrounding the market making and brokerage businesses. Key automated controls include the following: 

&#149; Our technical operations section continuously monitors our network and the proper functioning of each of our nodes (exchanges, internet service providers ("ISPs"), leased customer lines and our own data centers) around the world. &#149; Our real-time credit manager software provides pre and post-execution controls by: &#149; testing every customer order to ensure that the customer's account holds enough equity to support the execution of the order, rejecting the order if equity is insufficient or directing the order to an execution destination without delay if equity is sufficient; and &#149; continuously updating a customer account's equity and margin requirements and, if the account's equity falls below its minimum margin requirements, automatically issuing liquidating orders in a smart sequence designed to minimize the impact on account equity. &#149; Our market making system continuously evaluates over one million securities and futures products in which we provide bid and offer quotes and changes our bids and offers in such a way as to maintain an overall hedge and a low-risk profile. The speed of communicating with exchanges and market centers is maximized through continuous software and network engineering innovation, thereby allowing us to achieve real-time controls over market exposure. 14 

&#149; Our clearing system captures trades in real-time and performs automated reconciliation of trades and positions, corporate action processing, customer account transfer, options exercise, securities lending and inventory management, allowing us to effectively manage operational risk. &#149; Our accounting system operates with automated data feeds from clearing and banking systems, allowing us to produce financial statements for all parts of our business every day by mid-day on the day following trade date. &#149; Software developed to interface with the accounting and market making systems performs daily profit and loss reconciliations, which provide tight financial controls over market making functions. Transaction Processing 

Our transaction processing is automated over the full life cycle of a trade. Our market making software generates and disseminates to exchanges and market centers continuous bid and offer quotes on over one million tradable, exchange-listed products. Our fully automated smart router system searches for the best possible combination of prices available at the time a customer order is placed and immediately seeks to execute that order electronically or send it where the order has the highest possibility of execution at the best price. 

At the moment a trade is executed, our systems capture and deliver this information back to the source, either the market making system or via the brokerage system to the customer, in most cases within a fraction of a second. Simultaneously, the trade record is written into our clearing system, where it flows through a chain of control accounts that allow us to reconcile trades, positions and money until the final settlement occurs. Our integrated software tracks other important activities, such as dividends, corporate actions, options exercises, securities lending, margining, risk management and funds receipt and disbursement. 

IB SmartRouting SM 

IB SmartRouting SM searches for the best destination price in view of the displayed prices, sizes and accumulated statistical information about the behavior of market centers at the time an order is placed, and IB SmartRouting SM immediately seeks to execute that order electronically. Unlike other smart routers, IB SmartRouting SM never relinquishes control of the order, and constantly searches for the best price. It continuously evaluates fast-changing market conditions and dynamically re-routes all or parts of the order seeking to achieve optimal execution. IB SmartRouting SM represents each leg of a spread order independently and enters each leg at the best possible venue. IB SmartRouting Autorecovery SM re-routes a customer's U.S. options order in the case of an exchange malfunction, and we undertake the risk of double executions. In addition, IB SmartRouting SM checks each new order to see if it could be executed against any of its pending orders. As the system gains more users, this feature becomes more important for customers in a world of multiple exchanges, market centers and penny priced orders because it increases the possibility of best executions for our customers ahead of customers of other brokers. As a result of this feature, our customers have a greater chance of executing limit orders and can do so sooner than those who use other routers. 

Clearing and Margining 

Our activities in the U.S. are entirely self-cleared. We are a full clearing member of OCC (the Options Clearing Corporation), the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Clearing House ("CMECH"), The Depository Trust &#38; Clearing Corporation and ICE Clear U.S. 

Due to our large positions in broad based index products, we benefit from the cross-margin system maintained by OCC and CMECH. For example, if we hold a position in an OCC cleared product and have an offsetting position in a CMECH cleared product, the cross-margin computation takes both positions into account, thereby reducing the overall margin requirement. The reduced margin benefit proves especially useful during times of market stress, such as on days with large price movements when intra-day margin calls may be reduced or eliminated by the cross-margin calculation. 

In addition, we are fully or partially self-cleared in Canada, Great Britain, Switzerland, France, Germany, Belgium, Austria, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, India and Hong Kong. 

Customers 

We established our electronic brokerage subsidiary, IB LLC, in 1993 to enhance the use of our global network of trading interfaces, exchange and clearinghouse memberships, and regulatory registrations assembled over the prior 16 years to serve our market making business. We realized that electronic access to market centers worldwide through our network could easily be utilized by the very same floor traders and trading desk professionals who, in the coming years, would be displaced by the conversion of exchanges from open outcry to electronic systems. 

We currently service approximately 331 thousand cleared customer accounts. Our customers reside in over 190 countries around the world. 

Our target customer is one that requires the latest in trading technology, worldwide access and expects low overall transaction costs. Our customers are mainly comprised of "self-service" individuals, former floor traders, trading desk professionals, electronic retail brokers, financial advisors who are comfortable with technology, banks that require global access, and hedge funds. 

Our customers fall into three groups based on services provided: cleared customers, trade execution customers, and wholesale customers. By offering portfolio margining and other institutional services, we have been able to persuade many of our trade execution hedge fund customers to utilize our cleared business solution, which benefits the hedge funds in terms of cost savings. Many prime brokers once offered increased leverage over Regulation T credit limitations and NYSE margin requirements through offshore entities and joint back office arrangements. Following the market turmoil of late 2008 and the resulting tightening of credit, we observed competition in this area diminish. Through portfolio margining, we are able to offer similar leverage with lower margin requirements that reflect the reduced risk of a hedged portfolio. 

&#149; Cleared Customers: We provide trade execution and clearing services to our cleared customers who are generally attracted to our low commissions, low financing rates, high interest paid and best price execution. From small market making groups and individual market makers, our cleared customer base has expanded over the years to include institutional and individual traders and investors, financial advisors and introducing brokers. &#149; Trade Execution Customers: We offer trade execution for customers who choose to clear with another prime broker or a custodian bank; these customers are able to take advantage of our low commissions for trade execution as well as our best price execution. &#149; Wholesale Customers: Our wholesale customers, which include some of the largest banks and retail electronic brokers, are generally self-clearing. These customers count on us for our superior options and option/stock combination trade routing and execution and our ability to assist them in satisfying their regulatory requirements to provide best execution to their customers. 16 

Our non-cleared customers include large online brokers and increasing numbers of the proprietary and customer trading units of U.S., Canadian and European commercial banks. These customers are attracted by our IB SmartRouting SM technology as well as our direct access to stock, options, futures, forex and bond markets worldwide. 

Our customers receive worldwide electronic access connectivity in one of three ways: the Trader Workstation via desktop or mobile device, our proprietary API, and/or industry standard FIX connectivity. 

Employees and Culture 

We take pride in our technology-focused company culture and embrace it as one of our fundamental strengths. We remain committed to improving our technology and we try to minimize corporate hierarchy to facilitate efficient communication among employees. We have assembled what we believe is a highly talented group of employees. As we grow, we expect to continue to provide significant rewards for our employees who provide substantial value to us and the world's financial markets. 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 1,087 employees, of which 1,037 own shares of the Company either vested, unvested or both, all of whom were employed on a full-time basis. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. 

Competition 

Electronic Brokerage 

The market for electronic brokerage services is rapidly evolving and highly competitive. We believe that we fit neither within the definition of a traditional broker nor that of a traditional prime broker. Our primary competitors include offerings targeted to professional traders by large retail online brokers (such as TD Ameritrade's thinkorswim, E*TRADE Pro business, and The Charles Schwab Corporation's StreetSmart Edge and optionsXpress businesses) and the prime brokerage and electronic brokerage arms of major investment banks and brokers (such as Goldman Sachs' Electronic Trading (GSET), and Morgan Stanley Electronic Trading (MSET)). We also encounter competition to a lesser extent from full commission brokerage firms including Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, as well as other financial institutions, most of which provide online brokerage services. The electronic brokerage businesses of many of our competitors are relatively insignificant in the totality of their firms' business and many impose significant account equity minimums, which we do not. We provide access to a global range of products from a single IB Universal Account SM and professional level executions and pricing, which positions us in competition with niche direct-access providers and prime brokers. In addition to offering low commissions and financing rates, we provide sophisticated order types and analytical tools that give a competitive edge to our customers. 

Market Making 

Historically, competition has come from registered market making firms which range from sole proprietors with very limited resources to large integrated broker-dealers. Today, our major competitors continue to be large broker-dealers, such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, UBS, Citigroup, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, and niche players such as Citadel, Susquehanna, Virtu, Wolverine Trading, Group One Trading, Peak6 and Knight Capital Group. Some of our competitors in market making are larger than we are and have more captive order flow, although this is less true with respect to our narrow focus on options, futures and ETFs listed on electronic exchanges. 

The competitive environment for market makers has evolved considerably in the past several years, most notably with the rise in HFTs, which transact significant trading volume on electronic exchanges by using complex algorithms and high speed execution software that analyzes market conditions. HFTs that are not registered market makers operate with fewer regulatory restrictions and are able to move more quickly and trade more cheaply. This issue is currently an area of focus amongst regulators who are examining the practices of HFTs and their impact on market structure. 

To compete successfully, we believe that we must have more sophisticated, versatile and robust software than our competitors. This is our primary focus, as contrasted with many of our competitors. With respect to these competitors, we maintain the advantage of having had much longer experience with the development and usage of proprietary electronic brokerage and market making systems. Market conditions that are difficult for other market participants often present us with the opportunities inherent in diminished competition. Our advantage is our expertise and decades of single-minded focus on developing our technology. This enables us to have a unique platform specializing strictly in electronic market making and brokerage. 

Regulation 

Our securities and derivatives businesses are extensively regulated by U.S. federal and state regulators, foreign regulatory agencies, numerous exchanges and self-regulatory organizations of which our subsidiaries are members. In the current era of heightened regulation of financial institutions, we expect to incur increasing compliance costs, along with the industry as a whole. Our approach has been to build many of our regulatory and compliance functions into our integrated market making, order routing and custodial systems. 

Overview 

As registered U.S. broker-dealers, IB LLC and TH LLC are subject to the rules and regulations of the Exchange Act, and as members of various exchanges, we are also subject to such exchanges' rules and requirements. Additionally, IB LLC and TH LLC are subject to the Commodity Exchange Act and rules promulgated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC") and the various commodity exchanges of which they are members. We are also subject to the requirements of various self-regulatory organizations such as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA") and the National Futures Association ("NFA"). Our foreign affiliates are similarly regulated under the laws and institutional framework of the countries in which they operate. 

U.S. broker-dealers and futures commission merchants are subject to laws, rules and regulations that cover all aspects of the securities and derivatives business, including: 

&#149; sales methods; &#149; trade practices; &#149; use and safekeeping of customers' funds and securities; &#149; capital structure; &#149; risk management; &#149; record-keeping; &#149; financing of customers' purchases; and &#149; conduct of directors, officers and employees. In addition, the businesses that we may conduct are limited by our agreements with and our oversight by regulators. Participation in new business lines, including trading of new products or participation on new exchanges or in new countries often requires governmental and/or exchange approvals, which may take significant time and resources. As a result, we may be prevented from entering new businesses that may be profitable in a timely manner, or at all. 

As certain of our subsidiaries are members of FINRA, we are subject to certain regulations regarding changes in control of our ownership. FINRA Rule 1017 generally provides that FINRA approval must be obtained in connection with any transaction resulting in a change in control of a member firm. The FINRA defines control as ownership of 25% or more of the firm's equity by a single entity or person and would include a change in control of a parent company. As a result of these regulations, our future efforts to sell shares or raise additional capital may be delayed or prohibited by FINRA. 

Net Capital Rule 

The SEC, FINRA, CFTC and various other regulatory agencies within the U.S. have stringent rules and regulations with respect to the maintenance of specific levels of net capital by regulated entities. Generally, a broker-dealer's capital is net worth plus qualified subordinated debt less deductions for certain types of assets. The Net Capital Rule requires that at least a minimum part of a broker-dealer's assets be maintained in a relatively liquid form. 

If these net capital rules are changed or expanded, or if there is an unusually large charge against our net capital, our operations that require the intensive use of capital would be limited. A large operating loss or charge against our net capital could adversely affect our ability to expand or even maintain these current levels of business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. 

The U.S. regulators impose rules that require notification when net capital falls below certain predefined criteria. These rules also dictate the ratio of debt-to-equity in the regulatory capital composition of a broker-dealer, and constrain the ability of a broker-dealer to expand its business under certain circumstances. If a firm fails to maintain the required net capital, it may be subject to suspension or revocation of registration by the applicable regulatory agency, and suspension or expulsion by these regulators could ultimately lead to the firm's liquidation. Additionally, the Net Capital Rule and certain FINRA rules impose requirements that may have the effect of prohibiting a broker-dealer from distributing or withdrawing capital and requiring prior notice to U.S. regulators and approval from FINRA for certain capital withdrawals. 

As of December 31, 2015, aggregate excess regulatory capital for all of the operating companies was $3.4 billion. 

IB LLC and TH LLC are subject to the Uniform Net Capital Rule (Rule 15c3-1) under the Exchange Act and to the CFTC's minimum financial requirements (Regulation 1.17) under the Commodities Exchange Act; and THE is subject to the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority eligible equity requirement. Additionally, Interactive Brokers Hong Kong Limited ("IBHK") is subject to the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission financial resource requirement, THA is subject to the Australian Stock Exchange liquid capital requirement, Timber Hill (Lichtenstein) AG is subject to the Financial Market Authority Liechtenstein eligible capital requirements, THC and Interactive Brokers Canada Inc. ("IBC") are subject to the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada risk adjusted capital requirement, Interactive Brokers (U.K.) Limited ("IBUK") is subject to the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority financial resources requirement, IBI is subject to the National Stock Exchange of India net capital requirements and Interactive Brokers Securities Japan, Inc. ("IBSJ") is subject to the Japanese Financial Supervisory Agency capital requirements. 

The following table summarizes capital, capital requirements and excess regulatory capital: 

&#160; &#160; Net Capital/ Eligible Equity &#160; Requirement &#160; Excess &#160; &#160; &#160; (in millions) &#160; IB LLC &#160; $ 2,367 &#160; $ 259 &#160; $ 2,108 &#160; TH LLC &#160; &#160; 375 &#160; &#160; 1 &#160; &#160; 374 &#160; THE &#160; &#160; 605 &#160; &#160; 180 &#160; &#160; 425 &#160; Other regulated Operating Companies &#160; &#160; 567 &#160; &#160; 35 &#160; &#160; 532 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#160; $ 3,914 &#160; $ 475 &#160; $ 3,439 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; 

As of December 31, 2015, all of the operating companies were in compliance with their respective regulatory capital requirements. For additional information regarding our net capital requirements see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Protection of Customer Assets 

To conduct customer activities, IB LLC is obligated under rules mandated by its primary regulators, the SEC and the CFTC, to segregate cash or qualified securities belonging to customers. In accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, IB LLC is required to maintain separate bank accounts for the exclusive benefit of customers. In accordance with the Commodity Exchange Act, IB LLC is required to segregate all monies, securities and property received from commodities customers in specially designated accounts. IBC, IBUK, IBHK, and IBSJ are subject to similar requirements within their respective jurisdictions. 

To further enhance the protection of our customers' assets, in 2011, IB LLC sought and received approval from FINRA to perform the customer reserve computation on a daily basis, instead of once per week. IB LLC has been performing daily computations since December 2011, along with daily adjustments of the money set aside in safekeeping for our customers. 

Supervision and Compliance 

Our Compliance Department supports and seeks to ensure proper operations of our market making and electronic brokerage businesses. The philosophy of the Compliance Department, and our company as a whole, is to build automated systems to try to eliminate manual steps in the compliance process and then to augment these systems with experienced staff members who apply their judgment where needed. We have built automated systems to handle wide-ranging compliance issues such as trade and audit trail reporting, financial operations reporting, enforcement of short sale rules, enforcement of margin rules and pattern day trading restrictions, review of employee correspondence, archival of required records, execution quality and order routing reports, approval and documentation of new customer accounts, and anti-money laundering and anti-fraud surveillance. In light of our automated operations and our automated compliance systems, we have a smaller and more efficient Compliance Department than many traditional securities firms. Nonetheless, we have increased the staffing in our Compliance Department over the past several years to meet the increased regulatory burdens faced by all industry participants. 

Our electronic brokerage and market making companies have Chief Compliance Officers who report to the Company's CEO, General Counsel and its Audit and Compliance Committee.

Patriot Act and Increased Anti-Money Laundering ("AML") and "Know Your Customer" Obligations 

Registered broker-dealers traditionally have been subject to a variety of rules that require that they "know their customers" and monitor their customers' transactions for potential suspicious activities. With the passage of the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the "Patriot Act"), broker-dealers are subject to even more stringent requirements. Likewise, the SEC, CFTC, foreign regulators, and the various exchanges and self-regulatory organizations, of which IB companies are members, have passed numerous AML and customer due diligence rules. Significant criminal and civil penalties can be imposed for violations of the Patriot Act, and significant fines and regulatory penalties for violations of other governmental and self-regulatory organization AML rules. 

As required by the Patriot Act and other rules, we have established comprehensive anti-money laundering and customer identification procedures, designated AML compliance officers, trained our employees and conducted independent audits of our programs. Our anti-money laundering screening is conducted using a mix of automated and manual reviews and has been structured to comply with regulations in various jurisdictions. We collect required information through our new account opening process and screen accounts against databases for the purposes of identity verification and for review of negative information and appearance on government lists, including the Office of Foreign Assets and Control, Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons lists. Additionally, we have developed methods for risk control and continue to add upon specialized processes, queries and automated reports designed to identify money laundering, fraud and other suspicious activities. 

Dodd-Frank Reform Act 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act imposes strict reporting and disclosure requirements on the financial services industry. We have enhanced the evidence of our supervisory review of controls over financial reporting and Management continues to monitor accounting and regulatory rulemaking developments for their potential effect on our financial statements and internal controls over financial reporting. 

Business Continuity Planning 

Federal regulators and industry self-regulatory organizations have passed a series of rules in the past several years requiring regulated firms to maintain business continuity plans that describe what actions firms would take in the event of a disaster (such as a fire, natural disaster or terrorist incident) that might significantly disrupt operations. We have developed business continuity plans that describe steps that we and our employees would take in the event of various scenarios. We have built a backup site for certain key operations at our Chicago facilities that would be utilized in the event of a significant outage at our Greenwich headquarters. In addition, we have strengthened the infrastructure at our Greenwich headquarters and have built redundancy of systems so that certain operations can be handled from multiple offices. We continually evaluate opportunities to further our business continuity planning efforts.
