General 

&#160;

Cipherloc Corporation is a Technology and Services based Solutions Company for the rapidly expanding Cloud based Cyber Security industry. Cipherloc is based in Henderson, Nevada. The company has introduced an innovative and revolutionary new type of encryption technology with five international patents and two US patents pending and is the industry&#8217;s first &#8220;Polymorphic Cipher Engine&#8221;, called CipherLoc &#174; . It is the first secure commercially viable advanced &#8220;Polymorphic Key Progression Algorithmic Cipher Engine&#8221; (PKPA). This morphing cipher can be used in any commercial data security industry and/or in sensitive applications: Banks, Financial transactions, Credit Cards, Securities, Stock and Bonds transactions, Emails, Phones, tablets, Servers and or computers, etc...

Our Company 

&#160;

Cipherloc Corporation (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was incorporated in Texas on June 22, 1953 as American Mortgage Company. On May 16, 1996, the Company changed its name to National Scientific Corporation. On March 15, 2015, the Company changed its name to Cipherloc Corporation. The name change became effective through the Amended Certificate as of March 23, 2015. The Company has notified the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) of its name change and has received FINRA&#8217;s approval for a new trading symbol CLOK reflecting its new name. The name change and the 1-100 reverse split were announced March 20, 2015 in the Daily List and became effective on March 23, 2015. The financial statements as to shares and earnings per share are restated as if the reverse split occurred on the first day of the first period being reported.

&#160;

In the year ended September 30, 2011, the Company introduced the Cloud-MD Office, a &#8220;Cloud Based&#8221;, 5010 ready and ICD-10 compliant, fully integrated and interoperable suite of medical software and services, designed by experienced healthcare analysts and programmers for healthcare providers, that produces &#8220;Actionable Information&#8221; to help Independent Physician Practices, New Care Delivery Models (ACO), Healthcare Systems and Billing Services optimize a wide range of business processes resulting in Increased Profits, Higher Quality, Greater Efficiency, Noticeable Cost Reductions and Better Patient Care. On September 29, 2015 the Company decided to sell the asset Cloud MD software. It was sold to an employee for $250,000 as set out in an Asset Purchase Agreement and Promissory Note attached to this report as an exhibit. The sale of Cloud MD closed on October 1, 2015. 

&#160;

On November 21, 2012, the Company purchased from CipherSmith, LLC a complete source code, intellectual property rights, all computer software or algorithm licensed or sold under CipherSmith, and appropriate copy rights, patents, mask works, trademarks, service marks, internet domain names or world wide web URS. Since 2012, the Company has tested the software application and created a commercial product for distribution of its encryption technology. The Company is presently developing more applications for consumer usage in the future.

Item 1. Description of Business 

&#160; 

CipherLoc&#174; &#8220;To Defeat the Attacker&#8221; Software Product 

&#160;

CipherLoc is the first truly Polymorphic Cipher Engine that can be used in commercial, security sensitive applications and is far more secure than any cipher by itself. This PKPA Engine eliminates replay attacks because the cipher morphs quickly over time. It also rejects data access and injection, false commands, and data alteration. All such methods are keys to cyber intrusion, spoofing, and electronic attacks. CipherLoc&#174; is one facet of a layered defense in depth protection plan for any organization. Cost effective and easy to use, the CipherLoc&#174; Polymorphic Cipher Engine provides an electronic gate that restricts access to vital assets, production facilities, and distribution systems that comprise the backbone of today&#8217;s electronics based organizations.

&#160;

What is a &#8220;Polymorphic Cipher&#8221;? 

&#160;

A polymorphic cipher has the ability to change an encryption to another method of encryption or key on the fly and is more commonly known as a &#8220;mutating&#8221; cipher. Polymorphic ciphers are a revolutionary idea based on the information content in a message rather than the difficulty of the key. Using advanced set theory and information theory, this encryption method does not rely exclusively on large keys and complicated permutation/obscuring techniques. This makes the algorithm faster, thus, allowing cipher changes to occur VERY quickly, and requires less memory than other encryptions. Polymorphic changes take place at a rate no slower than the effective &#8220;unicity distance&#8221; (that certain amount of information needed in order to decrypt an encrypted message) of the cipher, more frequently than enough information can be collected to break the code. Most other ciphers are easily broken as hardware gets faster because it is easier to check all possible keys in the cipher key space. However, if a polymorphic cipher is implemented properly, the speed of the encryption will increase as the hardware gets faster. Thus, unlike other ciphers, this type of software becomes safer as computers get faster.

&#160;

CipherLoc - Development 

&#160;

CipherLoc is not a static product and because of its very nature will always be a &#8220;work-in-progress&#8221; so that it can always be one step ahead of contemporary hacking approaches. The CipherLoc initial proof-of-concept was done in conjunction with a major U.S. university recognized for its excellence in security instruction and research by the US Government. Today&#8217;s CipherLoc team consists of several PhD&#8217;s (math, computer science, electrical engineering and statistics), elite professors, one of whom is a Fulbright Scholar, graduate students and commercial software developers specializing in operating systems, networking and security. Collectively the development team has specialties and experience in computer science, information theory, ciphers, cryptography, set theory, tactical and strategic electronic warfare, wireless communications, networking, control systems, communications electronics, commercial telecommunications and military telecommunications. Members of the team have worked for some of the largest and most admired engineering companies in existence, have military security expertise, have designed security programs, audited utilities and other infrastructure facilities, designed legal chain of custody applications, created anti-piracy and HIPAA (defined below) programs, protected credit card information, and worked in defense industries. Cooperative research takes place at several different universities with innovative cyber security programs. Each professor leads research teams composed of specially selected researchers specializing in cutting edge mathematics and cryptography techniques for randomization and decryption. Both are used to simplify encryption algorithms and proactively &#8220;attack the hack.&#8221; The goal is to make hackers react to attacking methods in the cipher rather than to react to new attack methodologies used by the hackers. Members of the research and development team have published papers and books on cryptography and set theory, are Critical Infrastructure Protection (&#8220;CIP&#8221;) certified, are developing university programs in cyber security, and are considered experts in the field of cryptography.

&#160;

Products and Services 

&#160; 

Information Security (&#8220;IS&#8221;) offers CipherLoc, the most comprehensive security coverage available and easily complies with HIPAA guidelines. CipherLoc is a patented, state-of-the-art Polymorphic Cipher Engine that was created as an advance Polymorphic Key Progression Algorithm (&#8220;PKPA&#8221;) cipher engine. CipherLoc is an industry changing, ground breaking and innovative solution for making all digital communications virtually impenetrable, thus, giving any corporation or individual the capability to achieve virtually the same security offered by a One Time Pad (OTP), the most secure cipher solution known, without all of the disadvantages..

CipherLoc Marketing 

&#160; 

A new concentration of risks in the cloud is driving the creation of new threat vectors. These new threats, in turn, create uncertainty about the Internet-fueled growth plans of Intel, Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Apple, Facebook, AT&#38;T, Verizon and just about any tech hardware, software or services company you care to name.

&#160;

The market for CipherLoc spans the entire spectrum of digital communications and covers every industry across the globe. Potential licenses for the CipherLoc family of encryption technology are in the 100&#8217;s of millions of client licenses.
