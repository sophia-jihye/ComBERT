&#160;

Codorus Valley Bancorp, Inc. (&#8220;Codorus Valley&#8221; or the &#8220;Corporation&#8221;) is a Pennsylvania business corporation, incorporated on October 7, 1986. On March 2, 1987, Codorus Valley became a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. PeoplesBank, A Codorus Valley Company (&#8220;PeoplesBank&#8221;) is its wholly owned bank subsidiary. The Corporation&#8217;s business consists primarily of managing PeoplesBank, and its principal source of income is dividends received from PeoplesBank. The Corporation also wholly-owns two non-bank subsidiaries, SYC Realty Co., Inc., a subsidiary for holding certain foreclosed assets pending liquidation, and CVLY Corp., which may be used, as needed, for the financial and legal management of acquisition transactions. On December 31, 2015, Codorus Valley had total consolidated assets of $1.46 billion, total deposits and other liabilities of $1.3 billion, and total shareholders&#8217; equity of $159,141,000.

&#160;

Bank Subsidiary

&#160;

PeoplesBank, organized in 1934, is a Pennsylvania chartered bank that offers a full range of business and consumer banking services. As of December 31, 2015, PeoplesBank operated twenty-four financial centers located in York and Cumberland Counties in Pennsylvania, and in Baltimore, Harford and Carroll Counties, and Baltimore City, in Maryland. PeoplesBank, with origins dating back to 1864, is focused on acquiring and nurturing financial relationships with small and mid-sized businesses. It also provides personal banking, mortgage banking, wealth management and real estate settlement services. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insures the deposits of PeoplesBank to the maximum extent provided by law . On December 31, 2015, PeoplesBank had total gross loans of $1.12 billion, excluding loans held for sale, and total deposits of $1.11 billion. PeoplesBank had the second largest share of deposits in York County, Pennsylvania, with deposits totaling 13.2 percent of the market as of June 30, 2015, the latest available measurement date.

&#160;

PeoplesBank is not dependent on deposits of, or exposed to a loan concentration to, a single customer, or a small group of customers. Therefore, the loss of a single customer, or a small customer group, would not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of PeoplesBank . At December 31, 2015, the largest indebtedness of a single PeoplesBank customer was approximately $17,516,000 or 1.6 percent of the total loan portfolio, which was within PeoplesBank&#8217;s 2015 regulatory lending limit of $19,919,000.

&#160;

Most of the Corporation&#8217;s business is with customers in York County, Pennsylvania and northern Maryland. Although this market area may pose a concentration risk geographically, we believe that the diverse local economy and our detailed knowledge of the customer base lessens this risk. At December 31, 2015, the Corporation had three industry concentrations that exceeded 10 percent of the total loan portfolio: commercial real estate investor represented 17.1 percent of the portfolio; residential real estate investors represented 14.3 percent of the portfolio; and builder and developer represented 11.9 percent of the portfolio. At December 31, 2014, the Corporation had three industry concentrations that exceeded 10 percent of the total loan portfolio: commercial real estate investor represented 15.7 percent of the portfolio; builder and developer represented 12.5 percent of the portfolio; and residential real estate investors represented 10.6 percent of the portfolio. Loans to borrowers within these industries are usually collateralized by real estate.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Nonbank Subsidiaries of PeoplesBank 

&#160;

PeoplesBank had five wholly-owned nonbank subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015, that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes. Codorus Valley Financial Advisors, Inc., a subsidiary that sells non-deposit investment products, began operations in January 2000, and previously operated as SYC Insurance Services, Inc. until the change to the current name in December 2005. SYC Settlement Services, Inc. is a subsidiary that has provided real estate settlement services since January 1999. Periodically, PeoplesBank creates nonbank subsidiaries for the purpose of temporarily holding certain foreclosed assets pending liquidation. On December 31, 2015, two of three of these foreclosed asset subsidiaries were active.

&#160;

Nonbank Subsidiaries of Codorus Valley Bancorp, Inc.

&#160;

In 2006, Codorus Valley formed CVB Statutory Trust No. 2, a wholly-owned special purpose subsidiary whose sole purpose was to facilitate a pooled trust preferred debt issuance of $7,217,000. In 2004, Codorus Valley formed CVB Statutory Trust No. 1 to facilitate a pooled trust preferred debt issuance of $3,093,000. The Corporation owns 100 percent of the common stock of these nonbank subsidiaries, which are not consolidated for financial reporting purposes. These obligations are reported as junior subordinated debt on the Corporation&#8217;s balance sheet.

&#160;

In 1991, SYC Realty Co., Inc. was incorporated as a wholly owned subsidiary of Codorus Valley, and originally commenced operations in October 1995. Codorus Valley created this nonbank subsidiary primarily for the purpose of holding certain foreclosed properties obtained by PeoplesBank pending liquidation of those properties. SYC Realty was inactive during the entire reporting period of 2015.

&#160;

In 2014, CVLY Corp. was formed as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Codorus Valley to be used in connection with the acquisition of Madison Bancorp, Inc. (which was completed on January 16, 2015). This entity may be used, as needed, for the financial and legal management of acquisition transactions.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

At year-end 2015, PeoplesBank employed 256 full-time employees and 36 part-time employees, which equated to approximately 282 full-time equivalent employees. Employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and PeoplesBank considers its relations with employees to be satisfactory.

&#160;

Segment Reporting 

&#160;

Management has determined that it operates in only one segment, community banking. The Corporation&#8217;s non-banking activities are not significant to the consolidated financial statements.

&#160;

Competition

&#160;

The banking industry in PeoplesBank&#8217;s service area, principally York County, Pennsylvania, and northern Maryland (specifically, Baltimore, Harford and Carroll counties), is highly competitive. PeoplesBank competes through service and price, and by leveraging its hometown image. It competes with commercial banks and other financial service providers, such as thrifts, credit unions, consumer finance companies, investment firms and mortgage companies. Some financial service providers operating in PeoplesBank&#8217;s service area operate on a national and regional scale and possess resources that are greater than PeoplesBank&#8217;s.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Supervision and Regulation 

&#160;

The Corporation is subject to extensive regulation under federal and Pennsylvania banking laws, regulations and policies, including prescribed standards relating to capital, earnings, dividends, the repurchase or redemption of shares, loans or extensions of credit to affiliates and insiders, internal controls, information systems, internal audit processes, loan documentation, credit underwriting, asset growth, impaired assets, and loan-to-value ratios. The bank regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of depositors, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking systems as a whole, and not for the protection of security holders.

&#160;

The following summary sets forth certain of the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries and provides certain specific information about Codorus Valley and PeoplesBank. It does not describe all of the provisions of the statutes, regulations and policies that are identified. To the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by express reference to each of the particular statutory and regulatory provisions. A change in applicable statutes, regulations or regulatory policy may have a material effect on the business of the Corporation.

&#160;

Bank Holding Company Regulations 

&#160;

Codorus Valley is registered as a bank holding company, and is subject to regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (&#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;), under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. The Bank Holding Company Act requires bank holding companies to file periodic reports with, and subjects them to examination by, the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has issued regulations under the Bank Holding Company Act that require a bank holding company to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks. As a result, the Federal Reserve may require Codorus Valley to use its resources to provide adequate capital funds to PeoplesBank during periods of financial stress or adversity.

&#160;

The Bank Holding Company Act prohibits Codorus Valley from acquiring direct or indirect control of more than 5 percent of the outstanding voting stock of any bank, or substantially all of the assets of any bank, or merging with another bank holding company, without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve. The Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities must also approve certain similar transactions. Pennsylvania law permits Pennsylvania bank holding companies to control an unlimited number of banks.

&#160;

The Bank Holding Company Act restricts Codorus Valley to activities that the Federal Reserve has found to be closely related to banking, and which are expected to produce benefits for the public that will outweigh any potentially adverse effects. Therefore, the Bank Holding Company Act prohibits Codorus Valley from engaging in most nonbanking businesses, or acquiring ownership or control of more than 5 percent of the outstanding voting stock of any company engaged in a nonbanking business, unless the Federal Reserve has determined that the nonbanking business is closely related to banking. Under the Bank Holding Company Act, the Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to end a nonbanking business if it constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness and stability of any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company.

&#160;

The Federal Reserve Act imposes restrictions on a subsidiary bank of a bank holding company, such as PeoplesBank. The restrictions affect extensions of credit to the bank holding company and its subsidiaries, investments in the stock or other securities of the bank holding company and its subsidiaries, and taking such stock or securities as collateral for loans.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

The Federal Reserve Act and Federal Reserve regulations also place limitations and reporting requirements on extensions of credit by a bank to the principal shareholders of its parent holding company, among others, and to related interests of such principal shareholders. In addition, such legislation and regulation may affect the terms upon which any person becoming a principal shareholder of a holding company may obtain credit from banks with which the subsidiary bank maintains a correspondent relationship.

&#160;

PeoplesBank and the banking industry, in general, are affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. Treasury and government agencies, including the Federal Reserve. Through open market securities transactions, and changes in its federal funds and discount rates and reserve requirements, the Federal Reserve exerts considerable influence over the cost and availability of funds for lending and investment.

&#160;

Small Business Lending Fund Program 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (&#8220;Treasury&#8221;) had a capital investment in the Corporation pursuant to the Corporation&#8217;s participation in the Treasury&#8217;s Small Business Lending Funding Program (&#8220;SBLF Program&#8221;). In August 2011, the Corporation sold to the Treasury, for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000,000, 25,000 shares of non-cumulative, perpetual preferred stock, Series B, $1,000 liquidation value, $2.50 par value. Proceeds from the SBLF Program were used in part to redeem $16,500,000 of outstanding Series A preferred stock previously issued to the Treasury under its Capital Purchase Program (&#8220;CPP&#8221;) and to repurchase a related CPP common stock warrant. In May 2014, the Corporation redeemed 13,000 of the 25,000 outstanding shares of the Corporation&#8217;s preferred stock that had been issued to the Treasury, leaving 12,000 shares and $12,000,000 of Series B preferred stock outstanding as of December 31, 2015. The preferred stock redemption was funded primarily with funds raised in a March 2014 private placement of Codorus Valley&#8217;s common stock.

&#160;

On February 18, 2016, Codorus Valley redeemed the remaining 12,000 shares and $12,000,000 of Series B preferred stock issued to the Treasury as reported on Form 8-K filed on February 19, 2016.

&#160;

Regulation of PeoplesBank 

&#160;

PeoplesBank is a Pennsylvania chartered bank that is not a member of the Federal Reserve System, and its deposits are insured (up to applicable limits) by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;). Accordingly, PeoplesBank&#8217;s primary federal regulator is the FDIC, and PeoplesBank is subject to the extensive regulation and examination by the FDIC and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities.

&#160;

State and federal banking laws and regulations govern such things as: the scope of a bank&#8217;s business; permissible investments; the reserves against deposits a bank must maintain; the types and terms of loans a bank may make and the collateral it may take; the activities of a bank with respect to mergers and consolidations; the establishment of branches; and the sale of non-deposit investment products by the bank and its insurance subsidiary.

&#160;

As the primary federal regulator of PeoplesBank, the FDIC regularly examines banks in such areas as capital, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity and sensitivity to market risk and other aspects of operations and requires that PeoplesBank furnish annual and quarterly reports. Examinations by the FDIC are designed for the protection of PeoplesBank&#8217;s depositors rather than Codorus Valley&#8217;s shareholders. The FDIC provides deposit insurance to banks, which covers all deposit accounts. The standard maximum insurance amount is $250,000 per depositor.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Effective January 1, 2012, PeoplesBank became subject to FDIC regulation 363.3(b), which requires depository institutions with total assets of $1 billion or more to engage an independent public accountant to examine, attest to, and report on the assertion of management concerning the institution&#8217;s internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting.

&#160;

The Pennsylvania Insurance Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&#8220;FINRA&#8221;) control and supervise the licensing and activities of employees engaged in the sale of non-deposit investment products.

&#160;

Federal Deposit Insurance and Premiums 

&#160;

PeoplesBank pays deposit insurance premiums to the FDIC based on a risk-based assessment formula established by the FDIC for Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) member institutions. Institutions are classified into one of four risk categories and pay premiums according to perceived risk to the FDIC&#8217;s DIF. PeoplesBank has consistently been a risk category I institution, the least risky category. Institutions in risk categories II, III and IV are assessed premiums at progressively higher rates.

&#160;

In February 2011, the FDIC announced its final rule pertaining to, among other things, changes in the computation of risk-based insurance premiums as mandated by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The final rule, which took effect April 1, 2011, changed the assessment base from domestic deposits to average assets minus average tangible equity, i.e., Tier 1 capital, and lowered assessment rates. For insured member institutions below $10 billion in total assets, the four risk categories framework mentioned earlier continues to apply. For the least risky category I institutions, such as PeoplesBank, the assessment rate range of 7 to 24 basis points on domestic deposits decreased to 2.5 to 9 basis points on total average assets minus average tangible equity. The final rule eliminated risk categories for large institutions with total assets of $10 billion or more. Instead, their assessment rates are now calculated using a scorecard that combines regulatory ratings and certain forward financial measures to assess the risk a large institution poses to the DIF. Generally, the change in the assessment methodology by the FDIC lowered deposit insurance premiums for community banks like PeoplesBank.

&#160;

Dividend Restrictions 

&#160;

The Corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from PeoplesBank. Declaration and payment of cash dividends by the Corporation depends upon cash dividend payments to the Corporation by PeoplesBank, which is the Corporation&#8217;s primary source of revenue and cash flow. Accordingly, the right of the Corporation, and consequently the right of our creditors and shareholders, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary is necessarily subject to the prior claims of creditors of the subsidiary, except to the extent that claims of the Corporation in its capacity as a creditor may be recognized.

&#160;

As a Pennsylvania chartered bank, PeoplesBank is subject to regulatory restrictions on the payment and amounts of dividends under the Pennsylvania Banking Code of 1965, as amended. Further, the ability of banking subsidiaries to pay dividends is also subject to their profitability, financial condition, capital expenditures and other cash flow requirements.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

The payment of dividends by PeoplesBank and the Corporation may also be affected by other factors, such as the requirement to maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines. The federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institution&#8217;s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, a depository institution may not pay any dividend if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it is already undercapitalized. Moreover, the federal agencies have issued policy statements that provide that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings. Federal banking regulators have the authority to prohibit banks and bank holding companies from paying a dividend if the regulators deem such payment to be an unsafe and unsound practice. More information about dividend restrictions and capital requirements can be found in Note 9 &#8211; Regulatory Matters, to the consolidated financial statements.

&#160;

Other Laws and Regulations Affecting the Corporation and PeoplesBank 

&#160;

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted to improve accountability and transparency in the financial system, to attempt to end &#8220;too big to fail&#8221; pertaining to large, troubled financial institutions, to protect the American taxpayer by ending governmental bailouts, to protect consumers from abusive financial services practices, and for other purposes. The Dodd-Frank Act is broad and complex legislation that puts in place a sweeping new financial services regime that will have significant regulatory and legal consequences for banks now and for years to come. The effects of the Dodd-Frank Act on the financial services industry will depend, in large part, upon the extent to which regulators exercise the authority granted to them under the Dodd-Frank Act and the approaches taken in implementing regulations. Additional uncertainty regarding the effect of the Dodd-Frank Act exists due to the potential for additional legislative changes to the Dodd-Frank Act. The Corporation, like all financial institutions, has been and will continue to be impacted by the Dodd-Frank Act in the areas of corporate governance, deposit insurance assessments, capital requirements, risk management, stress testing, and regulation under consumer protection laws.

&#160;

Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act:

&#160;

&#183; Provides extensive authorities to the federal bank regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Federal Reserve, to take proactive steps to reduce or eliminate threats to the safety of the financial system, impose strict controls on large bank holding companies ($50 billion or more) and nonbank financial companies to limit their risk, and take direct control of troubled financial companies considered systemically significant; &#160;

&#183; Increases bank supervision by restructuring the supervision of holding companies and depository institutions; establishes the equivalent of a prompt corrective action program for large bank holding companies; requires that capital requirements for holding companies be at least as strict as capital requirements for depository institutions; disallows new issuances of trust preferred securities from qualifying for Tier 1 capital treatment; directs federal bank regulators to develop specific capital requirements for holding companies and depository institutions that address activities that pose risk to the financial system, such as significant activities in higher risk areas, or concentrations in assets whose reported values are based on models; &#160;

&#183; Established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as an independent entity within the Federal Reserve System that has assumed responsibility for supervision and enforcement of most consumer protection laws, and has authority to supervise, examine and take enforcement action with respect to depository institutions with more than $10 billion in assets and nonbank mortgage industry participants and other designated nonbank providers of consumer financial services; &#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

&#183; Places certain limitations on investment and other activities by depository institutions, holding companies and their affiliates. Expands the coverage of Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act to include the credit exposure related to additional transactions, including derivatives; and &#160;

&#183; Significantly increases the regulation of residential mortgage lending and servicing by banks and nonbanks by requiring, among other things, mortgage originators to ensure that the consumer will have the capacity to repay the loan; and requires mortgage loan securitizers to retain a certain amount of risk, unless the mortgages conform to the new regulatory standards as qualified residential mortgages. &#160;

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (&#8220;SOA&#8221;) was signed into law in July 2002 and applies to all companies, both U.S. and non-U.S, that file periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The stated goals of the SOA were to increase corporate responsibility, to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws. The SEC is responsible for establishing rules to implement various provisions of the SOA. The SOA includes specific disclosure requirements and corporate governance rules, requires the SEC and securities exchanges to adopt extensive additional disclosure, corporate governance and other related rules and mandates further studies of certain issues by the SEC. The SOA represents significant regulation of the accounting profession and corporate governance practices, such as the relationship between a board of directors and management and between a board of directors and its committees. Section 404 of the SOA requires publicly held companies to document, test and certify that their internal control systems over financial reporting are effective.

&#160;

Effective December 31, 2014, the Corporation is subject to the independent attestation requirement under Section 404 of the SOA. PeoplesBank remains subject to independent auditor attestation under FDIC regulation 363.3(b), which is a similar independent attestation requirement to Section 404 of the SOA.

&#160;

USA Patriot Act of 2001 In October of 2001, the USA Patriot Act of 2001 was enacted to strengthen U.S. law enforcement&#8217;s and the intelligence communities&#8217; abilities to work cohesively to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts. The Patriot Act contains sweeping anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and imposes various regulations on financial institutions, including standards for verifying client identification at account opening, and rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering.

&#160;

Future Laws and Regulations 

&#160;

Periodically, various federal and state legislation is proposed that could result in additional regulation of, and restrictions on, the business of Codorus Valley and PeoplesBank. It cannot be predicted whether such legislation will be adopted or, if adopted, how such legislation would affect the business of Codorus Valley and its subsidiaries. As a consequence of the extensive regulation of commercial banking activities in the United States, Codorus Valley&#8217;s and PeoplesBank&#8217;s business is particularly susceptible to being affected by federal legislation and regulations. The general cost of compliance with numerous federal and state laws and regulations has had, and in the future may have, a negative impact on Codorus Valley&#8217;s results of operations.
