&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

Art&#8217;s-Way Manufacturing Co., Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; and the &#8220;Company&#8221;), began operations as a farm equipment manufacturer in 1956. Since that time, we have become a worldwide manufacturer of agricultural equipment, specialized modular science buildings, pressurized steel vessels, and steel cutting tools. Our principal manufacturing plant is located in Armstrong, Iowa. 

&#160; 

We have organized our business into four operating segments. Management separately evaluates the financial results of each segment because each is a strategic business unit offering different products and requiring different technology and marketing strategies. Our agricultural products segment manufactures and distributes farm equipment under our own and private labels and includes the operations of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Art&#8217;s-Way Manufacturing International LTD, a Canadian company (&#8220;International&#8221;) and Universal Harvester by Art&#8217;s-Way, Inc., an Iowa corporation (&#8220;UHC by Art&#8217;s-Way&#8221; or &#8220;UHC&#8221;), which was merged into the Company effective November 30, 2015. Our pressurized vessels segment manufactures pressure vessels through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Art&#8217;s-Way Vessels, Inc., an Iowa corporation. Our modular building segment manufactures modular buildings for various uses, commonly animal containment and research laboratories, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Art&#8217;s-Way Scientific, Inc., an Iowa corporation; and our tools segment manufactures standard single point brazed carbide tipped tools as well as PCD (polycrystalline diamond) and CBN (cubic boron nitride) inserts and tools through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Ohio Metal Working Products/Art&#8217;s Way, Inc., an Ohio corporation (&#8220;Ohio Metal&#8221;). For detailed financial information relating to segment reporting, see Note 16 to our financial statements in Item 8 of this report.

The tools are used by manufacturers in various industries to cut and shape various parts, pipes, and fittings. The marketing of the tools is primarily through independent distributors supplying manufacturers with industrial tools and supplies. We plan to continue our focus on providing cutting tools to industries such as automotive, aerospace, oil and gas piping, and appliances. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Our Principal Products 

&#160; 

Agricultural Products 

&#160; 

From its beginnings as a producer of portable grinder mixers, our Agricultural Products segment has grown through developing several new products and with our acquisitions. In 2012, we acquired UHC in Ames, Iowa and began selling reels for combines and swathers as UHC by Art&#8217;s-Way. In 2013, we acquired Agro Trend in Clifford, Ontario, through which we now sell industrial snow blowers and agricultural trailers as Art&#8217;s-Way Manufacturing International LTD. Today, our Agricultural Products segment manufactures a wide array of products relating to feed processing, crop production, augers, spreaders, hay and forage, tillage and land management, potato harvesting, and sugar beet harvesting equipment. We primarily manufacture products under the Art&#8217;s-Way, Miller Pro, Roda, M&#38;W, Badger, and UHC by Art&#8217;s-Way brand names. Our Agricultural Products segment also maintains a small volume of OEM work for the industry&#8217;s leading manufacturers. 

&#160; 

Grinder mixer line. The grinder mixer line represents our original product line. Our founder, Arthur Luscombe, designed the original PTO powered grinder-mixer prior to the Company&#8217;s inception. Grinder mixers are used to grind grain and mix in proteins for animal feed. They have several agricultural applications, and are commonly used in livestock operations. Our grinder mixers have wide swing radiuses to allow users to reposition the discharge tube from one side of the tank to the other in one step. Our 6105 grinder mixer offers a 105-bushel tank with a 20-inch hammermill. Our 6140 grinder mixer is a medium sized product with a 140-bushel tank, a 20&#8221; hammermill, and an 8&#8221; discharge auger. Our 6530 is the largest in the industry at 165-bushel tank with a 26-inch hammermill. It features self-contained hydraulics, and 10-inch discharge augers, which yields the fastest unload times in the industry. Our Cattle Maxx rollermill mixer products offer consistent feed grain rations for beef and dairy operations and are available in 105-bushel, 140-bushel and 165-bushel capacities. 

&#160; 

Stationary feed grain processing line. We offer stationary hammermills and rollermills. Harvesting leaves various amounts of extraneous materials that must be removed through processing the seeds. Hammermills are aggressive pre-cleaners that are designed to remove appendages, awns and other chaff from seeds by vigorously scraping the seed over and through the screen. The screen has holes that are big enough to let the seed pass through undamaged, but are small enough to catch and remove the appendages. Our rollermills roll the feed grain to minimize dust, and they fracture the outside hull to release the digestive juices more rapidly. Rolling feed provides more palatable and digestible feed for use in animal feeding operations. 

&#160; 

Crop production line. Art&#8217;s-Way shredders assure maximum crop shredding and destroy insect habitats. The shredded crop material allows for faster decomposition and restores nutrients to the soil more quickly while providing ground cover to reduce wind and water erosion. 

&#160; 

Land management line. Land planes are used to ensure even distribution of rainfall or irrigation by eliminating water pockets, furrows and implement scars in fields. Our land planes have a patented Art&#8217;s-Way floating hitch design. We offer pull-type graders to help our customers perform many tasks such as maintaining terraces and waterways, leveling ground, cleaning ditches and removing snow. The pull-type graders follow close to the back of a tractor for leveling uneven areas or for turning in smaller spaces. 

&#160; 

Moldboard plow line. The Art&#8217;s-Way moldboard plows offer conservation tillage choices to match each customer&#8217;s preference. Our moldboard plows are designed to slice and invert the soil to leave a rough surface exposed, and they are primarily used on clean-tilled cropland with high amounts of crop residue. 

&#160; 

Sugar beet harvesting line. Our sugar beet defoliators and harvesters are innovative products in the industry due to our focus on continuous improvement, both in reaction to customer requests and in anticipation of our customers&#8217; needs. Our machines can harvest six, eight, or twelve rows at one time. Along with being the first manufacturer to introduce a larger, 12-row harvester, we have begun to sell a self-propelled unit. Our sugar beet defoliators cut and remove the leaves of the sugar beets without damaging them, and the leaf particles are then incorporated back into the soil. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Hay and forage line. We offer highly productive hay and forage tools for the full range of producers. This product line includes high capacity forage boxes for transporting hay from the field with optional running gear to provide superior stability and tracking. High velocity, high volume forage blowers are able to fill the tallest silos with lower power requirements. Cam action rotary rakes and power mergers will gently lift the crop, carry it to the windrow and release it, saving more leaves and forming a faster drying, fluffier windrow. High performance V-style and carted finger wheel rakes offer growers value and include such features as large capacity and high clearance with ease of adjustment and operation. The M&#38;W balers are ideal for the dairy and equine segments that serve niche markets in the East North Central and the East South Central regions of the United States. The primary use of these balers is efficiently turning grass, alfalfa, clover, corn stalks, silage, peanut and straw hay into storable bales to save space and extend the life of these harvested feed sources. 

&#160; 

Augers line. Our portable grain auger models are available painted white or hot dipped galvanized. Rolling hopper augers are constructed from 12 gauge tube and &#188;&#8221; flighting. These augers feature an internal drive with externally mounted gear boxes for proper venting and easier maintenance. Driveline augers are also available with either power take-off unit (PTO) or electric drive. These heavy-duty augers have a reversible gear box which permits PTO operation from either side. 

&#160; 

Manure s preaders line . Roda manure spreaders are a well-known name with a rich tradition in the West North Central region of the United States with the origin of the spreaders dating back to the 1950s. We offer vertical and horizontal beaters and rear discharge manure spreaders in both truck-mount and pull-type configurations. Our products are ideal for spreading livestock manure, compost and lime. We offer a scale system, and a scale system with GPS for proper nutrient placement. These spreaders boast a heavy-duty and rugged design with one of the best spread patterns in the industry, allowing for efficient and consistent nutrient and land management. 

&#160; 

Reels line. In May of 2012 we purchased the assets of UHC and began selling reels for combines and swathers as UHC by Art&#8217;s-Way. These reels have a unique flip over action for self-cleaning in adverse conditions. They are manufactured with extruded aluminum creating a light weight yet strong reel. 

&#160; 

Snow blowers line. In June of 2013 we purchased certain assets of Agro Trend, a division of Rojac Industries, Inc. of Clifford, Ontario, Canada and began selling snow blowers, agricultural trailers, and dump boxes as Art&#8217;s-Way Manufacturing International LTD. We offer snow blowers in 28 models ranging from 54&#8221; wide to 120&#8221; wide. The styles also range from compact to heavy duty. Trailers range in sizes from 1.5 ton to 8 ton and we offer two versions of dump boxes. 

&#160; 

Pressurized Vessels 

&#160; 

We build vessels in carbon steel and stainless steel, ranging from atmospheric (0 PSI) storage vessels up to any PSI pressure rating required. Sizes range from 4&#8221; to 168&#8221; diameter and larger and to any length of vessel the customer requires. 

&#160; 

Modular Buildings 

&#160; 

We supply laboratories for bio-containment, animal science, public health, and security requirements. We custom design, manufacture, deliver, and install laboratories and research facilities to meet customers&#8217; critical requirements. In addition to selling these facilities, we also offer a lease option to customers in need of temporary facilities. 

&#160; 

Tools 

&#160; 

We supply standard single point brazed carbide tipped tools as well as PCD (polycrystalline diamond) and CBN (cubic boron nitride) inserts and tools. Our customers use the tools for various steel cutting applications. 

&#160; 

Product Distribution and Markets 

&#160; 

We distribute goods for our Agricultural Products segment primarily through a network of approximately 1,800 U.S. and Canadian independent dealers, as well as overseas dealers in the U.K., and Australia, whose customers require specialized agricultural machinery. We have sales representation in 48 states and seven Canadian provinces; however, many dealers sell only service parts for our products. Our dealers sell our products to various agricultural and commercial customers. We also maintain a local sales force in our Armstrong, Iowa facility to provide oversight services for our distribution network, communicate with end users, and recruit and train dealers on the uses of our products. Our local service parts staff is available to help customers and dealers with their service parts needs. Our Pressurized Vessels and Modular Building segments traditionally sell products customized to the end-users&#8217; requirements directly to the end-users. Our Tools segment distributes products through manufacturers&#8217; representatives, direct sales, and OEM sales channels. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

We currently export products to four foreign countries. We have been shipping grinder mixers abroad since 2006, and have exported portable rollermills as well. We look forward to strengthening these relationships and developing new international markets as well. Our international sales accounted for 7.3% of consolidated sales. 

&#160; 

Backlog. Our backlogs of orders vary on a daily basis. As of January 25, 2016, our Tools segment had approximately $156,000 of backlog, our Pressurized Vessels segment had approximately $701,000 of backlog, our Modular Buildings segment had approximately $686,000 of backlog and our Agricultural Products segment had a net backlog of approximately $3,535,000. We expect that our order backlogs will continue to fluctuate as orders are received, filled, or cancelled, and due to dealer discount arrangements we may enter into from time to time, these figures are not necessarily indicative of future revenue. 

&#160; 

Recent Product Developments 

&#160; 

During 2015, development in our Agricultural Products segment consisted of several products. We introduced the new 6140 grinder mixer. We also debuted a belt drive system as a product enhancement to our 6530 grinder mixer. We also added a 20&#8217;, 22&#8217;, and 24&#8217; pull type tandem axle vertical manure spreader to our product offerings. 

&#160; 

Our Pressurized Vessels and Modular Building segments complete projects based on customer specifications and did not engage in specific product development during 2015. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

In addition to the competitive strengths of each of our segments described below, we believe our diversified revenue base helps to provide protection against competitive factors in any one industry. Our Pressurized Vessels, Modular Buildings, and Tools segments provide us with diversified revenues rather than solely relying on the agricultural machinery sector. We are also diversified on the basis of our sales presence and customer base. 

&#160; 

Agricultural Products 

&#160; 

Our Agricultural Products segment competes in a highly competitive agricultural equipment industry. We compete with larger manufacturers and suppliers that have broader product offerings and significant resources at their disposal; however, we believe that our competitive strengths allow us to compete effectively in our market. 

&#160; 

Management believes that grain and livestock producers, as well as those who provide services to grain and livestock operations, are the primary purchasers of agricultural equipment. Many factors influence a buyer&#8217;s choice for agricultural equipment. Any one or all factors may be determinative, but they include brand loyalty, the relationship with dealers, product quality and performance, product innovation, product availability, parts and warranty programs, price and customer service. 

&#160; 

While our larger competitors may have resources greater than ours, we believe we compete effectively in the farm equipment industry by serving smaller markets in specific product areas rather than directly competing with larger competitors across an extensive range of products. Our Agricultural Products segment caters to niche markets in the agricultural industry. We do not have a direct competitor that has the same product offerings that we do. Instead, each of our product lines competes with similar products of many other manufacturers. Some of our product lines face greater competition than others, but we believe that our products are competitively priced with greater diversity than most competitor product lines. Other companies produce feed processing equipment, sugar beet harvesting and defoliating equipment, grinders, shredders and other products similar to ours; therefore, we focus on providing the best product available at a reasonable price. Overall, we believe our products are competitively priced with above average quality and performance, in a market where price, product performance and quality are principal elements. 

&#160; 

In addition, in order to capitalize on brand recognition for our Agricultural Products segment, we have numerous product lines produced under our labels and private labels, and have made strategic acquisitions to strengthen our dealer base. We also provide aftermarket service parts which are available to keep our branded and OEM-produced equipment operating to the satisfaction of the customer. We sell products to customers in the United States and four foreign countries through a network of approximately 1,800 independent dealers in the United States and Canada, as well as overseas dealers in the United Kingdom and Australia. 

&#160; 

We believe that our competitive pricing, product quality and performance, a network of worldwide and domestic distributors and our strong market share for many of our products allow us to compete effectively in the agricultural products market. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Pressurized Vessels 

&#160; 

Competition in the pressurized vessel industry is intense. It is critical in this business to deliver a quality product on a timely basis. We continue to work on delivering a quality product and improving our reputation within the industry. 

&#160; 

Modular Buildings 

&#160; 

We expect continued competition from our Modular Buildings segment&#8217;s existing competitors, which include conventional design/build firms, as well as competition from new entrants into the modular building market. To some extent, we believe barriers to entry in the modular building industry limit the competition we face in the industry. Barriers to entry in the market consist primarily of access to capital, access to a qualified labor pool, and the bidding process that accompanies many jobs in the health and education markets. Despite these barriers, manufacturers who have a skilled work force and adequate production facilities could adapt their manufacturing facilities to produce modular structures. 

&#160; 

We believe the competitive strength of our Modular Buildings segment is our ability to design and produce high-tech modular buildings more quickly than conventional design/build firms. Conventional design/build construction may take two to five years, while our modular laboratories can be delivered in as little as six months. As one of the few companies in the industry to supply turnkey modular buildings and laboratories, we believe we provide high quality buildings at reasonable prices that meet our customers&#8217; time, flexibility and security expectations. 

&#160; 

Tools 

&#160; 

We expect competition in our Tools segment from off shore products which have gained market share over the last twenty years. Our greatest threat continues to be emerging technologies that replace the need for brazed tools. These competitive threats are countered by our ability to offer the widest range of standard carbide tipped brazed tool inventories to be found in North America. These inventories are strategically located in four warehouses across the U.S. enabling our customers to receive product quickly with minimal shipping costs. Our ability to produce special, engineered, value added products in volume with short lead times sets us apart from our competitors. This is most evident in certain segments of the pipe processing industry, where we have been able to establish and maintain market share despite efforts from companies significantly larger than ourselves. 

&#160; 

Raw Materials, Principal Suppliers and Customers 

&#160; 

Raw materials for our various segments are acquired from domestic and foreign sources and normally are readily available. Currently, we purchase the lifter wheels used to manufacture our sugar beet harvesters from a supplier located in China. We also purchase rake tines and gearboxes from a supplier in Italy. However, these suppliers are not principal suppliers and there are alternative sources for these materials. 

&#160; 

We have an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) supplier agreement with Case New Holland (CNH) for our Agricultural Products segment. Under the OEM agreement, we have agreed to supply CNH&#8217;s requirements for certain feed processing and service parts, primarily blowers, under CNH&#8217;s label. The agreement has no minimum requirements and can be cancelled upon certain conditions. The initial term of the agreement with CNH ran through September 2006, but the agreement continues in force until terminated or cancelled. We have not terminated or cancelled the agreement as of November 30, 2015. We also sell reels to Honey Bee and Agco under an OEM agreement. For the year ended November 30, 2015, sales to OEM customers were approximately 5% of consolidated sales. 

&#160; 

We do not rely on sales to one customer or a small group of customers. During the year ended November 30, 2015, no one customer accounted for more than 5% of consolidated revenues. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We maintain manufacturing rights on several products which cover unique aspects of design. We also have trademarks covering product identification. We believe our trademarks and licenses help us to retain existing business and secure new relationships with customers. The duration of these rights ranges from 5 to 10 years, with options for renewal. We currently have no pending applications for intellectual property rights. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

We pay royalties for our use of certain manufacturing rights. Under our OEM and royalty agreement with CNH, CNH sold us the license to manufacture, sell and distribute certain plow products designed by CNH and their replacement and component parts. We pay semi-annual royalty payments based on the invoiced price of each licensed product and service part we sell. Under agreements with Roda and M&#38;W, we acquired an ongoing license to manufacture, sell and distribute Roda-branded manure spreaders and M&#38;W-branded balers in exchange for royalty payments for certain time periods which expired in January 2015and May 2015, respectively. Having fulfilled our royalty obligations under the Roda and M&#38;W agreements, we no longer are required to make payments, but retain the rights to manufacture, sell, and distribute these products. 

&#160; 

Research and Development Activities 

&#160; 

Our Agricultural Products segment is continually engaged in research and development activities to improve and enhance our existing products. We perform research and development activities internally, and the cost of our research and development activities is not borne by our customers. Our research and development expenses are cyclical; they may be high in one year, but would tend to be lower the next, with an increase in production expenses as our new ideas are manufactured. Research and development expenses during our 2015 fiscal year accounted for $162,000 of our total consolidated engineering expenses, compared to $191,000 during our 2014 fiscal year. 

&#160; 

Our Tools segment produces standard cutting tools and inserts and special tools per customer specifications. Our Pressurized Vessels segment produces custom tanks and vessels that are manufactured in accordance with specifications provided by our customers. Similarly, our Modular Buildings segment designs modular buildings in accordance with customer specifications. 

&#160; 

Government Relationships and Regulations; Environmental Compliance 

&#160; 

Our Modular Buildings segment must design, manufacture and install its modular buildings in accordance with state building codes, and the Company has been able to achieve the code standards in all instances. In addition, we are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations pertaining to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment. We do not expect that the cost of complying with these regulations will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of November 30, 2015, we employed approximately eighty-two employees in our Agricultural Products segment, one of whom was employed on a part-time basis. As of the same date, we had approximately fifteen full-time employees in our Pressurized Vessels segment and eighteen full-time employees in our Tools segment, nearly all of whom are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements. In addition, our Modular Buildings segment employed approximately sixteen employees, three of whom worked on a part-time basis. We experienced a decrease in employee levels in 2015 based upon demand for our product lines, and the numbers provided above do not represent our peak employment during our 2015 fiscal year. 

&#160;
