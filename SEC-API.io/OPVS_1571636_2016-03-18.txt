 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Introduction 

&#160; 

NanoFlex Power Corporation, formerly known as Universal Technology Systems, Corp., was incorporated in the State of Florida on January 28, 2013. On September 24, 2013, the Company completed the acquisition of Global Photonic Energy Corporation, a Pennsylvania corporation (&#8220;GPEC&#8221;) pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement (the &#8220;Share Exchange Transaction&#8221;). Immediately following the closing of the Share Exchange Transaction, the Company incorporated the business of GPEC and as a result, the Company owns 100% of equity interests of GPEC and GPEC became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. On November 25, 2013, the Company changed its name from &#8220;Universal Technology Systems, Corp.&#8221; to &#8220;NanoFlex Power Corporation&#8221; and its trading symbol was changed to &#8220;OPVS&#8221; on December 26, 2013. 

&#160; 

GPEC was founded and incorporated on February 7, 1994 and is engaged in the research, development, and commercialization of advanced configuration solar technologies. The Company&#8217;s sponsored research programs at the University of Southern California (&#8220;USC&#8221;), the University of Michigan (&#8220;Michigan&#8221;), and Princeton University have resulted in an extensive portfolio of issued and pending patents worldwide. Pursuant to its sponsored research agreements, NanoFlex has obtained the exclusive worldwide license and right to sublicense any and all intellectual property resulting from the Company&#8217;s sponsored research programs. While each patent is issued in the name of the respective university that developed the subject technology, NanoFlex has exclusive commercial license rights to all of the patents and their attendant technologies and the patents are referred to herein as being NanoFlex&#8217;s patents. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s Common Stock is quoted on the OTCQB under the symbol &#8220;OPVS.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Our Business 

&#160; 

NanoFlex Power Corporation is engaged in the research, development, and commercialization of advanced configuration solar technologies which enable unique thin-film solar cell implementations with what we believe will be industry-leading efficiencies, light weight, flexibility, and low total system cost. NanoFlex&#8217;s sponsored research programs at USC, Michigan, and Princeton University have resulted in an extensive portfolio of issued and pending patents worldwide covering flexible, thin-film photovoltaic technologies. Pursuant to its sponsored research agreements, NanoFlex has obtained the exclusive worldwide license and right to use and sublicense any and all intellectual property resulting from the Company&#8217;s sponsored research programs. 

&#160; 

These patented and patent-pending technologies fall into two general categories. Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) solar technologies involve fabrication processes and device architectures to substantially reduce the cost of ultra-high efficiency GaAs thin films. Organic Photovoltaics (OPV) technologies involve the materials, architectures, and fabrication processes for ultra-thin film semi-transparent solar cells. The technologies are targeted at, but not limited to, certain broad applications that require high power conversion efficiency, flexibility, and light weight. These applications include, but are not limited to: (a) portable power mats and sheets for military and field use, (b) building applied photovoltaics (&#8220;BAPV&#8221;), (c) building integrated photovoltaics (&#8220;BIPV&#8221;), (d) space vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles (&#8220;UAVs&#8221;), (e) semi-transparent solar power generating glazing or windows, and (f) ultra-thin solar films for consumer applications such as mobile devices or automobiles. Laboratory feasibility prototypes have been developed by the engineering team at the University of Michigan that successfully demonstrate key building block principles for these technology application areas. 

&#160; 

The Company is beginning to and plans to continue working with industry partners to commercialize its technologies for key applications where we believe they present compelling competitive advantages. For example, the Company has begun staffing our engineering team to support the transfer of technologies from university laboratories to implementation in industry partners&#8217; commercial product designs and fabrication processes. To this end, as further described below, on August 26, 2015, the Company signed a Joint Development Agreement (the &#8220;JDA&#8221;) with SolAero Technologies Corp. (&#34;SolAero&#34;). The JDA provides for the joint development of GaAs solar cells utilizing our proprietary manufacturing processes in conjunction with SolAero's advanced high efficiency solar cell technologies. 

&#160; 

Further, the Company plans to license the right to use and or sublicense its intellectual property to industry partners and customers. These manufacturing partners can supply customers directly, but also serve as a source of solar cell supply for NanoFlex to provide products to customers on its own, particularly in the early stages of market development. This business model is oriented around licensing and sublicensing processes and technologies to large, well-positioned commercial partners who can provide manufacturing and marketing capabilities to enable rapid commercial growth. 

&#160; 

Sponsored Research and License Agreements 

&#160; 

On October 22, 1993, American Biomimetics Corporation (&#8220;ABC&#8221;) entered into a Sponsored Research Agreement and License Agreement with Princeton University for research work being conducted in the laboratory of Dr. Mark E. Thompson. In August 1995, this original sponsored research agreement with Princeton University was assigned to USC when Dr. Thompson accepted a position at USC. In August of 1996, ABC assigned to GPEC its rights to various research inventions under the foregoing agreements. On May 1, 1998, GPEC, Princeton University, and USC entered into a new Sponsored Research Agreement (&#8220;1998 Sponsored Research Agreement&#8221;), which continued without interruption the research of Dr. Thompson (at USC) and added to it the research being done by Dr. Stephen R. Forrest (at Princeton University). At the same time, the parties entered into a License Agreement (the &#8220;1998 License Agreement&#8221;) which they considered an amendment of the earlier license agreement. This 1998 Sponsored Research Agreement formed the basis for future renewals of this agreement in 2004, 2006 and 2009 (together with such amendments, extensions and renewals referred to as the &#8220;Research Agreement&#8221;). 

&#160; 

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In 2006, the Company&#8217;s remaining principal researcher at Princeton University, Dr. Stephen R. Forrest, accepted a tenured position at Michigan and became its Vice President of Research. The USC Research Agreement, dated January 1, 2006 as later amended in 2009 (the &#8220;2009 Research Agreement&#8221;) is the renewal of the 1998 Sponsored Research Agreement and it retained the Company&#8217;s relationship with Dr. Thompson and his team, and established USC as the lead researcher and Michigan as the subcontractor. In addition, the 1998 License Agreement was also amended in 2006 (the &#8220;License Agreement 2006 Amendment&#8221;) to include Michigan, where Dr. Forrest has been conducting research for the Company. 

&#160; 

On December 20, 2013, the Company entered into a Research Agreement with USC (&#8220;2013 Research Agreement&#8221;) to amend and replace the 2009 Research Agreement to continue the sponsored research at USC and Michigan from February 1, 2014 through January 31, 2021. On the same day, they also entered into a Third Amendment to the License Agreement which renews and extends the License Agreement by and between USC, Michigan, Princeton and GPEC (&#8220;Third Amendment to License Agreement&#8221;). GPEC assigned to the Company and the Company assumed all the rights and obligations under both the 2013 Research Agreement and the Third Amendment to License Agreement. 

&#160; 

Currently, research and development of our flexible, thin-film OPV and GaAs technologies is being conducted at USC and Michigan under the seven year 2013 Research Agreement dated December 20, 2013. Under the 2013 Research Agreement, the Company made a deposit of $550,000 (the &#8220;Deposit&#8221;) in early 2014. This deposit was used by USC to pay for research costs and expenses as it incurred, including payments to Michigan, during any billing quarter. When the Company pays the related quarterly billing, the funds go to replenish the Deposit back to the full amount of $550,000, which is to continue until the end of the 2013 Research Agreement.

&#160; 

Under the currently effective License Agreement, as amended, with USC, Michigan, and Princeton wherein NanoFlex has obtained the exclusive worldwide license and right to sublicense any and all intellectual property resulting from the Company&#8217;s sponsored research agreements, we have agreed to pay for all reasonable and necessary out of pocket expenses incurred in the preparation, filing, maintenance, renewal and continuation of patent applications designated by the Company. In addition, the Company is required to pay to USC 3% of net sales of licensed products or licensed processes used, leased or sold by the Company, 3% of revenues received by the Company from the sublicensing of patent rights and 23% of revenues (net of costs and expenses, including legal fees) received by the Company from final judgments in infringement actions respecting the patent rights licensed under the agreement. The Third Amendment to License Agreement amended the minimum royalty section to eliminate the accrual of any such royalties until 2014. Furthermore, the amounts of the non-refundable minimum royalties, which would be applicable starting in 2014, were adjusted to be lower than the amounts in the previous License Agreement.

&#160; 

The Company has an exclusive worldwide license and rights to use and sublicense any and all intellectual property conceived or developed under its sponsorship at USC, Michigan, and Princeton University. There is currently no ongoing research activity at Princeton University related to the Company, although the Company maintains licensing rights to technology previously developed there. 

&#160; 

During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we incurred research and development costs pertaining to our sponsored research efforts and our establishment of our internal engineering team of $2,325,539 and $1,174,473, respectively.

Summary Business Description 

&#160; 

NanoFlex Power Corporation is engaged in the research, development, and commercialization of advanced configuration solar technologies which enable unique thin-film solar cell implementations with what we believe will be industry-leading efficiencies, light weight, flexibility, and low total system cost. NanoFlex&#8217;s sponsored research programs at USC, Michigan, and Princeton University have resulted in an extensive portfolio of issued and pending patents worldwide covering flexible, thin-film photovoltaic technologies. Pursuant to its sponsored research agreements, NanoFlex has obtained the exclusive worldwide license and right to sublicense any and all intellectual property resulting from the Company&#8217;s sponsored research programs. Building upon the university research, the Company plans to work with industry partners to commercialize its technologies to target key applications where we believe they present compelling competitive advantages. 

&#160; 

These patented and patent-pending technologies fall into two general categories. Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) solar technologies involve fabrication processes and device architectures to substantially reduce the cost of ultra-high efficiency GaAs thin films. Organic Photovoltaics (OPV) technologies involve the materials, architectures, and fabrication processes for ultra-thin film semi-transparent solar cells. The technologies are targeted at, but not limited to, certain broad applications that require high power conversion efficiency, flexibility, and light weight. These applications include, but are not limited to: (a) portable power mats and sheets for military and field use, (b) building applied photovoltaics (&#8220;BAPV&#8221;), (c) building integrated photovoltaics (&#8220;BIPV&#8221;), (d) space vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles (&#8220;UAVs&#8221;), (e) semi-transparent solar power generating glazing or windows, and (f) ultra-thin solar films for consumer applications such as mobile devices or automobiles. Laboratory feasibility prototypes have been developed by the engineering team at University of Michigan that successfully demonstrate key building block principles for these technology application areas. 

&#160; 

NanoFlex&#8217;s sponsored research activities have generated an extensive portfolio of issued and pending patents worldwide to which the Company has exclusive commercial rights. The patents cover materials, architectures, and processes for flexible, thin-film OPV technologies and high efficiency thin-film GaAs technologies. As of January 31, 2016, there were 63 issued patents, 43 pending non-provisional applications and 13 pending provisional applications in the U.S. and 18 pending PCT applications. In addition, in countries and regions outside the U.S., including but not limited to Australia, Canada, China, European Patent Convention, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea and Taiwan, there were a total of 141 issued patents and 263 pending patent applications. The duration of the issued U.S. and foreign patents is typically 20 years from their respective first effective filing dates. 

&#160; 

The Company has identified GaAs solar technologies as its nearest term market opportunity. We are executing a plan to commercialize the patented GaAs-based processes and technologies on an accelerated program. We have begun staffing our engineering team to support the transfer of technologies from University laboratories to implementation in industry partners&#8217; commercial products through Joint Development Agreements (&#8220;JDAs&#8221;). Upon successful completion of joint development, our intention is to enter into licensing and supply agreements with industry partners. We are also in discussions with system integrators, installers, and architects to assist with requirements, definition and technology development for several targeted applications. Additionally, we are working with our University researchers as well as industry partners to submit proposals for government programs to advance our technology development for both GaAs and OPV technologies. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The Company is currently in the development stage and has not sold any products nor licensed any of its technologies. NanoFlex&#8217;s auditors&#8217; opinion states that there is substantial doubt about the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern. 

&#160; 

Philosophy and Approach 

&#160; 

NanoFlex is focusing on two parallel technology development efforts: (a) its GaAs architectures, manufacturing processes, and technologies aim to provide GaAs solar cell manufacturers with the capability of producing ultra-high efficiency GaAs solar cells in thin-film form factors at a substantially reduced cost that is competitive with existing thin-film solar technologies. This has the potential to open new market segments such as portable field generation, mobile power, BAPV, BIPV and aerospace which are not well-served by crystalline silicon solar technologies; and (b) its portfolio of OPV thin film solar technologies provide highly flexible solar energy solutions for new applications such as BIPV (semi-transparent solar films for glass) and ultra-thin films for coatings on automobiles and other applications that demand design flexibility and light weight. Additionally, OPV technologies have the potential to achieve a very low cost structure relative to other solar technologies due to minimal material usage and compatibility with roll-to-roll processing. 

&#160; 

NanoFlex is not, and does not plan to be, a direct manufacturer of its technologies. Rather, it plans to license or sublicense its intellectual property to industry partners and customers. These manufacturing partners can supply customers directly, but also serve as a source of solar cell supply for NanoFlex to provide products to customers on its own, particularly in the early stages of market development. This business model is oriented around licensing and sublicensing processes and technologies to large, well-positioned commercial partners who can provide manufacturing and marketing capabilities to enable rapid commercial growth. This model is also intended to quickly establish NanoFlex as an important player in the solar industry with rapid, high-margin revenue growth. Potential partners for our GaAs technologies include current manufacturers of GaAs solar technology, who recognize the potential for our technology to dramatically reduce production costs, improve their margins, and open new market opportunities. Potential partners for our OPV technologies include manufacturers of electronics, including organic electronics, existing developers of OPV solar technologies, producers of advanced materials and films, manufacturers of building materials, and glass manufacturers. 

&#160; 

In addition, NanoFlex believes that there are several avenues for early revenue generation that become possible with the establishment of its developmental engineering team. First among these avenues is government funding. The Department of Energy (&#8220;DOE&#8221;), Department of Defense (&#8220;DoD&#8221;), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (&#8220;NASA&#8221;) all have interests in technologies that can deliver lightweight, high-efficiency solar power that contribute toward ubiquitous solar. 

&#160; 

NanoFlex also anticipates that advancements achieved by its engineering team can attract other industry players to acquire early licenses to use NanoFlex intellectual property. Finally, new licenses and agreements can be made possible by ongoing technology development, especially that related to perfecting and broadening of NanoFlex&#8217;s intellectual property in ultra-thin-film semi-transparent organic solar cells. 

&#160; 

Gallium Arsenide Solar Technologies 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s first technology platform is based on the GaAs semiconductor, and is currently advancing toward commercialization. GaAs is a key component of many ultra-high performance electronic technologies used in cellular telephones and military applications. While the very highest single-junction and multi-junction solar cell efficiencies (approximately 29% and 44%, respectively, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, &#8220;Best Research Cell Efficiencies,&#8221; www.nrel.gov/ncpv) are based on GaAs, they are prohibitively expensive for mass markets and hence are only considered for specialty applications where performance and weight requirements outweigh cost considerations, such as space-borne applications. Broader market acceptance of GaAs-based solar technologies requires substantial cost reductions. 

&#160; 

NanoFlex&#8217;s patented technology has the potential to enable these cost reductions in two ways: (a) reducing the cost of the solar cell by re-using expensive GaAs source material and (b) using mini-concentrators to reduce the amount of semiconductor material used within a solar module. Furthermore, NanoFlex&#8217;s technology combines the high power conversion efficiency of GaAs solar cells with an extremely light weight and flexible form factor that meets requirements for applications that are not well-served by crystalline silicon technologies, due to heavy weight and rigidity, or by other thin films due to low power conversion efficiency. 

&#160; 

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

The primary cost in fabricating GaAs solar cells is the very high cost of the substrates on which the thin active region (called the epitaxial layers) is grown. These substrates, or &#8220;parent wafers,&#8221; constitute the largest portion of the total cost of a GaAs solar cell. During the fabrication process that is currently in use in industry, these expensive parent wafers are destroyed when the solar cell layer is removed, yielding only a single solar thin film for each parent wafer. Existing GaAs solar cell fabricators continue to seek methods to prevent damage to the parent wafer to enable multiple re-growths thereby fabricating multiple solar thin films from a single wafer. NanoFlex, through its researchers, has developed an architecture and process enabling the active solar cell layer (approximately 1/1,000 th of the thickness of a human hair) to be removed from the parent wafer on which it is grown in a non-destructive manner without degradation in surface area, thereby allowing for the re-use of the wafer multiple times. Furthermore, lab tests also reflect no degradation in solar cell performance from each growth and removal cycle. 

&#160; 

We believe this process, called non-destructive epitaxial lift-off (&#8220;ND-ELO&#8221;), revolutionizes the cost structure of GaAs solar cell technology, allocating the high cost of the parent wafer to multiple solar thin films, substantially reducing the total cost per watt for each GaAs solar cell. Further, as part of the ND-ELO process, the ultra-thin semiconductor is bonded to a flexible and thin secondary substrate such as plastic or metal foil using our adhesive-free, lightweight, ultra-strong and flexible process called cold-weld bonding. The cold-weld bonding process enables highly flexible and lightweight thin film GaAs solar cells. 

&#160; 

A second aspect of the Company&#8217;s GaAs technology centers on minimizing the required size of the GaAs solar cell through the use of mini-concentrators, thereby further reducing cost. In this design, small GaAs thin-film cells are placed at the trough of low-profile plastic parabolic concentrators. The concentrators harvest solar energy using a wide acceptance angle and focus it into the small GaAs cell. This enables solar energy harvesting throughout the day and the integrated device is able to capture the equivalent energy production density (measured in kW-hrs/m2) as a full-sized GaAs cell at a substantially reduced cost. 

&#160; 

With the combination of GaAs&#8217;s high conversion efficiencies and the cost reductions associated with implementing our proprietary ND-ELO processes and mini-concentration technologies, we believe the costs of GaAs solar cells can approach cost metrics associated with competing solar technologies, particularly thin films, while providing substantial performance advantages associated with power per surface area and power per weight. 

&#160; 

Organic Photovoltaic Technologies 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s second technology platform is based on flexible, thin-film OPV technologies that have been researched and developed over the last two decades by our sponsored research partners. Relative to other solar technologies, we believe OPV present compelling advantages relating to form factor flexibility and has the potential to realize extremely low production costs. 

&#160; 

Because the organic films are lightweight and extremely thin (in this case the entire structure is approximately 1/10,000 th of the thickness of a human hair), they can be made semitransparent and adjusted to any desirable color. As a result, we believe there are significant opportunities to achieve heretofore unrealizable applications such as window glazing and ultra-thin films or coatings to be incorporated into non-conformal surfaces. 

&#160; 

OPV technologies have potential to achieve a very low cost structure, derived from low materials cost and highly efficient roll-to-roll processing. The ultra-thin layer of OPV requires small quantities of materials. Furthermore, layers of OPV material can be deposited directly onto plastic or metal foils and therefore is no need for energy-intensive processes required by other solar technologies, such as silicon. Rather, there is the opportunity to &#8220;print&#8221; organic solar cells onto continuous rolls of plastic in an ultra-high-speed and low energy intensity manufacturing process. We believe the potential for printed electronics - making solar films roll-to-roll rather than by batch processing - makes OPV a potentially revolutionary step in the widespread acceptance and deployment of solar energy. 

&#160; 

NanoFlex&#8217;s approach has been to advance all dimensions of OPV technology, including the development of new materials, new high efficiency device architectures, and ultra-high-speed, low-energy-intensity production processes such as organic vapor phase deposition developed in NanoFlex&#8217;s researcher&#8217;s laboratories, and solar cell modulization. 

&#160; 

Our sponsored research efforts aim to advance the practical viability of OPV by demonstrating reliable, large area and high-efficiency organic multi-junction cells based on small molecule materials systems. NanoFlex development targets aim to achieve greater than 15% power conversion efficiencies on organic solar cells with operational lifetimes of 20 years on barrier-coated plastic or metal foil substrates, and to demonstrate roll-to-roll &#8220;printing&#8221; of solar cells on plastic or metal foil substrates. 

&#160; 

OPV&#8217;s form factor flexibility offers the potential for solutions in various tints and transparencies, offering a unique solution well-suited for BIPV applications, including facades, curtain walls, skylights, and windows. Our discussions with architects emphasize a need for BIPV solutions offering design flexibility and high quality aesthetics. Furthermore, OPV also offers the potential for very low costs due to its low material usage and suitability for roll-to-roll processing. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

As a result of its sponsored research programs, NanoFlex currently holds the exclusive commercialization rights to more than 540 issued and pending patents worldwide which cover architecture, processes and materials for OPV and GaAs technologies. As of January 31, 2016, U.S. issuances and applications were as follows: 63 issued patents, 43 pending non-provisional applications, 13 pending provisional applications, and 18 Patent Cooperation Treaty (&#8220;PCT&#8221;) applications. For regions outside of the U.S.: 141 issued patents, and 263 pending patent applications. While each patent is issued in the name of the respective university that developed the subject technology, NanoFlex has exclusive commercial license rights to all of the patents and their attendant technologies and the patents are referred to herein as being NanoFlex&#8217;s patents. 

&#160; 

The patent applications being filed as a result of NanoFlex&#8217;s sponsored research programs are part of a dynamic, comprehensive development strategy to protect NanoFlex&#8217;s commercialization rights. Following this developmental strategy, current work builds off of earlier work, with new discoveries continually developed and protected. Additionally, as we progress with product development and commercialization, we also have focused on optimizing the patent portfolio, reducing unnecessary or redundant costs while still protecting critical technologies. The patent numbers presented exclude issued and pending patents that the Company has identified for abandonment under this criterion. 

&#160; 

Patent lifetimes typically run twenty years from a patent application&#8217;s effective filing date, not from when the patent was granted. There is a huge backlog in patent offices around the world, and as a result the processing time from application filing to the grant of the patent generally takes 3-5 years, and sometimes longer. In the following table, both the lower number of entries related to the patents with 15-20 years of remaining life and the much higher number of entries related to the patents with 10-15 years of remaining life reflect the lengthy processing time currently needed to obtain a patent. Simply put, waiting 3-5 years after filing to obtain a patent is a rather common occurrence. 

&#160; 

For U.S. Patents (as of January 31, 2016): 

&#160; 

8/63 of issued patents have 0-5 years remaining; 

27/63 of issued patents have 5-10 years remaining; 

19/63 of issued patents have 10-15 years remaining; and 

9/63 of issued patents have 15-20 years remaining. 

&#160; 

For Foreign Patents (as of January 31, 2016): 

&#160; 

7/141 of issued patents have 0-5 years remaining; 

57/141 of issued patents have 5-10 years remaining; 

62/141 of issued patents have 10-15 years remaining; and 

15/141 of issued patents have 15-20 years remaining. 

&#160; 

In addition, the Company has numerous patent applications in process. Some of the Company&#8217;s technology holdings include foundational concepts in the following areas.

&#160; &#9679; Accelerated and recyclable liftoff process. Our research partners have invented and patented manufacturing processes and materials that allow current manufacturers of GaAs solar cells to reduce their existing fabrication costs, because the process preserves the integrity of the parent substrate which can be re-used without chemo-mechanical polishing. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Cold-weld bonding of inorganic solar cells to plastic substrates and metal foils. This cold-weld bonding process enables the direct bonding of active solar material to a thin plastic or metal substrate without using adhesive. This creates thin-film cells that are lighter weight and highly flexible. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Micro-inverters monolithically integrated into GaAs solar cells during production. Integrating micro-inverters into the solar cell has the potential to greatly reduce the total cost of a photovoltaic system. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Low cost thermos-formed plastic mini-compound parabolic concentrator arrays. This allows a fraction of the GaAs solar cell material while collecting an equivalent amount of energy over the course of a sun arc. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Integrated tracking technology. Lattice-like solar cells, with a design inspired by Kirigami, that can stretch like an accordion, allowing them to tilt along the sun&#8217;s trajectory and capture up to 36% more energy than flat cells. &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Organic Photovoltaics: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Multi-junction organic solar cell. Individual conventional solar cells have limited spectral coverage, voltage output, and tradeoff between absorption length and charge collection length. By stacking multiple solar cells with complementary absorption profiles, voltages of the cells can be added (at a constant current). This can make a more efficient cell. The researchers at Michigan have achieved 12.6% power conversion efficiency in the lab. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Fullerene acceptors. Fullerenes include molecules such as C 60 , C 70 , C 84 and derivatives that are designed to dissolve in solvents and are the most prevalent acceptor in organic photovoltaics. Fullerenes offer better efficiency than any other acceptor molecule implemented to date. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Blocking layers. In most solar cell designs, excitons must be blocked and reflected away from the metallic (or transparent) contact so that they can be dissociated at the donor-acceptor junction. Additionally, it is desired that these layers block the wrong carrier from contacting the electrode. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; New materials for visible and infrared sensitivity. Current OPV materials absorb light in the visible and deep red part of the solar spectrum, but do not collect light in the near infrared (NIR). Extending efficient light collection into the NIR has the potential to increase photocurrent generation by 40%, markedly improving OPV performance. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Scalable growth technologies. A number of growth technologies have been developed for organic materials. These include vacuum thermal evaporation and organic vapor phase deposition for materials that can be sublimed or evaporated directly and gravure or ink-jet printing of dissolved materials. All of these processes are compatible with rigid planar substrates, but more importantly can be applied to flexible plastic or metal foil substrates, for roll-to-roll fabrication of OPVs. &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Inverted solar cells. One of the most air sensitive parts of the OPV is the region between the anode and electron acceptor. This region is degraded by oxygen and water in the dark and even more so under illumination. This interfacial region in a &#8220;conventional&#8221; OPV is exposed to the atmosphere directly, requiring that the OPV be kept in a hermetic package. If the OPV is prepared as an inverted cell, the air sensitive anode/organic interfacial region is placed below the donor, buffer layer and cathode. Thus, the device itself provides a level of &#8220;packaging,&#8221; markedly slowing environmental degradation of the device, minimizing packaging requirements for long term deployment in the field. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Materials for enhanced light collection via multi-exciton generation. The Shockley-Queisser limit for solar cell efficiency is 29% for silicon based cells and 31% for cells made with GaAs. In order to prepare solar cells with efficiencies higher than the Shockley-Queisser, researchers have turned to multi-junction cells, however, these cells are very expensive. An alternate approach is to collect the high energy part of the spectrum, i.e. UV-to-green, and double the energy collected from this part of the solar spectrum using singlet fission (&#8220;SF&#8221;). SF materials absorb high energy light and generate two excitons for every photon absorbed, thus doubling the light collection efficiency. The SF approach has the potential to give a single solar cell a 45% efficiency, well over the Shockley-Queisser limit, without increasing the cost to produce the cell. &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Mixed layer and nanocrystalline cells. In planar (e.g., bilayer) cells, the thickness of a layer is limited by the distance an exciton is expected to travel before it recombines. If the layer is too thick, photons absorbed may never result in collected charge. If the layers are too thin, there is insufficient material available for absorption of the light. By mixing the donor and acceptor throughout a thicker layer, an additional donor-acceptor interface is created throughout the layer, improving photocurrent generation capability. Nanocrystalline cells have a higher degree of phase separation between the donor and acceptor with nanocrystalline domains, with high purity and domain sizes in the nanometer scale. &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Solar films and coatings. OPV technology enables materials to be deposited onto virtually any substrate (needs to be smooth, but not flat). The idea is to create solar coatings or films that can be applied quickly and easily to any surface, including, for example, mobile communications devices, electric cars, roofing materials, building siding and glass). &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Transparent/semi-transparent cells. In certain applications it may be desirable to have a partially transparent solar cell. These applications include tinted windows. Instead of just absorbing or reflecting the light, the light would be absorbed and converted into energy. The unique nature of organics allows the Company to tune the wavelengths absorbed to those that it does not want transmitted or that are not useful for vision, such as in the infrared region of the spectrum &#160; 

Development Goals 

&#160; 

If necessary capital is available to it, of which there can be no assurance, NanoFlex plans to accelerate the commercialization of its GaAs technology during 2016 as set forth below. Our research and development efforts are projected to consist of a continuation of work by our university researchers along with collaborative research and development with industry partners, including existing GaAs solar cell manufacturers. We have begun staffing our engineering team to support the transfer of technologies from University laboratories to implementation in industry partners&#8217; commercial product designs and fabrication processes. To this end, on August 26, 2015, the Company signed a JDA with SolAero Technologies Corp. (&#34;SolAero&#34;). The JDA provides for the joint development of GaAs solar cells utilizing our proprietary manufacturing processes in conjunction with SolAero's advanced high efficiency solar cell technologies. 

&#160; 

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

In addition to our researchers and manufacturing partners, we plan to work with key stakeholders along the supply chain to assist with requirements definition and help prioritize technology development efforts. For mobile field generation applications, we plan to work closely with the military which is eager for mobile power solutions to reduce demand for diesel fuel at forward operating locations, which is expensive and logistically challenging. For targeted BAPV and BIPV applications, we plan to work with system integrators, installers, and architects. Additionally, we are working with our University researchers as well as industry partners to submit proposals for government programs to advance our technology development. 

&#160; 

Our primary technical objective for GaAs is to demonstrate the efficacy of our technologies. We plan to demonstrate ND-ELO technology on GaAs wafers of increasing diameter and on GaAs solar cells of increasing complexity. NanoFlex plans to integrate mini-concentrators within the ND-ELO and cold-weld-bonded cells to effect further cost reductions. 

&#160; 

With respect to its OPV technology, NanoFlex plans to continue its sponsored research activities at the universities. We also plan to work with system integrators, installers, and architects to assist with requirements definition and technology development for targeted applications. Additionally, we are working with our University researchers as well as industry partners to submit proposals for government programs to advance our technology development. 

&#160; 

NanoFlex plans to achieve greater than 15% power conversion efficiencies on organic solar cells with operational lifetimes of 20 years on barrier-coated plastic or metal foil substrates, and to demonstrate roll-to-roll &#8220;printing&#8221; of solar cells on plastic or metal foil substrates. 

&#160; 

Overall Operating Plan 

&#160; 

We have made contact with major solar cell and electronics manufacturers world-wide and are finding commercial interest in both our GaAs and OPV technologies. We are seeking to work closely with those companies interested in our technology solutions to develop proof-of-concept prototypes and processes to mitigate commercialization risks and gain early market entry and acceptance. 

&#160; 

A key to reducing the risk to market entry of our GaAs technologies by our partners is for us to demonstrate our technologies on their product designs and fabrication processes. To support this joint development, NanoFlex must establish its own developmental engineering team if we are available to raise the necessary capital. This team would serve several key functions, including working closely between the universities and our industry partners to integrate and customize our processes and technologies into the partner&#8217;s existing product designs and fabrication process. Our engineering team would also work closely with downstream partners such as military users for mobile field applications and system integrators, installers, and architects for BAPV and BIPV applications to better understand requirements and incorporate these requirements into our research and development cycle. 

&#160; 

To support this work, NanoFlex&#8217;s engineering team is able to utilize the facility and equipment onsite at the University of Michigan on a recharge basis, which will be cost effective in moving the technologies toward commercialization. This can allow our engineering team to work directly with industry players to acquire early licenses to use our intellectual property without the need for any immediate standalone technology facility. 

&#160; 

Additionally, having an established technical team can enable us to more effectively pursue and execute sponsored research projects from the DoD, the DOE, and NASA, each of which has interests in businesses that can deliver ultra-lightweight, high-efficiency technologies for demanding applications. 

&#160; 

A second potential revenue source is in JDAs with existing GaAs solar cell manufacturers. Once we are able to initially demonstrate the efficacy of our GaAs processes and technologies on partner&#8217;s fabrication process, we expect to be in a position where we can sign licenses covering further joint development, IP licensing, and solar cell supply. We anticipate that partnerships with one or more of the existing GaAs solar cell manufacturers can be supported by the developmental engineering team, and result in early revenue opportunities, as with our initial partner, SolAero. 

&#160; 

Near Term Operating Plan 

&#160; 

Our near-term focus is on concentrating our efforts on advancing our development efforts while containing costs. The company requires approximately $6 million to $8 million to continue its operations over the next twelve months to support its research, development, and commercialization activities, fund patent application and prosecution, service outstanding liabilities, and support its corporate functions. Our operating plan over the next twelve months is comprised of the following: 

&#160; 

&#160; 1. Cost cutting and containment to reduce our annual burn rate; &#160; 

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 2. Prioritizing our existing IP based on our technology development strategy to identify opportunities for cost reduction; &#160; 

&#160; 3. Closely aligning our research and development activities with near-term commercialization opportunities; &#160; 

&#160; 4. Partnering with strategic partners for licensing and/or joint development of our technologies; and &#160; 

&#160; 5. Raising adequate capital (approximately $6 million to $8 million) to support our activities for at least 12 months. &#160; 

In the event that we raise less than the required amount of capital, our focus will be on prioritizing our GaAs commercialization effort to capture near-term revenue opportunities and limiting spending on general and administrative expenses and patent costs. 

&#160; 

There can be no assurance that our near term operating plan will be successful or that we will be able to fulfill it as it is largely dependent on raising capital and there can be no assurance that capital can be raised. 

&#160; 

Market Opportunity 

&#160; 

There are several key trends that we believe are reshaping the future of the global energy mix, including continued rapid growth in the use of solar technologies, a retreat from nuclear power in some countries, and the emergence of unconventional natural gas production, according to the International Energy Agency&#8217;s (the &#8220;IEA&#8221;) World Energy Outlook 2013. These trends are driving a pronounced shift away from oil, coal, and nuclear towards renewables and natural gas. 

&#160; 

Expansion of solar generation worldwide is a necessary component of any serious strategy to mitigate climate change, according to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (&#8220;MIT&#8221;) Energy Initiative. In recent years, solar costs have fallen substantially and installed capacity has grown very rapidly. Nonetheless, solar energy currently accounts for only about 1% of global electricity generation (MIT Energy Initiative, &#8220;The Future of Solar Power,&#8221; 2015). 

&#160; 

Solar PV installations have experienced rapid growth over the past several years. According to IHS Technology, global solar installations reached 59 GW in 2015, a 35% increase over 2014, while growth in 2016 is expected to increase a further 17% to 69 GW (www.pv-tech.org; &#8220;IHS Forecasts Global Solar Market to Top 69 GW in 2016,&#8221; February 29, 2016). 

&#160; 

The dominant PV technology, used in approximately 90% of installations, is wafer-based crystalline silicon, with thin-film technologies accounting for approximately 10% of the PV market, according to the MIT Energy Initiative. However, current c-Si technologies have inherent technical limitations, including high processing complexity and low intrinsic light absorption, which requires a thick silicon wafer, resulting in rigidity and heavy weight, according to the MIT Energy Initiative. We believe these form factor constraints largely limit the addressable market for crystalline silicon-based to rooftop and utility-scale installations. 

&#160; 

NanoFlex plans to initially focus its GaAs technologies on applications that are not well-served by crystalline silicon-based solar panels and are suited for high power, thin film solar solutions. These markets include aerospace (space vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles), mobile and field generation, and building integrated photovoltaics (&#8220;BIPV&#8221;) and building applied photovoltaics (&#8220;BAPV&#8221;), where high efficiency GaAs thin films can be applied to multi-story rooftops as well as building facades. Likewise, the Company will focus its OPV technologies on BIPV solutions where its highly flexible form factor and semi-transparency add value, such as glazing applications, including skylights, curtain walls, facades, and windows. 

&#160; 

Global BIPV installations were 1.6 GW in 2014 and are projected to increase to 2.6 GW in 2019, according to BCC Research (BCC Research, &#8220;Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV): Technologies and Global Markets,&#8221; January 2015). We expect adoption of BIPV solutions will be driven in part by Net Zero Energy Building (&#8220;NZEB&#8221;) regulations, which require buildings to produce as much energy as it uses over the course of a year. NZEB goals are achieved through a combination of energy efficiency measures and onsite renewable energy generation. The California Public Utilities Commission (&#8220;CPUC&#8221;) has set several NZEB goals, including targeting all new residential construction and all new commercial construction within the State to be net zero energy by 2020 and 2030, respectively and 50% of existing buildings will be retrofit to NZEB by 2030 (California Public Utilities Commission, &#8220;CPUC/IOU Zero Net Energy Building Activities: Setting the Stage,&#8221; May 18, 2015). 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

NanoFlex is focused on developing commercializing and licensing advanced solar technologies that will enable entry of solar PV into new applications and also eventually compete with established solar technologies in traditional solar markets. As a technology licensor, we believe our competitive exposure is somewhat insulated from industry dynamics, because we aim to partner with key industry participants and license our technology. Additionally, our licensing business model does not require us to directly establish high-volume manufacturing, which is a key competitive factor for product-based companies. 

&#160;

&#160; 12 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

The solar photovoltaic sector is highly competitive, characterized by intense price competition among commercialized technologies and aggressive investment in emerging technologies as companies attempt to compete within the solar markets as well as within the overall electric power industry. The current solar market is dominated by crystalline silicon (&#8220;c-Si&#8221;) technology, with some penetration by Cadmium Telluride (&#8220;CdTe&#8221;) and Copper Indium Gallium Selenide (&#8220;CIGS&#8221;) thin film technologies, according to SolarBuzz (www.solarbuzz.com). Crystalline silicon solar cells are produced at massive scale and have established a low-cost position within the rooftop and utility-scale photovoltaics markets. Advanced solar technology development efforts encompass various multiple technology platforms at various stages of development. 

&#160; 

We believe our technologies will compete with established technologies as well as advanced technologies under development by other organizations primarily on a basis of cost and performance, which is typically measured as cost per watt, largely a function of production costs and power conversion efficiency. Within emerging applications, we anticipate our technologies will compete primarily with advanced technologies on a basis of cost and performance, and also functionality and aesthetics as we attempt to open new markets to solar power. Additionally, we believe that we will compete with other research and development organizations for funding from government agencies, laboratories, research institutions, and universities. Some of our existing or future competitors may be part of larger corporations that have greater financial resources than we do and, as a result, may be better positioned to adapt to changes in the industry or the economy as a whole. 

&#160; 

GaAs solar technologies have been limited to specialty, niche applications due to their high costs; although numerous research efforts are focused on reducing manufacturing costs. Within the GaAs solar sector, there are a small number of manufacturers, including Spectrolab, a subsidiary of Boeing; SolAero Technologies, Azur Space (Germany), MicroLink Devices, and Alta Devices (acquired by Hanergy Thin Film). Spectrolab, SolAero, and Azur produce commercial GaAs solar cells for highly specialized applications such as military and space-borne systems, which are inelastic to the high prices associated with the technology. Some of these companies are attempting to reduce manufacturing costs to enable entry of GaAs-based solar technologies into commercial terrestrial markets. We believe NanoFlex&#8217;s patented GaAs ND-ELO&#8482; and mini-concentration technologies present the opportunity to significantly reduce the cost for GaAs solutions and believe that we could potentially license our technology to these companies. 

&#160; 

OPV technologies remain in the development stage, with numerous activities ongoing among government laboratories, universities, and private enterprises. Currently, we are not aware of any commercialized OPV technologies, but we believe there are a limited number of developers planning introduction within the next several years. 

&#160; 

Ongoing research and development on OPV materials and devices are currently being performed by Heliatek (Dresden, Germany), Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corporation, LG Chemical, and BELECTRIC OPV (Kolitzheim, Germany), Solvay (Brussels, Belgium; acquired Plextronics), Polyera (Skokie, Illinois), and Solarmer Energy (El Monte, California), among others. Research institutions may also become our competitors, such as University of California, Los Angeles, University of California, Berkley, Fraunhofer-Institut fur Solare Energiesysteme (ISE), Empa, a Swiss federal laboratory for materials science and technology. We believe NanoFlex&#8217;s exclusive Intellectual Property, rights surrounding technologies for small molecule OPVs present a formidable obstacle for those wishing to compete with us and present opportunities for potential partnerships. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

Currently, the Company employees consist of four full-time personnel &#8211; our Chief Executive Officer; Chief Financial Officer; Executive Vice President, Secretary and Treasurer; and Senior Process Engineer. Our Chief Technology Officer works on a part-time basis as a consultant. Depending on the availability of capital, the Company plans to expand its engineering team, hiring process and product engineers to facilitate technology transfer and commercialization. The Company&#8217;s engineering team is augmented by numerous post-doctoral fellows and PhD candidates that are employed in our sponsored university research programs at USC and Michigan.
