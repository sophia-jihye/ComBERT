Unless specified otherwise, as used in this Form 10-K, &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;Track Group&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221; refer to Track Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

&#160; 

Business Strategy 

&#160; 

The Company is committed to increasing public safety by helping its customers improve offender rehabilitation and re-socialization outcomes through its innovative hardware, software and services. &#160; The Company treats its business as a service business. Although they still manufacture patented tracking technology, they see the physical goods as only a small part of the integrated offender monitoring solutions they provide. So, rather than receiving a stream of ongoing revenue just for a piece of manufactured equipment, the Company is now receiving a steady stream of revenue for ongoing device agnostic subscription contracts that help make the administration of justice better, faster, and less expensive for taxpayers. As part of its strategy, the Company continues to expand its device-agnostic platform to not only collect, but store, analyze, assess and correlate location data for reasons of both accountability and auditing as well as to use for predictive analytics and assessment of effective and emerging techniques in criminal behavior and rehabilitation. The Company believes a high-quality customer experience with knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the Company&#8217;s products and services greatly enhances its ability to attract and retain customers. Therefore, the Company&#8217;s strategy also includes building and expanding its own direct sales force and its third-party distribution network to effectively reach more customers and provide them with a world-class sales and post-sales support experience. The Company believes continual investment in research and development (&#8220; R&#38;D &#8221;), marketing and branding is critical to the development and sale of innovative technologies and integrated solutions.

Conrent Loan Agreement 

On May 1, 2016 we entered into an unsecured Loan Agreement with Conrent Invest S.A., acting with respect to its Compartment Safety III (the "Conrent Loan Agreement") . Under the Conrent Loan Agreement, the Company can borrow $5.0 million for working capital, repayment of debt, and operating purposes. The Conrent Loan Agreement contains a condition precedent, which provides that the lender is not obligated to fund the loan until it has received total proceeds of $5.0 million from the sale of fixed rate notes, which are to be issued by the lender through its Compartment Safety III. As of September 30, 2016 this condition precedent has not been satisfied. When funded, the loan will bear interest at a rate of 8% per annum, payable in arrears semi-annually, with all principal and accrued unpaid interest due on July 31, 2018. In addition, the Company anticipates paying the lender an arrangement fee of $112,500 when it receives proceeds from this loan.

&#160; 

Product Support and Services 

&#160; 

Monitoring Center 

The Company&#8217;s monitoring center provides live 24/7/365 monitoring of all alarms generated from our devices, as well as customer and technical support. Our monitoring center operators play a vital role, and as such, we staff our centers with highly trained, bi-lingual individuals. These operators act as an extension of agency resources receiving alarms, communicating and intervening with offenders regarding violations, and interacting with supervision staff, all pursuant to agency-established protocols. The facilities have redundant power source, battery backup and triple redundancy in voice, data, and IP. The Company has established monitoring centers in Salt Lake City, Utah USA, and Santiago, Chile, SA. In addition the Company has assisted in the establishment of monitoring centers for customers and local partners in the Bahamas and in Puerto Rico. 

&#160; 

Customer Care 

The Company offers a range of support options for its customers. These include assistance that is built into software products, printed and electronic product manuals, online support including comprehensive product information as well as technical assistance. 

&#160; 

Research and Development Program 

&#160; 

During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, we incurred research and development expense of $2,627,228 compared to those costs recognized during fiscal year 2015 totaling $1,562,566. The $1,064,622 increase in research and development cost reflects costs to (i) streamline our device hardware, therefore expediting manufacturing time, and (ii) enhance both the firmware and software of our devices to improve the overall user experience. As a result of these improvements, $1,949,813 was capitalized as developed technology during the twelve months ended September 30, 2016. A portion of these expenses would have been recognized as research and development expense, absent the software enhancements. 

Competition 

The markets for the Company&#8217;s products and services are highly competitive and the Company is confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of its business. These markets are characterized by frequent product introductions and technological advances. The Company&#8217;s competitors who sell tracking devices have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins to gain or maintain market share. The Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results can be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide downward pressures on gross margins. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product features, relative price/performance, product quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong software ecosystem, service and support and corporate reputation. 

&#160; 

The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to offender monitoring. These markets are highly competitive and include many large, well-funded and experienced participants. The Company expects competition in these markets to intensify significantly as competitors attempt to imitate some of the features of the Company&#8217;s products and applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with third-party providers to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. These markets are characterized by aggressive pricing practices, frequent product introductions, evolving design approaches and technologies, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of customers. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Table of Contents 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s future financial condition and operating results depend on the Company&#8217;s ability to continue to win large contracts and develop and offer new innovative products and services in the markets in which it competes. The Company believes it offers superior innovation and integration of the entire offender monitoring solution including the hardware (ReliAlert and Shadow), software (TrackerPAL), and applications (Analytics, Domestic Violence, and Alcohol). Some of the Company&#8217;s current and potential competitors have substantial resources and may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss to compete with the Company&#8217;s offerings.

Dependence on Major Suppliers 

We purchase cellular services from several suppliers. The cost to us for these services during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $790,829 and $718,333, respectively. The 10% increase in cellular service expense in 2016 compared to 2015 resulted from increased costs associated with higher revenue and resulting cost of sales. 

During the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we also purchased a significant portion of our inventory and monitoring equipment from certain suppliers. The cost of these purchases was $1,488,515 and $1,095,903, respectively. The 36% increase was due to higher demand for products purchased from these suppliers. 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

The Company currently holds rights to patents and copyrights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software and services. The Company has registered or has applied for trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and a number of foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such patents, copyrights, trademarks and service marks is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on the ownership thereof, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Table of Contents 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The Company regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development and design, and is currently pursuing thousands of patent applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued patents around the world. The Company holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services. No single patent or copyright is solely responsible for protecting the Company&#8217;s products. The Company believes the duration of its patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products. 

&#160; 

Many of the Company&#8217;s products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all. Because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company competes, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible that certain components of the Company&#8217;s products, processes and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. &#160; 

Trademarks. We have developed and use trademarks in our business, particularly relating to our corporate and product names. We own 11 trademarks that are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, plus one trademark registered in Mexico and one in Canada. In addition, we have one trademark registered in Europe. 

We will file additional applications for the registration of our trademarks in foreign jurisdictions as our business expands under current and planned distribution arrangements. Protection of registered trademarks in some jurisdictions may not be as extensive as the protection provided by registration in the United States.

Trade Secrets . We own certain intellectual property, including trade secrets that we seek to protect, in part, through confidentiality agreements with employees and other parties. Even where these agreements exist, there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by competitors. 

&#160; 

We intend to protect our legal rights concerning intellectual property by all appropriate legal action. Consequently, we may become involved from time to time in litigation to determine the enforceability, scope, and validity of any of the foregoing proprietary rights. Any patent litigation could result in substantial cost and divert the efforts of management and technical personnel. 

Seasonality 

Given the consistency in recurring domestic monitoring revenues by customers throughout 2016, we detected no apparent seasonality in our business. However, as in previous years, incremental domestic device deployment opportunities typically slow down in the months of July and August. We believe this is due to the unavailability of judicial and corrections officials who observe a traditional vacation season during this period. 

Employees 

As of November 25, 2016, we had 223 full-time employees and 10 part-time employees. None of the employees are represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We have never experienced a work stoppage and management believes that relations with employees are good. 

Additional Available Information 

We make available, free of charge, at our corporate website copies of our annual reports filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220; SEC &#8221;) on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements, and all amendments to these reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. We also provide copies of our Forms 8-K, 10-K, 10-Q, and proxy statements at no charge to investors upon request. 

All reports filed by us with the SEC are available free of charge via EDGAR through the SEC website at www.sec.gov. In addition, the public may read and copy materials we have filed with the SEC at the SEC's public reference room located at 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549.
