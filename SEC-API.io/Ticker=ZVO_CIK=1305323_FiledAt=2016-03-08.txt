BUSINESS 

Overview 

We are a provider of postsecondary education services. We believe that our academic institutions, Ashford University &#174; &#32;and University of the Rockies SM , embody the contemporary college experience. Our institutions deliver programs primarily online. Our institutions had a total of 49,159 &#32;students enrolled as of December 31, 2015 . 

Our institutions' online delivery models, weekly start dates, commitment to affordability and transferability of credits make their programs highly accessible. Our institutions' online platform has been designed to deliver a quality educational experience while offering the flexibility and convenience that many students require, particularly working adults. Our institutions are committed to providing a high-quality educational experience to their students. Our institutions have a comprehensive curriculum development process and employ qualified faculty members with significant academic and practitioner credentials. Our institutions conduct ongoing faculty and student assessment processes and provide a broad array of student services. 

We are also focused on developing innovative new technologies to improve the way students learn, such as Constellation &#8482; , our proprietary learning platform, and the mobile learning applications offered by our institutions. 

Ashford University. In March 2005, we acquired The Franciscan University of the Prairies, located in Iowa, and renamed it Ashford University. The mission of Ashford University is to provide accessible, affordable, innovative, high-quality learning opportunities and degree programs that meet the diverse needs of individuals pursuing integrity in their lives, professions and communities. We believe Ashford University is helping to define the modern college experience by providing the flexibility and effectiveness of online learning. The institution offers associate's, bachelor's and master's degree programs online, as well as bachelor's degree programs at its campus in Clinton, Iowa. Ashford University is comprised of four colleges: the Forbes &#8482; &#32;School of Business, the College of Education, the College of Health, Human Services and Sciences, and the College of Liberal Arts. 

In July 2015, the Ashford University Board of Trustees made the decision to close the Clinton Campus after the 2015-2016 academic year, following the implementation of a one-year teach-out plan. On December 22, 2015, the Company entered into a Purchase Agreement and Escrow Instructions with Clinton Catalyst, LLC (&#8220;Catalyst&#8221;) pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell the Clinton Campus to Catalyst for $1.6 million. Simultaneously with the closing of the sale on December 29, 2015, the Company entered into a Lease Agreement with Catalyst pursuant to which the Company is leasing the Clinton Campus from Catalyst through December 31, 2016 at $12,500 per month plus standard operating expenses. 

Ashford University is accredited by WASC Senior College and University Commission (&#8220;WSCUC&#8221;). For additional information regarding accreditation, see &#8220;Regulation &#8212; Accreditation&#8221; below. Ashford University also maintains a website at www.ashford.edu, the contents of which are not incorporated by reference into, or in any way a part of, this report. 

University of the Rockies . In September 2007, we acquired the Colorado School of Professional Psychology, located in Colorado, and renamed it University of the Rockies. The mission of University of the Rockies is to provide high-quality, accessible learning opportunities globally for diverse groups of individuals seeking preparation for life goals, professional practice, service and distinguished leadership. University of the Rockies is a graduate institution that offers master's and doctoral degree programs in the social and behavioral sciences. Classes at University of the Rockies are presented in a progressive online format, as well as at its campus in Denver, Colorado. The majority of students at University of the Rockies attend via the institution's accessible online platform, which is also available through our mobile applications. 

University of the Rockies is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission (&#8220;HLC&#8221;). For additional information regarding accreditation, see &#8220;Regulation &#8212; Accreditation&#8221; below. University of the Rockies also maintains a website at www.rockies.edu, the contents of which are not incorporated by reference into, or in any way a part of, this report. 

Innovation and new technologies . &#32; Central to our ideal of enabling learning anytime, anywhere is the commitment to provide learning platforms and resources that make accessible learning a reality. These innovations include Constellation, Waypoint Outcomes and our mobile application technology. 

Constellation is an innovative suite of interactive educational materials that increases both the educational quality and affordability of education for online students at Ashford University. We developed Constellation to replace third-party textbooks with digital course materials, and in doing so, we were able to decrease the costs to the student and increase student accessibility and learning. Constellation materials are displayed in a proprietary, browser-based platform developed and owned by the Company. Constellation provides mobile access to students over the Internet as well as on a variety of devices, including web-enabled smartphones and tablet devices. 

Waypoint Outcomes provides learning and assessment software to our institutions. The software combines classic rubric grading scales with easy, efficient technology to help educators teach writing, critical thinking and cognitive skills. Its sophisticated grading palette frees teachers to focus on meaningful, personalized feedback for students by automating repetitive tasks. 

Ashford University also utilizes mobile application technology that empowers students and faculty to connect to their learning environment via their web-enabled smartphones and tablet devices. These innovations have garnered significant interest within the academic community and have led to invitations for our personnel to speak at various academic conferences.

* Includes students who are taking one or more courses with our institutions, but have not declared that they are pursuing a specific degree. 

We define period-end enrollment as the number of active students on the last day of the financial reporting period. A student is considered active if the student has attended a class within the prior 15 days or is on an institutionally-approved break not to exceed 45 days, unless the student has graduated or provided notice of withdrawal. 

As of December 31, 2015 , 69% of our institutions' online students were female, 54% identified themselves as minorities and the average age of online students was 36. Our institutions have online students throughout the United States, as well as students from 37 different countries. 

Graduation 

As of December 31, 2015 , more than 93,200 students have graduated &#32; from our combined institutions. Total credits required to obtain a degree are consistent for online and campus-based programs: an associate's degree requires a minimum of 64 credits; a bachelor's degree requires a minimum of 120 credits; a master's degree typically requires a minimum of 30 additional credits; and a doctoral degree at University of the Rockies requires a minimum of 62 additional credits. 

Many students have previously completed some postsecondary education and have credits they would like to transfer to a new degree program. Because we believe students should receive credit for their prior work, our institutions have worked closely with their accrediting agencies to obtain the right to accept a high level of transfer credits. 

Tuition and Fees 

Our institutions generally structure the tuition and fees for programs to be below Title IV loan limits and average grant awards, affording students who do not otherwise have the financial means to pursue an education the ability to gain access to our institutions' programs. We recognize that private loans are increasingly difficult to obtain, which can prevent academically qualified students from pursuing an education at institutions with higher tuition and fees. We believe that helping to remove the financial burden of obtaining incremental private loans while pursuing a postsecondary education not only permits more students to access our institutions' programs, but also enables students to focus more on their coursework and on program completion while in school. 

The price of our institutions' courses varies based upon the number of credits per course (with most courses representing three credits), the degree level of the program and the discipline. For the 2015-2016 academic year (which began on July 1, 2015), the price per credit is $430 for undergraduate online courses and ranges from $560 to $1,082 for graduate online courses. Based on these per credit prices, the prices for a three-credit course are $1,290 for undergraduate online courses and range from $1,680 to $3,246 for graduate online courses. We anticipate a tuition increase of approximately 3.0% for undergraduate online students at Ashford University for courses beginning on April 1, 2016. 

Revenue realized from tuition is reduced by the amount of scholarships awarded to students. For the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013, we recorded institutional scholarships of $102.2 million, $105.1 million and $113.5 million, respectively, to students of our institutions. 

Student Financing 

Students finance their education at our institutions through a combination of financing options as described below. 

Title IV programs 

If a student attends any institution certified as Title IV eligible by the U.S. Department of Education (the &#8220;Department&#8221;) and meets applicable student eligibility standards, that student may receive grants or loans to help fund their education under programs authorized by Title IV of the Higher Education Act (&#8220;Title IV&#8221;). An institution participating in federal student financial aid programs authorized by Title IV (&#8220;Title IV programs&#8221;) must ensure that all program funds are accounted for and disbursed properly. To continue receiving program funds, students must demonstrate satisfactory academic progress toward the completion of their program of study. 

In the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013, Ashford University derived 80.9% , 83.4% &#32;and 85.6% &#32;respectively, and University of the Rockies derived 86.6% , 88.3% &#32;and 87.6% , respectively, of their revenues (in each case calculated in accordance with applicable Department regulations) from Title IV program funds. 

Federal Direct Loans . The federal Direct Loan Program consists of two types of loans: Stafford loans, which are either subsidized or unsubsidized, and PLUS loans, which are made available to graduate and professional students, as well as parents of dependent undergraduate students. 

With a Direct Subsidized Loan, the federal government pays the interest on the loan while the student is in school and during grace periods and any approved periods of deferment, until the student's obligation to repay the loan begins. Direct Unsubsidized Loans are not based on financial need and are available to students who do not qualify for a Direct Subsidized Loan, or in some cases, in addition to a Direct Subsidized Loan. Loan funds are paid to our institutions, which in turn credit the student's account for tuition and fees and disburse any amounts in excess of tuition and fees to the student. The Budget Control Act of 2011 provides that for loan periods beginning on or after July 1, 2012, graduate and professional students are no longer eligible to receive Direct Subsidized Loans; however, graduate and professional students remain eligible for Direct Unsubsidized Loans. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2012 temporarily eliminated the interest subsidy provided on Direct Subsidized Loans during the six-month grace periods provided to students who are no longer enrolled on at least a half-time basis, effective for new Direct Subsidized Loans for which the first disbursement was made on or after July 1, 2012 and before July 1, 2014. 

In July 2012, President Obama signed into law the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21 st &#32;Century Act (&#8220;MAP-21&#8221;), which provided a one-year extension of the 3.4% interest rate that applied to Direct Subsidized Loans made to undergraduate students for loans first disbursed on or after July 1, 2012 and before July 1, 2013. MAP-21 limits a first-time borrower&#8217;s eligibility for Direct Subsidized Loans on or after July 1, 2013 to a period not to exceed 150% of the length of the borrower&#8217;s program. MAP-21 also provides that a borrower who reaches the 150% limit on or after July 1, 2013 becomes ineligible for interest subsidy benefits on all Direct Subsidized Loans. 

Under the Direct Stafford Loan Program, a dependent undergraduate student can borrow up to $5,500 for the first academic year, $6,500 for the second academic year and $7,500 for each of the third and fourth academic years. Students classified as independent, and dependent students whose parents have been denied a PLUS loan for undergraduate students, can obtain up to an additional $4,000 for each of the first and second academic years and an additional $5,000 for each of the third and fourth academic years. Students enrolled in graduate programs can borrow up to $20,500 per academic year. 

In August 2013, President Obama signed into law the Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act of 2013, which amended the Direct Loan interest rate section of the Higher Education Act. Under the law, interest rates will be established each year for Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and PLUS loans for which the first disbursement is on or after July 1 of that year through the following June 30. The interest rate, once established, will be fixed and apply for the life of the loan. With respect to loans for which the first disbursement is on or after July 1, 2015 but before July 1, 2016, the interest rates are (i) 4.29% for Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans for undergraduate students, (ii) 5.84% for Direct Unsubsidized Loans for graduate/professional students and (iii) 6.84% for PLUS loans. 

Pell Grant Program . Under the Pell Grant Program, the Department makes grants to undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need. Under the August 2008 reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, students were able to receive Pell Grant funds for attendance on a year-round basis, and could potentially receive more in a given year than the traditionally defined maximum annual amount. However, the U.S. Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act of 2011 permanently repealed the Pell Grant provision that provided an otherwise eligible student with more than one Pell Grant in an award year, effective with the 2011-2012 award year. Beginning with the 2012-2013 award year, a student's eligibility to receive a Pell Grant was reduced from 18 semesters (or its equivalent) to 12 semesters (or its equivalent). The funding for Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations is part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, which was signed into law by President Obama in January 2014 and provided full funding for Pell Grant award year 2014-2015 of $5,730, subject to change annually. The funding amount for Pell Grant award year 2015-2016 increased to $5,775. 

Non-Title IV funding sources 

Other funding sources consist of payments made in cash by individuals, private loans, reimbursement from corporate affiliates, government tuition assistance programs for military personnel, including veterans, and internal loan programs. In the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013, Ashford University derived 19.1% , 16.6% &#32;and 14.4% , respectively, and University of the Rockies derived 13.4% , 11.7% &#32;and 12.4% , respectively, of their respective revenues (in each case calculated in accordance with applicable Department regulations) from these other funding sources. 

Financial aid processing 

Our institutions have engaged Xerox Business Solutions (&#8220;XBS&#8221;) to provide call center and transactional processing services for the online financial aid student populations at our institutions, including services related to disbursement eligibility review and Title IV fund returns. We believe the engagement of XBS centralizes these processing services to improve student financing outcomes, and enhances efforts to comply with Title IV rules and regulations. If the engagement with XBS were terminated, we would need to handle these processing services using our own resources or engage another third-party vendor, if available. 

Curricula and Scheduling 

Our institutions are committed to providing their students with a rigorous and rewarding academic experience that gives them the knowledge and experience necessary to be contributors, educators and leaders in their chosen professions. Our institutions seek to maintain a high level of quality in curriculum, faculty and student support services, all of which contribute to the overall student experience. Curriculum is reviewed annually to ensure that content is refined and updated as necessary. Our institutions provide extensive student support services, including academic, administrative and technology support, to help maximize the success of their students. Additionally, our institutions monitor the success of their educational delivery processes through periodic faculty and student assessments. Our institutions believe their commitment to quality is evident in the satisfaction and demonstrated proficiency of their students, which is measured at the completion of every course. 

As of December 31, 2015 , our institutions offered approximately 1,850 &#32;courses, 80 &#32;degree programs and 150 &#32;specializations. Specialization areas are comprised of a select number of courses within an existing program that supplement that program's required courses. Specialization areas focus on one area of study and may also be offered under the designation of concentration, endorsement or track. Programs and specialization areas are offered through Ashford University's four colleges, the Forbes School of Business, the College of Education, the College of Health, Human Services and Science, and the College of Liberal Arts, and through University of the Rockies' two schools, the School of Organizational Leadership and the School of Professional Psychology. 

Our institutions' online courses are offered with weekly start dates throughout the year, except for two weeks total in late December and early January. Courses typically run five to six weeks and all courses are offered in an asynchronous format so students can complete their coursework as their schedule permits. Online students typically enroll in one course at a time. This focused approach to learning allows the student to engage fully in each course. 

Our institutions' campus-based courses are typically nine or 16 weeks in length and have one start per term, with two to five terms per year. Undergraduate campus-based students can enroll in up to six concurrent courses at a time and typically enroll in at least four courses in a given semester. 

Doctoral students, both online and campus-based, are required to participate in periodic seminars located on campus and compose and defend a dissertation on an approved topic. 

Program Development 

Our institutions design their academic offerings to meet the needs of a broad cross-section of prospective students. In addition to adding programs in high-demand disciplines, our institutions intend to enhance their programs through the addition of more specializations in the future. Specializations are used to create an offering that is tailored to the specific objectives of a student population and, therefore, is more attractive to potential students interested in a particular program. The addition of specializations represents a cost-effective way to both expand our market and further enhance the differentiation of our institutions' programs in that market. Additionally, our institutions intend to expand their portfolio of master's and doctoral degree programs, consistent with our commitment to a quality academic offering, and to pursue increased graduate student enrollments because we believe graduate students represent an attractive segment of the market. 

Our institutions seek to offer programs in disciplines in which there is strong demand for education and significant opportunity for employment. Our institutions' current program portfolio includes offerings at the associate's, bachelor's, master's and doctoral levels in the disciplines of business, education, psychology, social sciences and health sciences. Our institutions follow a defined process for identifying new degree program opportunities that incorporates student, faculty and market feedback, as well as macro trends in the relevant disciplines, in order to evaluate the expected level of demand for a new program prior to developing the content and marketing it to potential students. 

Potential new programs and specializations are determined based on proposals submitted by faculty and staff and an assessment of overall market demand. Our institutions' faculty and academic leadership work in collaboration with our marketing team to research and select new programs that are expected to have strong demand and that can be developed at a reasonable cost. Programs are reviewed by the respective institution and must also receive approval through the normal governance process at the relevant institution. 

Once a program is selected for development, one or more subject matter experts are assigned to work with curriculum development staff to define measurable program-level student learning objectives. Each course in a program is designed to include learning activities that address the program objectives, foster student engagement and assess learning outcomes. All courses undergo extensive internal and external third-party quality assurance reviews before they are offered to students. A new program is reviewed for approval through the appropriate governance processes. Following approval, an online program is conformed to the standards of our online learning management system and our marketing department creates a marketing plan for the program. In most cases, the time frame to identify, develop and internally approve a new program is approximately six months, not including the external regulatory approvals required before a program can be offered to students. 

Assessment 

Each of our institutions have developed and implemented a comprehensive assessment plan focused on student learning and effective instruction. The plans stipulate assessment of learning outcomes at the course, program and institutional levels. Learning outcomes are unique to each institution and demonstrate the skills that graduates should be able to demonstrate upon completion of their respective programs. With the assistance of our dedicated assessment team, our institutions' faculty routinely evaluates and revises courses and learning resources based upon outcomes and institutional research data. Using direct and indirect measurements, student performance is assessed on an ongoing basis to ensure student success. 

We utilize Waypoint Outcomes, our proprietary assessment platform, which is an innovative, web-based assessment system of interactive rubrics, to gather data from specific learning activities. Data results from Waypoint Outcomes are shared with the student and are also accessible by the faculty and program administrators. 

In addition to course and program assessments, faculty instructional performance is continuously assessed by the institutional deans and instructional specialists and by results of student surveys at the completion of each course. The results of 

all of our assessment practices are reviewed by an assessment team, including faculty, and based on their conclusions, recommendations may be made to add to or modify our institutions' programs. 

Branding and Marketing 

We have invested significant resources in developing processes and implementing technologies that allow us to effectively identify, recruit and retain qualified students. We develop and participate in various marketing activities to generate leads for prospective students and to build the Bridgepoint Education, Ashford University and University of the Rockies brands. 

For our institutions' online student population, we align ourselves with working adults, many of whom have already completed some postsecondary courses and are seeking an accessible, affordable education from a quality institution. The admissions policies that require the minimum age of 22 for online students at Ashford University are focused on attracting more mature students with a greater commitment to completing their degrees. 

Our branding campaign utilizes digital channels to communicate the Ashford University message. Additionally, leads are generated from online sources, with the main source of leads being third-party online lead aggregators. We also purchase keywords from search providers to generate online leads directly, rather than acquiring them through aggregators. Additionally, we have a team internally who focuses on generating online leads through search engine optimization techniques. 

Recruiting and Admissions 

Our institutions employ a team structure in their recruiting operations. Each team consists of admissions counselors, financial services advisors and academic advisors. The teams provide a single point of contact and facilitate all aspects of enrollment and integration of a prospective student into a program of study. The team structure promotes internal accountability among employees involved in identifying, recruiting, enrolling and retaining new students. 

All leads are managed through our proprietary customer relations management (&#8220;CRM&#8221;) system, which directs a lead for a prospective student to a recruiting team and assigns an admissions counselor within that team to serve as the primary liaison for that prospective student. Once contact with a prospective student is established, admissions counselors, along with the academic and financial services advisors, begin an assessment process to determine if our institutions' program offerings match the student's needs and objectives. Additionally, admissions counselors communicate other criteria, including expected duration and cost of the programs, to prospective students. Through our proprietary systems, admissions counselors are able to generate a comparison of tuition levels across our competitors in order to help prospective students make more informed decisions. 

Each admissions counselor goes through a comprehensive training program that addresses our institutions' academic offerings, financial aid options and the regulatory environment in which we operate, including the restrictions that regulations impose on the admissions process. We place significant emphasis on regulatory requirements and demand an environment of strict compliance. 

Military and corporate channel relationships are developed and managed by channel development teams. Our military development specialists and corporate liaisons work with representatives in these organizations to demonstrate the quality, impact and value that our institutions' programs can provide to individuals in the organizations, as well as to the organizations themselves. We believe our institutions' educational offerings are attractive to potential students in these markets. Military students may frequently change locations or seek to complete a program intermittently over the course of several years. As of December 31, 2015 , approximately 28.0% &#32;of our institutions' students were affiliated with the military, as either service members or veterans or their spouses. In the corporate channel, we believe employers value our institutions' affordability, which allows employer tuition reimbursements to be used more efficiently. 

The admissions process is designed to offer access to prospective students who seek the benefits of a postsecondary education. Ashford University undergraduate students may qualify in various ways, including by having a high school diploma or a General Educational Development (GED) equivalent. Graduate level students at Ashford University and University of the Rockies are required to have an undergraduate degree from an accredited college and may be required to have a minimum grade point average or meet other criteria to qualify for admission to certain programs. 

Retention 

Once a student enrolls in an online program, the institution provides consistent, ongoing support to assist the student in acclimating to the online environment and to address challenges that arise in order to increase the likelihood that the student will persist through graduation. 

Providing a superior learning experience to every student is a key component in retaining students at our institutions. We feel that our team-based approach to recruitment and the robust student services we provide enhance retention because of each student's interaction with their team and the accountability inherent in the team structure. We also incorporate a systematic approach to contacting students at key milestones during their experience at our institutions, providing encouragement and highlighting their progress. There are frequent personal interactions between academic advisors and students, which we view as a key component to our retention strategy. Additionally, we employ a retention committee that monitors performance metrics and other key data to analyze student retention rates, as well as the causes and potential risks for student drops. Also, our dispute resolution department serves as a neutral third party for students to raise any concerns or complaints. Such concerns and complaints are then elevated to the appropriate department so we may proactively address those issues. 

Ashford University has various initiatives focused on academic quality and student success that we believe help students succeed in their programs, help retain higher quality students and ultimately increase student retention. In the area of academic quality, Ashford University increased the size of its student support team, increased the number of full-time faculty and implemented a smaller class size initiative. In the area of student success, Ashford University has expanded its orientation program, broadened its refund policy, redefined the minimum age for all students, and made the decision to eliminate certain associate programs. 

Ashford University has a free two-week orientation course that is mandatory for all incoming students who have not earned any previous college credits. The orientation is designed to provide students with a complete overview of the online classroom experience, prepare them for success in their courses, and help them self-evaluate their readiness to succeed in an online college setting. The experience provides a realistic, up-front overview of expectations so that students are aware of what is expected of them as they prepare for their studies. Students also gain an understanding of how to access and navigate within the online classroom so they can feel confident when they move to their first course in their respective programs. For students taking the orientation course, successful completion of all orientation activities is a requirement before they can enroll in their first class. 

Ashford University also offers the &#8220;Ashford Promise,&#8221; which allows a student to experience the first three weeks of his or her first class before incurring any financial obligation. At any time during these first three weeks, students who do not demonstrate satisfactory academic progress, or those who simply opt out, will not be admitted as students. These individuals will not be responsible for any tuition or fees, and therefore will not incur any debt. We believe the Ashford Promise initiative helps increase student retention while reducing the financial risk to the student. 

Technology 

We have created a scalable technology system that we believe is secure, reliable and redundant, and permits our institutions' courses and support services to be offered online. 

Online course delivery and management 

We use the eCollege online learning platform provided by Pearson eCollege (&#8220;eCollege&#8221;), a third-party software and services provider, as our online platform. The platform provides an online learning management system and provides for the storage, management and delivery of course content. The platform includes collaborative spaces for student communication and participation with other students and faculty, grade and attendance management for faculty, and assessment capabilities to assist us in maintaining quality. eCollege hosts the software for us in its data center to allow us to efficiently scale the applications to meet the needs of our institutions' student populations. Access to our systems is provided through student portals, an extension of our institutions' respective websites. These portals are dynamic destinations for students to securely access personal information and services and also serve as vehicles for student communications, activities and student support services. 

Internal administration 

Ashford University utilizes a CRM application from Campus Management Corp. for lead management, workflow, analytics, reporting and a complete view of our students. This tool enables Ashford University to view the entire student history from the lead to graduation, individually or in cohorts, and to respond appropriately. University of the Rockies utilizes an internally developed proprietary CRM system for lead management, document management, workflow, analytics and reporting. Both institutions utilize online application portals to accept, integrate and process student applications. 

Both institutions utilize CampusVue, a student information system provided by Campus Management Corp., to manage student data (including grades, attendance, status and financial aid) and to generate periodic management reports. This system interfaces with our online learning management system provided by eCollege. 

Constellation 

Constellation is our proprietary learning platform that takes the best features of traditional textbooks and combines them with the best features of the Internet to create a premium student experience. Constellation gives students access to their digital course materials across platforms without sacrificing time-tested studying tools like highlighting and note taking. Constellation includes customized content geared to our institutions' courses and students, combined with a robust set of features that make course materials engaging and accessible to students of various learning styles and abilities. Constellation is cloud-based and is compatible across operating systems, browsers and mobile technologies. We have developed Constellation-enabled courses primarily in core classes to attempt to reach as many students as possible. We plan to continually expand the features of Constellation in future releases. 

The editorial team for Constellation consists of editors with extensive experience at leading textbook publishing firms. Highly qualified subject matter experts are recruited to author content that addresses course and institutional outcomes. Constellation digital texts are organized around our institutions' accelerated courses. As of December 31, 2015 , we had more than 188 Constellation titles available. 

Mobile application technology 

Each of our institutions offers mobile applications compatible with most web-enabled smartphones and tablet devices in order to increase the accessibility of the student learning experience. The applications enable students to use their mobile device to contact support staff, complete discussion posts and review important information regarding their academic status. We have received positive feedback from students indicating that these mobile applications further their learning experience, and we have incorporated feedback received into the periodic updates to these mobile applications. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , our institutions had approximately 190 full-time faculty members and approximately 3,810 adjunct faculty members. Adjunct faculty members are part-time employees engaged on a course-by-course basis and are compensated based upon a fixed amount per course, which varies among faculty members based on each individual's experience and background. In addition to teaching assignments, adjunct faculty members may also be asked to serve on student committees, such as comprehensive examination and dissertation committees, or assist with course development. 

As of December 31, 2015 , the Company also employed almost 2,960 combined non-faculty staff in the areas of university services, academic advising and academic support, enrollment services, university administration, financial aid, information technology, human resources, corporate accounting, finance and other administrative functions. None of our employees is a party to any collective bargaining or similar agreement with us. 

Competition 

The postsecondary education market is highly fragmented and competitive, with no private or public institution representing a significant market share. Our institutions compete primarily with public and private degree-granting regionally accredited colleges and universities. Many colleges and universities enroll working adults, in addition to traditional 18 to 24 year-old students. In addition, many of those colleges and universities offer a variety of distance education and online initiatives. 

We believe that competitive factors in the postsecondary education market include the reputation of the college or university among students and employers, the number of qualified and experienced faculty, the program costs, the relevant and accredited program offerings, the regulatory approvals, the convenient, flexible and dependable access to programs and classes, the relative marketing and selling effectiveness, the time necessary to earn a degree, and the level of student support services. 

We do expect to encounter increased competition as a result of new entrants to the online education market, including traditional colleges and universities that had not previously offered online education programs. 

Intellectual Property 

We rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, service marks, patents, trade secrets, domain names and agreements with employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property rights. We have trademark and service mark registrations and pending applications for additional registrations in the United States and select foreign jurisdictions. We also own the domain name rights for our institutions, as well as other words and phrases important to our business. In addition, we have applied for domestic and international patents for certain technology developed by us. We also have registered copyrights for exemplary business course materials. In many instances, our institutions' course content is produced by faculty and other content experts under work-for-hire agreements pursuant to which we own the course content in return for a fixed development fee. In certain limited cases, course content is licensed from third parties on a royalty fee basis. 

Environmental Matters 

We believe our facilities are in material compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Compliance with these laws and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position. 

Financial Information about Segments and Geographic Areas 

We operate our business in one reportable segment, and we have no foreign operations or assets located outside of the United States.

REGULATION 

Ashford University and University of the Rockies are accredited institutions of higher education that are subject to extensive regulation by a variety of agencies. These agencies include WSCUC, the agency that accredits Ashford University, and HLC, the agency that accredits University of the Rockies. Accrediting agencies provide an independent assessment of educational quality. Our institutions are also subject to regulation by educational licensing authorities in states where our institutions are physically located or conduct certain operations. We are also subject to regulation by the Department due to our participation in Title IV programs. To participate in Title IV programs, a school must maintain authorization by the state education agency or agencies where it is physically located, be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Department and be certified by the Department as an eligible institution. Institutions that participate in Title IV programs are subject to an extensive set of laws and regulations. The laws, regulations and standards of WSCUC, HLC, the Department and state agencies affect the vast majority of our institutions' operations. 

Accreditation 

Prior to being institutionally accredited by WSCUC in December 2013, Ashford University was accredited by HLC. University of the Rockies has been institutionally accredited since 2003 by HLC. WSCUC and HLC are two of six regional accrediting agencies that accredit colleges and universities in the United States. Most traditional, public and private non-profit, degree-granting colleges and universities are accredited by one of these six agencies. 

Accreditation by WSCUC and HLC is recognized by the Department and by prospective students as a reliable indicator of educational quality. Accreditation is a private, non-governmental process for evaluating the quality of an educational institution and its programs and an institution's effectiveness in carrying out its mission in areas including integrity, student performance, curriculum, educational effectiveness, faculty, physical resources, administrative capability and resources, financial stability and governance. To be recognized by the Department, an accrediting agency, among other things, must adopt specific standards to be maintained by educational institutions, conduct peer-review evaluations of institutions' compliance with those standards, monitor compliance through periodic institutional reporting and the periodic renewal process and publicly designate those institutions that meet the agency's criteria. An accredited institution is subject to periodic review by its accrediting agency to determine whether it continues to meet the performance, integrity, quality and other standards required for accreditation. An institution that is determined not to meet the standards of accreditation may have its accreditation revoked or not renewed. 

Accreditation is important to our institutions as it establishes comprehensive criteria designed to promote educational quality and effectiveness. Accreditation also represents a public acknowledgment by a recognized independent agency of the quality and effectiveness of our institutions and their programs. It also facilitates the transferability of educational credits when students transfer to or apply for graduate school at other regionally accredited colleges and universities. The Department relies on accreditation as an indicator of educational quality and effectiveness in determining an institution's eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, as do certain corporate and government sponsors in connection with tuition reimbursement and other student aid programs. 

We believe that regional accreditation is viewed favorably by certain students when choosing a school, by other schools when evaluating transfer and graduate school applications, and by certain employers when evaluating the credentials of candidates for employment. 

In addition, by approving our institutions' offerings of approved campus-based programs through online delivery modalities and by approving increased transfer credit allowance and prior learning assessments, accreditation supports our mission of serving students by providing innovative online programs and allowing student accessibility through increased transfer of credit for prior traditional and non-traditional education. 

Evaluations and renewals of accreditation 

In 2003, University of the Rockies was granted its initial accreditation from HLC for a period of five years. Its accreditation was then renewed by HLC in 2008 for a period of seven years. In September and October of 2014, HLC conducted a previously scheduled comprehensive evaluation visit at University of the Rockies in order for the University to seek reaffirmation of its accreditation by HLC. On February 3, 2015, University of the Rockies received a letter from HLC stating that the Institutional Actions Council of HLC continued the accreditation of the university, with the next Reaffirmation of Accreditation in 2024-25. 

In July 2013, WSCUC granted Initial Accreditation to Ashford University for five years, until July 15, 2018. In December 2013, Ashford University effected its transition to WSCUC accreditation and designated its San Diego, California facilities as its main campus. As part of a continuing WSCUC monitoring process, Ashford University hosted a visiting team from WSCUC in a special visit in April 2015. In July 2015, Ashford University received an Action Letter from WSCUC outlining the findings 

arising out of its team's special visit. The Action Letter stated that the WSCUC visiting team found substantial evidence that Ashford University continues to make sustained progress in all six areas recommended by WSCUC in 2013. 

WSCUC also performs Mid-Cycle Reviews of its accredited institutions near the midpoint of their periods of accreditation, as required by the Department. The purpose of the Mid-Cycle Review is to identify problems with an institution&#8217;s or program&#8217;s continued compliance with agency standards while taking into account institutional or program strengths and stability. The Mid-Cycle Review report will focus particularly on student achievement, including indicators of educational effectiveness, retention and graduation data. 

Licensure by California BPPE 

To be eligible to participate in Title IV programs, an institution must be legally authorized to offer its educational programs by the states in which it is physically located. Effective July 2011, the Department established new requirements to determine if an institution is considered to be legally authorized by a state. In connection with its transition to WSCUC accreditation, Ashford University designated its San Diego, California facilities as its main campus for Title IV purposes and submitted an Application for Approval to Operate an Accredited Institution to BPPE on September 10, 2013. 

In April 2014, the application was granted, and the university was approved by BPPE to operate in California until July 15, 2018. As a result, Ashford University is no longer exempt from certain laws and regulations applicable to private, post-secondary educational institutions. These laws and regulations entail certain California reporting requirements, including but not limited to, graduation, employment and licensing data, certain changes of ownership and control, faculty and programs, and student refund policies, as well as the triggering of other state and federal student employment data reporting and disclosure requirements. 

Negotiated Rulemaking and Other Executive Action 

Three negotiated rulemaking sessions held between January and March of 2014 resulted in draft regulations to enact changes to the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act (the &#8220;Clery Act&#8221;) required by the enactment of the Violence Against Women Act (&#8220;VAWA&#8221;). The Department published final regulations in the Federal Register on October 20, 2014, which became effective on July 1, 2015. Among other things, VAWA requires institutions to compile statistics for additional incidents to those currently required by the Clery Act and include certain policies, procedures and programs pertaining to these incidents in annual security reports. 

The Department held Program Integrity and Improvement negotiated rulemaking sessions between February and May of 2014 that focused on topics including, but not limited to, cash management of Title IV program funds, state authorization for programs offering distance or correspondence education, credit and clock hour conversions, the retaking of coursework, and the definition of &#8220;adverse credit&#8221; for PLUS loan borrowers. No consensus resulted from the rulemaking sessions. As a result, the Department had discretion to propose Program Integrity regulations in these areas. In August 2014, the Department published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing new regulations regarding the federal Direct PLUS loan program. The final regulations became effective on July 1, 2015 and update the standards for determining if a potential parent or student borrower has an adverse credit history for purposes of eligibility for a PLUS loan. Specifically, the regulations revise the definition of &#8220;adverse credit history&#8221; and require that parents and students who have an adverse credit history, but who are approved for a PLUS loan on the basis of extenuating circumstances or who obtain an endorser for the PLUS loan, must receive loan counseling before receiving the loan. 

On September 3, 2014, the Department published a notice in the Federal Register to announce its intention to establish a negotiated rulemaking committee to prepare proposed regulations for the William D. Ford &#8220;Federal Direct Loan Program&#8221; authorized by the Higher Education Act. Two public hearings were held in October and November 2014. On December 19, 2014, the Department published a notice to announce its intention to establish the committee to (i) prepare proposed regulations to establish a new Pay as Your Earn repayment plan for those not covered by the existing Federal Direct Loan Program and (ii) establish procedures for Federal Family Education Loan Program (&#8220;FFEL Program&#8221;) loan holders to use to identify U.S. military service members who may be eligible for a lower interest rate on their FFEL Program loans. The committee met in February, March and April of 2015. On July 9, 2015, the Department published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing to amend the regulations governing the Federal Direct Loan Program, and on October 30, 2015, the regulations were amended to create a new income-contingent repayment plan in accordance with President Obama's initiative to allow more Federal Direct Loan Program borrowers to cap their loan payments at 10% of their monthly income. Changes were also made to the FFEL Program and Federal Direct Loan Program regulations to streamline and enhance existing processes and provide additional support to struggling borrowers. The amended regulations also expand the circumstances in which an institution may challenge or appeal a draft or final cohort default rate based on the institution's participation rate index. 

On October 30, 2014, the Obama administration announced that the Department would lead an effort to formalize an interagency task force to conduct oversight of for-profit institutions of higher education, especially regarding alleged unfair, deceptive, and abusive policies and practices. The task force has been formed and includes the Departments of Justice, Treasury and Veterans Affairs, as well as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Federal Trade Commission, Securities and Exchange Commission, and state Attorneys General. The stated purpose of the task force is to &#8220;coordinate...activities and promote information sharing to protect students from unfair, deceptive and abusive policies and practices.&#8221; 

On March 24, 2015, the OIG issued a final audit report titled &#8220;Federal Student Aid's Oversight of Schools' Compliance with the Incentive Compensation Ban.&#8221; In its report, the OIG concluded that the Department's Office of Federal Student Aid (the &#8220;FSA&#8221;) failed to (i) revise its enforcement procedures and guidance after the Department eliminated the incentive compensation safe harbors in 2010, (ii) develop procedures and guidance on appropriate enforcement action and (iii) properly resolve incentive compensation ban findings. In response to the report, the OIG and the FSA agreed on corrective action that may increase scrutiny and enforcement action related to payment of incentive compensation. 

On May 18, 2015, the Department published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to amend cash management regulations related to Title IV program funds. The proposed regulations address student access to Title IV program funds, financial account fees and the opening of financial accounts. The proposed regulations also clarify how the Department treats previously passed coursework for Title IV eligibility purposes, and streamline the requirements for converting clock hours to credit hours. 

On June 8, 2015, the Department held a press conference and released a document entitled &#8220;Fact Sheet: Protecting Students from Abusive Career Colleges&#8221; in which the Department announced processes that will be established to assist students who may have been the victims of fraud in gaining relief under the &#8220;defense to repayment&#8221; provisions of the Federal Direct Loan Program regulations. Rarely used in the past, the defense to repayment provisions allow a student to assert as a defense against repayment of federal Direct Loans any commission of fraud or other violation of applicable state law by the school related to such loans or the educational services paid for. The processes outlined by the Department on June 8 include (i) extending debt relief eligibility to groups of students where possible, (ii) providing loan forbearance and pausing payments while claims are being resolved, (iii) appointing a Special Master dedicated to borrower defense issues for students who believe they have a defense to repayment, (iv) establishing a streamlined process and (v) building a better system for debt relief for the future. The Department noted that building a better system for debt relief would involve developing new regulations to clarify and streamline loan forgiveness under the defense to repayment provisions, while maintaining or enhancing current consumer protection standards and strengthening provisions that hold schools accountable for actions that result in loan discharges. 

On August 20, 2015, the Department announced its intention to establish a negotiated rulemaking committee to prepare proposed regulations for the Federal Student Aid programs authorized under Title IV of the Higher Education Act. The Department held two public hearings in September 2015 at which interested parties commented on the topics suggested by the Department and suggested additional topics that should be considered for action by the negotiating committee. The Department also accepted written comments and suggestions. The Department intends to convene a committee to develop proposed regulations for determining which acts or omissions of an institution of higher education a borrower may assert as a defense to repayment, and the consequences of the assertion of such borrower defenses for borrowers, institutions and the Department. Specifically, the Department intends to address (i) the procedures to be used for a borrower to establish a defense to repayment, (ii) the criteria the Department will use to identify acts or omissions of an institution that constitute defenses to repayment, (iii) the standards and procedures the Department will use to determine the liability of the institution for amounts based on borrower defenses and (iv) the effect of borrower defenses on institutional capability assessments. The committee met in January and February of 2016, and is scheduled to meet again in March 2016. 

Authorization by U.S. Congress of Title IV Programs 

The U.S. Congress must periodically reauthorize the Higher Education Act and annually determine the funding level for each Title IV program through the budget and appropriations process. In 2008, the Higher Education Act was reauthorized through September 2014, and the House Education and the Workforce Committee is currently working to reauthorize the Higher Education Act. The Higher Education Act's programs will continue year-to-year without explicit reauthorization as long as the U.S. Congress appropriates funds for the programs. The U.S. Congress may propose and pass revisions to the Higher Education Act between reauthorizations by using other legislative vehicles such as budget bills and appropriations bills, which could impact funding for student financial aid programs. 

There has been increased focus by some in the U.S. Congress on the role that for-profit educational institutions play in higher education. In particular, the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee of the U.S. Senate (&#8220;HELP Committee&#8221;) held a series of hearings regarding the for-profit education sector and Title IV programs, including a March 2011 hearing specifically entitled &#8220;Bridgepoint Education, Inc.: A Case Study in For-Profit Education and Oversight.&#8221; The hearings of the HELP Committee, and those of other Congressional committees, have focused on various aspects of the for-profit education 

sector including student debt, recruitment practices, educational quality, student outcomes, the effectiveness of accrediting bodies, and the amount of Title IV funding received by the for-profit education sector. In connection with these hearings, members of Congress have requested a broad range of detailed information from various for-profit institutions, including Ashford University and University of the Rockies. On July 29, 2012, the majority staff of the HELP Committee issued a report entitled &#8220;For Profit Higher Education: The Failure to Safeguard the Federal Investment and Ensure Student Success,&#8221; which contains the majority staff's findings from the committee's two-year investigation of the for-profit education sector. The report is critical of the sector generally and of us and our institutions specifically, expressing concerns surrounding the amount of Title IV and other federal funds received, the amount of money spent on marketing and recruiting, student retention and default rates, staffing levels, learning outcomes and accreditation, among other items. 

Certain members of Congress have proposed legislation that could have an adverse impact on our institutions. Even if this proposed legislation does not pass during the session in which it is introduced, it may be reintroduced or similar legislation may be proposed, or it may serve as a basis of discussion during the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. 

Department Regulation of Title IV Programs 

To be eligible to participate in Title IV programs, an institution must comply with the Higher Education Act and the regulations thereunder that are administered by the Department. Among other things, the law and regulations require that an institution (i) be licensed or authorized to offer its educational programs by the states in which it is physically located, (ii) maintain institutional accreditation by an accrediting agency recognized for such purposes by the Department and (iii) be certified to participate in Title IV programs by the Department. Our institutions' participation in Title IV programs subjects them to extensive oversight and review pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Department. Those regulations are subject to revision and amendment from time to time by the Department. The Department's interpretation of its regulations likewise is subject to change. As a result, it is difficult to predict how Title IV program requirements will be applied in all circumstances. 

An institution must periodically seek recertification from the Department to continue to participate in Title IV programs and may, in certain circumstances, be subject to review by the Department prior to seeking recertification. The current certification for University of the Rockies is scheduled to expire on June 30, 2016. Ashford University is provisionally certified until September 30, 2016. The Department typically places an institution on provisional certification following a change in ownership resulting in a change of control, and may provisionally certify an institution for other reasons including, but not limited to, failure to comply with certain standards of administrative capability or financial responsibility. During the time when an institution is provisionally certified, it may be subject to adverse action with fewer due process rights than those afforded to other institutions, and it must apply for and receive approval from the Department for any substantial change including but not limited to the establishment of an additional location, an increase in the level of academic offerings, or the addition of certain programs. 

The 90/10 rule 

Under the Higher Education Act, a for-profit institution loses its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if the institution derives more than 90% of its revenues (calculated in accordance with applicable Department regulations) from Title IV program funds for two consecutive fiscal years. This rule is commonly referred to as the &#8220;90/10 rule.&#8221; Any institution that violates the 90/10 rule for two consecutive fiscal years becomes ineligible to participate in Title IV programs for at least two fiscal years. In addition, an institution whose rate exceeds 90% for any single year will be placed on provisional certification and may be subject to other enforcement measures. In the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , Ashford University derived 80.9% , 83.4% &#32;and 85.6% , respectively, and University of the Rockies derived 86.6% , 88.3% &#32;and 87.6% , respectively, of their respective revenues (calculated in accordance with applicable Department regulations) from Title IV program funds. 

Revenue derived from government tuition assistance for military personnel, including veterans, is not considered federal student aid for purposes of the 90/10 calculation, and accordingly helps our institutions satisfy the 90/10 rule. As of December 31, 2015 , approximately 28.0% &#32;of our institutions' students were affiliated with the military, some of whom are eligible to receive government tuition assistance that may be used to pursue postsecondary degrees. 

Incentive compensation 

The Higher Education Act prohibits an institution from providing any commission, bonus or other incentive payments based directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments or financial aid to any persons or entities engaged in student recruiting or admissions activities or making decisions about the award of student financial assistance. Under prior Department regulations, there were 12 &#8220;safe harbor&#8221; provisions. The Department eliminated all 12 safe harbors, effective July 1, 2011, taking the position that any commission, bonus or other incentive payment based in any part, directly or indirectly, on securing enrollments or awarding financial aid is inconsistent with the incentive payment prohibition in the Higher Education Act. The Department issued a Dear Colleague Letter dated March 17, 2011 that attempted to clarify and provide interpretive guidance 

regarding certain aspects of the regulations, but there remains uncertainty as to what constitutes prohibited incentive compensation. 

Qui tam complaints against us and our institutions were unsealed in December 2012 and January 2013. These complaints allege, among other things, that our institutions violated the Federal False Claims Act by falsely certifying to the Department that Ashford University and University of the Rockies, in the case of the qui tam unsealed in December 2012, and Ashford University, in the case of the &#32;qui tam unsealed in January 2013, were in compliance with the prior regulations regarding the payment of incentive compensation to enrollment personnel in connection with the institutions' participation in student financial aid programs. The U.S. Department of Justice declined to intervene in the qui tam &#32;complaints. The qui tam &#32;complaint unsealed in December 2012 was voluntarily dismissed in June 2013, following the U.S. Department of Justice's stipulation to the dismissal. In August 2015, our motion to dismiss the qui tam &#32;complaint unsealed in January 2013 was granted, and the case is currently under appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. During the pendency of the appeal, the parties agreed to settle the case for an immaterial amount and are in the process of finalizing a settlement agreement. For more information regarding claims and lawsuits, see Note 21 , &#8220;Commitments and Contingencies&#8221; to our annual consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. 

Cohort default rate 

For each federal fiscal year, the Department calculates a rate of student defaults over a three-year measuring period for each educational institution, which is known as a &#8220;cohort default rate.&#8221; An institution may lose its eligibility to participate in the federal Direct Loan and Pell programs if, for each of the three most recent federal fiscal years, 30% or more of its students who became subject to a repayment obligation in that federal fiscal year defaulted on such obligation by the end of the following federal fiscal year. 

The three-year cohort default rates for Ashford University for the 2012, 2011 and 2010 federal fiscal years, were 15.3% , 15.3% &#32;and 16.3% , respectively. The three-year cohort default rates for University of the Rockies for the 2012, 2011 and 2010 federal fiscal years, were 4.3% , 6.6% &#32;and 8.0% , respectively. 

The draft three-year cohort default rates for the 2013 federal fiscal year for Ashford University and the University of the Rockies are 14.7% and 3.9%, respectively. 

Substantial misrepresentation 

The Higher Education Act prohibits an institution participating in Title IV programs from engaging in substantial misrepresentation of the nature of its educational programs, financial charges or graduate employability. Under the Department's rules, a &#8220;misrepresentation&#8221; is any false, erroneous or misleading statement an institution, one of its representatives, or any ineligible institution, organization, or person with whom the institution has an agreement to provide educational programs, or marketing, advertising, recruiting, or admissions services makes directly to a student or prospective student or any member of the public, or to an accrediting agency, to a state agency or the Department. The Department's rules define a &#8220;substantial misrepresentation&#8221; as any misrepresentation on which the person to whom it was made could reasonably be expected to rely, or has reasonably relied, to that person's detriment. Considering the broad definition of &#8220;substantial misrepresentation,&#8221; it is possible that, despite our training efforts and compliance programs, our institutions' employees or service providers may make statements that could be construed as substantial misrepresentations. For-profit educational institutions are also subject to the general deceptive practices jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission (the &#8220;FTC&#8221;) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the &#8220;CFPB&#8221;). The FTC and CFPB are intensifying their regulatory scrutiny of our industry and related vendors, sometimes in coordination with the Department of Education and state Attorneys General. 

On August 10, 2015, we received from the CFPB Civil Investigative Demands related to the CFPB's investigation to determine whether for-profit post-secondary education companies or other unnamed persons have engaged in or are engaging in unlawful acts or practices related to the advertising, marketing or origination of private student loans. We, together with Ashford University, expect to provide documents, testimony and other information to the CFPB, and cannot predict the eventual scope, duration or outcome of the investigation at this time. 

On December 10, 2015, Ashford University received a request for information from the Multi-Regional and Foreign School Participation Division of the FSA for (i) advertising and marketing materials provided to prospective students regarding the transferability of certain credit, (ii) documents produced in response to the CFPB's August 10, 2015 Civil Investigative Demand related to the CFPB's investigation to determine whether for-profit post-secondary education companies or other unnamed persons have engaged in or are engaging in unlawful acts or practices related to the advertising, marketing or origination of private student loans, (iii) certain documents produced in response to subpoenas and interrogatories issued by the California Attorney General and (iv) records created between 2009 and 2012 related to the disbursement of certain Title IV funds. The FSA is investigating representations made by Ashford University to potential and enrolled students, and has asked 

us and Ashford University to assist in its assessment of Ashford University's compliance with the prohibition on substantial misrepresentations. We, together with Ashford University, intend to provide the FSA with our full cooperation with a view toward demonstrating the compliant nature of our practices. 

If the Department determines that one of our institutions has engaged in substantial misrepresentation, the Department may (i) attempt to revoke the institution's program participation agreement if the institution is provisionally certified, (ii) impose limitations on the institution's participation in Title IV programs if the institution is provisionally certified, (iii) deny applications from the institution for approval of new programs or locations or other matters or (iv) initiate proceedings to fine the institution or limit, suspend or terminate its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. Because Ashford University is provisionally certified, it could be subject to the actions set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above in addition to any other actions taken by the Department if it were determined that Ashford University has engaged in substantial misrepresentation. 

Return of Title IV funds for students who withdraw 

If a student who has received Title IV funds withdraws, the institution must determine the amount of Title IV program funds the student has earned pursuant to applicable regulations. If the student withdraws during the first 60% of any payment period (which, for our undergraduate online students, is typically a 20-week term consisting of four five-week courses and, for our campus-based students, is a 16-week semester), the amount of Title IV funds that the student has earned is equal to a pro rata portion of the funds the student received or for which the student would otherwise be eligible for the payment period. If the student withdraws after the 60% threshold, then the student is deemed to have earned 100% of the Title IV funds received. If the student has not earned all of the Title IV funds disbursed, the institution must return the unearned funds to the appropriate lender or the Department in a timely manner, which is generally no later than 45 days after the date the institution determined that the student withdrew. If an institution's annual financial aid compliance audit in either of its two most recently completed fiscal years determines that 5% or more of such returns were not timely made, the institution may be required to submit a letter of credit in favor of the Department equal to 25% of the Title IV funds that the institution should have returned for withdrawn students in its most recently completed fiscal year. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , our institutions did not exceed the 5% threshold for late refunds sampled. 

Ashford University's administration of Title IV program funds during the period from July 1, 2006 through June 30, 2007, including the return of unearned Title IV funds during the period, is the subject of a compliance audit previously conducted by the OIG. For information regarding the OIG's audit findings, see &#8220;Regulation &#8212; Department Regulation of Title IV Programs &#8212; Compliance reviews, audits and reports&#8221; below. In addition, the Multi-Regional and Foreign School Participation Division of the FSA has requested from us and Ashford University records created between 2009 and 2012 related to the disbursement of certain Title IV funds. For additional information regarding the request for information, see &#8220;Regulation &#8212; Department Regulation of Title IV Programs &#8212; Substantial misrepresentation&#8221; above. 

State authorization 

To be eligible to participate in Title IV programs, an institution must be legally authorized to offer its educational programs by the states in which it is physically located. An institution is considered to be legally authorized by a state if, among other things, it meets one of the following sets of requirements: 

&#8226; 

the state establishes the institution by name as an educational institution through a charter, statute, constitutional provision or other action issued by an appropriate state agency or state entity and is authorized to operate educational programs beyond secondary education, including programs leading to a degree or certificate; the institution complies with any applicable state approval or licensure requirements, except that the state may exempt the institution from any state approval or licensure requirement based on the institution's accreditation by one or more accrediting agencies recognized by the Department or based upon the institution being in operation for at least 20 years; and the state has a process to review and appropriately act on complaints concerning the institution including the enforcement of state laws; 

&#8226; 

the institution is established by the state on the basis of an authorization to conduct business in the state or to operate as a nonprofit charitable organization; the institution, by name, is approved or licensed by the state to offer programs beyond secondary education, including programs leading to a degree or certificate; and the institution is not exempt from the state's approval or licensure requirements based on accreditation, years in operation, or other comparable exemption; and the state has a process to review and appropriately act on complaints concerning the institution including the enforcement of state laws; or 

&#8226; 

the institution is exempt from state authorization as a religious institution under the state constitution or by state law, and the state has a process to review and appropriately act on complaints concerning the institution and to enforce applicable state laws. 

The Department has stated that it will not publish a list of states that meet, or fail to meet, the above requirements, and it is unclear how the Department will interpret these requirements in each state. 

The regulations also provide that if an institution is offering postsecondary education through distance or correspondence education to students in a state in which it is not physically located or in which it is otherwise subject to state jurisdiction as determined by the state, the institution must meet any state requirements for it to be legally offering postsecondary distance or correspondence education to students in that state. Additionally, upon request by the Department, an institution must be able to document that it has the applicable state approval. Although our institutions have a process for evaluating the compliance of their online educational programs with state requirements regarding distance and correspondence learning, and have experienced no significant restrictions on their educational activities to date as a result of such requirements, state regulatory requirements for online education vary among the states, are not well developed in many states, are imprecise or unclear in some states and are subject to change. For more information, see &#8220;Regulation &#8212; State Education Licensure and Regulation&#8221; below. Moreover, it is also unclear whether and to what extent state agencies may augment or change their regulations in this area as a result of new Department regulations and increased scrutiny. Any failure to comply with state requirements, or any new or modified regulations, could result in our inability to enroll students or receive Title IV funds for students in those states and could result in restrictions on growth and enrollments. 

On June 5, 2012, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the new state authorization regulation with respect to distance and correspondence education. The Court affirmed a 2011 order of a Federal District Court in the District of Columbia vacating the regulation requiring an institution to meet state requirements in a state in which it has distance education students, but in which it is not physically located or otherwise subject to state jurisdiction. The Department subsequently issued a Dear Colleague Letter acknowledging the Court's decision and stating that the Department would not enforce the requirements of the regulation and commenting that institutions continue to be responsible for complying with all state laws as they relate to distance education. 

Ashford University has a campus that is physically located in Iowa. During the time period in which Ashford University was accredited by the Higher Learning Commission, the Iowa College Student Aid Commission (&#8220;ICSAC&#8221;) advised Ashford University that the institution was exempt from a requirement to register with the State of Iowa to offer postsecondary degree programs in Iowa by virtue of its accreditation by HLC. In anticipation of its transition to WSCUC accreditation, Ashford University applied for registration with ICSAC. In November 2011, ICSAC determined Ashford University met all requirements to offer postsecondary education in Iowa and approved the institution's registration in Iowa for a four-year period ending November 2015. Ashford University has submitted a renewal application with ICSAC and is authorized to continue operating in Iowa pending ICSAC's review of the renewal application. However, in light of the findings and recommendations contained in the final audit report of the OIG, discussed below under &#8220;Regulation &#8212; Department Regulation of Title IV Programs &#8212; Compliance reviews, audits and reports,&#8221; ICSAC stated that it would immediately reconsider the institution's registration for possible revocation if the Department ruled to limit, suspend or terminate the institution's participation in Title IV programs. 

University of the Rockies is located in the State of Colorado and has Full Authorization by the Colorado Commission on Higher Education. Such authorization may be lost or withdrawn if University of the Rockies fails to comply with requirements under Colorado statutes and rules for continued authorization. 

Gainful employment 

On October 31, 2014, the Department published Gainful Employment regulations impacting programs required to prepare graduates for gainful employment in a recognized occupation. Almost all academic programs offered by Title IV-participating private sector institutions of higher education must prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation. The Gainful Employment regulations became effective July 1, 2015, with certain disclosure requirements that are expected to be effective in early 2017. 

The Gainful Employment regulations have a framework with three components: 

&#8226; 

Certification: Institutions must certify that each of their gainful employment programs meet state and federal licensure, certification and accreditation requirements. 

&#8226; 

Accountability Measures: To maintain Title IV eligibility, gainful employment programs will be required to meet minimum standards for the debt burden versus the earnings of their graduates. 

&#9702; 

Pass: Programs whose graduates have annual loan payments less than 8% of total earnings or less than 20% of discretionary earnings. 

&#9702; 

Zone: Programs whose graduates have annual loan payments between 8% and 12% of total earnings or between 20% and 30% of discretionary earnings. 

&#9702; 

Fail: Programs whose graduates have annual loan payments greater than 12% of total earnings and greater than 30% of discretionary earnings. 

Programs that fail in two out of any three consecutive years or are in the Zone for four consecutive years will be disqualified from participation in the Title IV programs. 

&#8226; 

Transparency: Institutions will be required to make public disclosures regarding the performance and outcomes of their gainful employment programs. The disclosures will include information such as costs, earnings, debt and completion rates. 

The accountability measures will typically weigh a calculated debt burden from graduates who completed their studies three and four years prior to the measuring academic year and earnings from the most recent calendar year prior to the conclusion of the measuring academic year. Thus for the 2014-2015 academic year, the cohort will include graduates from the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 academic years and earnings for these graduates from calendar year 2014. 

The regulations contemplate a transition period in the first several years to afford institutions the opportunity to make changes to their programs and retain Title IV eligibility. Because definitive information necessary to determine how our programs will fare under the accountability measures is not available at this time, we are unable to reliably predict the impact of the Gainful Employment regulations. However, we are currently using available data to evaluate which programs are at risk of failing under the requirements. 

Financial responsibility 

The Higher Education Act and Department regulations establish standards of financial responsibility which an institution must satisfy to participate in Title IV programs. The Department evaluates compliance with these standards annually upon receipt of an institution's annual audited financial statements and also when an institution applies to the Department to reestablish its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs following a change in ownership. One financial responsibility standard is based on the institution's composite score, which is derived from a formula established by the Department. The composite score is a number between negative 1.0 and positive 3.0. It must be at least 1.5 for the institution to be deemed financially responsible without the need for further Department financial oversight. In addition to having an acceptable composite score, an institution must, among other things, meet all of its financial obligations (including required refunds to students and any Title IV liabilities and debts), be current in its debt payments and not receive an adverse, qualified or disclaimed opinion by its accountants in its audited financial statements. 

For the prior fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, the composite score calculated was 2.7 , satisfying the composite score requirement of the Department's financial responsibility test, which institutions must satisfy in order to participate in Title IV programs. We expect the consolidated composite score to be 1.8 &#32;for the year ended December 31, 2015 . However, the consolidated calculation is subject to determination by the Department once it receives and reviews our audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 . 

Administrative capability 

The Department specifies extensive criteria by which an institution must establish that it has the requisite administrative capability to participate in Title IV programs. To meet the administrative capability standards, an institution must, among other things, (i) comply with all applicable Title IV program requirements, (ii) have an adequate number of qualified personnel to administer Title IV programs, (iii) have acceptable standards for measuring the satisfactory academic progress of its students, (iv) have procedures in place for awarding, disbursing and safeguarding Title IV funds and for maintaining required records, (v) administer Title IV programs with adequate checks and balances in its system of internal control over financial reporting, (vi) not be, and not have any principal or affiliate who is, debarred or suspended from federal contracting or engaging in activity that is cause for debarment or suspension, (vii) provide financial aid counseling to its students, (viii) refer to the OIG any credible information indicating that any student, parent, employee, third-party servicer or other agent of the institution has engaged in any fraud or other illegal conduct involving Title IV programs, (ix) timely submit all required reports and financial statements and (x) not otherwise appear to lack administrative capability. 

Ashford University and University of the Rockies were notified by the Department that it did not believe the institutions fully responded to the disclosures of data required by the Gainful Employment regulations, that this was an indication of a serious lack of administrative capability, and that as a result the Department would not make any decisions regarding the addition of any new programs or additional locations until the reporting requirements were met. The Department informed us 

that failure to fully comply in all Gainful Employment data reporting requirements could result in the referral of the errant institution to the Department's Administrative Actions and Appeals Service Group for consideration of an administrative action against that institution, including a fine, the limitation, suspension or termination of institutional eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, or revocation of the institution's program participation agreement (if provisional). We worked with the Department to address their concerns with respect to the reporting of our institutions under the Gainful Employment regulations. The Department has since approved two new programs for Ashford University, and we do not anticipate any actions against our institutions related to this notification. 

Potential effect of noncompliance with Title IV regulations 

The Department can impose sanctions for violating the statutory and regulatory requirements of Title IV programs, including: 

&#8226; 

transferring an institution from the advance method or the heightened cash monitoring level one method of Title IV payment, each of which permit the institution to receive Title IV funds before or concurrently with disbursing them to students, to the heightened cash monitoring level two method of payment or to the reimbursement method of payment, each of which delay an institution's receipt of Title IV funds until student eligibility has been verified by the Department; 

&#8226; 

imposing a monetary liability against an institution in an amount equal to any funds determined to have been improperly disbursed or not to have been properly returned upon student withdrawal; 

&#8226; 

requiring an institution to post a letter of credit in favor of the Department as a condition for continued Title IV eligibility; 

&#8226; 

initiating proceedings to impose a fine or to limit, suspend or terminate an institution's participation in Title IV programs; 

&#8226; 

referring a matter for possible civil or criminal investigation; 

&#8226; 

failing to grant an institution's application for renewal of its certification, or revocation of an institution's provisional certification, to participate in Title IV programs, or imposing conditions on its participation in Title IV programs; or 

&#8226; 

taking emergency action to suspend an institution's participation in Title IV programs without prior notice or a prior opportunity for a hearing. 

If sanctions were imposed resulting in a substantial curtailment or termination of our institutions' participation in Title IV programs, enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. If our institutions lost their eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, or if the amount of available Title IV program funds were reduced, we would seek to arrange or provide alternative sources of financial aid for students. There is no assurance that any private organizations would be willing to provide financial assistance to our institutions' students. Additionally, the interest rate and other terms of such financial aid would likely not be as favorable as those for Title IV program funds, and we might be required to guarantee all or part of such alternative assistance or might incur other additional costs in connection with securing such alternative assistance. It is unlikely that we would be able to arrange alternative funding to replace all the Title IV funding our institutions' students receive. 

Compliance reviews, audits and reports 

Our institutions are subject to reviews in connection with periodic renewals of certification to participate in Title IV programs, as well as announced and unannounced compliance reviews and audits by various external agencies, including the Department and the OIG. State licensing agencies, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and accrediting bodies may also conduct audits and reviews of a similar fashion. In addition, as part of the Department's ongoing monitoring of institutions' administration of Title IV programs, the Higher Education Act requires institutions to submit to the Department an annual Title IV compliance audit conducted by an independent certified public accounting firm. In addition, to enable the Department to make a determination of an institution's financial responsibility, each institution must annually submit audited financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and Department regulations. 

The OIG is responsible for, among other things, promoting the effectiveness and integrity of the Department's programs and operations. With respect to educational institutions that participate in Title IV programs, the OIG conducts its work primarily through an audit services division and an investigations division. The audit services division typically conducts general audits of institutions to assess their administration of federal funds in accordance with applicable rules and regulations. The investigation services division typically conducts focused investigations of particular allegations of fraud, abuse or other wrongdoing against institutions by third parties, such as a lawsuit filed under seal pursuant to the federal False Claims Act. 

In January 2011, Ashford University received a final audit report from the OIG regarding the compliance audit commenced in May 2008 and covering the period July 1, 2006 through June 30, 2007. The audit covered Ashford University's administration of Title IV program funds, including compliance with regulations governing institutional and student eligibility, awards and disbursements of Title IV program funds, verification of awards and returns of unearned funds during that period, and its compensation of financial aid and recruiting personnel during the period May 10, 2005 through June 30, 2009. 

The final audit report contained audit findings, in each case for the period July 1, 2006 through June 30, 2007 (award year 2006-2007), which are summarized as follows: 

&#8226; 

Finding 1 - The university designed a compensation plan for enrollment advisors that provided incentive payments based on success in securing enrollments and did not establish that its plan and practices qualified for the regulatory safe harbors. 

&#8226; 

Finding 2 - The university did not always perform return of Title IV aid calculations properly, resulting in the improper retention of a total of $29,036 of Title IV program funds for 38 students in the OIG's sample sets of 85 students. 

&#8226; 

Finding 3 - The university did not in all instances return Title IV program funds timely for Title IV students who withdrew or went on a leave of absence from school. 

&#8226; 

Finding 4 - The form formerly used by the university to obtain authorizations to retain student credit balances did not comply with applicable regulations. 

&#8226; 

Finding 5 -The university did not in all instances disburse Title IV program funds in accordance with applicable regulations or university policy because they were made prior to the students being eligible to receive them. 

&#8226; 

Finding 6 - The university did not in all instances maintain documentation to support online students' leaves of absence due to the lack of support for the start dates for 19 leaves of absence. 

Each finding was accompanied by one or more recommendations to the FSA, as summarized below: 

&#8226; 

For Finding 1, the OIG recommended that the FSA require the university to provide records of all salary adjustments made to enrollment advisors during award year 2006-2007 and any documentation, not disclosed to the OIG, that demonstrates that any specific adjustments made during that period qualified for the regulatory safe harbors. 

&#8226; 

For Findings 2 and 5, the OIG recommended that the FSA require the university (i) to remit to the Department and appropriate lenders certain amounts identified by the OIG ($29,036 for Finding 2) and (ii) undertake a file review for award year 2006-2007 to identify the amount of Title IV funds that were improperly retained or disbursed and to remit such amounts to the Department or appropriate lenders. 

&#8226; 

For Finding 4, the OIG recommended that the FSA require the university to cease drawing, disbursing and holding credit balances of Title IV program funds for which there are no currently assessed institutional charges. 

&#8226; 

For Findings 2, 3, 5 and 6, the OIG recommended that the FSA require the university to develop and implement certain remedial policies and procedures. 

&#8226; 

For Findings 2, 3 and 5 generally, and for Finding 1 in the event the university cannot establish that its salary adjustments for enrollment advisors qualified for the safe harbor, the OIG recommended that the FSA consider whether to take appropriate action under Subpart G of 34 C.F.R. Part 668. Under Subpart G, the FSA may seek to impose a fine against the university or to limit, suspend or terminate the university's participation in Title IV programs. 

The findings and recommendations of the final audit report represent the opinions of the OIG, and the issuance of final audit determinations and corrective action to be taken, if any, will be made by the FSA. 

Ashford University expects that the FSA will consider the findings and recommendations in the final audit report and engage in a dialog with the university prior to determining what, if any, action to take and issuing a Final Audit Determination Letter concluding the audit. The OIG requested that Ashford University provide a response to the FSA regarding the final audit report, and the university responded in a timely manner. 

In June 2011, in connection with Findings 2 and 3, the FSA requested that Ashford University conduct a file review of the return to Title IV calculations for all Title IV recipients who withdrew from distance education programs during award year 2006-2007. The institution cooperated with the request and supplied the information within the time frame required. 

If the FSA were to determine to assess a monetary liability or commence an action under Subpart G or other procedures, Ashford University would have an opportunity to contest the assessment or proposed action through administrative proceedings, with the right to seek review of any final administrative action in the federal courts. Although we believe Ashford University operates in substantial compliance with Department regulations that are applicable to the areas under review, we cannot predict the ultimate findings, potential liabilities or remedial actions, if any, that the FSA may include in the Final Audit Determination Letter, or the result of any administrative proceedings, including Subpart G or other proceedings, that may arise out of the Final Audit Determination Letter. 

The Department periodically reviews institutions participating in Title IV programs for compliance with applicable laws and regulations. On July 25, 2012, the Department notified University of the Rockies that it had scheduled an on-site program review, which took place August 20, 2012 through August 24, 2012. In June 2013, University of the Rockies was provided with the Department&#8217;s program review report and subsequently filed a timely response to such initial report. Following consideration of the university's response, the Department issued a Final Program Review Determination letter, dated July 22, 2015, which states that University of the Rockies' responses have resolved all findings and the university may consider the program review closed. 

On July 31, 2014, the Department notified Ashford University that it intended to conduct a program review of Ashford University&#8217;s administration of Title IV programs in which the university participates. The review commenced on August 25, 2014. In November 2014, Ashford University was provided with the Department's program review report and has responded to such initial report. Following consideration of the university's response, the Department will issue a Final Program Review Determination letter. If the Final Program Review Determination letter were to include findings of non-compliance, Ashford University could be required, subject to administrative review procedures, to pay a fine or return Title IV funds previously received, or could be subjected to other administrative sanctions. 

Adding teaching locations and implementing new educational programs 

The requirements and standards of accrediting agencies, state education agencies and the Department limit our institutions' ability in certain instances to establish additional teaching locations or implement new educational programs. WSCUC, HLC and state education agencies that may authorize or accredit our institutions or their programs generally require institutions to notify them in advance of adding certain new locations or implementing certain new programs, and upon notification may undertake a review of the quality of the facility or the program and the financial, academic and other qualifications of the institution. If an institution participating in Title IV programs plans to add a new location or educational program, the institution must apply under certain circumstances to the Department to have the additional location or educational program designated as within the scope of the institution's Title IV eligibility. 

As previously discussed, Ashford University is provisionally certified for Title IV eligibility until September 30, 2016. During the time when an institution is provisionally certified, it must apply for and receive approval from the Department for any substantial change, including but not limited to the establishment of an additional location, an increase in the level of academic offerings, or the addition of certain programs. 

Change in ownership resulting in a change of control 

The Department and most state and accrediting agencies require institutions of higher education to report or obtain approval of certain changes of control and changes in other aspects of institutional organization or operations. Transactions or events that constitute a change of control may include significant acquisitions or dispositions of an institution's common stock and significant changes in the composition of an institution's governing board. The types of thresholds for such reporting and approval vary among the states and among accrediting agencies. The Department regulations provide that a change of control occurs for a publicly traded corporation if either (i) a person acquires such ownership and control of the corporation so that the corporation is required to file a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC disclosing a change of control or (ii) the corporation's largest stockholder who owns at least 25% of the total outstanding voting stock of the corporation, ceases to own at least 25% of such stock or ceases to be the largest stockholder owning at least 25% of the total stock. A significant purchase or disposition of our voting stock, including a disposition of voting stock by Warburg Pincus, could be determined by the Department to be a change of control under this standard. In such event, the regulatory procedures applicable to a change in ownership and control would have to be followed in connection with the transaction. Similarly if such a disposition were deemed a change of control by the applicable accreditor or state educational licensing agency, any required regulatory notifications and approvals would have to be made or obtained. 

Privacy of student records 

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 ("FERPA") and the Department's FERPA regulations require educational institutions to protect the privacy of students' educational records by limiting an institution's disclosure of a 

student's personally identifiable information without the student's prior written consent. FERPA also requires institutions to allow students to review and request changes to their educational records maintained by the institution, to notify students at least annually of this inspection right and to maintain records in each student's file listing requests for access to and disclosures of personally identifiable information and the interest of such party in that information. If an institution fails to comply with FERPA, the Department may require corrective actions by the institution or may terminate an institution's receipt of further federal funds. In addition, educational institutions are obligated to safeguard student information pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ("GLBA"), a federal law designed to protect consumers' personal financial information held by financial institutions and other entities that provide financial services to consumers. The applicable GLBA regulations require an institution to, among other things, develop and maintain a comprehensive, written information security program designed to protect against the unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable financial information of students, parents or other individuals with whom such institution has a customer relationship. If an institution fails to comply with the applicable GLBA requirements, it may be required to take corrective actions, be subject to monitoring and oversight by the FTC, and be subject to fines or penalties imposed by the FTC. 

State Education Licensure and Regulation 

California, Iowa and Colorado 

Ashford University has designated its San Diego, California facilities as its main campus for Title IV purposes. The university submitted an Application for Approval to Operate an Accredited Institution to BPPE on September 10, 2013. For additional information, see &#8220;Regulation &#8212; Licensure by California BPPE&#8221; above. 

Ashford University also has a campus located in Iowa. Ashford University is registered as a postsecondary school in the state of Iowa by ICSAC. To maintain its Iowa registration, the university must comply with applicable requirements under Iowa statutes and rules. In July 2015, the Ashford University Board of Trustees made the decision to close the Clinton Campus after the 2015-2016 academic year, following the implementation of a one-year teach-out plan. On December 22, 2015, we entered into a Purchase Agreement and Escrow Instructions with Catalyst pursuant to which we agreed to sell the Clinton Campus to Catalyst. Simultaneously with the closing of the sale on December 29, 2015, we entered into a Lease Agreement with Catalyst pursuant to which we are leasing the Clinton Campus from Catalyst through December 31, 2016. 

University of the Rockies' campus is located in Colorado. The university is authorized to operate by the Colorado Commission on Higher Education. To maintain its Colorado authorization, the university must comply with applicable requirements under Colorado statutes and rules. 

The Higher Education Act requires Ashford University and University of Rockies to be legally authorized in the states in which they are physically located in order to participate in Title IV programs. Department regulations impose Title IV program requirements for an institution to be considered legally authorized by a state. Our failure to hold required authorizations in California, Iowa, or Colorado could cause Ashford University or University of the Rockies, as applicable, to lose their authorization to deliver educational programs and to grant degrees and other credentials and lose their eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. For additional information, see &#8220;Regulation &#8212; Department Regulation of Title IV Programs &#8212; State authorization&#8221; above. 

Additional state regulation 

Most state education agencies impose regulatory requirements on educational institutions operating within their boundaries. Some states have sought to assert jurisdiction over out-of-state educational institutions offering online programs that have no physical location or other presence in the state but that have some activity in the state, such as enrolling or offering educational services to students who reside in the state, employing faculty who reside in the state or advertising to or recruiting prospective students in the state. In addition to California, Iowa and Colorado, we have determined that our activities in certain states constitute a presence requiring licensure or authorization under the requirements of the state education agency in those states, and in other states we have obtained state education agency approvals as we have determined necessary in connection with our marketing and recruiting activities. We review state licensure requirements when appropriate to determine whether our activities in those states constitute a presence or otherwise require licensure or authorization. Because we enroll students throughout the United States, we may have to seek licensure or authorization in additional states in the future. 

State regulatory requirements for online education vary among the states, are not well developed in many states, are imprecise or unclear in some states and are subject to change. Consequently, a state education agency could disagree with our conclusion that we are not required to obtain a license or authorization in the state and could restrict one or more of our business activities in the state, including the ability to recruit or enroll students in that state or to continue providing services or advertising in that state. If we fail to comply with state licensing or authorization requirements for any state, we may be subject to the loss of state licensure or authorization by that state, or be subject to other sanctions, including restrictions on our 

activities in that state, fines and penalties. The loss of any required license or authorization in states other than California, Iowa and Colorado could prohibit us from recruiting prospective students or from offering services to current students in those states. 

Effective July 1, 2011, the Department regulations imposed new Title IV state authorization requirements for institutions that offer postsecondary education through distance education to students in states in which it is not physically located or in which it is otherwise subject to state jurisdiction as determined by the state. The regulations have been the subject of a federal court challenge and a subsequent announcement by the Department regarding their enforcement. For additional information, see &#8220;Regulation &#8212; Department Regulation of Title IV Programs &#8212; State authorization&#8221; above. 

The Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 

During 2015, Santander Asset Management Investment Holdings Limited (&#8220;SAMIH&#8221;) and Endurance International Group Holdings, Inc. (&#8220;Endurance&#8221;) engaged in certain activities that are subject to disclosure pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 and Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act. These activities are disclosed in Exhibit 99.1 to this annual report. Affiliates of Warburg Pincus, LLC (i) beneficially own more than 10% of our outstanding common stock and are members of our board of directors and (ii) beneficially own more than 10% of the equity interests of and have the right to designate members of the board of directors of each of SAMIH and Endurance. We will be required to separately file with the SEC, concurrently with this annual report, a notice that such activities have been disclosed in this annual report, which notice must also contain the information required by Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act.
