 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Unless we have indicated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to &#8220;MassRoots,&#8221; the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; or similar terms are to MassRoots, Inc. Unless otherwise indicated, all share and per share information relating to our common stock in this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been adjusted to reflect the &#8220;Exchange&#8221; which occurred during our &#8220;Reorganization&#8221;. See the section entitled &#8220;Fundraising During the Year and Our Reorganization&#8221; contained in this &#8220;Item 1&#8221; for additional discussion of the Exchange and Reorganization. 

Organization 

&#160; We were incorporated in the state of Delaware on April 26, 2013 as a social network for the cannabis community.

Our principal executive office is located at MassRoots, Inc., 1624 Market Street, Suite 201, Denver, CO 80202, and our telephone number is (720) 442-0052.

For the year ended December 31, 2015, we raised an aggregate of $3,617,663 from the sale of our securities (including the exercise of previously issued warrants for the purchase of our common stock). For the year ended December 31, 2015, we had a net loss of $8,472,898. 

Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit opinion for our Company, which includes an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. 

Emerging Growth Company &#160;

We are an &#34;emerging growth company,&#34; as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies.

Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act provides that an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably opted out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act. 

We could remain an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues are $1 billion, as adjusted, or more, (ii) the date that we become a &#8220;large accelerated filer&#8221; as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period.

Background 

MassRoots was formed in April 2013 as a social network for the cannabis community. In July 2013, we launched in the App Store and since that time, have grown into a community of more than 775,000 cannabis consumers. Our users utilize MassRoots to share their cannabis experiences, follow their favorite dispensaries, and stay informed of legalization updates. Businesses use MassRoots to advertise their products directly to cannabis consumers. Our growth has been primarily driven by MassRoots&#8217; increasing popularity as one of the first national cannabis brands and word of mouth virility from our users. We believe that by creating a central community of hundreds of thousands of cannabis consumers, we are creating a valuable marketing channel for cannabis and its ancillary products.

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

As a technology company, MassRoots is able to rapidly scale its products and services with minimal marginal costs &#8211; each additional user or business that we add to our platform adds negligible server hosting costs. It also allows us to have exposure to every regulated cannabis market without establishing a physical presence in each state. This minimizes the costs of scaling and required capital while, at the same time, offering a direct role in the cannabis industry without ever touching the plant itself.

MassRoots has strong relationships in both the technology and cannabis industries. As a semi-finalist for the Extreme Tech Challenge, MassRoots was introduced to some of the leading technology investors and developers in Silicon Valley and became one of the first cannabis-related companies to present on stage at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in early 2016. At the same time, MassRoots raised much of its seed-stage capital from the ArcView Group, the largest network of cannabis investors and businesses in the industry, enabling the Company to develop relationships with the key plays in the cannabis sector.

&#160; 

The MassRoots Network &#160; 

&#160;

Examples showing the current user interface of our iOS application. 

The MassRoots network is accessible as a free mobile application through the iOS App Store, the Google Play Marketplace, and as a website at www.MassRoots.com. These applications and services work in a similar manner as other social networks, such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Vine:

Users may create a profile by choosing a username, setting their password and agreeing to our Terms and Conditions. We do not require users&#8217; real names, email address or phone numbers.

&#8226; Users have the ability to follow other users on the network. By &#8220;following&#8221; an account, users are essentially &#8220;opting-in&#8221; to their posts, allowing them to be displayed on their newsfeed. &#8226; A users&#8217; newsfeed displays all the posts from users in which they follow in reverse-chronological order, with the most recent posts being at the top. A users&#8217; profile page displays all the posts from that particular user. &#8226; Users have the ability to like, comment and report statuses from other users. By &#8220;liking&#8221; a status, a user is indicating their approval of the posts&#8217; content. By commenting on a status, users are free to voice their opinions or comments on the posts&#8217; content. By reporting a status, users can flag content that violates our Terms and Conditions, including spam, harassing content and posts about other drugs. &#8226; Users have the ability to tag other users and use hashtags to categorize posts. By using the &#8220;@&#8221; symbol followed by a username, users can tag other users in posts they want them to see or if they are included in the picture or post. By using the &#8220;#&#8221; followed by a categorical word, users can categorize posts based on their content. &#8226; Users have the ability to post pictures with text captions or just text statuses. &#8226; Users have the ability to search for users based on their username and the ability to search by hashtag to display all results within a particular category. Users can sort hashtag searches by their popularity or when they were posted. &#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; Users have the option to provide their phone number to MassRoots (but is not required) so their friends can search their contacts for friends with a MassRoots profile. Users also have the ability to invite their contacts that are not on MassRoots to join via text message. &#8226; Whenever an Interaction takes place involving a user (follow, like, comment, tag), they are sent a push notification on their mobile device notifying them of the action. &#8226; Users have the ability to set their profile to public and private, as well as enabling and disabling web-access. By setting their profile to public, any user on MassRoots&#8217; apps will be able to see the public profile&#8217;s posts and follow the account. When a profile is private, another user must request to follow their account and the account owner must grant permission before they can view any of the account&#8217;s posts. By setting an account to web-enabled, it allows public profiles to be visible via the MassRoots website. By setting an account to web-disabled, both public and private profiles are not viewable through www.MassRoots.com. In early December, MassRoots released a new web platform, indexing the public content on MassRoots on Google for the first time. Alexa ratings are a public measure of a website&#8217;s popularity and are used by advertising agencies to gauge websites&#8217; advertising value &#8211; similar to a Nielsen rating for television broadcast. During the month of January 2016, MassRoots.com experienced its highest ever Alexa ratings 21 out of the 31 days of the month, reflecting increasing amounts of web traffic. Over the coming months, MassRoots plans to introduce new features to our network to accelerate our user growth, boost retention, and open additional revenue streams.

MassRoots for Business 

We launched MassRoots for Business in early March 2015 as an online portal for dispensaries to schedule posts, view analytics and gain insights into their followers. The basic service is available to businesses for no cost. Over 1,000 cannabis businesses were utilizing MassRoots for Business as of December 31, 2015, including 62% of the dispensaries in Colorado.

MassRoots for Business operates in a manner similar to the one described herein:

&#8226; A business can register for the MassRoots for Business portal with their name, business name, email address, phone number, MassRoots username and password (to verify ownership of a particular page). &#8226; A MassRoots employee will then review the account to ensure they are in full compliance with state law. This may involve requiring the dispensary to provide their state dispensary license. &#8226; The business can then access the MassRoots for Business portal, which will consist of five main pages: Dashboard, Posts, Profile, Billing and Contact. &#8226; On the Dashboard, a business can view all the main analytics regarding their account: their follower count, likes per post, total reach of their posts and advertising, and balance on their account. Interactive graphs will allow businesses to track these metrics over time. &#8226; On the Posts page, businesses can schedule posts, view analytics, and promote popular content. &#8226; On the Profile page, businesses can edit their description, username, profile picture, URL, address, contact email, contact phone number and schedule future posts. &#8226; On the Billing page, businesses can enter their credit card information and view past receipts of payment. The advertising portal will operate on a pre-paid basis. &#8226; On the Contact page, businesses can contact a MassRoots employee with any questions or issues. 

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160; 

We started monetizing MassRoots&#8217; network in August 2015 through advertising. We currently offer businesses the ability to sponsor posts through widely-followed MassRoots accounts run by our employees, have their products featured in our weekly email newsletter to over 500,000 opt-in email subscribers, and sponsor content on the MassRoots blog. We generated over $150,000 in revenue through these channels in the last 4 months of 2015. We believe the revenue MassRoots is generating will continue cutting the Company&#8217;s monthly negative cash flow. MassRoots&#8217; business model is designed to scale as marijuana legalization continues to spread; every state that legalizes the medicinal or adult-use of cannabis expands the number of licensed businesses in the industry, increasing our potential customer base and potential revenues.

Monetization of Our Network and Other Long Term Plans 

While MassRoots does not collect Users&#8217; names or phone numbers, we still collect a sufficient amount of information to effectively monetize our network. For instance:

&#8226; Based on the nature of someone downloading and using MassRoots, we know they are an active cannabis consumer or enthusiast. &#8226; When a user accesses MassRoots&#8217; apps and websites, we are able to collect users&#8217; location information down to the zip code. &#8226; Based on the pictures and hashtags a user posts, we can determine what type of cannabis they prefer to consume; how they prefer to consume it; what time of day they are most active. &#8226; Based on the usertags that a user posts, we can determine who their friends are and who is within their social circle of influence. Because we do not collect personally-identifiable information, this data has relatively little value outside of our network, so MassRoots has no intention of selling or disclosing this information to third parties for use outside of our network. However, it has significant value when used to target advertising and services directly to users within the MassRoots network; therefore, it is of the highest importance that MassRoots is able to build out products and services that keep our users engaged and on the network for extended periods of time. The amount of revenue MassRoots may be able to generate per User is directly correlated to the time they spend on the network, their engagement with other users and the quality of posts they put on the network. Additionally, the number of Apps, Websites and Services built using MassRoots&#8217; APIs will also significantly impact the value per User &#8211; so long as MassRoots is integrated with these 3rd party applications, we will be able to collect data, serve advertising and boost engagement to, from and between our Users, increasing their value.

Integration with Dispensary Point of Sale Systems &#160;

During Q3 2016, we expect to begin integrating MassRoots with dispensary point of sale systems, enabling businesses to target advertising to users based on their purchasing history. For example, if a particular user goes to a dispensary every week for a month and purchases a chocolate brownie edible and then does not come back for two weeks, the dispensary would be able to send them a targeted ad offering them 20% off their next chocolate brownie edible purchase. The dispensary would be able to control the advertising offer, the targeting options, and all other relevant information. This will enable cannabis-related businesses to use data to target advertising directly to the consumers most likely to take action based on them, very similar to other social networks. 

To facilitate this integration with dispensary point of sale systems, during the second quarter of 2015, MassRoots invested $175,000 in exchange for preferred shares of Flowhub LLC (&#8220;Flowhub&#8221;), a seed-to-sale system, equal to 8.95% of the then outstanding equity of Flowhub. Since that time, we have been working with Flowhub to integrate their system with our network. We believe that Flowhub has developed the &#8220;next generation&#8221; of seed-to-sale software and believe there is tremendous amount of synergies between the data both MassRoots and Flowhub collect. We believe that by consolidating data from such cannabis point of sale systems, grow operations, and our consumer-facing social network, we will have some of the most important data available in the cannabis industry.

Users Growth and Product Distribution Channels 

The MassRoots app is distributed free of charge through the iOS App Store and the Google Play Marketplace. Prospective users can search for MassRoots on these platforms, read user-reviews and make a decision on whether to download and utilize the MassRoots app. The MassRoots network is also accessible on through desktop and mobile web browsers by navigating to www.MassRoots.com. Our MassRoots for Business portal is distributed at Business.MassRoots.com where businesses may request access.

MassRoots has primarily gained users through organic growth - users telling their friends to join the network. This is supported by the number of endorsements MassRoots receives on Instagram and Twitter, viewable by searching &#8220;#MassRoots&#8221;.

MassRoots also retains the owners of several widely-followed Instagram, Facebook and Twitter accounts as independent contractors. We estimate there are over 6,000,000 people actively posting about cannabis or following cannabis-related pages on Instagram &#8211; our team viewed this as the easiest market for us to capture as these users were already discussing cannabis in a social environment on a mobile application.

Apple App Store Removal, User Support and Restatement, and Similar Matters 

On November 4, 2014, the MassRoots App was removed from Apple&#8217;s iOS App Store due to what we originally believed was a compliance issue with the App Store review team. Existing iOS users were still able to access and use the MassRoots App, however new users were prohibited from downloading it. We discovered that this was a result of the App Store review team changing their app enforcement guidelines to prohibit all social cannabis applications.

When we learned of the true nature of this policy change, we immediately began organizing the cannabis community and industry against it. In early January 2015, we co-signed a letter to Apple&#8217;s CEO, Tim Cook, along with several cannabis business leaders, arguing that the App Store&#8217;s policies were stifling innovation in the cannabis industry. Over 10,000 of our users sent personal emails to Apple advocating why MassRoots should return to the App Store &#8211; with their arguments ranging from freedom of speech and expression to cannabis patients suffering from anxiety who need social support networks.

In early February 2015, an App Store representative informed us Apple had revised their enforcement guidelines &#8211; social cannabis applications that were geo-restricted to the 23 states with medical cannabis laws were once again permitted. On February 12, 2015, MassRoots returned to the App Store after we implemented the geo-restrictions.

While we are grateful to Apple for reversing its decision, we cannot guarantee this policy will remain in place. The iOS App Store is one of the largest content distribution channels in the world and is the only way to effectively distribute software to the 41.6% of the United States population who own iPhones and iPads. The iOS App Store review team is essentially a regulator for our product &#8211; they decide what rules all applications in the iOS App Store must operate by and how to enforce those regulations. The rules related to cannabis-related apps are not published, are arbitrarily enforced, and the App review and appeal processes are conducted in secret without public oversight. MassRoots will continue to push for a more open and transparent app review process &#8211; especially when such policies and decisions directly impact a large portion of the population &#8211; but there is no guarantee we will be successful in those efforts.

MassRoots has not encountered any regulatory issues with the Google Play Store nor have any of our competitors. Under their respective developer license agreements, Apple, Inc. and Google, Inc. have the right to update their iOS App Store and Play Store policies, respectfully, to prohibit cannabis-related applications at any time. This could result in many prospective users being unable to access and join our network and existing users being unable to access our App.

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160; 

Our activities outside of the application stores have also faced backlash and resistance due to our status as a cannabis-related company. For example, our Instagram account has a wide following of over 380,000 followers, the most of any cannabis related company per social media research website, Awesomepova.com and we utilize this following to help expand our user base. However, in a situation similar App Store removal, our Instagram account (along with several other cannabis related accounts) was suspended in January 2016 without notice or explanation from Instagram. The account was later reinstated on February 26, 2016. While we feel that our platform is at the point where any potential suspension will not affect our user growth, we expect to continue to face similar situations in the future that may cause disruptions, if only temporary, to our business plan.

MassRoots Store 

MassRoots also operates MassRoots.com/shop, an e-commerce platform built on the Shopify Platform. Visitors are able to order MassRoots t-shirts, jars and stickers by selecting the products they would like to order, entering their shipping and billing information and confirming the order. MassRoots.com/shop is not part of the Company&#8217;s primary business plan and we do not expect it to be a main focus of the Company as we grow &#8211; it is primarily meant to distribute marketing collateral to our fan base to help raise awareness and accelerate our user growth.

Market Conditions 

MassRoots is poised to take advantage of two rapidly growing industries: cannabis and mobile technology.

Cannabis Market Growth and Current Trends 

Since the MassRoots app first launched in July 2013, there have been a series of events that have help further shape the development of the cannabis and mobile technology industries: 

&#8226; On August 29, 2013, Deputy Attorney General James Cole issued a memo (&#8220;The Cole Memo&#8221;) in response to certain states passing measures to legalize the medical and adult-use of cannabis. The Cole Memo does not alter the Department of Justice's authority to enforce Federal law, including Federal laws relating to cannabis, regardless of state law, but does recommend that U.S. Attorneys to focus their time and resources on certain priorities, rather than businesses legally operating under state law. These guidelines focus on ensuring that cannabis does not cross state lines, keeping dispensaries away from schools and public facilities, strict-enforcement of state laws by regulatory agencies, among other priorities. &#8226; On January 1, 2014, the first sales of cannabis for adult-use permissible under state law took place in Colorado. This event resulted in significant media coverage for the industry. Since that time, three other states and the District of Columbia have made adult-use permissible under their state law and several states have ballot proposals pending at upcoming elections. &#160; On February 14, 2014, the Departments of Justice and Treasury issued a joint memo allowing banks and financial institutions to accept deposits from dispensaries operating legally under state law. In most cases, dispensaries had been forced to operate on a cash basis, presenting significant security and accounting issues. This was a major step in legitimizing and accepting the cannabis industry on a national level. Further, the passing of the Rohrabacher Farr Amendment (defined below) in 2014 and 2015 indicates some level of support in Congress for medicinal cannabis, even if its actual effect is still undetermined. See additional discussion on government regulations in the &#8220;Government Regulation&#8221; section below.

Current States With Laws Permitting the Medical or Adult Use of Cannabis 

As of December 31, 2015, 23 states and the District of Columbia have passed laws allowing some degree of medical use of cannabis, while four of those states and the District of Columbia have also legalized the adult-use of cannabis. The states which have enacted such laws are listed below:

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160; 

State &#160; &#160; Year Passed &#160; 1. Alaska* &#160; &#160; 1998 &#160; 2. Arizona &#160; &#160; 2010 &#160; 3. California &#160; &#160; 1996 &#160; 4. Colorado* &#160; &#160; 2000 &#160; 5. Connecticut &#160; &#160; 2012 &#160; 6. District of Columbia* &#160; &#160; 2010 &#160; 7. Delaware &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; 8. Hawaii &#160; &#160; 2000 &#160; 9. Illinois &#160; &#160; 2013 &#160; 10. Maine &#160; &#160; 1999 &#160; 11. Maryland &#160; &#160; 2014 &#160; 12. Massachusetts &#160; &#160; 2012 &#160; 13. Michigan &#160; &#160; 2008 &#160; 14. Minnesota &#160; &#160; 2014 &#160; 15. Montana &#160; &#160; 2004 &#160; 16. Nevada &#160; &#160; 2000 &#160; 17. New Hampshire &#160; &#160; 2013 &#160; 18. New Jersey &#160; &#160; 2010 &#160; 19. New Mexico &#160; &#160; 2007 &#160; 20. New York &#160; &#160; 2014 &#160; 21. Oregon* &#160; &#160; 1998 &#160; 22. Rhode Island &#160; &#160; 2006 &#160; 23. Vermont &#160; &#160; 2004 &#160; 24. Washington* &#160; &#160; 1998 &#160; * State has enacted laws permitting the adult use of cannabis, in addition to medical use.

Public Support for Legalization Increasing 

A Gallup poll conducted in October 2013 found that 58% of the American people supported legalizing the adult-use of cannabis, an increase of 22% from 2005 alone. This is the first time in American history the majority of registered voters support the full legalization of cannabis for adult-use. Moreover, of 67% participants aged 35 and below voted in support of recreational adult-use, setting the trend for years to come.

A 2016 ArcView Market Research report predicts an additional 14 states will legalize the adult-use of cannabis and two states will legalize medical-use within the next five years. If public support for cannabis legalization continues to increase, we believe it is likely that Federal policies towards marijuana will be reformed. The combination of additional states legalizing adult-use under state law, expansion of medical-use provisions in states where it is currently permitted under state law and increased public awareness is projected to cause marijuana sales permitted under state law to grow from $1.43 billion in 2013 to $10.2 billion in 2018, according to ArcView Market Research.

Market Conditions that Could Limit Our Business 

Cannabis is a Schedule I Controlled Substance under Federal law and, as such, there are several factors that could limit our market and our business. They include, but are not limited to:

&#8226; The Federal government and many private employers prohibit drug use of any kind, including cannabis, even where it is permissible under state law. Random drug screenings and potential enforcement of these employment provisions significantly reduce the size of the potential cannabis market; &#8226; Enforcement of Federal law prohibiting cannabis occurs randomly and often without notice. This could scare many potential investors away from cannabis-related investments and makes it difficult to make accurate market predictions; &#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; There is no guarantee that additional states will pass measures to legalize cannabis under state law. In many states, public support of legalization initiatives is within the margin of error of pass or fail. This is especially true when a supermajority is needed to pass measures, like in Florida where a state constitutional amendment permitting medical cannabis has been proposed, but requires 60% approval to pass. Changes in voters' attitudes and turnout have the potential to slow or stop the cannabis legalization movement and potentially reverse recent cannabis legalization victories; &#8226; There has been some resistance and negativity as a result of recent cannabis legalization at the state level, especially as it relates to drugged driving. The lack of clearly defined and enforced laws at the state level has the potential to sway public opinion against marijuana legalization; and &#8226; Even if the Federal government does not enforce the Federal law prohibiting cannabis, the legality of the state laws regarding the legalization of cannabis are being challenged through lawsuits. Oklahoma and Nebraska recently sued Colorado over the legalization of cannabis, and other lawsuits have been brought by private groups and local law enforcement officials. If these lawsuits are successful, state laws permitting cannabis sales may be overturned and significantly reduce the size of the potential cannabis market and affect our business. Additional discussion of government regulations is available in the &#8220;Government Regulation&#8221; section below.

Technology Industry 

Mobile Devices Dominate the Industry 

Over the past five years, mobile devices have redefined the technology industry. Smartphones were owned by two-thirds of U.S. mobile subscribers as of the fourth quarter of 2013, according to a February 2014 Nielsen Research Report. Smartphone sales worldwide increased 38.4% worldwide in 2013 according to a January 2014 IDC&#8217;s Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone tracker report. Additionally, 195 million mobile tablets were sold in 2013, an increase of 67.9% year over year, according to a March 2014 Gartner Research Report.

When the rapidly-growing smartphone and tablet market size is combined with the development fast, reliable and relatively inexpensive data plans from wireless carriers, it becomes clear why mobile applications &#8220;Apps&#8221; have surged in popularity and value over recent years.

The Rise of Mobile-First Networking 

The popularity, market share and value of mobile-first networks are increasing, especially if focused on a niche market.

&#8226; In August 2012, Facebook acquired Instagram for $521 million, a network without significant revenue, but a user base of approximately 100 million. &#8226; In late 2013, Facebook bid a reported $3 billion to purchase SnapChat, which was rejected by SnapChat&#8217;s Board of Directors. &#8226; In early 2014, Facebook acquired WhatsApp for a reported $18 billion in cash and stock. Additionally, there has been rapid growth in other mobile user driven niche networks, such as: Whisper (anonymous confessions) recently raised $30 million at a reported $200 million valuation; Vine (short videos) was acquired pre-launch by Twitter for $30 million; and Badoo (adventurers) has a reported valuation of $2 billion.

The Intersection of Mobile, Niche-Networking and Cannabis 

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160; 

MassRoots&#8217; top priority will remain expanding our user-base and increasing engagement on the network. In addition to strengthening MassRoots&#8217; standing within the cannabis community, public markets have placed significant value on rapidly expanding networks, as seen by the market capitalizations and price-to-earnings ratios (where applicable) in the social networking industry. As a mobile-first network focused on the cannabis industry where permitted under state laws, MassRoots is poised to take advantage of the increasing popularity of mobile devices, the emergence of a multi-billion dollar cannabis industry and the decelerating growth of Twitter and Facebook. 

Fundraising and Previous Offerings 

Since our inception, we have spent considerable effort on fundraising to support the operations of the Company. This included the following:

In connection with an offering that occurred in October 2013, the Company filed an Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation which authorized the issuance of 21 shares of preferred stock (6,397,958 common shares post-Exchange, defined below) with a par value of $1.00 per share, 17.65 shares (5,377,332 common shares post-Exchange) of which were designated as Series A Preferred Stock. Among other rights and privileges, holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to a cumulative dividend of 7% annually, preferential payments over common stock in liquidation and other events, and the ability to convert their Series A Preferred Stock to common stock on a one to one basis (taking into account any unpaid dividends).

In October 2013, the Company entered into agreements to issue 5.88, 5.88, and 5.89 Series A Preferred shares (1,791,428, 1,791,428, and 1,791,475 common shares post-Exchange) to Bass Point Capital, LLC, WM18 Finance LTD, and Rother Investments, LLC, respectively, in exchange for a $50,000 investment from each. In addition, the Company entered into an agreement to issue as compensation for services provided a total of 2.94 Series A Preferred shares (895,715 common shares post-Exchange) to Douglas Leighton for financial consulting services (collectively, the &#8220;Original Offering&#8221;). &#160; 

The Reorganization, March 2014 Offering and Registration Rights 

In preparation for the March 2014 Offering (as defined herein) and the Company&#8217;s intention of becoming a publicly traded entity, on March 18, 2014 the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization with its shareholders in which the following was effected: (i) on March 21, 2014, the Company&#8217;s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation was amended to allow for the issuance of 200,000,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock and amended the par value of the Company&#8217;s common stock to $0.001 per share; (ii) on March 24, 2014, each of the Company&#8217;s preferred shareholders converted their shares into common stock on a one for one basis (including the accrued divided); and (iii) on March 24, 2014, each of the Company&#8217;s shareholders surrendered their shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock in exchange for the pro-rata distribution of 36,000,000 newly issued shares of Company&#8217;s common stock, based on the percentage of the total shares of common stock held by the shareholder immediately prior to the exchange (the &#8220;Exchange&#8221;).

In March 2014, we raised gross proceeds of $475,000 through an offering of our securities to certain accredited and non-accredited investors consisting of: (i) $269,100 face amount of convertible debentures convertible into up to 2,691,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock at $0.10 per share (the &#8220;Debentures&#8221;), together with warrants, exercisable into an amount of our common stock equal to fifty percent (50%) of the common stock underlying the Debentures, at $0.40 per share; and (ii) 2,059,000 shares of our common stock at $0.10 per share with a warrant, exercisable into an amount of our common stock equal to fifty percent (50%) of the common stock purchased, at $0.40 per share (collectively, the &#8220;March 2014 Offering&#8221;). Five investors received Debentures and warrants, while 36 accredited and unaccredited investors received the common stock and warrants. In July 2015, one investor exchanged 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock for a warrant exercisable into 1,000,000 shares of our common stock at $0.001 per share, with materially the same terms as the $0.001 Consulting Warrants, defined below.

In connection with the March 2014 Offering, we entered into certain registration rights agreements (the &#8220;Registration Rights Agreement&#8221;), whereby we agreed to use our commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and file a registration statement with the SEC within forty-five (45) days after March 24, 2014, covering all outstanding shares of common stock (including all shares of Common Stock sold in the March 2014 Offering), in addition to all shares of common stock underlying the Debentures, Debenture Warrants, and Common Stock Warrants.

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160; 

Additionally, as payment for consulting services provided in relation to the March 2014 Offering, we issued Dutchess Opportunity Fund, II LP (&#8220;Dutchess&#8221;) a warrant exercisable into 4,050,000 shares of our common stock at $0.001 per share, and a warrant exercisable into 2,375,000 shares of our common stock at $0.40 per share. The Company also granted certain registration rights to Dutchess covering all shares of common stock issuable upon the excise of each of the warrants it received in connection to the March 2014 Offering.

On September 15, 2014 our resale registration statement on Form S-1 covering 50,400,000 shares of common stock outstanding or shares of common stock underlying warrants or debentures received in connection to the March 2014 Offering (&#8220;2014 Registration Statement&#8221;) became effective.

In March 2016, holders of the Debentures agreed to revise the maturity date of the Debentures to be March 24, 2018 from March 24, 2016.

Additional Offerings of our Securities 

From September 15, 2014 to March 11, 2015, we completed an offering of $861,000 of our securities to certain accredited and non-accredited investors consisting of 1,722,000 shares of our common stock at $0.50 per share and warrants to purchase up to 861,000 shares of common stock at $1 per share.

From April 1, 2015 through April 17, 2015, we completed an offering of 960,337 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock to certain accredited and unaccredited investors, pursuant to which, the Company received gross proceeds of $576,200. The Company terminated this offering as of April 17, 2015. The Company compensated Chardan Capital Markets, LLC, its placement agent for the offering, $20,000 in cash and 262,560 shares of common stock as commission for this placement.

From June 10, 2015 through July 13, 2015, MassRoots sold 1,540,672 shares of unregistered common stock to certain accredited investors for gross proceeds of $1,140,502. In connection with this offering, Chardan Capital, its placement agent for the offering, received $27,200 in cash and 80,560 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock as commission for this placement. 

On November 9, 2015, MassRoots sold 815,500 shares of common stock, with warrants to purchase 407,475 shares of common stock, in a registered offering to certain unaccredited and accredited investors for gross proceeds of $1,019,375 to the Company. MassRoots did not utilize a placement agent in this transaction. 

In December 2015, MassRoots issued 146,200 three year warrants with an exercise price of $1.06 to our holders of outstanding warrants issued in conjunction with our September 15, 2014 to March 11, 2015 offering. These warrants were issued in exchange for the holder agreeing to waive certain provisions providing price protection of the warrant received in the September 15, 2014 to March 11, 2015 offering. 

In March 2016, MassRoots completed a private offering (&#8220;March 2016 Note Offering&#8221;) to certain accredited investors of six (6) month secured convertible notes with a principal amount of $1,514,667 along with together with five year warrants to purchase an amount of shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock equal to the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of the notes in full and having an exercise price of $1.00 per share. The notes may be convertible into shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock at a price per share equal to the lower of (i) one dollar ($1.00), and (ii) a 25% discount to the price at which the Company next conducts an offering after the issuance date of the note; provided, however, if any part of the principal amount of the note remains unpaid at its maturity date, the conversion price would be equal to 65% of the average of the three trading days with the lowest daily weighted average prices of the Company&#8217;s common stock occurring during the fifteen days prior to the notes&#8217; maturity date. If the note is not repaid by the maturity date, the investors will receive, in aggregate but calculated pro rata to the principal amounts remaining outstanding at the time of maturity, up to five hundred thousand (500,000) shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock. Gross proceeds received by MassRoots in this offering was $1,420,000, while net proceeds were $1,271,600 (excluding any legal fees). In connection with this offering, Chardan Capital, its placement agent for the offering, received $123,400 in cash as commission for this placement. &#160; 

Employees and Consultants 

&#160; MassRoots has 33 full-time employees, two part time employees, and one full time independent contractor. &#160;

&#160; 

Amount Spent on Research and Development 

MassRoots invests a significant portion of its operating budget in developing new mobile communications tools, location-based services and in cross-platform compatibility software. We expect to spend approximately $1,500,000 during fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 on development-related payroll and expenses. We spent $651,000 on research and development-related salaries for the year ended December 31, 2015. &#160; 

Insurance 

In December 2015, MassRoots began offering health, dental and vision insurance to its employees at an estimated monthly cost of $10,000. MassRoots also carries general liability and worker&#8217;s compensation insurance for its employees. We do not currently hold any other forms of insurance. Because we do not have any insurance, if we are made a party of a legal action, we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs a judgment could be rendered against us that could cause us to cease operations. &#160; 

Government Regulation 

Marijuana is a categorized as a Schedule I controlled substance by the Drug Enforcement Agency and the United States Department of Justice and is illegal to grow, possess and consume under Federal law. However, 23 states and the District of Columbia have passed state laws that permit doctors to prescribe cannabis for medical-use and four states and the District of Columbia have enacted laws that legalize the adult-use of cannabis for any reason. This has created an unpredictable business-environment for dispensaries and collectives that legally operate under certain state laws but in violation of Federal law.

Cole Memo &#160;

On August 29, 2013, United States Deputy Attorney General James Cole issued the Cole Memo to United States Attorneys guiding them to prioritize enforcement of Federal law away from the cannabis industry operating as permitted under certain state laws, so long as: 

&#8226; cannabis is not being distributed to minors and dispensaries are not located around schools and public buildings; &#8226; the proceeds from sales are not going to gangs, cartels or criminal enterprises; &#8226; cannabis grown in states where it is legal is not being diverted to other states; &#8226; cannabis-related businesses are not being used as a cover for sales of other illegal drugs or illegal activity; &#8226; there is not any violence or use of fire-arms in the cultivation and sale of marijuana; &#8226; there is strict enforcement of drugged-driving laws and adequate prevention of adverse health consequences; and &#8226; cannabis is not grown, used, or possessed on Federal properties. The Cole Memo is meant only as a guide for United States Attorneys and does not alter in any way the Department of Justice&#8217;s authority to enforce Federal law, including Federal laws relating to cannabis, regardless of state law. We believe and have implemented procedures and policies to ensure we are operating in compliance with the &#34;Cole Memo&#34;. However, we cannot provide assurance that our actions are in full compliance with the Cole Memo or any other laws or regulations. Per MassRoots&#8217; Terms and Conditions: 

&#8226; Users must agree that they are located in a state where medical-use or adult-use of cannabis is legal; &#8226; Users must be of legal age to consume cannabis in their particular state (18 or 21 years old, depending on the state); &#8226; Users may only post content that is in compliance with their state&#8217;s laws; &#8226; Users may not solicit or distribute cannabis through MassRoots unless they are a licensed dispensary; we also do not currently facilitate in-app messaging, forcing all conversations to take place in a public environment; &#160; 13 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; Posting of any other drugs or substances, including prescription pain pills, is prohibited and will result in account termination; &#8226; Posting of any violence or threat of violence is prohibited and will result in account termination; &#8226; Posting of any drugged-driving content is prohibited and will result in account termination; and &#8226; Posting of any copyright-protected content is prohibited and will result in account termination. We have implemented an aggressive content and account review program to ensure compliance with our terms and conditions. Users have the ability to report any status or account that is in violation of our terms and we encourage users to do so as any illegal content jeopardizes the network for all our users. When a status or account is reported, the post is automatically removed from the network until further review. A MassRoots employee then reviews the content within 24 hours and either approves it as within our terms and conditions or permanently deletes it and bans the user account.

In addition, as part of the agreement to allow our app to return to the Apple App Store, we implemented restrictions to restrict new users to our mobile apps to the 23 states with medical cannabis laws. 

Our business plan includes allowing cannabis dispensaries to advertise on our network which we believe could be deemed to be aiding and abetting illegal activities, a violation of Federal law. We intend to remain within the guidelines outlined in the Cole Memo. However, we cannot provide assurance that we are in full compliance with the Cole Memo or any other laws or regulations. 

Rohrabacher Farr Amendment 

On December 16, 2014, H.R. 83 - Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 was enacted and included a provision known as the &#8220;Rohrabacher Farr Amendment&#8221; which states: 

None of the funds made available in this Act to the Department of Justice may be used, with respect to the States of Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin, to prevent such States from implementing their own State laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical marijuana. 

The Rohrabacher Farr Amendment represents one of the first times in recent history that Congress has taken action indicating support of medical cannabis. The Rohrabacher Farr Amendment was renewed by Congress in 2015 and remains in effect currently. 

However, the Rohrabacher Farr Amendment would appear to protect the right of the states to determine their own laws on medical cannabis use, the actual effects of the amendment are still unclear. The Rohrabacher Farr Amendment did not remove the federal ban on medical cannabis and cannabis remains regulated as a Schedule I controlled substance. Further, the United States Department of Justice has interpreted the Rohrabacher Farr Amendment as only preventing federal action that prevents states from creating and implementing cannabis laws &#8212; not against the individuals or businesses that actually carry out cannabis laws &#8211; and has continued to sporadically commence enforcement actions against individuals or businesses participating in the cannabis industry despite such participation being legal under state law. Whether this interpretation is appropriate is still being litigated, and, while an initial district court decision has not supported the Department of Justice&#8217;s interpretation, such decision is currently under appellate review. In addition, no matter what the interpretation is adopted by the courts, there is no question that the Rohrabacher Farr Amendment does not protect any party not in full compliance with state medicinal cannabis laws. 

&#160; 14 &#160; 

&#160; 

Potential Changes to Federal Laws and Enforcement Priorities &#160; 

Although the Department of Justice has stated in the Cole Memo that it is not an efficient use of limited resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical cannabis, there is no guarantee that the Department of Justice&#8217;s position will not change regarding the low-priority enforcement of federal laws. Further, United States is undergoing an election year in 2016 and a new administration could introduce a less favorable cannabis enforcement policy. There can be no assurances that any future administration would not change the current enforcement policy and decide to strongly enforce the federal laws. 

In light of the 2005 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Gonzales v. Raich, under the commerce clause of the constitution, Congress may pass laws to criminalize the production and use of home-grown cannabis even where states have approved its use for medicinal purposes, which leads to the conclusion that the Controlled Substances Act may preempt state laws relating to any cannabis-related activity. Any such change in the federal enforcement program of current federal laws could cause significant financial damage to our business. While we do not directly harvest, distribute, or distribute cannabis today, we still may be deemed to be violating federal law we may be irreparably harmed by a change in enforcement by the federal or state governments. 

Trademarks 

On March 31, 2014, we applied for a trademark of the &#8220;MassRoots, Inc.&#8221; name in the United States. However, several factors, including the Company&#8217;s app being removed from Apple&#8217;s iOS App Store, required the Company to focus its resources in other areas, away from completing the trademark application process, and the trademark application was deemed to be abandoned. The Company expects to reapply for this trademark in 2016. &#160; 

Competitors, Methods of Completion, Competitive Business Conditions 

We do not believe that we face significant direct competition in the &#8220;social network for the cannabis community&#8221; sector. No other network in the space currently has a significant user base or significant outside funding. 

MassRoots competes with Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, and other social networks for users&#8217; engagement; many of these competing social networks have substantially more financial resources, a better user-experience and a significantly larger user-base than MassRoots. Our differentiator is that MassRoots is solely dedicated to cannabis-related content, information most users do not feel comfortable sharing on these other networks as it may jeopardize their personal and professional reputations. Additionally, MassRoots is developing specialized features for the cannabis industry (such as a strain tagger) that competing networks likely will not spend the time and resources to develop given that only a small portion of their user-base consumes cannabis. This density of cannabis consumers and content is what makes MassRoots attractive to cannabis consumers and serves as our main competitive advantage. 

Network effects have come to dominate consumer habits, which can provide protection to networks such as MassRoots. For example, Google+ failed to obtain a dominant market share in desktop-based social networking because it wasn&#8217;t introduced until Facebook had already conquered the market. Similarly, when Facebook introduced Poke as a competitor to SnapChat in late 2012, it failed to overtake SnapChat due to the market dominance already achieved by SnapChat. Even if a well-financed competitor to MassRoots were to emerge, they would not only have to convince users on why their platform is superior, but also get them to switch away from the network their friends are already using. Every user that MassRoots gains, every interaction that takes place on our network and every day that we grow, the barrier to entry to competitors becomes higher. 

While it is true that some networks, such as Friendster and MySpace, failed after building significant user-bases, we believe a primary reason for their failure was technical: their platforms underwent routine maintenance that took the network offline for hours at a time and they did not focus on the underlying user-experience, and overwhelmed the users with advertisements. This created opportunities for well-financed competitors to emerge. We believe that by employing a similar strategy to other successful social networks and maintaining a focus on the user experience, this, combined with strong network effects of our large user-base, will allow us to create and maintain significant long-term shareholder value. 

&#160; 15 &#160; 

&#160; 

MassRoots competes with other cannabis networks such as WeedMaps, Leafly and THC Finder for advertisers&#8217; dollars. WeedMaps and THC Finder are platforms that allow users to find and review dispensaries. Leafly is primarily a strain-guide that allows users to find information on strains, add a review and find it a dispensary closest to the user. In most situations, cannabis consumers are not looking to change dispensaries often. All of these services &#8211; WeedMaps, Leafly and THC Finder &#8211; lack the daily, weekly and monthly recurring usage that drives long-term value for advertisers. We believe that MassRoots&#8217; recurring usage and the ability to target advertisements to users based on their previous posts will present a superior value proposition to advertisers.
