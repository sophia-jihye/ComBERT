Our Business Development 

&#160;

We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on June 24, 1997 and in July 2004 we acquired PSI-TEC Corporation (&#147; PSI-TEC &#148;) as a wholly owned subsidiary. PSI-TEC was founded in 1991 and incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on September 12, 1995. Dr. Frederick J. Goetz founded PSI-TEC in Upland, Pennsylvania where he established a laboratory with a small amount of private funding. PSI-TEC subsequently moved its operations to laboratory space provided by the U.S. Army on the Aberdeen Proving Grounds in cooperation with a division of the Department of Defense for the advancement of ultra wide-bandwidth satellite telecommunications. Thereafter, PSI-TEC commenced operations of its own organic synthesis and thin-films laboratory in Wilmington, Delaware.

On October 2006, in order to consolidate our operations, we merged with PSI-TEC Corp. and changed our name to Third-Order Nanotechnologies, Inc. In March 2008 we changed our name to Lightwave Logic, Inc. to better suit our strategic business plan and to facilitate stockholder recognition of our Company and our business.

Overview 

We are a development stage, electro-optical device and organic nonlinear materials company. Our primary area of expertise is the chemical synthesis of chromophore dyes used in the development of organic Application Specific Electro-Optic Polymers (ASEOP) and Organic Non-Linear All-Optical Polymers (NLAOP) that have high electro-optic and optical activity. Our family of materials is thermally and photo-chemically stable, which we believe could have utility across a broad range of applications in devices that address markets like, telecommunication, data communications, high-speed computing and photovoltaic cells. Secondarily, the company is developing proprietary electro-optical and all-optical devices utilizing the advanced capabilities of our materials for the application in the fields mentioned above.

Electro-optic devices convert data from electric signals into optical signals for use in communications systems and in optical interconnects for high-speed data transfer. We expect our patented and patent-pending optical materials, when completed and tested, to be the core of the future generations of optical devices, modules, sub-systems and systems that we will develop or be licensed by electro-optic device manufacturers, such as telecommunications component and systems manufacturers, networking and switching suppliers, semiconductor companies, aerospace companies and government agencies.

Our optical polymers (polymers) are property-engineered at the molecular level (nanotechnology level) to meet the exacting thermal, environmental and performance specifications demanded by electro-optic devices. We believe that our patented and patent pending technologies will enable us to design optical polymers that are free from the numerous diverse and inherent flaws that plague competitive polymer technologies employed by other companies and research groups. We engineer our polymers with the intent to have temporal, thermal, chemical and photochemical stability within our patented and patent pending molecular architectures.

Our non-linear all optical polymers have demonstrated resonantly enhanced third-order properties approximately 2,630 times larger than fused silica, which means that they are highly photo-optically active in the absence of an RF layer. In this way they differ from other optical polymers and are considered more advanced next-generation materials.

Our patented and patent pending molecular architectures are based on a well-understood chemical and quantum mechanical occurrence known as aromaticity. Aromaticity provides a high degree of molecular stability. Aromaticity is what will enable our core molecular structures to maintain stability under a broad range of polymerization conditions that otherwise appear to affect other current polymer molecular designs. Polymers, polymer-based devices, hybrid devices and the processes used to create them are often patentable, which can provide the developers of such technology with a significant competitive advantage. We consider our proprietary intellectual property to be unique.

Glossary of Select Technology Terms Used Herein 

All-optical devices 

All-optical devices convert data in the form of input light signals to a secondary light data stream. The future market of all-optical devices and switches is expected to include all-optical switches.

Electro-optic devices 

Electro-optic devices convert data from electric signals into optical signals for use in communications systems and in optical interconnects for high-speed data transfer.

Electro-optic material 

Electro-optic material is the core active ingredient in high-speed fiber-optic telecommunication systems. Electro-optic materials are materials that are engineered at the molecular level. Molecular level engineering is commonly referred to as &#147;nanotechnology.&#148;

Electro-optic modulators 

Electro-optic modulators are electro-optic devices that perform electric-to-optic conversions within the infrastructure of the Internet. Data centers may also benefit from this technology through devices that could significantly increase bandwidth and speed while decreasing costs.

Photonic Devices 

Photonic devices are components for creating, manipulating or detecting light. This can include modulators, laser diodes, light-emitting diodes, solar and photovoltaic cells, displays and optical amplifiers. Other examples are devices for modulating a beam of light and for combining and separating beams of light of different wavelength. 

Polymers 

Polymers, also known as plastics, are large carbon-based molecules that bond many small molecules together to form a long chain. Polymer materials can be engineered and optimized using nanotechnology to create a system in which unique surface, electrical, chemical and electro-optic characteristics can be controlled. Materials based on polymers are used in a multitude of industrial and consumer products, from automotive parts to home appliances and furniture, as well as scientific and medical equipment.

Our Business 

Lightwave Logic, Inc. is developing a new generation of advanced organic nonlinear chromophores to be used to make electro-optic polymer material systems and non-linear all-optical polymer material systems. We are developing a new generation of photonic devices that utilize our unique polymer based material systems. These polymer based material systems, when used in modulators or waveguide structures, can convert high-speed electronic signals into optical (light) signals for use in communications systems, high-speed data transfer or advanced high speed computing. Our Company is developing proprietary all-optical devices utilizing the advanced capabilities of our materials for the application mentioned above. These all-optical devices use light waves to switch other light waves meaning these material systems have third-order properties.

Inorganic material with electro-optic characteristics is the core active ingredient in high-speed fiber-optic telecommunication systems. Utilizing our proprietary technology, we are in the process of engineering advanced organic electro-optic polymer material systems that we believe may lead to significant performance advancements, component size and cost reduction, ease of processing, and thermal and temporal stability. We believe that our electro-optic polymer material systems engineered at the molecular level may have a significant role in the future development of commercially significant electro-optic related products.

Our organic electro-optic polymer material systems work by affecting the optical properties of light in the presence of an electric field at extremely high frequencies (wide bandwidths), but possess inherent advantages to inorganic materials.

Currently, the core electro-optic material contained in most modulators is a crystalline material, such as lithium niobate, indium phosphide and gallium arsenide. The following chart describes some of the characteristics of crystalline materials and electro-optical polymers.

Crystalline Materials 

Electro-optical Polymers 

&#160;

&#160;

Must be manufactured in strict dust-free conditions since even slight contamination can render them inoperable

Capable of being manufactured in less stringent environmental conditions. Capable of being tailored at the molecular level for optimal performance characteristics

More expensive to manufacture

Less expensive to manufacture

Limited to telecommunication speeds that are less than 40Gb/s (40 billion digital bits of data per second)

Demonstrated the ability to perform at speeds that are greater than 100Gb/s (100 billion digital bits of data per second)

Lithium niobate devices require large power levels (modulation voltages) to operate and are large in size -- typically measuring about four inches long (considering that most integrated circuits are literally invisible to the naked eye, these devices are enormous)

Require significantly lower power levels, up to 60% less (modulation voltages) to operate and are capable of miniaturization

Requires more elaborate, expensive mechanical packaging (housings) generally comprised of materials, such as gold-plated Kovar, in order to assure operational integrity over required time and operating temperature ranges

Initial tests indicate no requirement for more elaborate, expensive packaging (housings)

We consider organic polymers with electro-optic qualities to be the most feasible technology for future high-speed (wide bandwidth) electronic-optical conversion. Due to the ease of processing afforded by electro-optic polymers, as well as their capacity to foster component size reduction, we believe electro-optic polymers have the potential to replace more expensive, lower-performance materials and devices used in fiber-optic ground, wireless and satellite communication networks that are used today in commercial and military telecommunications and advanced computational systems.

We also believe potential future applications may include: (i) cloud computing and data centers; (ii) telecommunications/data communications; (iii) backplane optical interconnects; (iv) photovoltaic cells; (v) medical applications; (vi) satellite reconnaissance; (vii) navigation systems; (viii) radar applications; (ix) optical filters; (x) spatial light modulators; and (xi) all-optical switches.

Our Electro-Optic Technology Approach 

Our proposed solution to produce high-performance, high-stability electro-optic polymers for high-speed (wide bandwidth) telecommunication applications lies in a less mainstream, yet firmly established, scientific phenomenon called aromaticity. Aromaticity causes a high degree of molecular stability. It is a molecular arrangement wherein atoms combine into multi-membered rings and share their electrons among each other. Aromatic compounds are stable because the electronic charge distributes evenly over a great area preventing hostile moieties, such as oxygen and free radicals, from finding an opening to attack.

For the past two decades, diverse corporate interests, including, to our knowledge, IBM, Lockheed Martin, DuPont, AT&#38;T Bell Labs, Honeywell and 3M, as well as numerous universities and U.S. Government Agencies, have been attempting to produce high-performance, high-stability electro-optic polymers for high-speed (wide bandwidth) telecommunication applications. These efforts have largely been unsuccessful due, in our opinion, to the industry's singular adherence to an industry pervasive engineering model known as the Bond Length Alternation (&#34;BLA&#34;) theory model. The BLA model, like all other current industry-standard molecular designs, consists of molecular designs containing long strings of atoms called polyene chains. Longer polyene chains provide higher electro-optic performance, but are also more susceptible to environmental threats, which result in unacceptably low-performing, thermally unstable electro-optic polymers.

As a result, high frequency modulators engineered with electro-optic polymers designed on the BLA model or any other polyene chain design models are unstable over typical operating temperature ranges, and often exhibit performance degradation within days, hours or even minutes. Similarly, lower frequency modulators exhibit comparable failings, but to a lesser extent. These flaws, in most cases, have prevented commercial quality polymer-based modulators operating at 10-40Gb/s from entering the commercial marketplace. The thermal stability of these devices does not generally meet the minimum Telcordia GR-468 operating temperature range (-40 degrees Celsius to +85 degrees Celsius) much less the more harsh MILSPEC 883D (military specification) range of -55 degrees Celsius to 150 degrees Celsius.

None of our patented molecular designs rely on the BLA polyene chain design model.

Heterocyclical Chromophore Architectures with Novel Electronic Acceptor Systems

Heterocyclical Anti-Aromatic Systems Two of our provisional patents cover heterocyclical anti-aromatic electronic conductive pathways, which are the heart of our high-performance, high-stability molecular designs. The completely heterocyclical nature of our molecular designs &#34;lock&#34; conductive atomic orbitals into a planar (flat) configuration, which provides improved electronic conduction and a significantly lower reaction to environmental threats (e.g. thermal, chemical, photochemical, etc.) than the BLA design paradigm employed by other competitive electro-optic polymers.

The anti-aromatic nature of these structures dramatically improves the &#34;zwitterionic-aromatic push-pull&#34; of the systems, providing for low energy charge transfer. Low energy charge transfer is important for the production of extremely high electro-optic character.

Heterocyclical Steric Hindering System This patent describes a nitrogenous heterocyclical structure for the integration of steric hindering groups that are necessary for the nanoscale material integration. Due to the [pi]-orbital configuration of the nitrogen bridge, this structure has been demonstrated not to interfere with the conductive nature of the electronic conductive pathway and thus is non-disruptive to the electro-optic character of the core molecular construction. The quantum mechanical design of the system is designed to establish complete molecular planarity (flatness) for optimal performance.

Totally Integrated Material Engineering System This patent covers material integration structures under a design strategy known as Totally Integrated Material Engineering. These integration structures provide for the &#34;wrapping&#34; of the core molecule in sterically hindering groups that maximally protect the molecule from environmental threats and maximally protect it from microscopic aggregation (which is a major cause of performance degradation and optical loss) within a minimal molecular volume. These structures also provide for the integration of polymerizable groups for integration of materials into a highly stable cross-linked material matrix.

Historic Breakthroughs and Results 

During 2004, independent quantum mechanical calculations performed on our electro-optic polymer designs at government laboratories located at the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division in China Lake, California suggested that our initial aromatic molecules perform two and a half (2.5) to three and three-tenths (3.3) times more efficiently than currently available telecom grade electro-optic polymers. Our conclusion was that performance improvements of this magnitude indicate a significant breakthrough in the field of fiber-optic telecommunication.

In May and June of 2006, performance evaluations of one of our first extremely high-performance electro-optic materials were performed by electro-optic expert, Dr. C.C. Teng, co-inventor of the renowned Teng-Man test, and subsequently confirmed by the University of Arizona's College of Optical Sciences. Under identical laboratory conditions at low molecular loadings, one of our molecular designs outperformed one of the industry's highest performance electro-optic systems by a factor as high as 650%. Our conclusion was that the Teng-Man test established the validity of our novel, patent pending molecular design paradigm known as CSC (Cyclical Surface Conduction) theory; and that the success of CSC theory has the potential to establish the fundamental blueprint of electro-optic material design for decades to come, and to have broad application in commercial and military telecommunication and advanced computational systems.

On September 25, 2006 we obtained independent laboratory results that confirmed the thermal stability of our Perkinamine&#153; electro-optic materials. Thermal stability as high as 350 degrees Celsius was confirmed, significantly exceeding many other then commercially available high performance electro-optic materials, such as CLD-1 that exhibits thermal degradation in the range of 250 degrees Celsius to 275 degrees Celsius. This high temperature stability of our materials eliminates a major obstacle to vertical integration of electro-optic polymers into standard microelectronic manufacturing processes (e.g. wave/vapor-phase soldering) where thermal stability of at least 300 degrees Celsius is required. In independent laboratory tests, ten-percent material degradation, a common evaluation of overall thermal stability, did not occur until our Perkinamine&#153; materials base was exposed to temperatures as high as 350 degrees Celsius, as determined by Thermo-Gravimetric Analysis (TGA). The test results supported our Company's progress to introduce our materials into commercial applications such as optical interconnections, high-speed telecom and datacom modulators, and military/aerospace components.

On September 26, 2006, we were awarded the 2006 Electro-Optic Materials Technology Innovation of the Year Award by Frost &#38; Sullivan. Frost &#38; Sullivan's Technology Innovation of the Year Award is bestowed upon candidates whose original research has resulted in innovations that have, or are expected to bring, significant contributions to multiple industries in terms of adoption, change, and competitive posture. This award recognizes the quality and depth of our Company's research and development program as well as the vision and risk-taking that enabled us to undertake such an endeavor.

In July 2007, our Company developed an innovative process to integrate our unique architecture into our anticipated commercial devices, whereby dendritic spacer systems are attached to its core chromophore. In the event we are successful in developing a commercially viable product, we believe these dendrimers will reduce the cost of manufacturing materials and reduce the cost and complexity of tailoring the material to specific customer requirements.

In March 2008, we commenced production of our first prototype photonic chip, which we delivered to Photon-X, LLC to fabricate a prototype polymer optical modulator and measure its technical properties. In June 2009 we released test results conducted by Dr. C.C. Teng that re-confirmed our previous test results.

In August 2009, Photon-X, LLC commenced a compatibility study, process sequences, and fabricated wafers/chips containing arrays of phase modulators. The first one hundred plus modulators (bench top devices) were completed at the end of October 2009, and were successfully characterized for insertion loss, Vpi, modulation dynamic range and initial frequency response in March 2010. The multi-step manufacturing process we utilized to fabricate our modulators involved exposing our proprietary Perkinamine&#153; materials to extreme conditions that are typically found in standard commercial manufacturing settings. Our step-by-step analysis throughout the fabrication process demonstrated to us that our Perkinamine&#153; materials could successfully withstand each step of the fabrication process without damage.

In August 2009, we retained Perdix, Inc. in Boulder, Colorado to help us identify and build prototype products for high growth potential target markets in fiber optic telecommunications systems. During October 2009, we initiated the development and production of our prototype amplitude modulator, which can ultimately be assembled into 1- and 2-dimensional arrays that are useful for optical computing applications, such as encryption and pattern recognition. We expected our initial prototype amplitude modulator to be completed by the end of the second quarter 2010. We continued to work on this device throughout 2010 and discovered its design had limitations so we terminated the program to take a different design approach. We embarked on the new design approach in 2011 with another partner, Boulder Nonlinear Systems (BNS). A feasibility study with our new design partner was started in late 2011. This research and development program continued through 2013, and was completed the end of the third quarter of 2013. The results of this study gave us a guide on how to move forward with the design of our prototype spatial light modulator. The second phase of the program is under review and we expected to start the second phase sometime the second half of 2014; but funding for phase two of this program was delayed. We hope to reengage our work on this program after funding is approved.

In March 2010 we successfully concluded initial electrical and optical performance testing of our prototype phase modulator and began Application Engineering of our technology in customer design environments and working directly with interested large system suppliers to attempt to engineer specific individual product materials and device designs for sale to or by these suppliers. Those programs were subsequently put on hold by the system suppliers.

In October of 2010, we completed the concept stage of a novel design for an advanced optical computing application and moved forward into the design stage with Celestech, Inc. of Chantilly, Virginia. Several projects with Celestech are currently on hold. If these projects move forward, they will incorporate one or more of our Company&#146;s advanced electro-optical polymer materials.

In October of 2010 we announced the results of testing performed by Lehigh University that demonstrated the third-order non-linear properties of our proprietary molecules in the PerkinamineNR&#153; chromophore class. Lehigh University determined that the material was 100 times stronger than the highest off-resonance small molecule currently known. They also determined that it was 2,600 times more powerful than fused silica and demonstrated extremely fast (less than 1 picosecond) photo-induced non-linear response that would be capable of modulation at rates of 1 THz (terahertz). Additional testing at Lehigh University of the Company&#146;s other Perkinamine&#153; class of materials demonstrated third-order non-linear properties, which may have utility in all optical switches.

In March 2011 we entered into a research and development agreement with the City University of New York&#146;s Laboratory for Nano Micro Photonics (LaNMP) to develop third-order non-linear devices. The combination of LaNMP&#146;s device capabilities together with our materials expertise should accelerate the development of all-optical devices. This effort, starting with an all-optical switch, was continued at the University of Colorado, Boulder through an agreement entered into in January 2013. This research and development effort continued through 2014, but not at the pace we expected. In the future we hope to engage a product development partner, which should accelerate the product development program.

In March 2011, we entered into a research and development agreement with the City University of New York&#146;s (&#147;CUNY&#148;) Laboratory for Nano Micro Photonics (LaNMP) to develop third-order non-linear devices. The combination of LaNMP&#146;s device capabilities together with our materials expertise showed promise for the development of all-optical devices. The agreement ran through the end of 2011. The goal of the project was to fabricate and test slot waveguides embedded with two types of nonlinear optical polymers obtained from our Company. These two polymers were Perkinamine&#153; and PerkinamineNR&#153;. In CUNY&#146;s final report it showed they successfully demonstrated that the Perkinamine&#153; and PerkinamineNR&#153; survived their 170 degrees C processing temperature without degradation. According to their report, they were successful in one processing run wherein they showed the possibility to realize waveguides with very smooth sidewalls. Reflectivity measurements carried out under optical pumping showed phase shift in the Perkinamine&#153; material.

In March 2011 we announced a two-year research and development collaboration with the University of Alabama to explore the advanced energy capture properties of our Perkinamine&#153; class of chromophores. Our material absorbs light across a wide range of wavelengths from near infrared into the near ultraviolet. We have subsequently ended our relationship with the University.

In December 2011, we announced the discovery of a new material named Perkinamine Indigo&#153;. We believed this represented a major advancement in the field of organic nonlinear optical materials. We have much to learn about how to harness full potential of Perkinamine Indigo&#153;. The material demonstrated an unusually high electro-optical effect of greater than 250 picometers per volt at 1550 nanometers with excellent thermal and photo stability. Independent research laboratories at Micron Inc., Photon-X and The University of Colorado confirmed these characteristics. Subsequent measurements showed electro-optical effects closer to 100 picometers per volt in a 500 nm thin films. We continued the development work to better understand these results. In January 2014 we created a new methodology to combine multiple chromophores into a single polymer host that significantly improved our ability to create more powerful organic, nonlinear electro-optical polymer systems. The new synthetic chemistry process can enable multiple chromophores (dyes) to work in concert with each other within a single polymer host. This proprietary process has created two new material systems, which have demonstrated outstanding electro-optic values. In addition, initial thermal stability results exceed any commercially available organic nonlinear polymer material systems.

In June 2012 we opened a new internal research laboratory facility in Newark, Delaware in the Delaware Technology Park, near the University of Delaware. This new lab facility enables us to synthesize and test our materials in the same facility and will help us accelerate our development efforts. It is equipped with state of the art equipment necessary to expand our ability to conduct synthetic chemistry in much more tightly controlled conditions. Additionally, we equipped a separate advanced optical laboratory at the same location where the necessary testing of material candidates will be performed as they emerge from our new synthesis laboratory. The optical laboratory has subsequently been moved to Longmont, CO.

In July 2012 we entered into an agreement with The University of Colorado, Boulder, Guided Wave Optics Laboratory (GWOL) to conduct analytical testing and to carry out studies that will give a better understanding of the properties of a new class of composite organic electro-optic materials. This class of materials was our Perkinamine Indigo&#153;. The processing and measurements were carried out primarily at the university&#146;s GWOL. The work was completed in close collaboration with Company personnel. It was determined a new synthetic chemistry and material process methodology was needed for consistent and repeatable results. That methodology was announced in January 2014.

In February 2013 we delivered to a potential large system supplier customer prototype devices that were coated with our advanced organic nonlinear electro-optical polymer, Perkinamine Indigo&#153;. Tests conducted by the University of Colorado, Boulder on coupons coated with the material demonstrated R 33 measurements from 100-125 picometers per volt, as measured by the University of Colorado which exceeded the potential large system supplier customer's stated electro-optical requirements. 

In March 2013 we entered into a product development contractor agreement with EM Photonics (EMP) of Newark, Delaware to fabricate and test waveguides and phase modulators during an initial development phase using existing EMP polymer modulator design and processes. In June 2013 we consolidated the EMP design program into our University of Colorado, Boulder (UCB) program after we fabricated structures with UCB that will be used as the basic building blocks of our Integrated Optical Device effort for the construction of both our advanced telecom modulator and data communications transceiver. In August 2013 in a combined effort of the Company&#146;s chemists, the University of Colorado, Boulder, and a third party research group, we successfully fabricated Silicon Organic Hybrid (SOH) slot waveguide modulators. The devices utilized an existing modulator structure with one of our proprietary electro-optic polymer material systems as the enabling material layer. In October 2013, we confirmed the functionality of the SOH slot waveguide modulators as operating devices. 

In April 2013 our potential large system supplier customer informed us that their preliminary testing results on the prototype devices coated with Perkinamine Indigo&#153; that we delivered to them in February 2013 demonstrated several of the key performance parameters that they desired. There were additional tests that need to be completed. We worked with our potential customer utilizing our Perkinamine&#153; family of chromophores in a number of host polymers to evaluate these polymers in conjunction with our chromophores for a specific performance attributes for their application. Currently, this customer&#146;s program is on hold, and we do not know when or if this program will restart. We are currently talking to other potential new development partners.

In August 2013 in a combined effort of the Company&#146;s chemists, the University of Colorado, Boulder, and a third party research group we successfully fabricated Silicon Organic Hybrid (SOH) slot waveguide modulators. The devices utilized an existing modulator structure with one of our proprietary electro-optic polymer material systems as the enabling material layer. In October 2013, we confirmed the functionality of the SOH slot waveguide modulators as operating prototype devices. These first-generation devices have achieved greater electro-optical activity and dramatically lower drive voltage than industry standard modulators based on inorganic materials. We continued this effort in 2014 and have signed an agreement with the third party research group to continue our collaboration through 2016. 

In November 2013, preliminary testing and initial data on our SOH slot waveguide modulators demonstrated several promising characteristics. The tested SOH chip had a 1-millimeter square footprint, enabling the possibility of sophisticated integrated optical circuits on a single silicon substrate. In addition, the waveguide structure was approximately 1/20 the length of a typical inorganic-based silicon photonics modulator waveguide. With the combination of our proprietary electro-optic polymer material and the extremely high optical field concentration in the slot waveguide modulator, the test modulators demonstrated less than 2.2 volts to operate. Initial speeds exceeded 30-35 GhZ in the telecom, 1550 nanometer frequency band. This is equivalent to four, 10Gb/sec, inorganic, lithium niobate modulators that would require approximately 12-16 volts to move the same amount of information. Our material also operates in the 1310 nanometer frequency band, which is suitable for data communications applications.

In January 2014 we created a new methodology to combine multiple chromophores into a single polymer host that significantly improves their ability to generate more powerful organic, nonlinear electro-optical polymer systems. The new synthetic chemistry process can enable multiple chromophores (dyes) to work in concert with each other within a single polymer host. This proprietary process has created two new material systems, which have demonstrated outstanding electro-optic values. In addition, we now have a significant amount of data on the thermal aging of our materials. We have demonstrated that our materials can withstand more than 2,000 hours at 110 degrees C with little to no change in electro-optic activity in our materials, which is a significant milestone. To our knowledge, this is something that has not been achieved before in any polymer. We are also concurrently coating prototype waveguides with our proprietary material system.

In February 2014 we received our first purchase order for our advanced organic nonlinear electro-optic polymer from Boulder Nonlinear Systems (BNS) of Boulder, Colorado in connection with the development of a next generation LADAR system. A LADAR system is a radar system that utilizes a pulse laser to calculate the distance to a target, but is also capable of rendering a 3-D image. In the event BNS continues to move forward with the development of this LADAR system, we expect to receive additional purchase orders from BNS.

In March 2014 we began the process of manufacturing an advanced design Silicon Organic Hybrid Transceiver prototype and we released the completed chip design to the OpSIS Center at the University of Delaware who contracted with a third party to produce the initial silicon chips, which were delivered to us in December 2014 and January 2015. We are currently qualifying and testing these chips for utilization in our Silicon Organic Transceiver. The initial application will target inter-data center interconnections of more than 10 kilometers. Our next design will utilize a different frequency and address the current bottleneck in the rack-to-server layer at distances greater than 500 meters.

In April 2014 we entered into a sole worldwide license agreement with Corning Incorporated enabling us to integrate Corning's organic electro-optical chromophores into our portfolio of electro-optic polymer materials. The agreement allows us to use the licensed patents within a defined license field that includes communications, computing, power, and power storage applications utilizing the nonlinear optical properties of their materials. 

In August 2014 the University of Colorado successfully fabricated and tested a bleached electro-optic waveguide modulator designed and fabricated through a sponsored collaborative research agreement. The results of this initial bleached waveguide modulator correlated well with previous electro-optic thin film properties. These initial results of our first in-house device were significant to our entire device program and were an important starting point for our current modulators that are being developed for target markets. We have multiple generations of new materials that we are optimizing for this specific design.

In October 2014 we submitted an order with Reynard Corporation to produce gold-layered fused silica substrates for our bleached waveguide modulators to be coated with several of our organic electro-optical polymers, which we received in early November and performance tested throughout December. In May, 2015, we subsequently decided to eliminate this product from our commercial development plans due to its limited commercial value, low speed characteristics, difficulty to mass-produce and limited ability to integrate with existing architectures. In lieu of this development program, a commercially viable prototype ridge waveguide modulator program was started to replace the bleached waveguide development. We believe that the ridge waveguide modulator represents a viable telecom device opportunity for the Company that does not have the inherent limitations seen in bleached waveguide structures.

In May 2015 we achieved operating capability of our in-house Class 100 Clean Room where we expect to do thin film processing and complete the development of prototype photonic devices enabled by our advanced organic electro-optic polymer material systems in a timelier manner. Additionally, the Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics (JILA) certified three of our employees, which allows us access to JILA&#146;s world-class semiconductor facility located at the University of Colorado, Boulder. Access to this facility provides us with better control over the quality of our development work and the speed at which it progresses. 

In August 2015 we completed 2,000+ hours of thermal aging tests of several blends of materials created by our multi-chromophore process, which included lengthy exposure to high temperatures (85 0 C and 110 0 C). The data collected indicated minimal loss of electro-optical activity (R 33 ) of our materials, which means that our organic polymers are expected to provide decades of operational performance. These results exceed previously published efforts for other organic polymers and are an important part of our commercialization effort as we begin to implement these material systems into advanced photonic devices for the telecom and datacom markets. 

Additionally, in August 2015, we completed 500+ hours of photochemical stability testing of our material candidates by exposing them to the visible light spectrum. The data collected indicated no discernible change in the chemical structures in an oxygen free environment. This stability testing was begun to help us understand more clearly the processing and manufacturing requirements of our future commercial products, and provide initial assurances to expect the same results as we move these materials into an actual photonic device structures. This, in turn, has enabled us to begin initial device testing on devices that utilize our silicon photonic chips.

In October 2015, we successfully surpassed 2000 hours of photochemical stability testing of our material candidates with little to no change in the electro-optic characteristics (R 33 ) of our material; and, in January 2016, we successfully surpassed 4000 hours of photochemical stability testing of our material candidates with little to no change in the electro-optic characteristics (R 33 ) of our material. These photochemical stability test results, along with the thermal stability at 110&#176;C, should enable the Company to demonstrate that organic polymers can compete head-to-head with inorganic crystalline legacy telecom and datacom devices which currently provide the backbone for the entire infrastructure that converts almost incalculable amounts of electronic (binary) data into pulses of light and back on a daily basis.

In November of 2015, we successfully fabricated ridge waveguide structures from our core material system. At the same time we successfully developed a proprietary methodology to segment individual chips from our silicon wafers that contain our ridge waveguide devices. These critical steps in our process provide us with a clear path towards a commercial telecommunication device. These same processes can be used for the fabrication of modulators to be used in data centers. The individual chips are now being analyzed and passively tested in our Longmont, CO optical test facility. 

In February 2016, we successfully guided laser single-mode light through 16 of our passive ridge waveguides made entirely out of our advanced organic polymer systems, which are the building block of waveguide modulators that can achieve high modulator performance. As a result, our commercialization effort has entered the next phases of development: passive-waveguide loss measurements, followed by the development and active testing of electro-optic modulators. Utilizing continuous-wave input laser light, electro-optic modulators convert digital (binary) electrical data into output pulses of light that can be transported across fiber optic communication networks. Active testing is accomplished by applying an electrical signal to a modulator and evaluating the resulting output optical signal. 

Presently, we are continuing to move towards completion of our operating organic polymer-enabled ridge waveguide modulator prototype using our new multi-chromophore material systems. 

We ultimately intend to use our next-generation electro-optic polymer material systems and non-linear all-optical polymer material systems for future applications vital to the following industries. We expect to create specific materials for each of these applications as appropriate:

&#160;

&#183;

Cloud computing and data centers

Telecommunications/data communications

&#183;

Backplane optical interconnects

&#183;

Navigation systems

&#183;

Radar applications

&#183;

Optical filters

&#183;

Spatial light modulators

&#183;

In an effort to maximize our future revenue stream from our electro-optic polymer material systems and non-linear all-optical polymer material systems, our business model anticipates that our revenue stream will be derived from one or some combination of the following: (i) technology licensing for specific product applications; (ii) joint venture relationships with significant industry leaders; or (iii) the production and direct sale of our own photonic device components. Our objective is to be a leading provider of proprietary technology and know-how in the photonic device markets. In order to meet this objective, subject to successful testing of our technology and having available financial resources, we intend to:

&#183;

Continue to develop proprietary intellectual property

&#183;

Streamline our product development process

The Electro-Optic Device Market 

General 

Electro-optic devices such as fiber-optic modulators translate electric signals into optical signals. Such devices are used in communication systems to transfer data over fiber-optic networks. Optical data transfer is significantly faster and more efficient than transfer technologies using only electric signals, permitting more cost-effective use of bandwidth for broadband Internet and voice services.

Two distinct technologies currently exist for the fabrication of fiber-optic devices, such as fiber-optic modulators. The first, which is the more traditional technology, utilizes an electro-optically active inorganic core crystalline material (e.g. lithium niobate). The second, which is the focus of the Company&#146;s research and development, involves the exploitation of electro-optic polymers.

Traditional Technology - Inorganic Crystals 

Traditional technology translates electric signals into optical signals generally relying upon electro-optic materials, such as lithium niobate, indium phosphide and gallium arsenide. Five of the largest inorganic fiber-optic component manufactures hold approximately 85% of the electro-optic modulator component market. They are JDSU, Sumitomo, Oclaro, Fujitsu and ThorLabs. These companies are heavily invested in the production of crystalline-based electro-optic modulator technologies, as well as the development of novel manufacturing techniques and integrated laser/modulator designs. While each company possesses their own modulator design and processing patents, the underlying core constituents (lithium niobate, indium phosphide, gallium arsenide) occur in nature and as such cannot be patented.

New Technology - Organic Polymers 

Our developing technology that translates electric signals into optical signals relies upon organic electro-optic materials, such as electro-optic polymers. Electro-optic polymers involve the material integration of specifically engineered organic (carbon-based) compounds. The molecular designs of these compounds are precise and do not occur naturally; thus they may be protected under patent law.

Polymer-based electro-optic modulators may provide considerable advantages over traditional inorganic fiber-optic technology in terms of:

&#160;

&#183;

Cost

&#160;

&#183;

Size and versatility

&#160;

&#183;

Modulating/switching speed

&#160;

&#183;

Optical transmission properties

&#160;

&#183;

Lower operating voltages

&#160;

&#183;

Generate less heat

Our Company holds an extensive amount of internally developed intellectual property in the field of electro-optic molecular design that, as a whole, attempts to fundamentally solve these and other problems associated with these molecular structures. We believe our provisional patents describe broad, highly unique techniques for novel paradigms in molecular design.

Our innovative solution lies in a very well known scientific phenomenon called aromaticity, which causes a high degree of molecular stability. Aromaticity is a molecular arrangement wherein atoms combine into multi-membered rings and share their electrons among each other. Aromatic compounds are extremely stable because the electronic charge distributes evenly over a great area preventing hostile moieties, such as oxygen and free radicals, from finding an opening to attack. Until now, to our knowledge, no one has been able to propose molecular designs that could effectively exploit aromaticity in the design of a high-performance electro-optic polymer.

We believe now that we have fabricated electro-optic molecular architectures that do in fact exhibit extremely high thermal stability, our technologies may soon replace inorganic electro-optic materials in the marketplace due to their considerable advantages over traditional inorganic fiber-optic materials.

Our Target Markets 

Our proprietary electro-optic polymers are designed at the molecular level for potentially superior performance, stability and cost-efficiency and we believe may have the potential to replace more expensive, lower-performance materials and devices used in fiber-optic ground, wireless and satellite communication networks. We believe our organic electro-optic polymers may have broad applications in civilian and military telecommunications and advanced computational systems. Potential future applications may include: (i) cloud computing and data centers; (ii) telecommunications/data communications; (iii) backplane optical interconnects; (iv) photovoltaic cells; (v) medical applications; (vi) satellite reconnaissance; (vii) navigation systems; (viii) radar applications; (ix) optical filters; (x) spatial light modulators; and (xi) all-optical switches.

Cloud computing and data centers 

Big data is a general term used to describe the voluminous amount of unstructured and semi-structured data a company creates -- data that would take too much time and cost too much money to load into a relational database for analysis. Companies are looking to cloud computing in their data centers to access all the data. Inherent speed and bandwidth limits of traditional solutions and the potential of organic polymer devices offer an opportunity to increase the bandwidth, reduce costs and improve speed of access.

Telecommunications/Data Communications 

Telecommunications is one of the primary initial target applications for electro-optic polymers. Telecommunication companies are currently faced with the enormous challenge to keep up with the tremendous explosion in demand for bandwidth due to the popularity of Internet enabled devices accessing all forms of streaming media, along with voice messaging, text messaging and cloud based data access.

The challenge for these companies is converting digital information in the form of electric signals into optical information and back. Their networks rely upon optical modulators based around inorganic materials, such as lithium niobate, to accomplish this task. These existing legacy modulators have inherent limitations in terms of maximum data rates, error correction, and costs associated with their manufacture and other operating costs related to drive voltage and heat dissipation due to the complexities of producing single crystalline ingots of sufficient diameter (3 to 5 inches). Also, strict environmental controls must be enforced during the growth of the core crystalline material.

Replacing these inorganic materials with organic polymer materials made with the Perkinamine&#153; family of chromophores would offer significant improvements in data rates; reduce form factor; require less error correction along with a significant reduction in drive voltage leading to less heat dissipation and hence reduce the overall cost of operation with regard to site cooling. Polymers are not inherently costly to produce nor do they require such strict environmental conditions. Due to their material flexibility (e.g. ability to more easily mold into specific topologies) they are expected to enable smaller, faster, less expensive, and more integrated network components. In many laboratory tests, electro-optic polymers have demonstrated substantial (3-10x) transmission data speed improvements over crystalline technologies (lithium niobate, gallium arsenide, indium phosphide).

Backplane Optical Interconnects 

Organic nonlinear polymer based devices offer advantages in Active Optical cables that are used in data communications in computer-to-computer or server-to-server applications. It is reported that backplane optical interconnects are envisioned by members within leading corporations (including IBM, Intel and Agilent Technologies) as the future of high-speed computation. These components can potentially replace copper circuitry with photons carrying digital information over fiber optic cable in CPU architecture to manage CPU-to-graphics, CPU&#150;to-memory and CPU-to-I/O device interactions that have previously operated over an internal electrical bus. On-Chip optical buses can increase performance and decrease cost. They could speed the transmission of information within an integrated circuit, among integrated circuit chips in a module, and across circuit boards at speeds unattainable with traditional metallic interconnections and bus structures. Additionally, our organic polymer material possesses the thermal stability necessary to survive Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) processing temperatures that gives it the ability to be spin-coated directly on silicon substrates. In the future, all-optical (light-switching-light) signal processing could become possible using an advanced version of our chemistry.

Photovoltaic Cells 

A solar cell (also called a photovoltaic cell) is an electrical device that converts the energy of light directly into electricity by the photovoltaic effect. It is a form of photoelectric cell (in that its electrical characteristics&#151;e.g. current, voltage, or resistance&#151;vary when light is incident upon it) which, when exposed to light, can generate and support an electric current without being attached to any external voltage source. These cells are very inefficient. Organic nonlinear polymers offer potential increases in the efficiency of photovoltaic cells that could be orders of magnitude greater than LCD technology.

Medical Applications 

Medical Applications for electro-optic polymers have been proposed for many varied applications, including dentistry, oncology and protein identification. Although experimental, it is believed that the successful fabrication of high-stability electro-optic polymers could open up many future applications such as these. Other medical applications such as the higher-speed transmission of medical records, X-ray and MRI scans over the Internet would be improved by the broadening of Internet bandwidth.

Satellite Reconnaissance 

Satellite reconnaissance applications include a specific target market within the Department of Defense, the 14-member Intelligence Community and their contractors. Electro-optic polymers have historically been seen as attractive for potential application in this market due to the constant need for the fastest bandwidth transmission to meet the needs of national security.

Navigation Systems 

Navigation systems for both advanced aerial and missile guidance require the use of electro-optic gyroscopes. These devices are currently fabricated out of lithium niobate or similar electro-optic materials; the application of electro-optic polymers would facilitate the development of more accurate and architecturally simple device designs.

Radar Applications 

Radar Applications, specifically phased array radar, has been traditionally understood as a potential application for successful electro-optic material designs, along with electronic counter measure systems (ECM) systems, ultra-fast analog-to-digital conversion, LADAR, land mine detection, radio frequency photonics and spatial light modulation.

Optical Filters 

Optical filters are devices that utilize optical waveguides and various other structures like ring resonators that can be made with organic nonlinear materials that can filter out a specific wavelengths from one waveguide and redirect them to a different waveguide.

Spatial Light Modulators 

Spatial Light Modulators (SLMs) are optical computing devices that can be used in various recognition applications by collecting and correlating optical input to stored images in a database using complex mathematical computations based around calculated light intensity at various point on an image. Existing Liquid Crystal display technology that is accurate, but too slow for widespread adoption has hampered proliferation of these devices.

All-Optical Switches 

All-optical switches are expected to be included in the future market of all-optic devices. All-optical devices convert data in the form of input light signals to a secondary light data stream. Some experts anticipate that all-optical switches will replace traditional switches used today in microprocessors. All-optical switches are expected to enable the fabrication of an entirely new high-speed generation of &#34;polymer&#34; based computers that operate on light instead of electricity, which in turn should significantly improve computation speeds.

Our Business Strategy 

The Company revised its business strategy from a materials only approach into a dual path strategy that also includes developing devices, components and potentially sub-systems. Our economic model anticipates that our revenue stream will be derived from one or some combination of the following: (i) technology licensing for specific product application; (ii) joint venture relationships with significant industry leaders; or (iii) the production and direct sale of our own electro-optic device components. Our objective is to be a leading provider of proprietary technology and know-how in the electro-optic device market. In order to meet this objective, we intend, subject to successful testing of our technology and having available financial resources, to:

&#160;

&#183;

&#160;

&#183;

Maintain/develop strategic relationships with government agencies, private firms, and academic institutions

&#160;

&#183;

Continue to attract and retain high level science and technology personnel to our Company

Develop Electro-Optic Product Devices 

We intend to utilize our proprietary optical polymer technology to create an initial portfolio of commercially feasible electro-optic polymer product devices and applications for various markets, including telecommunications and government. We expect our initial product device line to include high-speed 40Gb/s and 100Gb/s modulators and system applications.

Continue to Develop Proprietary Intellectual Property 

We plan to advance our core competence in electro-optic polymer technology by continuing to develop proprietary materials, processes, designs and devices. We also plan to protect our technology by filing patent applications where appropriate, obtaining exclusive technology rights where available, and taking other appropriate steps to secure and protect our intellectual property.

Streamline Our Product Development Process 

We intend to streamline our development process and to design, fabricate and test proprietary materials and potential electro-optic polymer devices in order to position our Company to take advantage of emerging market opportunities.

In 2011 we retained the services of EOvation Advisors LLC, a technology and business advisory firm founded by Dr. Frederick Leonberger, former chief technology officer at JDS Uniphase Corporation, a leading provider of communications test and measurement solutions, and optical products. Dr. Leonberger is presently a senior advisor to the Company and its Board of Directors in assisting our Company with strategic planning and the design of optical modulators that we intend to develop.

Develop a Comprehensive Marketing Plan 

We are developing sales and marketing plans for our devices for implementation once we produce multiple prototype devices for the optical market. We plan to aggressively pursue sales of our potential products through the use of industry-specific sales organizations, such as electro-optic component representatives and distributors. In addition, we plan to target market leaders as initial customers and to leverage relationships with these market leaders to obtain future contracts and sales references.

Maintain/Develop Strategic Relationships with Government Agencies, Private Firms, and Academic Institutions 

Since the formation of our Company, we have had numerous strategic relationships with government agencies that have provided us with funding and access to important technology. We intend to establish, re-establish or maintain our relationships with:

&#160;

1.

Our Research and Development Process 

Our research and development process consists of the following steps:

&#160;

&#183;

We develop novel polymer materials utilizing our patented and patent pending technology to meet certain performance specifications. We then develop methods to synthesize larger quantities of such material.

&#160;

&#183;

We conduct a full battery of tests at the completion of the synthesis of each new polymer material to evaluate its characteristics. We also create development strategies to optimize materials to meet specifications for specific applications.

&#160;

&#183;

We integrate data from the material characterization and test results to fabricate devices. We analyze device-testing results to refine and improve fabrication processes and methods. In addition, we investigate alternative material and design variations to possibly create more efficient fabrication processes.

&#160;

&#183;

We create an initial device design using simulation software. Following device fabrication, we run a series of optical and electronic tests on the device.

We have and expect to continue to make significant operating and capital expenditures for research and development. Our operating expenses were $1,929,924 and $1,160,723 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, for an increase of $769,201.

Our Proprietary Products in Development 

As part of a two-pronged marketing strategy, our Company is developing several optical devices, which are in various stages of development and that utilize our organic nonlinear optical materials. They include:

Ridge Waveguide Modulator 

Our ridge electro-optic waveguide modulator was designed and fabricated in our Longmont, Colorado lab. The fabrication of our first in-house device is significant to our entire device program and is an important starting point for modulators that are being developed for target markets. We have multiple generations of new materials that we will soon be optimizing for this specific design. The ridge waveguide modulator represents our first commercially viable device, and targets metro networks (&#60; 10Km) within large scale telecommunications and data communications networks and represents approximately a $300MM per year market opportunity for us. 

Slot Waveguide Modulator 

Our functional Silicon Organic Hybrid (SOH) slot waveguide modulator utilizes an existing modulator structure with one of our proprietary electro-optic polymer material systems as the enabling material layer, and is functional as an operating prototype device. Preliminary testing and initial data on our SOH slot waveguide modulators demonstrated several promising characteristics. The tested SOH chip had a 1-millimeter square footprint, enabling the possibility of sophisticated integrated optical circuits on a single silicon substrate. In addition, the waveguide structure was approximately 1/20 the length of a typical inorganic-based silicon photonics modulator waveguide. With the combination of our proprietary electro-optic polymer material and the extremely high optical field concentration in the slot waveguide modulator, the test modulators demonstrated less than 2.2 volts to operate. Initial speeds exceeded 30-35 GhZ in the telecom, 1550 nanometer frequency band. This is equivalent to four, 10Gb/sec, inorganic, lithium niobate modulators that would require approximately 12-16 volts to move the same amount of information. Our material also operates in the 1310 nanometer frequency band, which is suitable for data communications applications. We continued with our collaborative development of our SOH slot waveguide modulator in 2014 and have signed an agreement with the associated third party research group to continue our collaboration through 2016. 

Spatial Light Modulator 

We have a development program to develop a Spatial Light Modulator with an outside manufacturer, Boulder Nonlinear Systems (BNS) utilizing certain Perkinamine&#153; chromophores. A spatial modulator is a form of optical computer that can perform various advanced tasks, such as object and facial recognition, by using advanced mathematical calculations known as Fourier Transforms. Our organic nonlinear optical materials can potentially produce update rates of more than a million times per second, which is a significant improvement in processing speed over existing Liquid Crystal Display technology that updates at only 30 to 60 times per second.

100 Gbps Telecommunications Modulator 

We have recently begun a second-generation design of a unique telecommunications modulator incorporating our newly developed materials in the Perkinamine&#153; family. We anticipate this modulator will be able to exceed the performance of existing legacy modulators by an order of magnitude, and will allow for improvements in the form of reduced power consumption and reduced device cost.

200 Gbps Datacomm/Telecomm Photonic Transceiver 

We propose to develop multichannel integrated nanophotonic transceivers for application in data communications. The transceiver consists of a silicon photonic chip fabricated with nonlinear polymer infused modulators (SOH), multiplexers, demultiplexers, detectors and grating fiber couplers to an external light source. The CMOS-compatible optical modulators are key components for future silicon-based photonic transceivers. Our solution, the silicon-organic hybrid (SOH) platform has been proposed and is being prototyped. In the SOH approach, the optical signal is guided by a silicon waveguide while an organic cladding provides the electro-optic effect.

Other Potential Applications For Our Products 

Optical Filters 

We are in preliminary design and fabrication phases of development of an optical filter using our proprietary Perkinamine&#153; and PerkinamineNR&#153; materials within a SiNx photonics platform. Initial work has been done in collaboration with City University of New York, but limitations in their process capabilities have led us to seek alternate fabrication facilities, which are underway at this time.

All-Optical Switches 

An all-optical switch is one that enables signals in optical fibers or networks to be selectively switched from one fiber or circuit to another. Many device designs have been developed and commercialized in today&#146;s telecom networks to effect optical switching by using mechanical or electrical control elements to accomplish the switching event. Future networks will require all-optical switches that can be more rapidly activated with a low energy and short duration optical (light) control pulse. 

Multi-Channel Optical Modem 

The availability of low cost electro-optic modulators will enable low cost multichannel optical modems that will use many wavelengths in parallel and employ high efficiency modulation techniques such as QAM (quadrature amplitude modulation). Such modems would enable an order of magnitude increase in the Internet capacity of legacy fiber. Lightwave Logic is in the early feasibility stage of such a multichannel optical modem. 

Our Current Strategic Partners 

Boulder Non-Linear Systems 

Boulder Nonlinear Systems, Inc. is a Colorado company that designs, manufactures and sells liquid crystal based photonics devices and systems. BNS builds unique analog liquid crystal on silicon modulators used in applications ranging from holographic storage to microscopic cell manipulation. Its advanced liquid crystal technology is used in telecommunications, medical instruments, defense, and manufacturing.

Our Past Government Program Participation 

Our Company has been a participant in several vital government sponsored research and development programs with various government agencies that protect the interests of our country. The following is a list of some of the various divisions of government agencies that have provided us with advisory, financial and/or materials support in the pursuit of high-speed electro-optic materials. We are not partnered with, strategically related to, or financially supported by any governmental agency at this time. Our previous relationships included:

&#160;

&#183;

National Reconnaissance Office (NRO)

&#160;

&#183;

Properties Branch of the Army Research Laboratory on the Aberdeen Proving Grounds in Aberdeen, Maryland.

&#160;

&#183;

Defense Advance Research Project Agency (DARPA)

&#160;

&#183;

Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division in China Lake, California

&#160;

&#183;

Air Force Research Laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio

Our Competition 

The markets we are targeting for our electro-optic polymer technology are intensely competitive. Among the largest fiber-optic component manufactures are Finisar, JDSU, Oclaro, NeoPhotonics, OpLink, CyOptics. Additionally, the five largest inorganic modulator component manufacturers hold approximately 85% of the electro-optic modulator component market. They are JDSU, Sumitomo, Oclaro, Fujitsu and ThorLabs. These companies are heavily invested in the production of crystalline-based electro-optic modulator technologies, as well as the development of novel manufacturing techniques and modulator designs.

We considered GigOptix, Inc., as our primary polymer competitor. They designed and patented potentially commercially feasible electro-optic polymers and hold an exclusive license to all electro-optic polymeric technology developed at the University of Washington. GigOptix presently has a joint venture with CPqD. Subsequently, GigOptix sold a majority interest of their polymer IP to BrPhotonics based in Brazil.

We believe that through the commercialization of our technology, we will be poised to obtain a significant portion of the component manufacturing market. Electro-optic polymers demonstrate several advantages over other technologies, such as inorganic-based technologies, due to their reduced manufacturing and processing costs, higher performance and lower power requirements. Our patented organic polymers and future electro-optic devices have demonstrated significant stability advantages over our known competitor's materials.

We believe the principal competitive factors in our target markets are:

&#160;

&#183;

The ability to develop and commercialize highly stable optical polymer-based materials and optical devices, including obtaining appropriate patent and proprietary rights protection.

&#160;

&#183;

Lower cost, high production yield for these products.

&#160;

&#183;

The ability to enable integration and implement advanced technologies.

&#160;

&#183;

Strong sales and marketing, and distribution channels for access to products.

We believe that our current business planning will position our Company to compete adequately with respect to these factors. Our future success is difficult to predict because we are an early stage company with all of our potential products still in development.

Many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater research and product development capabilities and financial, scientific, marketing and human resources than we do. As a result, these competitors may:

&#160;

&#183;

Succeed in developing products that are equal to or superior to our potential products or that achieve greater market acceptance than our potential products.

&#160;

&#183;

Devote greater resources to developing, marketing or selling their products.

&#160;

&#183;

Respond quickly to new or emerging technologies or scientific advances and changes in customer requirements, which could render our technologies or potential products obsolete.

&#160;

&#183;

Introduce products that make the continued development of our potential products uneconomical.

&#160;

&#183;

Obtain patents that block or otherwise inhibit our ability to develop and commercialize our potential products.

&#160;

&#183;

Withstand price competition more successfully than we can.

&#160;

&#183;

Establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that enhance their ability to address the needs of our prospective customers.

&#160;

&#183;

Take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities more readily than we can.

Our Laboratory Facilities 

In June 2012 we opened an internal research laboratory facility in Newark, Delaware in the Delaware Technology Park, near the University of Delaware. This lab facility enables us to synthesize and test our materials in the same facility and to accelerate our development efforts. It is equipped with state of the art equipment necessary to conduct synthetic chemistry in much more tightly controlled conditions. 

In January of 2014 we moved our Corporate Headquarters, as well as our advanced optical laboratory at the same location where the necessary testing of material candidates will be performed as they emerge from our synthesis laboratory. We commenced construction of clean room at this facility during the fourth quarter of 2014, which became fully operational and functional in April 2015. This clean room enables us to expand our in-house prototype development capabilities. 

Employees 

We currently have 9 full-time employees and 7 part-time employees, and we retain several independent contractors on an as-needed basis. We believe that we have good relations with our employees.
