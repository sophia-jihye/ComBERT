 Item 1. Business. 

General

Systemax Inc. is primarily a direct marketer of brand name and private label products. During 2015, our operations were organized in three reportable business segments &#8212; Industrial Products Group (&#8220;IPG&#8221;), EMEA Technology Products Group (&#8220;EMEA&#8221;) and what was our largest business in terms of revenue, North America Technology Products Group (NATG&#8221;). EMEA and NATG were aggregated in prior years as they met the aggregation criteria. Smaller business operations and corporate functions are aggregated and reported as an additional segment &#8211; Corporate and Other (&#8220;Corporate&#8221;). On December 1, 2015, we sold certain assets and liabilities of the NATG business and are currently winding down its remaining operations, as discussed below.

Operating History and Recent Restructuring of NATG Business

The NATG segment sold products categorized as Information and Communications Technology (&#8220;ICT&#8221;) and Consumer Electronics (&#8220;CE&#8221;) products. These products included computers, computer supplies and consumer electronics which were marketed in North America. Most of these products were manufactured by other companies; however, the Company did offer a selection of products manufactured for our own design and marketed on a private label basis.

In response to significant market pressures and poor operating performance, the Company initiated a series of actions to focus the NATG business on improved profitability. These actions included closing our PC manufacturing business in 2012, making &#8220;TigerDirect&#8221; our go to market brand, ceasing use of our &#8220;CompUSA&#8221; and &#8220;CircuitCity&#8221; brands and making efforts to transition their customers to TigerDirect. Additionally, the Company began to re-evaluate its &#8220;brick and mortar&#8221; retail consumer business, and it closed 10 unprofitable stores in 2012-2014. In this regard, due to market conditions and other factors described in our previous public filings which adversely impacted our retail and online consumer business, on March 10, 2015 the Company announced that it was taking additional actions to focus our NATG business primarily on Business to Business (&#8220;B2B&#8221;) customers, and that NATG would be exiting the retail store business in order to accelerate its focus on its B2B operations. This exit plan included the closing of 31 retail stores (leaving three remaining in operation), closing one of the NATG distribution centers, and implementing a significant general workforce reduction to align available resources with a B2B focus, as well as transitioning retail customers to online consumer sales.

At that time, the Company also began exploring strategic alternatives for the NATG business, while continuing its efforts to focus the NATG business on B2B customers and returning the business to profitability. Among other alternatives being considered, the Company engaged an investment advisor to seek a purchaser for the NATG business, and following solicitation and review of offers received, the Company negotiated the sale of certain assets and liabilities of the NATG business to PCM, Inc. The sale closed on December 1, 2015, though delivery of certain IT, website and other related assets was deferred to and completed in February 2016.

As of this filing, the Company has completed most of the NATG wind down activities, including selling its remaining inventory, closing the two remaining retail stores and closing its remaining distribution center; employee reductions were primarily completed in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 and currently approximately 30 employees remain at the Miami location. These employees are performing wind-down activities and it is anticipated these activities will be substantially complete by the end of the second quarter of 2016; any remaining activities after that date will be undertaken by the Company&#8217;s Corporate function in New York. The Company anticipates completing all wind down of remaining operations in 2016, other than settling of remaining lease obligations.

As a result of the sale of the NATG business to PCM and the wind down of NATG remaining operations, as of the date of this filing, the NATG business is discontinued and the Company&#8217;s business is now comprised of IPG, EMEA and Corporate and other. For a discussion of the accounting for the March 2015 exit from our retail store operations and the December 2015 sale and winding down of the NATG business, see Note 1and Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of this Form 10-K.

Industrial Products 

IPG sells a wide array of MRO products which are marketed in North America. Most of these products are manufactured by other companies; however, the Company does offer a selection of products that are manufactured for our own design and marketed under the trademarks: Global&#8482;, GlobalIndustrial.com&#8482;, Nexel&#8482; Relius&#8482;, Relius Elite&#8482; and Hercules&#8482;. &#160; Industrial products accounted for 38%, 26% and 24% of our net sales from continuing operations in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively reported on a U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) basis.

Technology Products &#8211; EMEA 

EMEA sells products categorized as Information and Communication Technology (&#8220;ICT&#8221;) and Consumer Electronics (&#8220;CE&#8221;). These products are marketed in Europe. Substantially all of these products are manufactured by other companies. EMEA accounted for 57%, 57% and 56% of our GAAP net sales from continuing operations in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Technology Products &#8211; NATG 

NATG sold ICT and CE products. These products were marketed in North America. Substantially all of these products were manufactured by other companies; however, the Company did offer a selection of products that were manufactured for our own design and marketed on a private label basis. NATG accounted for 5%, 17% and 20% of our GAAP net sales from continuing operations in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

See Note 2 and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of this Form 10-K for additional financial information about our business as well as information about our geographic operations.

The Company was incorporated in Delaware in 1995. Certain predecessor businesses which now constitute part of the Company have been in business since 1949. Our headquarters office is located at 11 Harbor Park Drive, Port Washington, New York.

Products

We offer over a million brand name and private label products. We endeavor to expand and keep current the breadth of our product offerings in order to fulfill the increasingly wide range of product needs of our customers.

MRO products offered by our IPG segment include electrical &#38; bulbs; fasteners &#38; hardware; foodservice &#38; appliances; furniture &#38; office; HVAC/R fans; janitorial &#38; maintenance; material handling; medical &#38; laboratory equipment; metalworking &#38; cutting tools; motors &#38; power transmission; office &#38; school supplies; outdoor &#38; grounds maintenance; packaging &#38; supplies; plumbing supplies; pneumatics &#38; hydraulics; raw material &#38; building supply; safety &#38; security; storage and shelving; tools and instruments; vehicle maintenance and workbench and shop desks.

ICT products offered by our EMEA segment include: computer &#38; mobile devices; computer parts &#38; memory; servers &#8211; storage &#38; backup; computer components and accessories; networking &#38; security; software; electronics and commercial and home networking. CE products include TV and video; audio; cameras and surveillance; GPS; cell phones; video games and toys; home and electronics accessories.

Sales and Marketing

We market our products primarily B2B, which include for-profit businesses, educational organizations and government entities. We have developed numerous proprietary customer and prospect databases. We have established a multi-faceted direct marketing system to business customers, consisting primarily of our relationship marketers, catalog mailings and proprietary internet websites, the combination of which is intended to maximize sales. Our discontinued NATG business also marketed its products to individual consumers (&#8220;B2C&#8221;).

Relationship Marketers

Our relationship marketers focus their efforts on our business customers by establishing a personal relationship between such customers and a Systemax account manager. The goal of the relationship marketing sales force is to increase the purchasing productivity of current customers and to actively solicit newly targeted prospects to become customers. With access to the records we maintain, our relationship marketers are prompted with product suggestions to expand customer order values. In certain countries, we also have the ability to provide such customers with electronic data interchange (&#8220;EDI&#8221;) ordering and customized billing services, customer savings reports and stocking of specialty items specifically requested by these customers. Our relationship marketers&#8217; efforts are supported by e-mail campaigns and periodic catalog mailings, both of which are designed to generate inbound telephone sales, and our interactive websites, which allow customers to purchase products directly over the Internet. We believe that the integration of our multiple marketing methods enables us to more thoroughly penetrate our business, educational and government customer base. We believe increased internet exposure leads to more internet-related sales and also generates more inbound telephone sales; just as we believe catalog mailings and email campaigns which feature our websites results in greater internet-related sales.

E-commerce

We currently operate multiple e-commerce sites, including:

North America 

Europe 

&#160; &#160; www.globalindustrial.com

www.misco.co.uk

www.globalindustrial.ca

&#160; www.inmac-wstore.com

&#160; www.miscosolutions.nl

We are continually upgrading the capabilities and performance of these websites in our significant markets. Our internet sites feature millions of MRO and ICT products. Our customers have around-the-clock, online access to purchase products and we have the ability to create targeted promotions for our customers&#8217; interests.

In addition to our own e-commerce websites, we have partnering agreements with several of the largest internet shopping and search engine providers who feature our products on their websites or provide &#8220;click-throughs&#8221; from their sites directly to ours. These arrangements allow us to expand our customer base at an economical cost.

Catalogs

&#160;

As IPG and EMEA have increased their focus on online and ecommerce advertising, marketing and sales activities, they have decreased their use of hard copy catalogs over the last several years, and currently distribute many fewer regular and specialty catalogs than in prior periods

&#160;

Customer Service, Order Fulfillment and Support

We generally receive orders through the Internet, by telephone and by EDI. We generally provide toll-free telephone number access for our customers in countries where it is customary. Certain domestic call centers are linked to provide telephone backup in the event of a disruption in phone service.

Certain of our products are carried in stock, and orders for such products are fulfilled on a timely basis directly from our distribution centers, typically within one day of the order. We utilize numerous sales and distribution facilities in North America and Europe. Orders are generally shipped by third-party delivery services. We maintain relationships with a number of large distributors in North America and Europe that also deliver products directly to our customers.

We maintain a database of commonly asked questions for our technical support representatives, enabling them to respond quickly to similar questions. We conduct regular on-site training seminars for our sales representatives to help ensure that they are well trained and informed regarding our latest product offerings.

&#160;

Suppliers

We purchase substantially all of our products and components directly from manufacturers and large wholesale distributors. Two vendors accounted for 10% or more of our purchases in 2015 and 2014: one vendor accounted for 12.2% and 12.6%, respectively; another vendor accounted for 10.9% and 11.6%, respectively. In 2013, one vendor accounted for 13.9% of our purchases. Excluding NATG operations, no vendor accounted for 10% or more of our purchases in 2015, 2014 or 2013. The loss of these vendors, or any other key vendors, could have a material adverse &#160; effect on us . 

Most private label products are manufactured by third parties to our specifications.

Competition and Other Market Factors

Industrial Products

The market for the sale of industrial products in North America is highly fragmented and is characterized by multiple distribution channels such as small dealerships, direct mail distribution, internet-based resellers, large warehouse stores and retail outlets. We face competition from large diversified MRO distributors such as Grainger Inc., MSC Industrial Direct Inc., Fastenal Inc., and other large retailers, including ecommerce retailers such as Amazon. We also face competition from manufacturers&#8217; own sales representatives, who sell industrial equipment directly to customers, and from regional or local distributors. Many high volume purchasers, however, utilize catalog distributors as their first source of product. In the industrial products market, customer purchasing decisions are primarily based on price, product selection, product availability, level of service and convenience. We believe that direct marketing via sales representatives, catalog and the Internet are effective and convenient distribution methods to reach mid-sized facilities that place many small orders and require a wide selection of products. In addition, because the industrial products market is highly fragmented and generally less brand oriented, we believe it is well suited to private label products.

Technology Products

The market for selling technology product markets is highly competitive, with many U.S., European and Asian companies vying for market share. We face competition from large distributors such as Econocom, Computa Center, Insight and others. There are few barriers to entry, with these products being sold through multiple channels of distribution, including direct marketers, computer resellers, mass merchants, over the Internet local and national retail computer stores, and by computer and office supply superstores.

&#160;

Timely introduction of new products or product features are critical elements to remaining competitive. Other competitive factors include product performance, quality and reliability, technical support and customer service, marketing and distribution and price. Some of our competitors have stronger brand-recognition, broader product lines and greater financial, marketing, manufacturing and technological resources than us.

Conditions in the EMEA market for technology products remain highly competitive, resulting in our frequent discounting of product sales price as well as offering free or highly discounted freight. These actions have and may continue to adversely affect our revenues and profits. Additionally, we rely in part upon the introduction of new technologies and products by other manufacturers in order to sustain long-term sales growth and profitability. There is no assurance that the rapid rate of such technological advances and product development will continue.

Employees

As of December 31, 2015, we employed a total of approximately 3,300 employees, of whom 1,600 were in North America and 1,700 were in Europe and Asia. On December 1, 2015 when the Company closed on the sale of certain assets and liabilities of its NATG segment to PCM and announced that it is winding down the remaining operations of NATG during early 2016, NATG employed approximately 1,000 employees. As of December 31, 2015, NATG employed approximately 500 employees; as of the date of filing this Form 10-K, NATG employed approximately 30.

Seasonality

Seasonality does not have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s continuing IPG and EMEA businesses.

Environmental Matters

Under various national, state and local environmental laws and regulations in North America and Western Europe, Hungary and Asia, a current or previous owner or operator (including the lessee) of real property may become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at such real property. Such laws and regulations often impose liability without regard to fault. We lease most of our facilities. In connection with such leases, we could be held liable for the costs of removal or remedial actions with respect to hazardous substances. Although we have not been notified of, and are not otherwise aware of, any material real property environmental liability, claim or non-compliance, there can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur remediation or other costs in connection with real property environmental matters in the future.

Financial Information About Foreign And Domestic Operations

We currently sell our products in North America (the United States, Puerto Rico, Canada and Mexico) and Europe.
