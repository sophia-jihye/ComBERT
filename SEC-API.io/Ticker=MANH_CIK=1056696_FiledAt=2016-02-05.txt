Business 

Overview 

Manhattan Associates was founded in 1990 in Manhattan Beach, California and incorporated in Georgia in 1998. References in this filing to the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;Manhattan,&#8221; &#8220;Manhattan Associates,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; and &#8220;us&#8221; refer to Manhattan Associates, Inc., our predecessors, and our wholly-owned and consolidated subsidiaries. Our principal executive offices are located at 2300 Windy Ridge Parkway, Tenth Floor, Atlanta, Georgia 30339, and our telephone number is 770-955-7070. 

We develop, sell, deploy, service and maintain software solutions designed to manage supply chains, inventory and omni-channel operations for retailers, wholesalers, manufacturers, logistics providers and other organizations. Our customers include many of the world&#8217;s premier and most profitable brands. 

Specifically, Manhattan Associates solutions help our customers in three distinct areas of their business: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Supply Chain - Manhattan solutions provide companies across industries the tools needed to manage distribution and optimize transportation costs throughout the entire network. Manhattan provides shippers the most comprehensive transportation management solutions in the market. This includes moving freight via the most cost-effective means possible while also meeting service level expectations. Likewise, Manhattan&#8217;s Warehouse Management solutions are widely regarded as industry-leading systems designed to optimize productivity and throughput in distribution centers and warehouses around the world. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Omni-Channel - Meeting ever-evolving consumer expectations of service, inventory availability and delivery convenience is a challenge every retailer must meet head on. Manhattan&#8217;s Omni-Channel solutions provide both &#8216;central&#8217; or corporate solutions that manage inventory availability across all channels and locations as well as &#8216;local&#8217; solutions deployed in retail stores to empower store associates to satisfy the demands of the walk-in shopper and the online customer. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Inventory - Manhattan solutions provide distributors of any finished goods (apparel, food, auto parts, pharmaceuticals, etc.) the ability to forecast demand, determine when, where and how much inventory is needed and translate this into a profitable inventory buying plan. Through the use of advanced science and sophisticated analytics, customer service level is maximized with the minimum necessary inventory investment. Industry changes driven by omni-channel retail, pharmaceutical regulations and other trends make this an area of particular need for many retailers and wholesale distributors. 

Manhattan Associates&#8217; Software Solution Portfolios 

Our portfolio of solutions takes a platform-based approach to the following key areas. This approach implies a single, holistic technology architecture that provides customers with three major benefits:

&#160;

&#183; 

Cross-Functional Business Solutions - By virtue of shared data, taxonomy and interfaces, a platform solution enables the organization to tackle business challenges that might otherwise be too technically daunting to achieve. For instance, the ability to apportion freight, labor, inventory handling and overhead costs across the supply chain to determine an item&#8217;s total cost to serve for an end customer normally requires a massive integration and harmonization effort. With a platform like Manhattan&#8217;s, this is simply another module that taps into a readily available pool of data in the supply chain and inventory solutions. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Total Cost of Ownership - A single set of tools to administrate security, resource management, system configuration and integration across all three functional disciplines allows for economies of scale within IT departments. The use of standard technologies, development tools and languages also ensures needed technical skills are readily available in the marketplace. 

&#160;

&#183; 

The Power of Shared Components - When an organization has multiple disparate systems, there are frequently redundant capabilities found across the enterprise. Examples include yard management, parcel shipping and inventory visibility. The consequences of duplicate systems range from the simple confusion brought on by different naming conventions to the expensive and complex data becoming out of sync, resulting in missed appointments, chargebacks and other issues. 

&#160;

&#160;

Supply Chain Solutions 

As previously described, Supply Chain solutions are focused on the distribution and transportation operations of the enterprise. There are four main components of Manhattan&#8217;s Supply Chain Solutions:

&#160;

&#183; 

Distribution Management - These applications comprise Manhattan&#8217;s Warehouse Management Solutions (WMS) commonly used to manage the complexity of the modern warehouse. They manage the flow of goods and information across the distribution center. The complete distribution management suite not only includes capabilities focused on execution within the distribution center, but also on the management of personnel, performance and the overall distribution center layout. All of these solutions come together to provide the customer the most productive workforce with an operation that can scale to meet the highest demands during peak season, yet can still operate effectively and profitably throughout the course of the year. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Transportation Management - Organizations today face a complex transportation environment with ever-changing demands driven by macro-economic trends and governmental regulations. Manhattan&#8217;s Transportation Management Solutions (TMS) are designed to help shippers navigate their way through these demands while meeting customer service expectations at the lowest possible freight costs. Components include procurement and modeling tools to setup a network that can be successful, along with planning, execution and settlement tools to manage day-to-day transportation requirements. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Supply Chain Convergence - Unique to Manhattan&#8217;s platform approach are a set of common components that for most solutions are either in a WMS or a TMS. These include tools designed to manage the scheduling of appointments with carriers and suppliers as well as oversee operations of the yard. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Visibility - Crucial to effective supply chain management is visibility into the movement of goods between locations in the supply chain and outside the enterprise&#8217;s realm of control. Manhattan provides world-class visibility and event management tools that not only provide alerts to when events occur in the supply chain, but also when they don&#8217;t occur (such as missing a vessel overseas) that can have a cascading effect on production lines, freight and most importantly, customer commitments. 

Omni-Channel Solutions 

As omni-channel retail has placed new demands on organizations, it has also created new software solution needs. These demands range from the ability to leverage inventory across the entire network to meet any demand, to providing store associates and call center representatives the means to take advantage of the available inventory. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Omni-Channel Central Solutions - There is a wide range of new capabilities that must be leveraged at a corporate or &#8216;central&#8217; level in retail today. The goal is to enable an omni-channel commerce platform that can be tapped into by any selling system&#8212;webstore, ERP, point-of-sale, call center, mobile app, etc. Manhattan&#8217;s Enterprise Inventory builds out a complete inventory availability picture that can be updated in near-real time with feeds from the warehouse, the store and the network. Enterprise Order Management merges this inventory availability data with demand feeds from across the organization to match supply with demand in a way that satisfies customer delivery expectations while also striving to maximize profitability. Lastly, the Call Center application provides representatives access to this inventory picture as well as complete customer sales history to satisfy shopper needs, regardless of whether it is an exchange, a return or a new order.

&#160;

&#9679; 

Omni-Channel Local Solutions - Just as the consumer enters the store with more information than ever, it is now vital to equip the sales associate with all relevant information and capabilities to satisfy that shopper&#8217;s every demand. Local solutions include mobile Point of Sale to process any purchase transactions, Clienteling to provide the associate with a complete picture of the shopper&#8217;s purchase history, and Tablet Retailing to offer a virtual showroom. When all of these solutions come together on a single mobile platform, retailers are able to offer unparalleled service and convenience for the shopper. 

Also an important part of Local solutions are Store Inventory and Fulfillment. Most retailers are now looking to leverage store inventory to fulfill ecommerce demand (driving greater sales revenue with less inventory). In order to achieve this, solutions that can maintain inventory integrity and enable productive, reliable fulfillment are required. 

&#160;

Inventory Solutions 

The ability to accurately forecast demand and project inventory needs is only heightened by omni-channel retail requirements that change traditional approaches to inventory management. Manhattan&#8217;s Inventory solutions address both the questions of what products should be carried and how much is needed at what locations and dates. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Inventory Optimization - This set of applications includes sophisticated demand forecasting capabilities that can address the particularly challenging slow-moving and intermittent products that frequently result in excess inventory due to unpredictability. Also included is the Replenishment module that can evaluate inventory needs across all locations and channels. This module can even suggest transferring inventory between locations (warehouses or stores) or &#8216;protect&#8217; merchandise at a store from online sales in order to save it for walk-in traffic. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#9679; 

Planning - Manhattan&#8217;s Planning solutions provide merchants the tools they need to create channel-, store- or region-specific assortments. These tools offer channel-specific metrics and methodologies that optimize the planning process and maximum retailer revenues. &#160;

Manhattan SCALE TM 

SCALE is our portfolio of logistics execution solutions built on Microsoft&#8217;s .NET &#174; platform. Purpose built for rapid development and a value based total cost of ownership, it is targeted toward companies with execution-focused supply chain needs that require speed-to-value, resource-light system configuration and maintenance, and the ability to quickly scale their logistics operations up or down in response to market fluctuations or business requirement changes. SCALE combines the features of Trading Partner Management, Yard Management, Optimization, Warehouse Management and Transportation Execution. 

Because SCALE leverages a common platform, solutions share common data elements and each user can access all applications through a single sign-on. Users also can set up &#8220;dashboards&#8221; that enable easy access to real-time information most relevant to their jobs. SCALE&#8217;s ease of deployment, operation and support make it a popular choice for organizations operating in countries with emerging and developing economies, and where technical support resources are limited. 

Technology Platform

Our solutions operate across Unix, IBM System i, Linux and Microsoft&#8217;s .NET computing platforms, as well as on multiple hardware platforms and systems. Because supply chain solutions necessarily interact with other business operation systems, our solutions are designed to interoperate with software from other providers as well as with a company&#8217;s existing legacy systems. This interfacing and open system capability enables customers to continue using existing computer resources and to choose among a wide variety of existing and emerging computer hardware and peripheral technologies. We provide an integration framework to facilitate rapid and reliable integration to any Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) or host business systems (including certified integration to both SAP and Microsoft Dynamics AX). We also offer certain of our solutions in both on-premise software and cloud computing models so that customers can select the option that best meets their requirements for control, flexibility, cost of ownership, and time-to-deployment.

Professional Services 

We advise and assist our customers in planning and implementing our solutions through our global Professional Services Organization. To ensure long-term successful customer relationships, consultants assist customers with the initial deployment of our systems, the conversion and transfer of the customer&#8217;s historical data onto our systems, and ongoing training, education, and system upgrades. We believe our Professional Services teams enable customers to implement our solutions knowledgeably and in the appropriate amount of time, help customers achieve expected results from system investments, continuously identify new opportunities for supply chain advancements, and meaningfully add to our industry-specific knowledge base to improve future implementations and product innovations. 

Substantially all of our customers utilize some portion of our Professional Services to implement and support our software solutions. Professional Services typically are rendered under time and materials contracts, with services billed by the hour. Professional Services sometimes are rendered under fixed-fee contracts, with payments due on specific dates or milestones. We believe that increased sales of our software solutions will drive higher demand for our Professional Services. 

We believe our Professional Services team delivers deep supply chain and enterprise commerce domain expertise to our customers through industry-specific &#8220;best-practices&#8221; protocols and processes developed through the collective knowledge we have gained from 26 years of implementing our supply chain solutions worldwide. We also extensively train our consulting personnel on enterprise commerce operations and on our solutions. 

Business consultants, systems analysts, and technical personnel assist customers in all phases of implementing our systems, including planning and design, customer-specific module configuration, on-site implementation- or conversion from existing systems, and integration with customer systems such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), web- and mobile-based commerce platforms, and Material Handling Equipment (MHE) systems. At times, third-party consultants, such as those from major systems integrators, assist our customers with certain implementations. 

Customer Support Services and Software Enhancements 

We offer a comprehensive program that provides our customers with software upgrades for additional or improved functionality and technological advances incorporating emerging supply chain and industry initiatives. Over the past three years, our annual renewal rate of customers subscribing to comprehensive support and enhancements has been greater than 90%. We are able to remotely access customer systems to perform diagnostics, provide on-line assistance, and facilitate software upgrades. We offer 24-

&#160;

hour customer support every day of the year, plus software upgrades for an annual fee that is paid in a dvance and is based on the solutions the customer has and the service level required. Software upgrades are provided under this program on a when-and-if- available basis. &#160;

&#160;

Training and Change Management Services

&#160;

We offer training and change management services for new and existing users, enabling our customers to align systems, people and processes. Services provided by our Manhattan training experts cover a wide range of support from the intended design to the front-line of the customer&#8217;s business, including critical end-user adoption with hands-on, live training in a virtualized Manhattan software environment. These programs are provided at fixed fees per-person, per-class. In addition, several computer-based training programs can be purchased for a fixed fee for use at client sites. 

&#160;

Manhattan Training and Change Management Services are offered under six categories: Role-Based Training Paths, Comprehensive Training Programs, Change Management Services, Individual Product Training Courses, End-User Enablement and Knowledge Resources.

Hardware Sales 

Along with software licenses, and as a convenience for our customers, we resell a variety of hardware developed and manufactured by others, including (but are not limited to) computer hardware, radio frequency terminal networks, RFID chip readers, bar code printers and scanners, and other peripherals. We resell all third-party hardware products and related maintenance pursuant to agreements with manufacturers or through distributor-authorized reseller agreements pursuant to which we are entitled to purchase hardware products and services at discount prices and to receive technical support in connection with product installations and any subsequent product malfunctions. We do not maintain hardware inventory as we generally purchase hardware from vendors only after receiving related customer orders. 

Strategy 

Our objective is to extend our position as the leading global commerce solutions provider for organizations intent on creating and sustaining market advantages through technology-enabled commerce solutions. Our solutions help global distributors, wholesalers, retailers, logistics providers and manufacturers successfully manage accelerating and fluctuating market demands, as well as master the increasing complexity and volatility of their local and global supply chains. We believe our solutions are advanced, highly functional and highly scalable. They are designed to enable organizations to: create customer experiences consistent with their brand values; improve relationships with suppliers, customers and logistics providers; leverage investments across supply chain functions; effectively generate revenue and manage costs; and meet dynamically changing customer requirements. We believe our solutions are uniquely positioned to holistically optimize the way companies bring together omni-channel, supply chain and inventory management: 

Develop and Enhance Software Solutions. We intend to continue to focus our research and development resources on enhancing our Supply Chain, Omni-Channel Commerce and Inventory Solutions. We offer what we believe to be the broadest and most richly-featured software portfolio in the marketplace. To continuously expand functionality and value, we plan to continue to provide enhancements to existing solutions and to introduce new solutions to address evolving industry standards and market needs. We identify these opportunities through our Product Management, Professional Services, Customer Support and Account Management organizations, through interactions such as ongoing customer consulting engagements and implementations, sessions with our solution user groups, association with leading industry analyst and market research firms, and participation on industry standards and research committees. Our solutions address needs in various vertical markets, including retail, consumer goods, food and grocery, logistics service providers, industrial and wholesale, high technology and electronics, life sciences and government. We intend to continue to enhance our solutions to meet the dynamic requirements of these and new vertical markets as business opportunities dictate. 

Expand International Presence. We believe our solutions offer significant benefits to customers in markets outside the United States, and for organizations with global operations. We have offices in Australia, China, France, India, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, and the United Kingdom, as well as representatives in Mexico and reseller partnerships in Latin America, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, South Africa, and Asia. Our Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) operations support sales, implementation services, and customer support functions for customers in Europe as well as a number of customers across the Middle East, concentrated in countries we consider politically and economically stable. Our Asia Pacific (APAC) operations service emerging opportunities in China, Southeast Asia, and India, as well as more established markets in Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Our international strategy includes leveraging the strength of our relationships with current U.S. and Europe-based customers that also have significant international operations. 

Strategic Alliances and Indirect Sales Channels. We currently sell our products primarily through our direct sales personnel, and through partnership agreements with a select number of organizations in emerging markets where we do not currently have a direct sales presence. We have worked on joint projects and joint sales initiatives with industry-leading consultants and software systems 

&#160;

implementers, including most of the large consulting firms specializing in our targeted industries, to supplement our direct sales force and professional services organization. We expand our indirect sales channels through reseller agreements, marketing agreements, and agreements with third-party logistics providers. These alliances extend our market coverage and provide us with new business leads and access to trained implementation personnel. &#160;

Acquire or Invest in Complementary Businesses. We continuously evaluate strategic acquisition opportunities of technologies, solutions, and businesses that are consistent with our platform-based strategy and enable us to enhance and expand our offerings. Preferred acquisition targets are those that would be complementary to our existing solutions and technologies, expand our geographic presence and distribution channels, extend our presence into additional vertical markets with challenges and requirements similar to those we currently serve, and further solidify our leadership position within the primary components of supply chain planning and execution. 

Sales and Marketing 

We employ multi-disciplinary sales teams that consist of professionals with industry experience in sales and technical sales support. To date, we have generated the majority of our software sales (licensing) revenue through our direct sales force. We plan to continue to invest in our sales, services, and marketing organizations within the United States, EMEA, and APAC, and to pursue strategic marketing partnerships. We conduct comprehensive global marketing programs that include prospect profiling and targeting, lead generation, public relations, analyst relations, trade show attendance and sponsorships, supply chain conference hosting, online marketing, joint promotion programs with vendors and consultants, and ongoing customer communication programs. 

Our sales cycle typically begins with the generation of a sales lead &#8212; through in-house telemarketing efforts, targeted promotions, web inquiries, trade show presence, speaking engagements, hosted seminars, or other means of referral &#8212; or the receipt of a request for proposal from a prospective customer. Leads are qualified and opportunities are closed through a process that includes telephone-based assessments of requirements; responses to requests for proposals, presentations and product demonstrations, site visits and/or reference calls with organizations already using our supply chain solutions, and contract negotiations. Sales cycles vary substantially from opportunity to opportunity, but typically require nine to twelve months. 

In addition to new customer sales, we plan to continue to leverage our existing customer base to drive revenue from system upgrades, sales of additional licenses of purchased solutions, and sales of new or add-on solutions. To efficiently penetrate emerging global markets, we leverage indirect sales channels, including sales through reseller agreements, marketing agreements, and agreements with third-party logistics providers. To extend our market coverage, generate new business leads, and provide access to trained implementation personnel, we leverage strategic alliances with systems integrators skilled at implementing our solutions. Business referrals and leads are positively influenced by systems integrators, which include most of the large consulting firms and other systems consulting firms specializing in our targeted industries. 

Our Manhattan Value Partner (Manhattan MVP&#8482;) and Manhattan GeoPartner&#8482; programs foster joint sales and marketing with other organizations. Manhattan Value Partners are proven software and hardware providers, trusted third-party integrators and consultants who bring added value to customer engagements through vertical industry knowledge or technical specialization. Manhattan MVPs support and complement our supply chain solutions so we can provide customers with a comprehensive approach that is suited to their business requirements. This collaborative program is designed to benefit both Manhattan and our partners through tailored joint marketing, sales and, in some cases, co-development efforts. Among others, Manhattan MVPs include IBM, Deloitte, Kurt Salmon, Microsoft, Cap Gemini and Intel. Manhattan GeoPartners represent a select group of companies that sell and implement our solutions in specific geographies around the world, each providing valuable localized expertise to meet customer needs in areas such as Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Russia, the Middle East, Latin America, Africa, and the Asia Pacific region. 

Customers 

To date, our customers have been suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and logistics providers in a variety of industries. Our top five customers (new or pre-existing) in the aggregate accounted for 8%, 10%, and 11% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue in 2015, 2014, or 2013. 

Product Development 

We focus our development efforts on new product innovation and adding new functionality to existing solutions, integrating our various solution offerings, enhancing the operability of our solutions across our Process Platform and across distributed and alternative hardware platforms, operating systems, and database systems. We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to enhance existing solutions, to respond to dynamically changing customer requirements, and to develop new or enhanced solutions that incorporate new technological developments and emerging supply chain and industry standards. To that end, development frequently focuses on base system enhancements and incorporating new user requirements and features into our 

&#160;

solutions. As a result, we deliver packaged, highly configurable solutions with increasingly rich functionality rather than custom-developed software. We also deliver int erface toolkits for many major ERP systems to enhance communication and improve data flows between our core solutions and our clients&#8217; host systems. &#160;

We leverage internal and external scientific advisors to inform our solution strategies and research and development approaches with the most advanced thinking on supply chain opportunities, challenges, and technologies. Our internal research team is comprised of Ph.D.-credentialed math and science experts who work on creating and solving algorithms and other constructs that advance the optimization capabilities and other aspects of our solutions. We also regularly communicate with and are advised by experts from leading educational institutions known for their supply chain disciplines, and practitioners from organizations deploying supply chain technology in innovative and market-advancing ways. Together, our research team and external advisors inform both the practical business approaches and the mathematical and scientific inventiveness of our solutions. 

We conduct most research and development internally in the U.S. and India to retain domain knowledge and to promote programming continuity standards. However, we may periodically outsource some projects that can be performed separately and/or that require special skills. We also use third-party translation companies to localize our application software into various languages such as, but not limited to, Chinese, French, Japanese, and Spanish. 

Our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 were $53.9 million, $49.0 million, and $44.5 million, respectively. We intend to continue to invest significantly in product development. 

Competition 

Our solutions are solely focused on enterprise commerce capabilities, which have been consolidating rapidly, are intensely competitive, and are characterized by rapid technological change. The principal competitive factors affecting the markets for our solutions include: industry expertise; company and solution reputation; company viability; compliance with industry standards; solution architecture; solution functionality and features; integration experience, particularly with ERP providers and material handling equipment providers; ease and speed of implementation; proven return on investment; historical and current solution quality and performance; total cost of ownership; solution price; and ongoing solution support structure. We believe we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors. 

Our competitors are diverse and offer a variety of solutions directed at various aspects of enterprise commerce. Our existing competitors include: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Corporate information technology departments of current or potential customers capable of internally developing solutions; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

ERP vendors, including Oracle, SAP, and Infor, among others; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Supply chain execution vendors, including JDA Software Group, Inc. (JDA), HighJump Software Inc., and the Sterling Commerce division of IBM, among others; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Point of sale vendors, including Aptos, Inc., Demandware, Inc., NCR Corporation, among others;

&#160;

&#9679; 

Supply chain planning vendors, including JDA and SAS Institute Inc., among others; and 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Smaller independent companies that have developed or are attempting to develop supply chain execution solutions and/or planning solutions that apply in specific countries and/or globally. 

We anticipate facing increased competition from ERP and supply chain management (SCM) applications vendors and business application software vendors that may broaden their solution offerings by internally developing or by acquiring or partnering with independent developers of supply chain planning and execution software. Some of these ERP and other potential competitors have longer operating histories; significantly more financial, technical, marketing and other resources; greater name recognition; broader solutions; and larger installed bases of customers than us. To the extent that ERP and SCM vendors or other large competitors develop or acquire systems with functionality comparable or superior to ours, their larger customer bases, long-standing customer relationships, and ability to offer broader solutions outside the scope of supply chain could create significant competitive advantage for them. It also is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and/or new competitors could emerge to win significant market share. Increased competition could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced earnings and margins and loss of market share. In turn, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow, and financial condition. 

We believe we have established meaningful competitive differentiation through our supply chain expertise; our platform-based solution approach; our track record of continuous supply chain innovation and investment; our strong and endorsing customer relationships; our significant success in deploying and supporting supply chains for market-leading companies; our success in helping our clients address the enterprise impacts of digital commerce; and our ability to out-execute others in identifying sales opportunities and demonstrating expertise throughout the sales cycle. However, to further our market success, we must continue to respond 

&#160;

promptly and effectively to technological change and competitors&#8217; innovations. Consequently, we cannot assure that we will not be required to make substantial additional investments in research, development, ma rketing, sales and customer service efforts in order to meet any competitive threat, or that we will be able to compete successfully in the future. &#160;

International Operations: Segments 

We have three reporting segments, based on geographic location: the Americas; Europe, Middle East and Africa (&#8220;EMEA&#8221;); and Asia Pacific (&#8220;APAC&#8221;). For further information on our segments, see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. Our international revenue was approximately $131.3 million, $134.6 million, and $110.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, which represents approximately 24%, 27%, and 27% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. International revenue includes all revenue derived from sales to customers outside the United States. We now have approximately 1,550 employees in our International operations. 

Proprietary Rights 

We rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trade secret, trademark, and trade dress laws, confidentiality procedures, and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights in our products, processes and technology. We have registered trademarks for Manhattan Associates and the Manhattan Associates logo, as well as a number of our products and features. Generally we enter into confidentiality and assignment-of-rights agreements with our employees, consultants, customers and potential customers and limit access to, and distribution of, our proprietary information. We license our proprietary products to our customers under license agreements that we believe contain appropriate use and other restrictions in order to try to best protect our ownership of our products and our proprietary rights in them, and to protect our revenue potential from our products. However, despite our efforts to safeguard and maintain our proprietary rights, we cannot ensure that we will successfully deter misappropriation, unintended disclosure or independent third-party development of our technology or our proprietary rights or information. Policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult, and, while we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software solutions exists, as is the case with any software company, piracy could become a problem. Further, to the extent that we enter into transactions in countries where intellectual property laws are not well developed or are poorly enforced, our efforts to protect our proprietary rights may be ineffective. Whether we seek to enforce our proprietary rights in the U.S. or abroad, our efforts, including litigation to enforce our rights, can result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, and such efforts, or our failure to succeed in such efforts, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, regardless of the final outcome. 

As the number of supply chain management solutions available in the marketplace increases and solution functionality continues to overlap, supply chain software may increasingly become subject to claims of infringement or other misappropriation of intellectual property. Third parties may assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us relating to our products, processes or technology. Such claims, whether or not they have merit, generally are time-consuming and may result in costly litigation, divert management&#8217;s attention or cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements. Defense of infringement or other misappropriation claims, entering into royalty or licensing agreements, the unavailability of such agreements, or adverse determinations in proprietary rights litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. 

Employees 

At December 31, 2015, we employed approximately 2,930 employees worldwide, of which 1,380 are based in the Americas, 210 in EMEA, and 1,340 in APAC (including India).
