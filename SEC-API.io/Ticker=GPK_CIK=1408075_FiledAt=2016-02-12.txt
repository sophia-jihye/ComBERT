The Company consumes most of its coated board output in its carton converting operations, which is an integral part of the customer value proposition. In 2015, approximately 83% &#32;of mill production of CUK and CRB was consumed internally. 

CUK Production. The Company is the largest of four worldwide producers of CUK. CUK is manufactured from pine-based wood fiber and is a specialized high-quality grade of coated paperboard with excellent wet and dry tear strength characteristics and printability for high resolution graphics that make it particularly well-suited for a variety of packaging applications. Both wood and recycled fibers are pulped, formed on paper machines, and clay-coated to provide an excellent printing surface for superior quality graphics and appearance characteristics. 

CRB Production. The Company is the largest North American producer of CRB. CRB is manufactured entirely from recycled fibers, primarily old corrugated containers (&#8220;OCC&#8221;), doubled-lined kraft cuttings from corrugated box plants (&#8220;DLK&#8221;), old newspapers (&#8220;ONP&#8221;), and box cuttings. The recycled fibers are re-pulped, formed on paper machines, and clay-coated to provide an excellent printing surface for superior quality graphics and appearance characteristics. 

Containerboard/Kraft Paper. The Company manufactures corrugated medium and kraft paper for internal use and sale in the open market. Corrugated medium is combined with linerboard to make corrugated containers. Kraft paper is used primarily to make grocery bags and sacks. In October 2015, the Company shutdown the kraft paper machine at West Monroe, LA and sold the book of business. 

The Company converts CUK and CRB, as well as other grades of paperboard, into cartons at converting plants the Company operates in various locations globally, including a converting plant associated with its joint venture in Japan, contract converters and at licensees outside the U.S. The converting plants print, cut, fold and glue paperboard into cartons designed to meet customer specifications. 

Joint Venture 

The Company is a party to a joint venture called Rengo Riverwood Packaging, Ltd. (in Japan) in which it holds a 50% ownership interest. The joint venture agreement covers CUK supply, use of proprietary carton designs and marketing and distribution of packaging systems. 

Marketing and Distribution 

The Company markets its products principally to multinational beverage, food, and other well-recognized consumer product companies. The beverage companies include Anheuser-Busch, Inc., MillerCoors LLC, PepsiCo, Inc. and The Coca-Cola Company, among others. Consumer product customers include Kraft Heinz Company., General Mills, Inc., Nestl&#233; USA, Inc., Kellogg Company, HAVI Global Solutions, LLC and Kimberly-Clark Corporation, among others. The Company also sells paperboard in the open market to independent and integrated paperboard converters. 

Distribution of the Company&#8217;s principal products is primarily accomplished through sales offices in the U.S., Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Spain, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, and, to a lesser degree, through broker arrangements with third parties. 

During 2015 , the Company did not have any one customer that represented 10% or more of its net sales. 

Competition 

Although a relatively small number of large competitors hold a significant portion of the paperboard packaging market, the Company&#8217;s business is subject to strong competition. The Company and WestRock Company are the two major CUK producers in the U.S. Internationally, The Klabin Company in Brazil and Stora Enzo in Sweden produce similar grades of paperboard. 

In beverage packaging, cartons made from CUK compete with substitutes such as plastics and corrugated packaging for packaging glass or plastic bottles, cans and other primary containers. Although plastics and corrugated packaging may be priced lower than CUK, the Company believes that cartons made from CUK offer advantages over these materials in areas such as distribution, brand awareness, carton designs, package performance, package line speed, environmental friendliness and design flexibility. 

In non-beverage consumer packaging, the Company&#8217;s paperboard competes with WestRock CUK, as well as CRB and solid bleach sulfate ("SBS") from numerous competitors, and internationally, folding boxboard and white-lined chip. There are a large number of producers in the paperboard markets. Suppliers of paperboard compete primarily on the basis of price, strength and printability of their paperboard, quality and service. 

Raw Materials 

The paperboard packaging produced by the Company comes from pine trees and recycled fibers. Pine pulpwood, paper and recycled fibers (including DLK and OCC) and energy used in the manufacture of paperboard, as well as poly sheeting, plastic resins and various chemicals used in the coating of paperboard, represent the largest components of the Company&#8217;s variable costs of paperboard production. 

For the West Monroe, LA and Macon, GA mills, the Company relies on private landowners and the open market for all of its pine pulpwood and recycled fiber requirements, supplemented by CUK clippings that are obtained from its converting operations. The Company believes that adequate supplies from both private landowners and open market fiber sellers currently are available in close proximity to meet its fiber needs at these mills. 

&#32;&#32;The paperboard grades produced at the Kalamazoo, MI, Battle Creek, MI, Middletown, OH, Santa Clara, CA, and East Angus, Quebec mills are made from 100% recycled fiber. The Company procures its recycled fiber from external suppliers and internal converting operations. The market price of each of the various recycled fiber grades fluctuates with supply and demand. The Company&#8217;s internal recycled fiber procurement function enables the Company to obtain low prices for its recycled fiber given the Company&#8217;s highly fragmented supplier base. The Company believes there are adequate supplies of recycled fiber to serve its mills. 

In North America, the Company also converts a variety of other paperboard grades such as SBS, in addition to paperboard that is supplied to its converting operations from its own mills. The Company purchases such paperboard requirements, including additional CRB, from outside vendors. The majority of external paperboard purchases are acquired through long-term arrangements with other major industry suppliers. The Company's European converting plants consume CUK supplied from the Company's mills and also converts other paperboard grades such as white-lined chip and folding box board purchased from external suppliers. 

Energy 

Energy, including natural gas, fuel oil and electricity, represents a significant portion of the Company&#8217;s manufacturing costs. The Company has entered into contracts designed to manage risks associated with future variability in cash flows and price risk related to future energy cost increases for a portion of its natural gas requirements at its U.S. mills. The Company&#8217;s hedging program for natural gas is discussed in Note 9 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein under &#8220;Item 8., Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#8221; 

Backlog 

Orders from the Company&#8217;s principal customers are manufactured and shipped with minimal lead time. The Company did not have a material amount relating to backlog orders at December 31, 2015 &#32;or 2014 . 

Seasonality 

The Company&#8217;s net sales, income from operations and cash flows from operations are subject to moderate seasonality, with demand usually increasing in the late spring through early fall due to increases in demand for beverage and food products. 

Research and Development 

The Company&#8217;s research and development team works directly with its sales, marketing and consumer insights personnel to understand long-term consumer and retailer trends and create relevant new packaging. These innovative solutions provide customers with differentiated packaging to meet customer needs. The Company&#8217;s development efforts include, but are not limited to, extending the shelf life of customers&#8217; products; reducing production and waste costs; enhancing the heat-managing characteristics of food packaging; improving the sturdiness and compression strength of packaging to meet store display needs; and refining packaging appearance through new printing techniques and materials. 

Sustainability represents one of the strongest trends in the packaging industry and the Company focuses on developing more sustainable and eco-friendly manufacturing processes and products. The Company&#8217;s strategy is to combine sustainability with innovation to create new packaging solutions for its customers. 

&#32;For more information on research and development expenses see Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein under &#8220;Item 8., Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#8221;
