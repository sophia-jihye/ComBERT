Marketing 

We strive to position ourselves as the leading online trading provider in Indonesia. In today's technology driven world, we believe having services with an offline and online element will position us for growth within the market. We plan to utilize various methods of marketing to gain brand recognition and market acceptance to establish ourselves in the online trading market place. 

We plan to establish a presence in the market, primarily through the use of traditional methods of marketing in conjunction with a viral marketing component geared towards online viewing. The highlighted points below are an overview of the various marketing channels and strategies we will employ. The campaign will focus on an overarching national strategy that will be complimented by regional efforts. The main goal is to sell our services to medium and large income businesses and individuals throughout Indonesia. We also intend to employ third party consultants to assist us in marketing telecom and mobile applications. 

&#61623; 

Full day Seminars. The seminar model will be a key marketing strategy for us to attract new clients. 

&#61623;

Branding 

We utilize various forms of media and print advertising to promote our brand. Anticipated forms of print media include brochures, advertisements in financial publications and billboards. 

Our management will also attend and participate in key industry related trade shows throughout the world to promote our brand and products. We will design and utilize the Internet as a forum to promote our brand that result in higher quality products. Our website will be regularly updated to ensure proper informational flow to established and new customers. 

Industry 

Since the beginning of online trading the commission rate has dropped from around $50 per trade down to around 1/5 of that and even some companies like Bank of America, Zecco and Saxo Bank have offered commission free trading in stocks. These price slashes generated great growth in the industry according to McKinsey &#38; Co who states that in 1999 online banking constituted 2 % of the entire industry, by 2002 it constituted 10 %. The explosive growth in the online trading industry attracted many new entrants, leading to intense competition. 

&#160; 

In addition to that, many of the traditional full-service brokers like Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley also entered the arena by offering online trading. The Internet posed the most serious threat to the established brokerage firms since the unfixing of commissions on May Day, 1975, when deregulation created the discount-brokerage business, threatening, but not vanquishing, a cozy oligopoly (Nathan, 1999). The oligopoly has now been battered by new technologies. So far, traditional full-service brokers had resisted using the Internet in any way that would cannibalize their existing offline brokerage business. They appeared positively complacent, arguing that the cut-price online brokerage is not a sustainable business model. 

&#160; 

However, by the early years of the new millennium, the traditional full-service firms finally began to counterattack. Their first steps were to add online trading to their information-only web sites with a better deal for their more active customers. As they further enter the online market at a larger scale, with vastly greater capital bases, and powerful global brand names these traditional firms will probably change the nature of the competition. 

&#160; 

The entry of traditional offline firms to the online market, however, has not necessarily been a smooth process. This has caused major &#8220;channel conflict&#8221; when distributing through competing channels that offer different prices and service levels. An example of this kind of conflict was felt during the launching of Discover Brokerage Direct, owned by Morgan Stanley (Smith, 1999). 

&#160; 

One of the clearest indications of how channel conflict influenced management decisions was in the way the online unit was named. Rather than extending the Morgan Stanley brand name to the online operation, a name that carried considerable clout in the securities business, the new company was given the name of the Discover credit-card operation. This was a way of distancing the parent company from the online business. 

&#160; 

New entries to the online market have been appearing in various ways: from traditional tier 1 banks, specialized online banks and hundreds of small online brokers, offering different trading platforms. Growth in the industry has been driven mainly by retail Forex operations and other derivatives such as CFDs (Contracts for Differences). 

&#160; 

Online Financial Industry Today 

&#160; 

We believe we are now at the apex of a new period of unprecedented opportunities for the online financial industry. History has revealed that after recessions, new &#8216;windows of opportunity&#8217; open up where new industries grow and become established. We believe there may be increasing consolidation since there are too many online brokers that do not offer a relevant and differentiated product. 

&#160; 

In a report published in December 2010, LeapRate estimated that the online Forex trading volume was some $200 billion daily, barely 5% of the total world foreign exchange market (this is the largest market in the world, with an average daily turnover estimated at $3.98 trillion). We believe this represents enormous growth if we compare it to the figure of under $10 billion that was traded online daily 10 years ago. If the LeapRate numbers are correct, daily online Forex operations are already more than double those of the New York Stock Exchange and some 40 times that of the Ibex in Spain. 

&#160; 

&#160; History of Online Trading 

&#160; 

For many years&#8217; stock markets were physical locations where buyers and sellers met and negotiated. Exchange trading would typically happen on the floor of an exchange, where traders in brightly colored jackets (to identify which firm they worked for) would shout and gesticulate at one another &#8211; a process known as open outcry or pit trading (the exchange floors were often pit-shaped &#8211; circular, sloping downwards to the center, so that the traders could see one another). With the improvement in communications technology in the late 20th century, the need for a physical location became less important and traders started to transact from remote locations in what became known as electronic trading. Electronic trading made transactions easier to complete, monitor, clear, and settle and this helped spur on its development. 

&#160; 

One of the earliest examples of widespread electronic trading was on Globex, the CME Group&#8217;s electronic trading platform conceived in 1987 and launched fully in 1992.This allowed access to a variety of financial markets such as treasuries, foreign exchange and commodities. The Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) produced a rival system that was based on Oak Trading Systems&#8217; Oak platform branded &#8216;E Open Outcry,&#8217; an electronic trading platform that allowed for trading to take place alongside that took place in the CBOT pits. 

&#160; 

Set up in 1971, NASDAQ was the world's first electronic stock market, though it originally operated as an electronic bulletin board, rather than offering straight-through processing (STP). 

&#160; 

By 2011 investment firms on both the buy side and sell side were increasing their spending on technology for electronic trading. With the result that many floor traders and brokers were removed from the trading process. Traders also increasingly started to rely on algorithms to analyze market conditions and then execute their orders automatically. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The move to electronic trading compared to floor trading continued to increase with many of the major exchanges around the world moving from floor trading to completely electronic trading. 

&#160; 

Trading in the financial markets can broadly be split into two groups: 

&#160; 

&#61623; 

Business-to-business (B2B) trading, often conducted on exchanges, where large investment banks and brokers trade directly with one another, transacting large amounts of securities, and 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Business-to-consumer (B2C) trading, where retail (e.g. individuals buying and selling relatively small amounts of stocks and shares) and institutional clients (e.g. hedge funds, fund managers or insurance companies, trading far larger amounts of securities) buy and sell from brokers or "dealers", who act as middle-men between the clients and the B2B markets. 

&#160; 

While the majority of retail trading in the United States happens over the Internet, retail trading volumes are dwarfed by institutional, inter-dealer and exchange trading. However, in developing economies, especially in Asia, retail trading constitutes a significant portion of overall trading volume. 

&#160; 

For instruments that are not exchange-traded (e.g. US treasury bonds), the inter-dealer market substitutes for the exchange. This is where dealers trade directly with one another or through inter-dealer brokers (i.e. companies like GFI Group and BGC Partners. They acted as middle-men between dealers such as investment banks). This type of trading traditionally took place over the phone but brokers moved to offering electronic trading services instead. 

&#160; 

Similarly, B2C trading traditionally happened over the phone and, while some still does, more brokers are allowing their clients to place orders using electronic systems. Many retail (or "discount") brokers (e.g. Charles Schwab, E-Trade) went online during the late 1990s and most retail stock-broking probably takes place over the web now. 

&#160; 

Larger institutional clients, however, will generally place electronic orders via proprietary electronic trading platforms such as Bloomberg Terminal, Reuters 3000 Xtra, Thomson Reuters Eikon, BondsPro, Thomson TradeWeb or CanDeal (which connect institutional clients to several dealers), or using their brokers' proprietary software. 

&#160; 

For stock trading, the process of connecting counterparties through electronic trading is supported by the Financial Information eXchange (FIX) Protocol. Used by the vast majority of exchanges and traders, the FIX Protocol is the industry standard for pre-trade messaging and trade execution. While the FIX Protocol was developed for trading stocks, it has been further developed to accommodate commodities, foreign exchange, derivatives, and fixed income trading. 

&#160; 

Impact of Electronic Trading 

&#160; 

The increase of electronic trading has had some important implications: 

&#160; 

&#61623; 

Reduced cost of transactions &#8211; By automating as much of the process as possible (often referred to as "straight-through processing" or STP), costs are brought down. The goal is to reduce the incremental cost of trades as close to zero as possible, so that increased trading volumes don't lead to significantly increased costs. This has translated to lower costs for investors. 

&#160; 

&#61623; 

Greater liquidity &#8211; electronic systems make it easier to allow different companies to trade with one another, no matter where they are located. This leads to greater liquidity (i.e. there are more buyers and sellers) which increases the efficiency of the markets. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Greater competition &#8211; While electronic trading hasn't necessarily lowered the cost of entry to the financial services industry, it has removed barriers within the industry and had a globalisation-style competition effect. For example, a trader can trade futures on Eurex , Globex or LIFFE at the click of a button &#8211; he or she doesn't need to go through a broker or pass orders to a trader on the exchange floor. 

&#160; 

&#61623; 

Increased transparency &#8211; Electronic trading has meant that the markets are less opaque. It's easier to find out the price of securities when that information is flowing around the world electronically. 

&#160; 

&#61623; 

Tighter spreads &#8211; The "spread" on an instrument is the difference between the best buying and selling prices being quoted; it represents the profit being made by the market makers. The increased liquidity, competition and transparency means that spreads have tightened, especially for commoditized, exchange-traded instruments. 

&#160; 

For retail investors, financial services on the web offer great benefits. We believe the primary benefits are the reduced cost of transactions, the availability of research materials for all concerned as well as the ease and the convenience. 

&#160; 

Investing Online 

&#160; 

Prior to the advent of the Internet, investors had to call up their stockbroker and place an order on the telephone. The brokerage firm would then enter the order in their system which was linked to trading floors and exchanges. 

&#160; 

In August 1994, K. Aufhauser&#38; Company, Inc. (later acquired by TD Ameritrade) became the first brokerage firm to offer online trading via its "WealthWEB". Online investing has experienced significant growth since that time. Investors can now enter orders directly online, or even trade with other investors via electronic communication networks (ECN). Some orders entered online are still routed through the broker, allowing agents to approve or monitor the trades. This step assists in the protection of both the client and brokerage firm from unlawful or incorrect trades which could affect the client&#8217;s portfolio or the stockbroker&#8217;s license. 

&#160; 

Online brokers are most often referred to as discount brokers. Their popularity is attributable to the speed and ease of their online order entry, and to fees and commissions significantly lower than those of full service brokerage firms. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Tools and Trading Platforms 

&#160; 

Investors who trade through an online brokerage firm are provided with a trading platform. This platform acts as the hub, allowing investors to purchase and sell such securities as fixed income, equities/stock, options, and mutual funds. Included with the platform are tools to track and monitor securities, portfolios and indices, as well as research tools, real-time streaming quotes and up-to-date news releases; all of which are necessary to trade profitably. Often, more robust research tools are available such as full, in-depth analyst reports and analysis, and customized back testing and screeners to see how particular investment strategies would have been realized during different historical periods. 

&#160; 

Some of the popular online brokers include: E*Trade, IDealing, Scottrade, TD Ameritrade, and Fidelity. Schwab is an example of a hybrid broker combining a traditional, brick-and-mortar brokerage house with discounted trading online, with the usual benefits of both available to customers. Commissions vary from broker to broker, depending on the services included with the account. 

Compliance with Government Regulations 

&#160; 

The conduct of our business, and the production, distribution, sale, advertising, labeling, safety, transportation and use of our products, may be subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local governmental agencies in Indonesia, as well as to foreign laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies in markets where we may operate and sell our products and services. We are unaware of any licenses or regulations that we have to adhere to and it is our policy to abide by the laws and regulations that apply to our business. 

We may also be subject to a number of U.S. federal or state laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet, many of which are still evolving and being tested in courts, and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. These may involve user privacy, rights of publicity, data protection, content, intellectual property, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, taxation and online payment services. 

We will rely on legal and operational compliance programs, as well as local counsel, to guide our business in complying with applicable laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we do business. 

&#160; 

We do not anticipate at this time that the cost of compliance with U.S. and foreign laws will have a material financial impact on our operations, business or financial condition, but there are no guarantees that new regulatory and tariff legislation may not have a material negative effect on our business in the future. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Currently, we believe there appears to be limited competition in Indonesia, as there are no international providers such as Saxo, IG Markets, Interactive brokers, E*Trade, FXCMarkets or Charles Schwab represented locally in Indonesia. In addition, 

&#61623; 

Not many Indonesian banks offer online trading; 

&#61623; 

Local brokers have access to Indonesian stocks with limited access to global markets; 

&#61623; 

Local commodity brokers offer gold and limited foreign exchange crosses (4 pairs); and 

&#61623; 

Limited investment seminars or education programs are available. 

However, we are a new entry into this marketplace and we are not well known. As such, we may compete with numerous providers of online trading services or Internet accessible applications and services companies, many of which have far greater financial and other resources than we do. Many of these companies have established histories and relationships in providing online applications or systems in other markets that may enable them to attract talent, marketing support, and financing if they decided to enter the Indonesian market. Our major competitors globally include Saxo Bank, IG Markets, Interactive brokers, E*Trade, FXCMarkets and TD Ameritrade. 

We believe our products will be competitive in the market place and with potential customers as our products are full featured and fully integrated while not requiring customization. The use of our products do not require extensive training and do not require any add on components from third party developers. 

We believe that our services will prove to be cost effective and easy for users to adopt and use. We also plan to market our products and services through channel partners, to broaden our exposure to customers and users. 

Employees 

&#160; 

We have no employees other than our executive officers and directors as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We conduct our business largely through agreements with consultants and arm&#8217;s length persons. 

&#160; 

Research and Development Expenditures 

&#160; 

We have not incurred any research expenditures since our incorporation.
