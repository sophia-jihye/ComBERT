 Item 1. Business 

&#160;

Equus Total Return, Inc. (&#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;Equus&#8221; the &#8220;Company&#8221; or the &#8220;Fund&#8221;), a Delaware corporation, was formed by Equus Investments II, L.P. (the &#8220;Partnership&#8221;) on August 16, 1991. On July 1, 1992, the Partnership was reorganized and all of the assets and liabilities of the Partnership were transferred to the Fund in exchange for shares of common stock of the Fund. On August 11, 2006, our shareholders approved the change of the Fund&#8217;s investment strategy to a total return investment objective. This strategy seeks to provide the highest total return, consisting of capital appreciation and current income. In connection with this strategic investment change, the shareholders also approved the change of name from Equus II Incorporated to Equus Total Return, Inc.

&#160;

We attempt to maximize the return to stockholders in the form of current investment income and long-term capital gains by investing in the debt and equity securities of companies with a total enterprise value of between $5.0 million and $75.0 million, although we may engage in transactions with smaller or larger investee companies from time to time. We seek to invest primarily in companies pursuing growth either through acquisition or organically, leveraged buyouts, management buyouts and recapitalizations of existing businesses or special situations. Our income-producing investments consist principally of debt securities including bonds, subordinated debt, debt convertible into common or preferred stock, or debt combined with warrants and common and preferred stock. Debt and preferred equity financing may also be used to create long-term capital appreciation through the exercise and sale of warrants received in connection with the financing. We seek to achieve capital appreciation by making investments in equity and equity-oriented securities issued by privately-owned companies or smaller public companies in transactions negotiated directly with such companies. Given market conditions over the past several years and the performance of our portfolio, our management and board of directors believe it prudent to continue to review alternatives to refine and further clarify the current strategies.

&#160;

Equus is a closed-end management investment company that has elected to be treated as a business development company (&#8220;BDC&#8221;) under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (&#8220;1940 Act&#8221;). In order to remain a BDC, we must meet certain specified requirements under the 1940 Act, including investing at least 70% of our assets in eligible portfolio companies and limiting the amount of leverage we incur. Equus is also a regulated investment company (&#8220;RIC&#8221;) under Subchapter M of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986. As such, we are not required to pay corporate-level income tax on the Fund&#8217;s investment income. We intend to maintain our RIC status, which requires that we qualify annually as a RIC by meeting certain specified requirements. For a discussion of these requirements necessary to maintain our status as a BDC and as a RIC, please see &#8220;Business Development Company Requirements&#8221; and &#8220;Regulated Investment Company Tax Status,&#8221; respectively.

&#160;

Our principal office is located at 700 Louisiana St., 48 th Floor, Houston, Texas, 77002, and the telephone number is 1-888-323-4533. Our corporate website is located at www.equuscap.com . We make available free of charge on our website our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;). Our shares are traded on The New York Stock Exchange (&#8216;NYSE&#8221;) under the ticker symbol &#8220;EQS&#8221;.

&#160;

Significant Developments 

&#160;

Plan of Reorganization and Share Exchange with MVC Capital . On May 14, 2014, we announced that the Fund intended to effect a reorganization pursuant to Section 2(a)(33) of the 1940 Act. As a first step to consummating the reorganization, we sold to MVC Capital, Inc. (&#8220;MVC&#8221;) 2,112,000 newly-issued shares of the Fund&#8217;s common stock in exchange for 395,839 shares of MVC (such transaction is hereinafter referred to as the &#8220;Share Exchange&#8221;). MVC is a business development company traded on the New York Stock Exchange that provides long-term debt and equity investment capital to fund growth, acquisitions and recapitalizations of companies in a variety of industries. The Share Exchange was calculated based on the Fund&#8217;s and MVC&#8217;s respective net asset value per share. At the time of the Share Exchange, the number of MVC shares received by Equus represented approximately 1.73% of MVC&#8217;s total outstanding shares of common stock.

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the terms of a Share Exchange Agreement, dated May 12, 2014, entered into by Equus and MVC which memorialized the Share Exchange, we intend to finalize the reorganization by pursuing a merger or consolidation with MVC, a subsidiary of MVC, or one or more of MVC&#8217;s portfolio companies (the &#8220;Consolidation&#8221;). Absent Equus merging or consolidating with/into MVC or a subsidiary thereof, our current intention is for Equus to (i) consummate the Consolidation with a portfolio company of MVC, (ii) terminate its election to be classified as a BDC under the 1940 Act, and (iii) be restructured as a publicly-traded operating company focused on the energy and/or financial services sector. Our management is currently evaluating these alternatives and expects to commence and/or consummate a Consolidation during 2016.

&#160; 

Portfolio Dispositions and Investments . During 2015 and shortly thereafter, we made the following portfolio dispositions and investments:

&#160;

&#8226; On January 6, 2015, we sold our interest in Spectrum Management, L.L.C. (&#8220;Spectrum&#8221;) in exchange for $3.0 million in cash and a secured subordinated 14% promissory note maturing July 1, 2016 in the principal amount of $914,509; &#160;

&#8226; On January 6, 2015, our debt investment in Security Monitor Holdings, LLC was repaid, wherein we received $582,833 in cash, which included the original principal amount of the debt and all interest, as accrued; &#160;

&#8226; On February 20, 2015, we sold our OPG Notes for &#8364;846,059 [$953,117] in net cash proceeds; and &#160;

&#8226; On January 29, 2016, we invested $2.0 million in Biogenic Reagents, LLC, a developer and producer of high value carbon products from renewable biomass, in the form of a senior secured promissory note maturing April 28, 2016 and bearing cash and PIK interest at the combined rate of 16% per annum. &#160;

Our Board of Directors (sometimes referred to as the &#8220;Board&#8221;) and management of the Fund (&#8220;Management&#8221;) continue to believe that current market conditions and recent portfolio performance dictate the need to pursue a more active role in the management of remaining investments and to seek liquidity events at the appropriate time to protect and enhance shareholder value. These activities include continuous monitoring and intensive reviews of portfolio company performance and expectations, providing follow-on capital when necessary, exploration of liquidity events for certain portfolio companies to position the Fund to maximize investment returns, and actively pursuing suitable new investments for the Fund.

&#160;

Investment Objective 

&#160;

To the extent we remain as a BDC and do not complete the Consolidation as described above, our investment objective is to maximize the total return to our stockholders in the form of current investment income and long-term capital gains by investing in the debt and equity securities of small and middle market capitalization companies that are generally not publicly traded at the time of our investment. As a result of our endeavors in the energy sector, we also seek to purchase working interests and revenue leasehold interests in oil and gas properties, although we remain open to exploring investment opportunities in a variety of other sectors. As we grow and develop the Fund, we intend to include investments in progressively larger enterprises.

&#160;

Investment Strategy 

&#160;

Beginning in 2006, we implemented a revised investment strategy to attempt to strike a balance between the potential for gain and the risk of loss. With respect to capital appreciation, Equus is a &#8220;growth-at-reasonable-price&#8221; investor that seeks to identify and acquire securities that meet our criteria for selling at reasonable prices. We give priority to cash producing investments wherein we invest principally in debt or preferred equity financing with the objective of generating regular interest and dividend income back to the Fund. Debt and preferred equity financing may also be used to create long-term capital appreciation through the exercise and sale of warrants received in connection with the financing. Given market conditions over the past several years and the performance of our portfolio, our Management and Board believe it prudent to continue to review alternatives to refine and further clarify the current strategies.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Investment Criteria 

&#160;

Consistent with our investment objective and strategy, our Management evaluates prospective investments based upon the criteria set forth below. We may modify some or all of these criteria from time to time.

&#160;

Management Competency and Ownership . We seek to invest in companies with experienced management teams who have demonstrated a track record of successful performance. Further, we desire to invest in companies with significant management ownership. We believe that significant management ownership in small capitalization and middle market companies provides appropriate incentives and an alignment of interests for management to maximize shareholder value. In addition, we will seek to design compensation and incentive arrangements that align the interests of the portfolio company&#8217;s management with those of the Fund to enhance potential returns.

&#160;

Substantial Target Market . We desire to focus on companies whose products or services have favorable growth potential and strong competitive positions in their respective markets. These positions may be as leadership positions within a given industry or market niche positions in which the product or service has a demonstrated competitive advantage. The market in which a potential portfolio company operates should either be sizeable or have significant growth potential. &#160; 

&#160; 

History of Profitability and Favorable Growth Potential . We target companies that have demonstrated a history of profitability or a reasonable expectation of a return to profitability in the near future.

&#160;

Ability to Provide Regular Cash Interest and Distributions . We look for companies with strong cash flow models sufficient to provide regular and consistent interest and/or preferred dividend payments.

&#160;

Management Assistance and Substantial Equity . Given the requirements of a BDC under the 1940 Act, we seek to invest in companies that will permit substantial managerial assistance including representation on the board of directors of the company or its equivalent. With regard to equity investments, we desire to obtain a substantial investment position in portfolio companies. This position may be as a minority shareholder with certain contractual rights and powers, or as a majority shareholder, and should otherwise allow us to have substantive input on the direction and strategies of the portfolio company.

&#160;

Plausible Exit and Potential for Appreciation . Prior to investing in a portfolio company, we will seek to analyze potential exit strategies and pursue those investments with such strategies as may be achievable.

&#160;

Investment Operations 

&#160;

Our investment operations consist principally of the following basic activities:

&#160;

Investment Selection. We expect that many of our investment opportunities will come from Management, members of our Board, other private equity investors, direct approaches from prospective portfolio companies and referrals from investment banks, business brokers, commercial, regional and local banks, attorneys, accountants and other members of the financial community. Subject to the approval of our Board, we may compensate certain referrals with finder&#8217;s fees to the extent permissible under applicable law and consistent with industry practice.

&#160;

Due Diligence. Once a potential investment is identified, we undertake a due diligence review using information provided by the prospective portfolio companies and publicly available information. Management may also seek input from consultants, investment bankers and other knowledgeable sources. The due diligence review will typically include, but is not limited to:

&#160;

&#8226; &#160; Review of historical and prospective financial information including audits and budgets; &#160;

&#8226; &#160; On-site visits; &#160;

&#8226; &#160; Interviews with management, employees, customers and vendors of the potential portfolio company; &#160;

&#8226; &#160; Review of existing loan documents, if any; &#160;

&#8226; &#160; Background checks on members of management; and &#160;

&#8226; &#160; Research relating to the company, its management, industry, markets, products and services and competitors. &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Structuring Investments. We typically negotiate investments in private transactions directly with the owner or issuer of the securities acquired. Management structures the terms of a proposed investment, including the purchase price, the type of security to be purchased and our future involvement in the portfolio company&#8217;s business. We seek to structure the terms of the investment to provide for the capital needs of the portfolio company while maximizing our opportunities for current income and capital appreciation. In addition, we may invest with other co-investors including private equity firms, business development companies, small business investment companies, venture capital groups, institutional investors and individual investors.

&#160; 

Providing Management Assistance and Monitoring of Investments. Successful private equity investments typically require active monitoring of, and significant participation in, major business decisions of portfolio companies. In several cases, officers and directors of the Fund serve as members of the governing boards of portfolio companies. Such management assistance is required of a BDC under the 1940 Act. We seek to provide guidance and management assistance with respect to such matters as capital structure, acquisitions, budgets, profit goals, corporate strategy, portfolio management and potential sale of the company or other exit strategies. In connection with their service as directors of portfolio companies, officers and directors of the Fund may receive and retain directors&#8217; fees or reimbursement for expenses incurred, and may participate in incentive stock option plans for non-employee directors, if any. When necessary and as requested by any portfolio company, Management, on behalf of the Fund, may also assign staff professionals with financial or management expertise to assist portfolio company management.

&#160;

Follow-On Investments 

&#160;

Following our initial investment, a portfolio company may request that we make follow-on investments by providing additional equity or loans needed to fully implement its business plans to develop a new line of business or to recover from unexpected business problems or other purposes. In addition, follow-on investments may be made to exercise warrants or other preferential rights granted to the Fund or otherwise to increase our position in a portfolio company. We may make follow-on investments in portfolio companies from cash on hand or borrow all or a portion of the funds required. If we are unable to make follow-on investments due to lack of available capital, the portfolio company in need of the investment may be negatively impacted, we may be required to subordinate our debt interest in the portfolio company to a new lender, and our equity interest in the portfolio company may be diluted if outside equity capital is required.

&#160; 

Disposition of Investments 

&#160; 

The method and timing of the disposition of our investments in portfolio companies are critical to our ability to realize capital gains and minimize capital losses. We may dispose of our portfolio securities through a variety of transactions, including recapitalizations, refinancings, management buy-outs, repayments from cash flow, acquisitions of portfolio companies by a third party and outright sales of the Fund&#8217;s securities in a portfolio company. In addition, we may distribute our portfolio securities in-kind to our stockholders. In structuring our investments, we endeavor to reach an understanding with the management of the prospective portfolio company as to the appropriate method and timing of the disposition of the investment. In some cases, we seek registration rights for our portfolio securities at the time of investment which typically provide that the portfolio company will bear the cost of registration. To the extent not paid by the portfolio company, the Fund typically bears the costs of disposing of its portfolio investments.

&#160; 

Current Portfolio Companies 

&#160;

For a description of our current portfolio company investments, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8211;Portfolio Securities.&#8221;

&#160; 

Valuation 

&#160;

On at least a quarterly basis, Management values our portfolio investments. These valuations are subject to the approval and adoption of the Board. Valuations of our portfolio securities at &#8220;fair value&#8221; are performed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;).

&#160;

The fair value of investments for which no market exists (which includes most of the Fund&#8217;s investments) is determined through procedures established in good faith by the Board. As a general principle, the current &#8220;fair value&#8221; of an investment is the amount the Fund might reasonably expect to receive upon its sale in an orderly manner. There are a range of values that are reasonable for such investments at any particular time.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

We base our adjustments upon such factors as the portfolio company&#8217;s earnings, cash flow and net worth, the market prices for similar securities of comparable companies, an assessment of the company&#8217;s current and future financial prospects and various other factors and assumptions. In the case of unsuccessful or substantially declining operations, we may base a portfolio company&#8217;s fair value upon the company&#8217;s estimated liquidation value. Fair valuations are necessarily subjective, and our estimate of fair value may differ materially from amounts actually received upon the disposition of its portfolio securities. Also, any failure by a portfolio company to achieve its business plan or obtain and maintain its financing arrangements could result in increased volatility and result in a significant and rapid change in its value.

&#160;

Our general intent is to hold our loans to maturity when appraising our privately held debt investments. As such, we believe that the fair value will not exceed the cost of the investment. However, in addition to the previously described analysis involving allocation of value to the debt instrument, we perform a yield analysis to determine if a debt security has been impaired.

&#160;

Our Management may engage independent, third-party valuation firms to conduct independent appraisals and review Management&#8217;s preliminary valuations of each privately-held investment in order to make their own independent assessment. Any third-party valuation data would be considered as one of many factors in a fair value determination. Management would then present its fair value recommendations to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors for review. Following review and any adjustments required thereby, the Audit Committee would, in turn, recommend the fair values for all of the Fund&#8217;s portfolio investments to the Board of Directors for final approval.

&#160;

To the extent that market quotations are readily available for our investments and such investments are freely transferable, we value them at the closing market price on the date of valuation. For securities which are of the same class as a class of public securities but are restricted from free trading (such as Rule 144 stock), we establish our valuation by discounting the closing market price to reflect the estimated impact of illiquidity caused by such restrictions. We generally hold investments in debt securities to maturity. Accordingly, we determine the fair value of debt securities on the basis of the terms of the debt securities and the financial condition of the issuer. We value certificates of deposit at their face value, plus interest accrued to the date of valuation.

&#160;

Our Board reviews the valuation policies on a quarterly basis to determine their appropriateness and reserves the right to hire and, from time to time, utilizes independent valuation firms to review Management&#8217;s valuation methodology or to conduct an independent valuation.

&#160;

On a daily basis, we adjust net asset value for changes in the value of publicly held securities, if any, and for material changes in the value of investments in securities issued by private companies. We report these amounts to Lipper Analytical Services, Inc. Our weekly and daily net asset values appear in various publications, including Barron&#8217;s and The Wall Street Journal .

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160;

We compete with a large number of public and private equity and mezzanine funds and other financing sources, including traditional financial services companies such as finance companies and commercial banks. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. Our competitors may have a lower cost of funds and many have access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, certain of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships and build their market shares. In addition, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC.

&#160;

We cannot assure you that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, because of this competition, we may not be able to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities and may not be able to identify and make investments that satisfy our investment objectives or meet our investment goals.

&#160; 

Properties 

&#160;

Our principal executive offices are located at 700 Louisiana St., 48 th Floor, Houston, Texas 77002. We believe that our office facilities are suitable and adequate for our operations as currently conducted and contemplated.

Business Development Company Requirements 

&#160; 

Qualifying Assets . As a BDC, we may not acquire any asset other than qualifying assets, as defined by the 1940 Act, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, the value of our qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the value of our total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are the following:

&#160;

&#8226; &#160; Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from an issuer that is an eligible portfolio company. An eligible portfolio company is any issuer that (a) is organized and has its principal place of business in the United States, (b) is not an investment company other than a small business investment company wholly-owned by the BDC, and (c) either (i) (A) does not have any class of securities with respect to which a broker or dealer may extend margin credit, (B) is controlled by the BDC either singly or as part of a group and an affiliated person of the BDC is a member of the issuer&#8217;s board of directors, or (C) has total assets of not more than $4 million and capital and surplus of at least $2 million, or (ii) does not have any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange, unless the total market capitalization of such issuer does not exceed $250 million. Qualifying assets may also include follow-on investments in a company that was a particular type of eligible portfolio company at the time of the BDC&#8217;s initial investment, but subsequently did not meet the definition; 

&#160; 

&#8226; &#160; Securities received in exchange for or distributed with respect to securities described above, or pursuant to the exercise of options, warrants or rights relating to such securities; and 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; &#160; Cash, cash items, government securities, or high quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment. &#160;

We may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or withdraw our election as, a BDC unless authorized by vote of the holders of the majority of our outstanding voting securities, as defined in the 1940 Act. Pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization announced on May 14, 2014, we intend to: (i) consummate a Consolidation with MVC or one of its subsidiaries, (ii) terminate the Fund&#8217;s election to be classified as a BDC under the 1940 Act, and (iii) be restructured as a publicly-traded operating company focused on the energy and/or financial services sector. Any or all of these intended developments will require an affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities (see Significant Developments&#8722;Plan of Reorganization above).

&#160;

To include certain securities above as qualifying assets for the purpose of the 70% test, a BDC must make available to the issuer of those securities significant managerial assistance, such as providing significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations, or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company. We offer to provide significant managerial assistance to each of our portfolio companies.

&#160;

Temporary Investments. Pending investment in portfolio companies, we invest our available funds in interest-bearing bank accounts, money market mutual funds, U.S. Treasury securities and/or certificates of deposit with maturities of less than one year (collectively, &#8220;Temporary Investments&#8221;). Temporary Investments may also include commercial paper (rated or unrated) and other short-term securities. Temporary Investments constituting cash, cash items, securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury or U.S. Government agencies and high quality debt securities (commercial paper rated in the two highest rating categories by Moody&#8217;s Investor Services, Inc. or Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s Corporation, or if not rated, issued by a company having an outstanding debt issue so rated, with maturities of less than one year at the time of investment) will qualify for determining whether we have 70% of our total assets invested in qualifying assets or in qualified Temporary Investments for purposes of the BDC provisions of the 1940 Act.

&#160; 

Leverage. We are permitted by the 1940 Act, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of senior debt and a single class of preferred stock senior to the common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least 200% after the issuance of the debt or the senior stockholders&#8217; interests. In addition, provisions must be made to prohibit any distribution to common stockholders or the repurchase of any shares unless the asset coverage ratio is at least 200% at the time of the distribution or repurchase.

&#160; 

Fund Share Sales Below Net Asset Value . We generally may sell our common stock at a price that is below the prevailing net asset value per share only upon the approval of the policy by stockholders holding a majority of our issued shares, including a majority of shares held by nonaffiliated stockholders. We may, in accordance with certain conditions established by the SEC, sell shares below net asset value in connection with the distribution of rights to all of our stockholders. We may also issue shares at less than net asset value in payment of dividends to existing stockholders.

&#160; 

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

No Redemption Rights. Since we are a closed-end BDC, our stockholders have no right to present their shares to the Fund for redemption. Recognizing the possibility that our shares might trade at a discount, our Board has determined that it would be in the best interest of our stockholders for the Fund to be authorized to attempt to reduce or eliminate a market value discount from net asset value. Accordingly, from time to time we may, but are not required to, repurchase our shares (including by means of tender offers) to attempt to reduce or eliminate any discount or to increase the net asset value of our shares.

&#160; 

Affiliated Transactions . Many of the transactions involving the Fund and its affiliates (as well as affiliates of such affiliates) require the prior approval of a majority of the independent directors and a majority of the independent directors having no financial interest in the transactions. However, certain transactions involving closely affiliated persons of the Fund require the prior approval of the SEC.

&#160; 

Regulated Investment Company Tax Status 

&#160;

We operate to qualify as a &#34;RIC&#34; under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#34;Code&#34;). If we qualify as a RIC and annually distribute to our stockholders in a timely manner at least 90% of our investment company taxable income, we will not be subject to federal income tax on the portion of our taxable income and capital gains we distribute to our stockholders. Taxable income generally differs from net income as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America due to temporary and permanent timing differences in the recognition of income and expenses, returns of capital and net unrealized appreciation or depreciation.

&#160;

Generally, in order to maintain our status as a RIC, we must (i) continue to qualify as a BDC; (ii) distribute to our stockholders in a timely manner at least 90% of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code; (iii) derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross investment company income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to securities loans, gains from the sale of stock or other securities or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities as defined by the Code; and (iv) meet investment diversification requirements. The diversification requirements generally require us at the end of each quarter of the taxable year to have (a) at least 50% of the value of our assets consist of cash, cash items, government securities, securities of other regulated investment companies and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of our assets and 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer and (b) no more than 25% of the value of our assets invested in the securities of one issuer (other than U.S. government securities and securities of other regulated investment companies), or of two or more issuers that are controlled by us and are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses.

&#160;

In addition, with respect to each calendar year, if we distribute or have treated as having distributed (including amounts retained but designated as deemed distributed) in a timely manner 98% of our net capital gain income for each one-year period ending on October 31, and distribute 98.2% of our investment company net ordinary income for such calendar year (as well as any ordinary income not distributed in prior years), we will not be subject to the 4% nondeductible Federal excise tax imposed with respect to certain undistributed income of regulated investment companies.

&#160;

If we fail to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement or otherwise fail to qualify as a regulated investment company in any taxable year, we will be subject to tax in such year on all of our taxable income, regardless of whether we make any distribution to our stockholders. In addition, in that case, all of our distributions to our stockholders will be characterized as ordinary income (to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits). We have distributed and currently intend to distribute sufficient dividends to eliminate our investment company taxable income; however, none have been necessary in recent years.

&#160; 

Custodian 

&#160;

We act as the custodian of our securities to the extent permitted under the 1940 Act and are subject to the restrictions imposed on self-custodians by the 1940 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. We have also entered into an agreement with Amegy Bank with respect to the safekeeping of our securities. The principal business office of Amegy Bank is 4400 Post Oak Parkway, Houston, Texas 77019.

&#160; 

Transfer and Disbursing Agent 

&#160;

We employ American Stock Transfer &#38; Trust Company as our transfer agent to record transfers of our shares, maintain proxy records and to process distributions. The principal business office of our transfer agent is 6201 15th Avenue, 2nd Floor, Brooklyn, NY 11219.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Certifications 

&#160;

In June 2015, we submitted to the New York Stock Exchange pursuant to Section 303A.12(a) of its Listed Company Manual, an unqualified certification of our Chief Executive Officer. In addition, certifications by our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have been filed as exhibits to this annual report on Form 10-K as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

All statements contained herein that are not historical facts including, but not limited to, statements regarding anticipated activity are &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; within the meaning of the federal securities laws, involve a number of risks and uncertainties, and are based on the beliefs and assumptions of Management, based on information currently available to Management. Actual results may differ materially. In some cases, readers can identify forward-looking statements by words such as &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;expect,&#8221; &#8220;objective,&#8221; &#8220;plan,&#8221; &#8220;intend,&#8221; &#8220;anticipate,&#8221; &#8220;believe,&#8221; &#8220;Management believes,&#8221; &#8220;estimate,&#8221; &#8220;predict,&#8221; &#8220;project,&#8221; &#8220;potential,&#8221; &#8220;forecast,&#8221; &#8220;continue,&#8221; &#8220;strategy,&#8221; or &#8220;position&#8221; or the negative of such terms or other variations of them or by comparable terminology. In particular, statements, express or implied, concerning future actions, conditions, or events, future operating results, or the ability to generate sales, income, or cash flow are forward-looking statements.

Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following: (i) changes in the economic conditions in which we operate negatively impacting our financial resources; (ii) certain of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources than the Fund reducing the number of suitable investment opportunities offered or reducing the yield necessary to consummate the investment; (iii) there is uncertainty regarding the value of our privately held securities that require a good faith estimate of fair value for which a change in estimate could affect the Fund&#8217;s net asset value; (iv) our investments in securities of privately held companies may be illiquid which could affect our ability to realize a gain; (v) our portfolio companies could default on their loans or provide no returns on its investments which could affect the Fund&#8217;s operating results; (vi) we are dependent on external financing to grow our business; (vii) our ability to retain key management personnel; (viii) an economic downturn or recession could impair our portfolio companies and therefore harm our operating results; (iv) our borrowing arrangements impose certain restrictions; (x) changes in interest rates may affect our cost of capital and net operating income; (xi) we cannot incur additional indebtedness unless the Fund maintains an asset coverage of at least 200%, which may affect returns to our stockholders; (xii) we may fail to continue to qualify for our pass-through treatment as a RIC which could have an effect on stockholder returns; (xiii) our common stock price may be volatile; and (xiv) general business and economic conditions and other risk factors described in its reports filed from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which statements are made pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and, as such, speak only as of the date made.
