 ITEM 1. BUSINESS

&#160;

Our Company

&#160;

Good Times Restaurants Inc., a Nevada corporation formed on October 6, 1996. operates and franchises Good Times Burgers &#38; Frozen Custard (&#8220;GTBFC&#8221; or &#8220;Good Times&#8221;) restaurants and Bad Daddy&#8217;s Burger Bar concept (&#8220;BDBB&#8221; or &#8220;Bad Daddy&#8217;s&#8221;). Good Times Burgers &#38; Frozen Custard and Bad Daddy&#8217;s Burger Bar are two distinctly different, yet complementary, restaurant concepts. Each is positioned as a high quality brand within its respective segment of the industry, has attractive unit-level economics, significant growth potential, and strong current sales momentum.

&#160;

Since 2013, we have owned 48% of Bad Daddy&#8217;s Franchise Development, LLC (&#8220;BDFD&#8221;), the franchising entity for Bad Daddy&#8217;s Burger Bar. On May 7, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Bad Daddy&#8217;s International, LLC (&#8220;BDI&#8221;), which owns the other 52% of BDFD as well as the intellectual property associated with the BDBB concept. BDI operates four BDBB restaurants in which it owns a 100% interest in Charlotte, NC, and owns 51% and 52%, respectively, of two BDBB restaurants in Raleigh, NC. BDI also owns a 23% interest in one BDBB restaurant in Winston Salem, NC, and receives a royalty payment from the licensed BDBB restaurant located in the Charlotte-Douglas Airport. As of December 16, 2016 there are twelve other BDBB restaurants, ten of which we operate in Colorado and two of which are operated by third party franchisees in Greenville, South Carolina and Knoxville, Tennessee. As a result of the acquisition, the Company now maintains complete ownership of the brand and trademark rights to BDBB and of the BDI restaurant interests in North Carolina. The acquisition has also provided us with what we believe can be national expansion potential for BDBB with both company-operated and franchised restaurants.

&#160;

The terms &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;Good Times&#8221; and similar terms refer to Good Times Restaurants Inc., a Nevada corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries, including BDFD, BDI, Good Times Drive-Thru Inc. (&#8220;Drive Thru&#8221;) and BD of Colorado LLC (&#8220;BD of Colo&#8221;). Drive Thru, BDI, BDFD and BD of Colo are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Good Times Restaurants Inc. Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, financial and operating data in this 10-K report reflect the consolidated business and operations of Good Times Restaurants Inc., BDFD, BDI, BD of Colo, and Drive Thru.

&#160;

Financial &#38; Brand Highlights

&#160;

&#183; The Good Times brand has had six consecutive years of same store sales growth.

&#183; The Good Times brand had a 0.3% increase in same store sales for the fiscal year ended September 27, 2016 (&#8220;fiscal 2016&#8221;) in addition to the increase in same store sales for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 (&#8220;fiscal 2015&#8221;) of 6.9%.

&#183; The Bad Daddy&#8217;s brand had a 3.3% increase in same store sales for fiscal 2016.

&#183; We ended fiscal 2016 with $6.3 million in cash and a $38,000 balance in notes payable.

&#183; We entered into a new $9,000,000 credit facility with Cadence Bank of which none had been drawn down at the end of fiscal 2016.

&#183; Our net revenues for fiscal 2016 increased by $20,382,000 (+46.3%) to $64,439,000 from $44,057,000 in fiscal year 2015, primarily due to the acquisition of BDI on May 7, 2015 and six new Bad Daddy&#8217;s locations opened during fiscal 2016.

&#183; We believe Good Times is the only quick service restaurant concept in Colorado offering all natural beef and chicken with no hormones, no steroids, no antibiotics and humanely raised, vegetarian fed animals with no animal byproducts in the feed in all of our hamburger and chicken menu items.

&#183; We continued our television campaign in fiscal 2016 that began in March of 2013 with four distinct product windows, communicating Good Times&#8217; core brand attributes of fresh, all natural, hand crafted products with taste profiles available only at Good Times.

&#183; We plan to build additional Good Times Burgers &#38; Frozen Custard company-owned restaurants in Colorado, utilizing our 2,200 square foot, 48 seat dining room design, our 2,400 square foot, 70 seat dining room design as well as converting buildings from other restaurant concepts.

&#183; We opened six Bad Daddy&#8217;s restaurants in fiscal 2016 and plan to open nine to eleven during fiscal 2017.

&#160;

&#160;

Fiscal 2015 BDI Acquisition and Public Offering

&#160;

In May 2015, we completed a public offering of 2,783,810 shares of our common stock, which included the full exercise of the underwriters&#8217; over-allotment option, at $8.15 per share for net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, of approximately $20.6 million. Net proceeds were used for the acquisition of BDI, to fund the remodeling and reimaging of existing Good Times Burgers &#38; Frozen Custard restaurants, for the development of new Bad Daddy&#8217;s Burger Bar restaurants, as working capital reserves and for future investment at the discretion of our Board of Directors. See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Acquisition of Bad Daddy&#8217;s International, LLC.&#8221;

Recent Developments

&#160;

In September 2016, we entered into a $9,000,000 senior debt revolving line of credit with Cadence Bank to provide the necessary capital to fund future Bad Daddy&#8217;s and Good Times locations as well as fund the continued remodel of existing Good Times locations and recurring capital expenditures.

&#160;

Concepts

&#160;

Good Times Burgers &#38; Frozen Custard

Good Times Burgers &#38; Frozen Custard is an upscale, quick service restaurant concept offering fresh, 100% all natural, hand crafted products. We operate 27 and franchise 10 Good Times restaurants located primarily in the Denver market and along the front range of Colorado. We believe Good Times Burgers &#38; Frozen Custard is the only quick service chain in our region, and one of a very few in the country, that offers a menu of fresh all natural Angus beef and all natural chicken from animals that are humanely raised and vegetarian fed without the use of added hormones, steroids, or antibiotics. In addition to our all natural platform, we offer fresh, unique taste profiles such as Hatch Valley New Mexico green chile breakfast burritos, frozen custard made fresh every few hours in each restaurant, Wild Fries with Wild Dippin Sauce and hand-breaded chicken tenders.

&#160;

&#160;

We compete primarily on the quality of our products and we believe that our menu items are consistent with the quality found at fast casual restaurants, but served at close to the speed of quick service restaurants. Our brand positioning is based on &#8220;Taking a Better Food Stand&#8221; supported by the marketing headline &#8220;Happiness Made to Order&#8221; with three primary brand pillars of Innovation, Quality, and Connectedness . Within Innovation , we strive to create products and flavor profiles available only at Good Times and that challenge traditional quick service restaurant norms. We communicate Quality throughout our menu, from our made-to-order items to our fresh, all natural, handcrafted attributes. We strive for Connectedness with our customers based on strong emotional ties to our brand through social media, appealing to an outdoor and active lifestyle, promoting high quality ingredients, and through community support and involvement.

&#160;

Our average per person check is approximately $6.75, which we believe is lower than the average check at fast casual hamburger concepts such as Habit Burger, Five Guys, and Smashburger, but higher than the typical quick service restaurant average check. We do not offer a low-priced value menu like most national and multi-regional quick service chains, choosing to define our value proposition based on a range of price choices within each of our menu categories and the quality of our food.

&#160;

The success of our strategy is evident in our strong same-store sales growth (sales growth over the prior year period at restaurants open more than 15 months, also referred to as comparable sales). Based on information from industry analysts and third party publications, our growth in comparable restaurant sales has outperformed the quick service restaurant industry average over the last five years. Fiscal 2016&#8217;s comparable sales growth of 0.3% followed comparable sales growth of 6.9% in fiscal 2015, 14.6% in fiscal 2014, 11.9% in 2013 and 3.1% growth in 2012.

&#160;

Bad Daddy&#8217;s Burger Bar

Bad Daddy&#8217;s Burger Bar operates in the emerging &#8220;small box&#8221; better burger casual dining segment and is an upscale, chef driven, full service, full bar concept.

&#160;

The menu consists of items made according to chef-driven recipes and with high quality ingredients that we believe have broad consumer appeal, yet are very distinctive within the upscale, casual dining segment. The menu is comprised of signature burgers, salads, sandwiches, and appetizers executed in unique flavor profiles. Regular &#8220;chef specials&#8221; are offered in each menu category that highlight unique flavor profiles whenever possible. Housemade sauces and dressings, a brioche bun, non-beef alternatives including buffalo, tuna, turkey and chicken and Create Your Own Burgers and Salads all help to differentiate Bad Daddy&#8217;s from other restaurants. The food menu is complemented by a full bar that focuses on local, craft microbrew beers and specialty cocktails. Alcoholic beverages account for approximately 14-24% of sales in our Bad Daddy&#8217;s restaurants. The quality positioning generates an average per person check of over $17, slightly above traditional bar and grill competitors such as Chili&#8217;s and Red Robin. The lunch daypart represents approximately 40% and the dinner daypart represents approximately 60% of restaurant sales, with hours of operation from 11 am to 10 pm or 11 pm with restaurants open slightly later on weekends, depending on the surrounding trade area. 

&#160;

The restaurants have a high energy yet family friendly environment with iconic, pop culture design elements and a personal, ultra-friendly and informal service platform. BDBB&#8217;s menu, service and environment are designed around a slightly irreverent brand personality, such as our Bad Ass Burger and Bad Ass Margarita menu items and the iconic Farrah Fawcett and Paul Newman Cool Hand Luke posters in the men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s rooms.

&#160;

A typical BDBB restaurant is approximately 3,500-4,000 square feet with an enclosed patio, smaller than most other casual dining restaurants. Based on average annual restaurant sales of approximately $2.6 million (for restaurants open more than 18 months), BDBBs generate average sales per square foot of approximately $700, which we believe is a key metric indicating the strength and expansion potential of the concept. While sharing common design elements, each restaurant has unique features intended to create the impression that each Bad Daddy&#8217;s is local to its trade area and serves as a further point of differentiation from the larger casual dining chains. We believe BDBBs&#8217; innovative menu and personalized service combined with a unique, fun restaurant design enhance our customers&#8217; experience and differentiate BDBB from its competitors.

&#160;

&#160;

Our Business Strengths

&#160;

Our Brands Are Complementary .

&#160;

While operating in different segments of the restaurant industry, our two brands share the following qualities:

&#160;

Each is positioned at the upper end of its respective segment with the value proposition primarily driven by quality and uniqueness. We believe Good Times Burgers and Frozen Custard is the only quick service chain in our region that offers beef, and chicken that is produced without added steroids, hormones, and antibiotics, are vegetarian fed, and from humanely-raised animals. Our quality positioning is further supported by serving hand breaded chicken tenders, fresh lemonade, and frozen custard made fresh every few hours with all natural cream and eggs, among other items. We do not offer a dollar menu that many national chains do, choosing to compete on a market position emphasizing quality and uniqueness and serving made-to-order products with quick service restaurant speed of service.

&#160;

Bad Daddy&#8217;s Burger Bar is an early entrant in the &#8220;small box&#8221; better burger casual dining segment. The menu contains chef-driven items with many made from scratch in our kitchens. Bad Daddy&#8217;s resonates with consumers by consistently executing high quality menu items with unique flavor profiles that are delivered in a personalized, high energy environment with a slightly irreverent brand personality.

&#160;

Our Brands Have a Common Culture and Operating Philosophy .

&#160;

While each of our brands is led by separate operating teams, each shares a commitment to four pillars for success:

&#160;

&#183; Values. &#160; Each brand focuses on developing behaviors and expectations around our core values of Integrity, Respect, Continued Improvement, and Fun.

&#160;

&#183; People. &#160; Each brand seeks to hire high quality people throughout and provide them with comprehensive training programs designed to ensure that they deliver consistently superior products and service. Each has an incentive program at the restaurant level based on balanced metrics that drive customer service, personnel development, and financial performance.

&#160;

&#183; Distinctive quality. &#160; Each brand strives to offer unique, high quality menu items with distinctive taste profiles made with fresh, high quality ingredients.

&#160;

&#183; Excellent systems. &#160; Each brand takes a &#8220;best practices&#8221; approach, cross-pollinating the best ideas that are applicable to either brand. We seek to provide the best operating systems and processes to ease the administrative burden of management, enabling them to focus on leading their team members. Our philosophy is that systems and processes drive financial success and leadership serves as an example and motivating force to our crew members who interact with our guests, driving sales and customer loyalty.

&#160;

Our Brands Share a Similar Customer Demographic .

&#160;

Due to the common strategic focus on a quality positioning, both Good Times and Bad Daddy&#8217;s appeal to a slightly higher income, more upscale consumer demographic profile. However, there is little, if any, overlap between the brands in how consumers use them. Good Times is convenience-driven, and the majority of its sales are derived from drive-through transactions with a $6.75 per person average check, while Bad Daddy&#8217;s provides a more destination-oriented, full service dining occasion with a $17+ per person average check.

&#160;

Our Brands Have Growth Potential .

&#160;

We believe both of our brands are well positioned to take advantage of consumers&#8217; growing demand for restaurants with fresh, high quality, all natural products that offer fully customizable menu choices. Consumers want to know where their food comes from, want to be able to customize menu items to fit their individual preference and dining occasions, and place a higher value on perceived healthiness and on brands they can trust to execute on those attributes. We believe Good Times and Bad Daddy&#8217;s are both well positioned to capitalize on those macro-trends.

&#160;

Both of our brands currently operate with relatively small market penetration and overall development footprints, providing significant expansion potential. As we further develop our markets, we expect to realize efficiencies in supervision and development and training of our employees, as well as economies of scale in our supply chain cost structure. It is our goal to grow concentrically from our existing operating bases in order to maximize brand awareness and operating and distribution efficiencies.

&#160;

&#160;

During 2015 we made investments in our information technology platform so that Good Times and Bad Daddy&#8217;s operate with a common point of purchase system and we have implemented a common back office system for both brands. We are also continuing to invest in sophisticated video and digital training tools, making all of each brand&#8217;s restaurant level processes, systems, recipes and management tools available in one commonly accessible database.

&#160;

We Have Assembled a Dedicated Management Team with Significant Experience .

&#160;

Our core Good Times management team has worked together for over 20 years developing its concept and systems. Immediately after signing our license agreement to operate Bad Daddy&#8217;s restaurants in Colorado, we hired a team experienced in the management and development of full service concepts to guide the growth of that brand.

&#160;

Each of our brands are operated under separately dedicated management teams utilizing shared support services in Administration, Finance, Accounting, Human Resources, Development, Marketing and Information Technology. We believe we have the processes and systems in place to support accelerated growth.

&#160;

We Have Significant Operating Momentum .

&#160;

Same-store sales at Good Times have increased six consecutive years. Our compound same-store sales growth rate was approximately 37% from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2016. We believe this performance is largely the result of the evolution in our brand positioning, the re-imaging of several of our older restaurants, effective broadcast and social media marketing, and consistent execution of the customer experience. We plan to continue to re-image and remodel our remaining restaurants, innovate with new menu items in keeping with our brand strategy, and communicate our brand story to maintain our same-store sales growth.

&#160;

The Bad Daddy&#8217;s concept was started in 2007 in Charlotte, NC. Sales of the Bad Daddy&#8217;s restaurants which were open for at least 18 months averaged $2.6 million for the fifty-two weeks ended September 27, 2016.

&#160;

We believe that the strength of the Bad Daddy&#8217;s unit economic model provides us with significant expansion potential, both in our existing markets of North Carolina and Colorado and in new markets.

&#160;

Our Growth Strategies.

&#160;

We are focused on continuing to improve the profitability of Drive Thru and developing additional Good Times Burgers &#38; Frozen Custard restaurants in our home state of Colorado while developing the Bad Daddy&#8217;s Burger Bar concept with company-owned restaurants in Colorado and North Carolina in addition to other markets in the U.S., allowing us to leverage these strengths and opportunities:

&#160;

&#183; Good Times is a 29-year-old company with a vibrant, high quality brand position in Colorado.

&#160;

&#183; We have a $9 million credit facility of which none has been drawn, a healthy balance sheet with positive cash flow from operations and six consecutive years of same store sales growth at Good Times.

&#160;

&#183; We own the Bad Daddy&#8217;s Burger Bar concept, which we believe is an exciting new, emerging growth concept.

&#160;

&#183; We have an existing infrastructure with sophisticated systems and processes in place that can be significantly leveraged with a new growth concept.

&#160;

We believe that there are significant opportunities to develop new units, grow customer traffic and increase awareness of our brands. The following sets forth the key elements of our growth strategy.

&#160;

1. Pursue Disciplined Growth of Company-operated Bad Daddy&#8217;s Burger Bar Restaurants . We have opened one new Bad Daddy&#8217;s restaurant in Broomfield, Colorado subsequent to September 27, 2016, have additional restaurants under construction to open in fiscal 2017 and we are in various stages of lease negotiation for additional sites for development in 2017 and 2018. Additionally, we have two leases signed for new restaurants in Charlotte, North Carolina, one in Raleigh, North Carolina, one in Fayetteville, North Carolina and two in the Denver, Colorado Metropolitan area with expected openings in 2017 and we plan to pursue additional sites for development in additional markets. We intend to follow a disciplined strategy of initially developing restaurants in other metropolitan areas in the Mid-Atlantic region and in states contiguous to Colorado that meet our demographic, real estate and investment criteria in order to maximize the efficiency of our regional and brand management and cost control.

&#160;

&#160;

We believe that the broad appeal of Bad Daddy&#8217;s concept and the high sales generated per square foot make it attractive to developers and provide us with the opportunity for continued expansion in other new markets across the country. We seek sites in upper middle income suburban areas in proximity to upscale retail developments, theaters and high levels of daytime employment.

&#160;

2. Develop joint venture Bad Daddy&#8217;s . &#160; We plan to develop two new Bad Daddy&#8217;s restaurants with our existing joint venture partners in North Carolina fiscal 2017.

&#160;

3. Remodel/Refresh our Good Times restaurants . There are two levels to our remodel program that began in fiscal 2012: a refreshing of the restaurant exterior that includes painting, landscaping, new exterior finishes, new graphics and signage and upgraded patio accoutrements; and a larger scale remodeling of the restaurant that includes new dining room finishes and d&#233;cor and the rebuilding of select locations. We have remodeled or refreshed sixteen company-owned restaurants and four franchised restaurants to date, and plan on refreshing or remodeling additional company-owned and franchised locations during fiscal 2017 and 2018. We anticipate that Good Times will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in fiscal 2017 to fund its refresh and remodel capital expenditures. The specific sales increases attributable to the remodel/refresh program are difficult to quantify due to the overall sales growth in all our restaurants. However, we believe that the refresh and remodel investment brings the restaurants up to our current brand standards, improves the appearance and street appeal of the restaurants, improves the overall customer experience and supports the brand&#8217;s quality positioning.

&#160;

4. Expand the number of Good Times Burger &#38; Frozen Custard locations . We have one new location under construction in Greeley, Colorado that will open in fiscal 2017. In evaluating the cost of real estate, the competitive environment and the cost of labor in new markets outside of Colorado for potential development of Good Times, we believe it is in our best interest to continue to develop Good Times in Colorado as sites become available and focus our new unit growth on Bad Daddy&#8217;s in existing and new markets.

&#160;

5. Increase same-store sales in both brands . We intend to continue to focus on increasing our same-store sales. We plan to further strengthen our fresh, handcrafted, all natural brand position at Good Times with menu innovation and quality improvements in each of our menu categories, such as our better burger process, West Coast Double Burger value proposition, expanded breakfast offering, Smothered Fries, Summer Shakes, and all natural Flavored Tenders. We will also continue our broadcast marketing program while expanding our social media activities to elevate our online consumer facing conversation around the attributes of our all natural platform for each of our core products. We believe that the completion of the remodeling and reimaging of our Good Times restaurants will positively impact our same-store sales trends over time. We intend to increase Bad Daddy&#8217;s same store sales through continual innovation in both ongoing menu engineering and chef-special temporary menu items that we believe drive increased customer visits as well as the per person average check. We also plan to promote our local, microbrew craft beer selections at each restaurant and increase our employees&#8217; knowledge of each beer&#8217;s attributes and taste profile. Bad Daddy&#8217;s marketing is targeted to individual trade areas, community involvement and &#8220;four wall&#8221; marketing activities that focus on optimizing the guests&#8217; food, bar and service experience.

&#160;

Expansion strategy and site selection

&#160;

Good Times Burgers &#38; Frozen Custard

&#160;

We believe that our highest return on investment opportunity in our Good Times Drive Thru Inc. subsidiary is to focus our growth in Colorado for operating and marketing efficiencies off of our existing base of restaurants while building new restaurants within the Denver marketing area.

&#160;

Any development of new Good Times Burgers &#38; Frozen Custard restaurants will involve our new prototype restaurant design on sites that are on or adjacent to big box or grocery store anchored shopping centers or in high activity and employment areas. Our site selection for new restaurants is oriented toward slightly higher income demographic areas than many of our urban locations and most of our targeted trade areas are in relatively high growth areas of the Denver and northern Colorado markets.

&#160;

We lease all of our sites. When we do purchase and develop a site, we intend to ultimately sell the developed site into the sale-leaseback market under a long term lease. Our primary site objective is to secure a suitable site, with the decision to buy or lease as a secondary objective. Our site criteria includes a mix of substantial daily traffic, density of at least 30,000 people within a three-mile radius, strong daytime population and employment base, retail and entertainment traffic generators, good visibility and easy access.

&#160;

&#160;

Bad Daddy&#8217;s Burger Bar

&#160;

Our development of the Bad Daddy&#8217;s Burger Bar concept in company-owned restaurants will focus on urban and suburban upper income demographic areas with median household incomes over $60,000, with a high concentration of daytime employment, upscale retail and movie theaters. We believe the Bad Daddy&#8217;s Burger Bar concept has expansion potential in vibrant, growing, upper scale demographic markets, as additional restaurants are developed.

&#160;

Bad Daddy&#8217;s Burger Bar locations are primarily end-cap locations in new and existing shopping center developments using approximately 3,500 to 4,000 square feet. While our Good Times Burgers &#38; Frozen Custard restaurants are free standing and require extensive site development and entitlement processes, Bad Daddy&#8217;s Burger Bar restaurants can be developed much more quickly due to the requirement for only a building permit, signage approvals and liquor license without the need for extensive on- and off-site development or land and zoning submittals and modifications. We estimate that it will take approximately 90 to 120 days to develop a Bad Daddy&#8217;s Burger Bar from the time a building permit is issued.

&#160;

Restaurant locations : As of December 16, 2016 we operate or franchise a total of thirty-seven Good Times restaurants, of which thirty-five are in Colorado. Two of the restaurants are in Wyoming and are &#8220;dual brand&#8221; concept restaurants operated by a franchisee of both Good Times and Taco John&#8217;s. Additionally, we operate or franchise a total of twenty Bad Daddy&#8217;s Burger Bar locations, of which ten are in Colorado, eight are in North Carolina, one is in South Carolina and one is in Tennessee. One of the North Carolina locations, at Charlotte Douglas International Airport, is operated pursuant to a License Agreement.

In January 2016 a Good Times franchisee terminated their agreement and closed a restaurant in Denver, Colorado. We opened company-owned Bad Daddy&#8217;s restaurants in Littleton, Colorado (January 2016), Longmont, Colorado (February 2016), Colorado Springs, Colorado (April 2016), Ft. Collins, Colorado (September 2016), and Broomfield, Colorado (December 2016).

&#160;

&#160;

Menu

&#160;

Good Times Burgers &#38; Frozen Custard

The menu of a Good Times Burgers &#38; Frozen Custard restaurant is limited to hamburgers, cheeseburgers, chicken sandwiches, French fries, onion rings, fresh lemonades, soft drinks and frozen custard products plus a breakfast menu consisting of breakfast burritos, orange juice and coffee. Each menu item is made to order at the time the customer places the order and is not pre-prepared.

&#160;

Our hamburger patties are made with Meyer All Natural, All Angus beef, served on a 4&#8221; bun. Hamburgers and cheeseburgers are garnished with fresh iceberg lettuce, fresh sliced sweet red onions, mayonnaise, guacamole and all natural and proprietary sauces. The chicken products include 100% All Natural tenderloins that are hand breaded in each restaurant daily. Signature chicken products include the &#8220;Hand Breaded Tenders,&#8221; &#8220;Buffalo Chicken Tender,&#8221; &#8220;Guacamole Bacon Chicken Tender,&#8221; and a &#8220;Tuscan Chicken.&#8221; Equipment has been automated and equipped with compensating computers to deliver a consistent product and minimize variability in operating systems.

&#160;

All natural Angus beef and chicken are raised without the use of any hormones, antibiotics or animal byproducts that are normally used in the open market. We believe that all natural beef and chicken deliver a better tasting product and, because of the rigorous protocols and testing that are a part of the Meyer All Natural All Angus Beef and Springer Mountain Farms Chicken processes, may also minimize the risk of any food-borne bacteria-related illnesses.

&#160;

Fresh frozen custard is a premium ice cream (requiring in excess of 10% butterfat content and 1.4% egg yolks) with a proprietary vanilla blend that is prepared from highly specialized equipment that minimizes the amount of air that is added to the mix and that creates smaller ice crystals than other frozen dairy desserts. The custard is scooped similarly to hard-packed ice cream but is served at a slightly warmer temperature. The resulting product is smoother, creamier and thicker than typical soft serve or hard-packed ice cream products. We serve the frozen custard as vanilla and a flavor of the day in cups and cones, specialty sundaes and &#8220;Spoonbenders,&#8221; a mix of custard and toppings, and we anticipate it will continue to be a significant percentage of sales as we continue to develop and promote custard products.

&#160;

The breakfast menu is centered around Hatch Valley Green Chile Burritos made with our own proprietary green chile recipe using Hatch Valley, New Mexico roasted green chiles, eggs, potatoes, and cheese offered with the choice of bacon, sausage or chorizo. We have expanded our breakfast menu to include a double egg breakfast sandwich, offered with bacon and cheddar or tomato and pesto, and served on an artisan bun. We also offer a premium coffee made by Daz Bog, a Colorado based coffee roaster, and pure 100% orange juice.

&#160;

Bad Daddy&#8217;s Burger Bar

&#160;

The menu of Bad Daddy&#8217;s Burger Bar consists of high quality, handcrafted all-Angus beef burgers with unique toppings such as buttermilk country-fried bacon, housemade American cheese, scratch made pesto and our specialty Bad Daddy&#8217;s sauce. The customizable menu options also include artisanal cheeses, tuna, turkey, buffalo and chicken sandwiches. We also offer recipe or customizable chopped salads, a full gluten free menu and regional menu items that incorporate local flavors. We also offer appetizers, hand-cut fries, housemade potato chips, hand-spun ice cream milk shakes and desserts. We offer a variety of craft beers from local breweries and a full bar.

&#160;

Signature recipes include the &#8220;Bad Ass Burger,&#8221; &#8220;Mama Ricotta&#8217;s Burger&#8221; and &#8220;Emilio&#8217;s Chicken Sandwich.&#8221; Chopped Salads include the &#8220;Texican Chicken Salad,&#8221; the &#8220;Stella&#8217;s Greek Salad&#8221; and create your own salad options. The craft beer and cocktail menus include local craft microbrews in each market. We&#8217;ve partnered with Full Sail Brewing Company for our own &#8220;Bad Daddy&#8217;s Amber Ale&#8221;. We offer a cocktail menu that uses fresh-squeezed housemade sours and fresh garnishes including the &#8220;Bad Ass Margarita&#8221;, &#8220;Bad Betty&#8221; and &#8220;Southern Hospitalitea.&#8221;

&#160;

Bad Daddy&#8217;s Burger Bar strives to provide proprietary flavors and recipes available nowhere else with fresh, handcrafted quality throughout the menu, including rotating chef specials with flavor profiles unique to Bad Daddy&#8217;s.

&#160;

&#160;

Marketing &#38; Advertising

&#160;

Good Times Burgers &#38; Frozen Custard

&#160;

Our marketing strategy for Good Times Burgers &#38; Frozen Custard focuses on: 1) driving same store restaurant sales through attracting new customers and increasing the frequency of visits by current customers; 2) communicating specific product news and attributes to build strong points of difference from competitors; and 3) communicating a unique, strong and consistent brand personality.

&#160;

Media is an important component of building our brand awareness and distinctiveness. We spent most of our broadcast advertising dollars on cable television media during fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016. The Colorado market is an expensive media market, so most of our advertising placement is not in prime time but in early and late fringe, prime access and late news time slots. We augment our cable television advertising with a social media presence that affords us a higher level of engagement with current customers and an increased level of product giveaways to support high sales opportunity products.

&#160;

We plan to continue to be active in digital and social media in order to create more customer engagement with our brand and to target specific consumer segments. We anticipate leveraging our customer email database and website to create cost effective channels to target existing customers and increase their frequency.

&#160;

Bad Daddy&#8217;s Burger Bar

&#160;

Our marketing strategy for Bad Daddy&#8217;s Burger Bar focuses on iconic, in-store merchandising materials and local store marketing to the surrounding trade area around each restaurant, including public relations and community based events. The focus is not on market wide promotions or marketing but on the in-store customer experience, building word of mouth reputation and recommendations and local public relations based on the prior awards and recognitions received by Bad Daddy&#8217;s. We utilize trade area specific direct mail materials, particularly in support of new restaurant openings, to drive trial and initial awareness as well as targeted social media marketing. We have developed an expanded menu of rotating chef specials featuring unique taste profiles and local ingredients for burgers, salads, sandwiches and appetizers, supported by trade area specific beer offerings and bar promotions.

&#160;

Operations

&#160;

We maintain separate operating teams for each of our concepts and have extensive operating, training and quality control systems in place.

&#160;

Restaurant Management

&#160;

Each Good Times Burgers &#38; Frozen Custard restaurant employs a general manager, one to two assistant managers and approximately 15 to 25 employees, most of whom work part-time during three shifts. An eight to ten-week training program is utilized to train restaurant managers on all phases of the operation. Ongoing training is provided as necessary. We believe that incentive compensation of our restaurant managers is essential to the success of our business. Accordingly, in addition to a salary, managerial employees may be paid a bonus based upon proficiency in meeting financial, customer service and quality performance objectives tied to a monthly scorecard of measures. Most of our managers participate in a bonus plan based on their performance against their monthly financial, operating, customer and people development scorecard metrics.

&#160;

Bad Daddy&#8217;s Burger Bar was developed as a chef-driven concept and utilizes a team of four to six managers in our operations at each restaurant. Managers are trained in back of the house skills (prep, kitchen positions and line management), front of the house service positions (host, server and bar) and all management functions. As a full service concept, the experience, qualifications and compensation differs from Good Times Burgers &#38; Frozen Custard and we recruit and train a separate operating team for Bad Daddy&#8217;s Burger Bar operations. Our managers participate in a bonus pool for each restaurant based on a percentage of sales. Bonuses are awarded based on achieving financial, customer service and people development goals and metrics.

&#160;

Operational Systems and Processes

&#160;

We believe that we have high level operating systems and processes relative to those in the industry for both of our concepts. Detailed processes have been developed for hourly, daily, weekly and monthly responsibilities that drive consistency across our system of restaurants and performance against our standards within different day parts. We utilize a labor program to determine optimal staffing needs of each restaurant based on its actual customer flow and demand. We also employ several additional operational tools to continuously monitor and improve speed of service, food waste, food quality, sanitation, financial management and employee development. The order system at each Good Times Burgers &#38; Frozen Custard restaurant is equipped with an internal timing device that displays and records the time each order takes to prepare and deliver. 

&#160;

&#160;

We use several sources of customer feedback to evaluate each restaurant&#8217;s service and quality performance, including an extensive secret shopper program, telephone surveys, website comments and a customer feedback tool that aggregates all social media comments as well as store by store surveys each week for each restaurant. We believe that information will assist us in evaluating opportunities for improved execution of the customer experience.

&#160;

Training

&#160;

We strive to maintain quality and consistency in each of our restaurants for both Good Times and Bad Daddy&#8217;s through the careful training and supervision of all our employees at all levels and the establishment of, and adherence to, high standards relating to personnel performance, food and beverage preparation and maintenance of our restaurants. Each manager must complete an eight to ten-week training program, be certified on several core processes and is then closely supervised to show both comprehension and capability before they are allowed to manage autonomously. All of our training and development is based upon a &#8220;train, test, certify, re-train&#8221; cycle around standards and operating processes at all levels. We have a defined weekly and monthly goal setting process around service, employee development, financial management and store maintenance goals for every restaurant. Additionally, we have a library of video training tools to drive training efficiencies and consistency at both brands.

&#160;

Recruiting and Retention

&#160;

We seek to hire experienced restaurant managers and Operating Partners. We support employees by offering competitive wages and benefits, including a 401(k) plan, medical insurance, and incentive plans at every level that are tied to performance against key goals and objectives. We motivate and prepare our employees by providing them with opportunities for increased responsibilities and advancement. We also provide various other incentives, including vacations, car allowances, monthly performance bonuses and monetary rewards for managers who develop future managers for our restaurants. We have implemented an online screening and hiring tool that has proven to reduce hourly employee turnover.

&#160;

Franchising

&#160;

For Good Times Burgers &#38; Frozen Custard, we have prepared form area rights and franchise agreements and advertising material to be utilized in soliciting prospective franchisees. However, we have not been actively soliciting new Good Times franchisees. We have historically sought to attract franchisees that are experienced restaurant operators, are well capitalized and have demonstrated the ability to develop one to five restaurants. We review sites selected for franchises and monitor performance of franchise units. We are not currently soliciting new franchisees and anticipate focusing on building additional company-owned Good Times Burgers &#38; Frozen Custard restaurants.

&#160;

We estimate that it will cost a Good Times Burgers &#38; Frozen Custard franchisee on average approximately $1,000,000 to $1,300,000 to open a restaurant with dining room seating, including pre-opening costs and working capital, assuming the land is leased. A franchisee typically will pay a royalty of 4% of net sales, an advertising materials fee of at least 1.5% of net sales, plus participation in regional advertising up to an additional 4% of net sales, or a higher amount approved by the advertising cooperative, and initial development and franchise fees totaling $25,000 per restaurant. Among the services and materials that we provide to franchisees are site selection assistance, plans and specifications for construction of the Good Times Burgers &#38; Frozen Custard restaurants, an operating manual, which includes product specifications and quality control procedures, training, on-site opening supervision and advice from time to time relating to operation of the franchised restaurants.

&#160;

After a Good Times Burgers &#38; Frozen Custard franchise agreement is signed, we actively work with and monitor our franchisees to ensure successful franchise operations as well as compliance with our systems and procedures. During the development phase, we assist in the selection of sites and the development of prototype and building plans, including all required changes by local municipalities and developers. We provide an opening team of trainers to assist in the opening of the restaurant. We advise the franchisee on menu, management training and marketing. On an ongoing basis we conduct standards reviews of all franchise restaurants in key areas including product quality, service standards, restaurant cleanliness and sanitation and food safety.

&#160;

&#160;

We have entered into eight Good Times Burgers &#38; Frozen Custard franchise agreements in the greater Denver metropolitan area and two dual-branded franchised restaurants operate in Gillette and Sheridan, Wyoming. In addition, seven joint-venture restaurants are operating in the Denver metropolitan area media market.

&#160;

For Bad Daddy&#8217;s Burger Bar, we have form area rights and franchise agreements, and two existing franchise agreements signed. We anticipate that a franchisee will typically pay a royalty of 4% to 5% of net sales and will participate in an advertising fund and local advertising by contributing up to 2% of net sales. Initial development and franchise fees are projected to be $35,000 per restaurant. We estimate that it will cost a Bad Daddy&#8217;s Burger Bar franchisee $590,000 to $1,382,000 to open a 3,000 to 3,800 square foot restaurant in an in-line or end-cap retail center, based on our knowledge of the development costs of the existing Bad Daddy&#8217;s Burger Bar restaurants. We currently have two franchise agreements for one restaurant in South Carolina and one restaurant in Tennessee, and a license agreement for a location in the Charlotte International Airport.

&#160;

Management Information Systems

&#160;

Financial and management control is maintained through the use of automated data processing and centralized accounting and management information systems that we provide. Sales, labor and cash data is collected daily via a restaurant back office system which gathers data from the restaurant point-of-sale system. Management receives daily, weekly and monthly reports identifying food, labor and operating expenses and other significant indicators of restaurant performance. The major management information systems are divided by function:

&#160;

&#183; Restaurant point of sale;

&#183; Restaurant back-of-house;

&#183; Financial;

&#183; Payroll/human resources; and

&#183; Internal operational reports.

&#160;

We believe that these reporting systems are sophisticated and enhance our ability to control and manage operations.

&#160;

Food Preparation, Quality Control &#38; Purchasing

&#160;

We believe that we have excellent food quality standards relative to the industry. Our systems are designed to protect our food supply throughout the preparation process. We inspect specific qualified manufacturers and work together with those manufacturers to provide specifications and quality controls. Our operations management teams are trained in a comprehensive safety and sanitation course provided by the National Restaurant Association. Minimum cook temperature requirements and line checks throughout the day ensure the safety and quality of both burgers and other items we use in our restaurants.

&#160;

We currently purchase 100% of the food and paper supplies for our Good Times Burgers &#38; Frozen Custard restaurants and the majority of the food and paper supplies for our Colorado Bad Daddy&#8217;s restaurants from Food Services of America. In our North Carolina Bad Daddy&#8217;s restaurants, we currently purchase the majority of our food and paper supplies from US Foods. In addition, we maintain multiple approved suppliers for all key components of our menu to mitigate risk and ensure supply. Suppliers are chosen based upon their ability to provide (i) a continuous supply of product that meets all safety and quality specifications, (ii) logistics expertise and freight management, (iii) product innovation and differentiation, (iv) customer service, (v) transparency of business relationships and (vi) competitive pricing. Specified products are distributed to all restaurants through Food Services of America or US Foods under negotiated contracts directly to our restaurants two to four times per week depending on restaurant requirements. We do not believe that the current reliance on these distributors will have any long-term material adverse effect since we believe that there are a sufficient number of other suppliers from which food and paper supplies could be purchased with little or no interruption in service. We do not anticipate any difficulty in continuing to obtain an adequate quantity of food and paper supplies of acceptable quality and at acceptable prices.

&#160;

&#160;

Employees

&#160;

At September 27, 2016, we had approximately 1,485 employees of which 1,267 are hourly employees and 218 are salaried employees working full time. We consider our employee relations to be good. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.

&#160;

Competition

&#160;

The restaurant industry, including the fast food segment, is highly competitive. Good Times Burgers &#38; Frozen Custard competes with a large number of other hamburger-oriented fast food restaurants in the areas in which it operates. Many of these restaurants are owned and operated by regional and national restaurant chains, many of which have greater financial resources and experience than we do. Restaurant companies that currently compete with Good Times Burgers &#38; Frozen Custard in the Denver market include McDonald&#8217;s, Burger King, Wendy&#8217;s, Carl&#8217;s Jr., Sonic, Jack in the Box and Freddy&#8217;s. Double drive-through restaurant chains such as Rally&#8217;s Hamburgers and Checker&#8217;s Drive-In Restaurants, which currently operate a total of over 800 double drive-through restaurants in various markets in the United States, are not currently operating in Colorado. Culver&#8217;s and Freddy&#8217;s are the only significant competitors offering frozen custard as a primary menu item operating in the Denver and Colorado Springs markets and both have a significant presence in Midwestern markets that may be targeted for expansion. Additional &#8220;fast casual&#8221; hamburger restaurants are being developed in the Colorado market, such as Smashburger and Five Guys; however, they do not have drive-through service and generate an average per person check that is approximately 50% higher than the average check at a Good Times Burgers &#38; Frozen Custard restaurant.

&#160;

We believe that Good Times Burgers &#38; Frozen Custard may have a competitive advantage in terms of quality of product compared to traditional fast food hamburger chains. Early development of our double drive-through concept in Colorado has given us an advantage over other double drive-through chains that may seek to expand into Colorado because of our brand awareness and present restaurant locations. Nevertheless, we may be at a competitive disadvantage to other restaurant chains with greater name recognition and marketing capability. Furthermore, most of our competitors in the fast-food business operate more restaurants, have been established longer, and have greater financial resources and name recognition than we do. There is also active competition for management personnel, as well as for attractive commercial real estate sites suitable for restaurants.

&#160;

Bad Daddy&#8217;s Burger Bar competes with both local and national grill and bar concepts and gourmet, &#8220;better burger&#8221; concepts. As the concept is expanded, Bad Daddy&#8217;s Burger Bar will compete against concepts such as Red Robin, Chili&#8217;s, Burger Lounge, The Counter, and Bobby&#8217;s Burger Palace. There are other burger-centric fast casual concepts such as Five Guys Burgers &#38; Fries and Smashburger that operate at a lower average customer check than Bad Daddy&#8217;s Burger Bar and others such as Zinburger, Bare Burger and Five Napkin Burger that operate with a higher average customer check. We believe that Bad Daddy&#8217;s Burger Bar has an advantage in the handcrafted quality of our food, distinctiveness of its atmosphere and uniqueness of its menu offerings. Nevertheless, Bad Daddy&#8217;s Burger Bar may be at a competitive disadvantage to other restaurant chains with greater name recognition.

&#160;

Intellectual Property

&#160;

We have registered our mark &#8220;Good Times Burgers &#38; Frozen Custard&#8221; federally. We received approval of our federal registration of &#8220;Good Times&#8221; in 2003. In addition, we own trademarks or service marks that have been registered, or for which applications are pending, with the United States Patent and Trademark Office including but not limited to: &#8220;Big Daddy Bacon Cheeseburger,&#8221; &#8220;Chicken Dunkers,&#8221; &#8220;Happiness Made To Order,&#8221; &#8220;Mighty Deluxe.&#8221; Our trademarks expire between 2016 and 2025.

&#160;

We have registered the mark &#8220;Bad Daddy&#8217;s Burger Bar&#8221; with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.

&#160;

Government Regulation

&#160;

Each of our restaurants is subject to the regulations of various health, sanitation, safety and fire agencies in the jurisdiction in which the restaurant is located. Difficulties or failures in obtaining the required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the opening of a new restaurant. Federal and state environmental regulations have not had a material effect on our operations. More stringent and varied requirements of local governmental bodies with respect to zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations. We are subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wages, overtime, and other working conditions. In addition, we are subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act, which requires restaurants and other facilities open to the public to provide for access and use of facilities by the handicapped. Management believes that we are in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. Beginning in 2015, we became subject to the Affordable Care Act which requires us to have the required health insurance benefits for eligible employees.

&#160;

&#160;

We are also subject to federal and state laws regulating franchise operations, which vary from registration and disclosure requirements in the offer and sale of franchises to the application of statutory standards regulating franchise relationships. Many state franchise laws impose restrictions on the franchise agreements, including limitations on non-competition provisions and the termination or non-renewal of a franchise. Some states require that franchise materials be registered before franchises can be offered or sold in that state.

&#160;

In addition, each Bad Daddy&#8217;s Burger Bar restaurant requires a liquor license and adherence to the attendant laws and requirements regulating the serving and consumption of alcohol. Alcoholic beverage control regulations govern various aspects of these restaurants&#8217; daily operations, including the minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing and inventory control, handling and storage. Typically, licenses to sell alcoholic beverages will require annual renewal and may be suspended or revoked at any time for cause, the definition of which varies by locality.
