&#160; 

Our Company 

&#160; 

We are a health and wellness company. Presently, our primary source of revenue is pazoo.com, an online, content driven, advertising supported health and wellness web site for people and their pets. This site has e-commerce functionality which allows pazoo.com to be an online retailer of nutritional foods/supplements, wellness goods, and fitness apparel. The Company has also moved into the cannabis industry where it seeks to provide, through its wholly owned subsidiaries (MA &#38; Associates, LLC and Harris Lee Holdings, LLC), quality control services to the medical and recreational cannabis industry. The company&#8217;s primary mission is to protect the public health by providing infrastructure and analytical services to legally authorized distributors and producers of cannabis and to regulators tracking their operations. This will be accomplished by the exclusive use of a &#8216;best-in-class&#8221; testing protocol established by Steep Hill Labs, Inc. The company will provide the medical cannabis industry guidelines on how the regulation and inspection by public health authorities is to be implemented. It is anticipated that this segment of the company will be its primary revenue source in the future. The cannabis industry is heavily regulated on the Federal, State and Local levels and the company is subject to changing regulation and enforcement. 

&#160; 

Lines of Business 

&#160; 

We currently have three lines of business relating to and revolving around the health and wellness arena; at this time no significant revenue has been derived from any of these sources 

&#9679; Pharmaceutical Testing Facilities. We entered this arena through our acquisition of a 100% equity stake in MA &#38; Associates, LLC in order to set up two testing locations. MA &#38; Associates was launched in September of 2013 to provide quality control services to the medical cannabis industry. MA &#38; Associates&#8217; primary mission is to protect the public health by providing infrastructure and analytical services to legally authorized distributors and producers of cannabis and to regulators tracking their operations. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The company will provide the medical cannabis industry guidelines on how the regulation and inspection by public health authorities is to be implemented. MA &#38; Associates&#8217; primary customer base includes all of the licensed cannabis cultivators, in the State of Nevada, and their customers are required by law to have their products tested before they can be transferred to the dispensaries. Furthermore, we have acquired all of the Membership interest in Harris Lee Holdings, LLC. Harris Lee was set up to take the MA model and testing operations to additional states above and beyond Nevada either in direct testing laboratories or through licensing the testing protocol. As such, we are in a unique position to provide the mandated health and safety testing in this burgeoning industry. 

&#160; 

&#9679; Advertising Revenue from our Website, www.pazoo.com. Through advertising providers and agencies, pazoo.com is paid for every ad impression that appears on a page for which a visitor goes to. As we build our visitor base, ad revenue will increase. However, just having the traffic does not effectively increase advertising revenue. To get the full value of each visitor, the time on site must be long enough so that a visitor is interested in going to multiple pages for which there are ads on each page. The only way this will transpire is if the visitor&#8217;s experience is gratifying. This is why pazoo.com is so focused on quality content that&#8217;s interesting and informative. A bad visitor experience will result in a low time on site and fewer page views. Internet tracking tools have much improved over the past decade and will continue to improve in the coming years, especially when it comes to advertising and overall website analytics. Pazoo continues to constantly improve is this area at all times. 

&#160; 

Pazoo.com has a unique and compelling online marketing platform. Pazoo.com offers the following important marketing advantages to its target audiences: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

1. 

A comprehensive solution as a content source &#8211; information on a full spectrum of disciplines within the health and wellness marketplace; 

&#160; 

2.

&#160; 

4. 

Content in the Health and Wellness sector of cannabis. To empower users to read and learn about the benefits and the need for the testing of the cannabis plant. 

&#160;

&#9679; E-commerce. We have limited e-commerce offerings which we anticipate will increase as we begin to offer the sale of non-regulated cannabis related products. In this way we could establish a revenue source over and above advertising revenue which is driven based on each visitor. We have the following e-commerce elements ready for an activated marketing program: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

1. 

An e-commerce platform that is functional; 

&#160; 

2. 

Relationships with manufacturers, distributors and other e-commerce companies so that increasing product offerings will not be time consuming; 

&#160; 

3.

&#160; 

4. 

Members on the pazoo.com content team that are experienced in e-commerce marketing; i.e. we will look to offer our consumers low cost and timely delivery of product by negotiating with shipping companies to offer a flat rates on various products. 

&#160; 

Growth Strategy 

&#160; 

We plan to grow our assets and earnings per share by employing the following business strategies: 

&#9679; Opportunistically Pursue Strategic Acquisitions. We plan to selectively pursue strategic, investments in, or acquisitions of, companies (like MA &#38; Associates and Harris Lee Holdings, LLC) and assets that are complementary to our existing lines of business. We believe that our existing management platform can support more assets without significant increases to our infrastructure due to the scalable nature of our operations. 

&#160;

&#9679; Expand Our Foot Print in the Pharmaceutical Testing Arena. Through the acquisitions of MA &#38; Associates, LLC and Harris Lee Holdings, LLC, Pazoo has entered the business of pharmaceutical testing of cannabis products. MA &#38; Associates, LLC ( d/b/a Steep Hill Nevada under a License Agreement to use the Steep Hill name and testing protocols) has obtained a provisional license from the State of Nevada to operate a cannabis testing laboratory. While there is no guaranty, it is anticipated that MA &#38; Associates, LLC will be granted its permanent license from the State of Nevada and will be able to open the lab and begin testing in the second quarter of this year. Harris Lee Holdings, LLC maintains an exclusive license, in certain states, to use the testing protocols of Steep Hill, Inc. Due to Colorado residency requirements Harris Lee Holdings, LLC cannot meet, Harris Lee Holdings, LLC has sub-licensed the testing protocols to Harris Lee Colorado, LLC in exchange for a testing fee for each test conducted. The Colorado MED has recently approved the transfer of management of an existing laboratory, operating as Steep Hill Colorado, to Harris Lee Colorado, LLC (a related party) and Harris Lee Holdings, LLC has begun to derive testing revenue from Harris Lee Colorado, LLC. Harris Lee Holdings is also in the process of establishing a testing facility in Oregon where there are currently no residency requirements that would prohibit direct ownership of that laboratory. In states where direct ownership is not possible, acquisitions and strategic alliances as discussed above will be sought. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#9679; Continue to invest in www.pazoo.com. We look to leverage our in-house experts and industry contacts to expand our market presence. On our website, www.Pazoo.com, experts blog on health and wellness within their areas of expertise, disseminating information on trends, developments and other pertinent industry facts. Additionally, through its own writers and other outside content sources, Pazoo.com provides videos and articles on health and wellness and provides an additional focus on the latest total health concepts. 

&#160; 

The purpose of these various sources of content is to offer a creative solution that comprehensively covers the full spectrum of disciplines within health and wellness. This comprehensive solution has become compelling for our visitors because we have focused on offering vital and entertaining information content that is updated periodically throughout the day. Combining our strategy to be an online library of comprehensive health and wellness information with multiple sources of well written content has helped to establish pazoo.com as a content driven provider of total health and wellness. 

&#160; 

&#9679; Focus on E-commerce. The product offerings on pazoo.com&#8217;s e-commerce platform will expand in terms of the number of products offered when our visitor base increases and management will put more marketing dollars into this business line. At that point, additional manufacturing relationships will be cultivated which will be a main factor in increasing the product offerings on pazoo.com. 

&#160; 

&#9679; Grow Secondary Revenue Streams. Pazoo is a health and wellness company with a strategy of growing revenues through a number of sources. From our inception, the strategy has been to be an integrated health and wellness company offering quality products and services in many lines of business which include the following: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

1. 

Advertising revenue through more traditional media outlets, such as television and radio. The internet has given direct response an inexpensive, effective way to test a direct response offer in terms of the product itself, the pricing of that product, the messaging associated with that product and the target audience. Limited, focused, pay per click (PPC) campaigns can be effectively executed for a fraction of broadcast costs. If a test campaign can successfully determine the elements for a profitable PPC, on line campaigns can be rolled out leading to testing for traditional media outlets such as television, radio and print. conventions. Once the consulting business has enough transactions, visibility and awareness, Pazoo can put on a forum which would be marketed using the Pazoo brand which will have substantial awareness, promoted through the pazoo.com web site and existing partnerships, and feature our own Experts. By rolling out this division in the aforementioned manner, Pazoo will be effectively able to introduce this service without exposing itself to some of the risks that others are exposed to when they enter the public forum business. 

&#160; 

2. 

Consulting services featuring our experts. Generally, our Experts regularly advise consumers and/or companies on matters related to each Expert&#8217;s specific discipline. At some point in the future, it would be a natural extension of our relationship with the Experts to find them &#8220;for pay&#8221; consulting engagements. The consulting engagement could be in the form of working with a person one-on-one or advising a small or large group in a forum or presentation. For Pazoo, this would be a natural extension of our relationship with our Experts (which is already provided for in their contracts with Pazoo). Additionally, with the size of the Pazoo.com audience we have a built in solicitation vehicle for our Experts&#8217; services. Additionally, the Pazoo management is regularly meeting with potential customers for consulting services. The attractive part of this additional revenue stream is that the risk is minimal because there is not meaningful overhead attached to it as a startup opportunity. And, Pazoo only has to pay the Experts when it gets paid. 

&#160; 

3. 

Pazoo branded events like forums and conventions. As a further extension to our consulting business, Pazoo will put on its own health and wellness forums. Pazoo will continue to sell health and wellness products through their website www.pazoo.com as well as their subsidiary CK Distribution, LLC. 

&#160; 

Marketing and Promotion 

&#160; 

To achieve our marketing goal and objective of being the leading provider of pharmaceutical testing, health and wellness content, services and products, our marketing strategy has focused on the following: 

&#160; 

&#9679; Leverage, under the existing license, the Steep Hill brand name; 

&#9679; Increase testing revenue through sales employees and independent sales representatives; 

&#9679; Strengthen the Pazoo.com brand name; 

&#9679; Increase customer traffic to the Pazoo.com website; 

&#9679; Continue to build strong customer loyalty; and 

&#9679; Maximize repeat involvement with our visitors and develop incremental revenue opportunities. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We have and will utilize a variety of marketing tools to increase testing revenue and traffic on pazoo.com and awareness about the Steep Hill, Pazoo brand names and www.pazoo.com. this site. These marketing tools include the following: 

&#160;

Sales and Employee Agents 

&#160;

&#9679; &#160; Hire dedicated sales employees to drive testing sales to the Steep Hill laboratories in Nevada, Colorado and Oregon in the future; 

&#9679; &#160; Contract with independent sales agents, on a commission basis, employees to drive testing sales to the Steep Hill laboratories in Nevada, Colorado and Oregon in the future 

On-Line Marketing 

&#160; 

&#9679; Search Engine Optimization (SEO) 

&#9679; Pay-per-click marketing 

&#9679; Social media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube) 

&#9679; Online promotions 

&#9679; Online promotional partners &#8211; event marketing 

&#160; 

Brick and Mortar Marketing and Promotion 

&#160; 

&#9679; Take advantage of market relationships from suppliers and retailers 

&#9679; Take advantage of combined sales efficiencies from online as well as off-line 

&#9679; Build strong relationships with suppliers from both a sales standpoint as well as a promotional standpoint 

To achieve our marketing goal and objective of being a leader in the cannabis laboratory testing industry our marketing strategy has focused on the following: 

&#160;

&#9679; Promote through business to business direct sales and have our lab managers and directors conduct direct sales calls as well as in person appointments and networking events 

&#9679; Promote laboratory testing an educational cannabis information on the Pazoo.com website as well as partner websites such as Steep Hill Labs 

&#9679; Promote through an array of media outlets including social media, online interviews and articles, and newspaper and magazine interviews and articles; and 

&#9679; Routinely provide tours of the labs to potential new clients to introduce them to the company and answer any questions they might have. 

By marketing and advertising pazoo.com, we are able to drive our targeted audience to pazoo.com while increasing awareness about pazoo.com as the leading on line health and wellness community for people as well as their pets. In fact, to retain awareness we have added a memorable tagline to the pazoo.com&#8217;s logo &#8216;Be Inspired. Live Powerful.&#8217; This challenging tagline is an example of pazoo.com having its own personality that stands out and can be remembered. 

&#160;

We feel that loyal, satisfied visitors to our site have vast potential to generate additional visits as returning visitors as well as word-of-mouth sources for new visitors to come to pazoo.com. However, to maintain this loyalty we have to maintain high quality content on pazoo.com that&#8217;s constantly being updated. 

&#160;

Please note that as pazoo.com&#8217;s traffic and revenue increase, Pazoo will cost effectively continue to increase the content to the site as well as the quality of this content. To have successful advertising sales, there needs to be a long term commitment to quality content so that all returning visitors will know that we are source of broad based, high quality health and wellness content. Though content development is a manageable, yet increasing expense, this cost highlights an important market advantage for pazoo.com. A large part of our content development cost does not require cash outlays (the compensation is in stock). This reduces our cash requirements. However, this situation exemplifies the ever increasing barrier to entry for others to create a health and wellness web site. Since pazoo.com launched its web site the cost of content has significantly gone up as well as marketing costs while ad revenues haven&#8217;t moved in a comparable manner. So, startup costs today and cash flow requirements have become much more challenging since pazoo.com launched its first version of pazoo.com.

Industry Trends 

&#160; 

&#9679; Steady and Rapid Growth in Online Advertising. Over the past decade in particular, the internet has changed the landscape of how we share and obtain information. More and more businesses are realizing the power of an online presence and are taking their businesses to the internet for marketing, brand recognition, and sales. The industry trend for 2016 is that online advertising and online marketing will continue to increase and permeate aspects of both business and personal life. Specifically, content marketing will continue to increase. Specifically, the diversification of online social media platforms and marketing is now a crucial trend in the industry. By consistently creating and disseminating content through an array of online channels, businesses are reaching consumers and retaining consumer bases in a whole new way. Further, Social Media will continue to be a powerful driving force in online advertising, marketing, and branding. Mobile content will be increasingly necessary and important. Due to the ever expanding use of smartphones and mobile devices, consumers are spending more time searching and purchasing products and information on their handheld devices than ever before. In addition, due to our emergence in the cannabis sector in 2015, the website will be re-branded to properly display our diversity in the health and wellness sector. 

&#160; 

The marijuana testing industry will continue to increase as it is just in its infancy. The following States have enacted some form of medical marijuana laws: Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and the District of Columbia. The following States have legalized the recreational use of marijuana: Colorado and Washington. Of the States that have enacted some form of medical marijuana laws, the following have enacted marijuana testing or sampling requirements: Alaska, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington. The State of Georgia does not allow for dispensaries or cultivation, and only permits the medicinal use of a low dose of cannabis oil, therefore the State has not enacted marijuana testing requirements. 

Competition 

&#9679; &#160; Health &#38; Wellness Websites. Pazoo.com is a site for people who want to live a healthy life and also want the same for their pets. Based on our market research, we have not identified other web sites that offer our dual health and wellness offerings, catering to the health of people and pets. 

&#160;

There are indirect competitors, which offer medical advice such as WebMD. However, these sites have, in relative terms, a narrow focus on medical issues and don't focus on the broader area of health and wellness. We are not looking to be an in depth resource about a specific ailment or condition, which is the main focus for WebMD and other similar sites. In effect, we are not competing with those sites per se, because if you want specific information on a specific ailment or condition a consumer will perform internet searches and end up at sites such as WebMD. 

&#160;

People Focused. We are about living a healthy and happy lifestyle which includes making sure that a visitor has the proper health and wellness experts involved in their lives when professionals are needed. On the people side we are looking for the same audience as Health.com, Shape.com, EveryDayHealth.com, etc., which are very informative sites. These sites primarily focus on diets and exercise. While Pazoo does provide content related to diets and exercise (as good, if not better than these competitors), we go beyond that offering a comprehensive look at health and wellness by going to areas like military health and wellness. We not only have professional writers addressing these issues but we have our Pazoo experts discussing these issues. In another words, we go outside the narrow focus that other sites have, utilizing our own Experts as well as professional writers. This combination is rare in health and wellness web sites. 

&#160;

Pet Focused. We compete with websites in the pet owner space. These sites are usually more narrowly focused than Pazoo's approach to a broad view of the Pet world. Most pet sites are for shopping (Petco.com) or a specific area like adoption/rescue, etc. (Breeders.net, Dogfriendly.com -- travel advice). We take a broad view, providing an ongoing experience to learn more about a lot of different areas in the pet world. So, if a visitor is a pet lover (over 60% of American homes have pets) then this visitor can go to pazoo.com and find a wide array of topics and new information. 

&#9679; &#160; E-Commerce. The online commerce market is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we expect the competition to intensify in the future. Barriers to entry are minimal, and current and new competitors can launch new sites at a relatively low cost. In addition, the health improvement industry is intensely competitive. We currently or potentially compete with a variety of other companies. These competitors include: 

&#160;

&#160; 

1. 

Direct competitors that specialize in or derive a substantial portion of their revenues from online retail and direct marketing of health and wellness products, including Vitacost; 

&#160; 

2. 

Various nutrition centers and vendors of other health related products such as sports nutrition, diet or other wellness products, including General Nutrition Centers; and 

&#160; 

3. 

Online vendors of dietary supplements, vitamins, minerals and herbs, with significant brand awareness, sales volume and customer bases, such as and VitaminShoppe. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market are brand recognition, selection, convenience, price, accessibility, customer service, and speed of order fulfillment. Many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than Pazoo. In addition, online retailers may be acquired by, receive investments from or enter into other commercial relationships with larger, well-established and well-financed companies as use of the Internet and other online services increases. Some of our competitors may be able to secure merchandise from vendors on terms that are more favorable, devote greater resources to marketing and promotional campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing or inventory availability policies and devote substantially more resources to website and systems development than our company. Increased competition may result in reduced operating margins, loss of market share and a diminished brand franchise. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, and competitive pressures faced by us may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operational results, business, and prospects. Furthermore, as a strategic response to changes in the competitive environment, we may from time to time make certain pricing, service or marketing decisions or acquisitions that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operational results, business, and prospects. 

&#9679; &#160; Pharmaceutical Testing. Inasmuch as this industry is in its infancy, it is clear that there is currently competition and if the industry goes as we anticipate it will, new entrants to the market will be inevitable. However, there are certain barriers to entry which clearly benefit Pazoo. For example: 

1. Cost of establishing a testing laboratory. The cost to setting up a fully operational laboratory, depending on the variety and number of tests the laboratory can do, can range for $500,000 to $2,000,000. Pazoo has the advantage of going through this process with MA &#38; Associates, LLC and had built relationships with equipment suppliers for the lease and/or purchase of the equipment needed to run a laboratory. 

2. The Need for a Proven Set of Testing protocols. Harris Lee Holdings, LLC as entered into a License Agreement with one of the industry leaders for the exclusive use of their proven testing protocols in certain states and a right of first refusal to expand into other states. It would be very costly for a new entrant into the market to develop or license such protocols. 

3. Limited Number of Licenses to be Issued. Each state has its own regulations for the licensing of testing laboratories. Many states, such as Nevada, limit the number of licenses which may be issued. Accordingly, if the maximum number of licenses has been issued, there would be a complete bar to the entry of new competitors.
