 Item 1. 

Business 

GENERAL 

Ashford Hospitality Trust, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, is an externally-advised real estate investment trust (&#8220;REIT&#8221;) focused on investing opportunistically in the hospitality industry with a focus on full-service upscale and upper-upscale hotels in the U.S. that have a revenue per available room (&#8220;RevPAR&#8221;) generally less than two times the U.S. national average. Additional information can be found on our website at www.ahtreit.com. We were formed as a Maryland corporation in May 2003 and commenced operations in August 2003, as a self-advised REIT. In November 2014, we completed the spin-off of our asset management business, forming Ashford Inc. as a separate publicly traded company, and we became advised by Ashford Inc. We continue to own our lodging investments and conduct our business through Ashford Hospitality Limited Partnership (&#8220;Ashford Trust OP&#8221;), our operating partnership. Ashford OP General Partner LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, serves as the sole general partner of our operating partnership. 

Our hotels are primarily operated under the widely recognized upscale and upper-upscale brands of Hilton, Hyatt, Marriott, Starwood and Intercontinental Hotels Group. Currently, all of our hotels are located in the United States. As of December 31, 2015 , we owned interests in the following: 

&#8226; 

132 &#32;consolidated hotel properties, including 130 &#32;hotel properties directly owned and two &#32;hotel properties owned through majority-owned investments in consolidated entities, which represent 27,977 &#32;total rooms (or 27,950 &#32;net rooms excluding those attributable to our partners); 

&#8226; 

85 &#32;hotel condominium units at WorldQuest Resort in Orlando, Florida; 

&#8226; 

an approximate 29.8% &#32;ownership in Ashford Inc. with a carrying value of $6.6 million &#32;and a fair value of $31.9 million ; and 

&#8226; 

a mezzanine loan with a carrying value of $3.7 million . 

On June 17, 2013, we announced that our board of directors had approved a plan to spin-off an 80% ownership interest in an 8-hotel portfolio, totaling 3,146 rooms (2,912 net rooms excluding those attributable to our partners), to holders of our common stock in the form of a taxable special distribution. This distribution was comprised of common stock in Ashford Hospitality Prime, Inc. (&#8220;Ashford Prime&#8221;), a newly formed company. We contributed the portfolio interests into Ashford Hospitality Prime Limited Partnership ("Ashford Prime OP"), Ashford Prime's operating partnership. The distribution was made on November 19, 2013, on a pro rata basis to holders of our common stock as of November 8, 2013, with each of our stockholders receiving one share of Ashford Prime common stock for every five shares of our common stock held by such stockholder as of the close of business on November 8, 2013. Ashford Prime has qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, under the symbol &#8220;AHP.&#8221; The transaction also included options for Ashford Prime to purchase the Crystal Gateway Marriott in Arlington, Virginia and the Pier House Resort in Key West, Florida. We sold the Pier House Resort to Ashford Prime on March 1, 2014, and Ashford Prime&#8217;s option to acquire the Crystal Gateway Marriott expired on May 19, 2015. 

On July 13, 2015, we announced that our board of directors had declared the distribution (1) to our stockholders of approximately 4.1 million &#32;shares of common stock of Ashford Prime to be received by Ashford Trust upon redemption of Ashford Prime OP common units and (2) to the common unitholders of Ashford Trust OP of our remaining common units of Ashford Prime OP. The distribution occurred on July 27, 2015, to stockholders and common unitholders of record as of the close of business of the New York Stock Exchange on July 20, 2015. As a result of the distribution, we have no &#32;ownership interest in Ashford Prime. 

On February 27, 2014, we announced that our board of directors had approved a plan to spin-off our asset management business into a separate publicly traded company in the form of a taxable special distribution. The spin-off was completed on November 12, 2014, with a pro-rata taxable distribution of a portion of Ashford Inc.&#8217;s common stock to our common stockholders of record as of November 11, 2014. The distribution was comprised of one &#32;share of Ashford Inc. common stock for every 87 &#32;shares of our common stock held by our stockholders. In addition, for each common unit of our operating partnership, the holder received a common unit of the operating limited liability company subsidiary of Ashford Inc. Each holder of common units of the operating limited liability company of Ashford Inc. could exchange up to 99% &#32;of those units for shares of Ashford Inc. stock at the rate of one &#32;share of Ashford Inc. common stock for every 55 &#32;common units of the operating limited liability company subsidiary of Ashford Inc. The exchange occurred on November 12, 2014, simultaneously with the distribution to common stockholders. Following the spin-off, we continue to hold approximately 598,000 &#32;shares of Ashford Inc. common stock, which represented an approximate 30.1% &#32;ownership interest in Ashford Inc. at the time of the spin-off. In connection with the spin-off, we entered into an advisory agreement with Ashford Inc. 

For federal income tax purposes, we have elected to be treated as a REIT, which imposes limitations related to operating hotels. As of December 31, 2015 , all of our 132 &#32;hotel properties were leased or owned by our wholly-owned and majority- owned subsidiaries that are treated as taxable REIT subsidiaries for federal income tax purposes (collectively, these subsidiaries are referred to as &#8220;Ashford TRS&#8221;). Ashford TRS then engages eligible independent contractors to operate the hotels under management contracts. Hotel operating results related to these properties are included in the consolidated statements of operations. 

We do not operate any of our hotels directly; instead we employ hotel management companies to operate them for us under management contracts. Remington Lodging &#38; Hospitality, LLC, together with its affiliates (&#8220;Remington Lodging&#8221;), is one of our property managers, and is beneficially wholly-owned by Mr. Monty J. Bennett, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Archie Bennett, Jr., our Chairman Emeritus. As of December 31, 2015 , Remington Lodging managed 89 &#32;of our 132 &#32;hotel properties and the WorldQuest Resort. On September 17, 2015, Remington Lodging and Ashford Inc. entered into an agreement pursuant to which Ashford Inc. will acquire all of the general partner interest and eighty percent of the limited partner interests in Remington Lodging. The acquisition is subject to the satisfaction of various conditions, including the approval of Ashford Inc.&#8217;s stockholders and independent directors. The acquisition, if completed, will not impact our management agreements with Remington Lodging. Third-party management companies managed our remaining hotel properties. 

BUSINESS STRATEGIES 

We will continue to seek ways to benefit from the cyclical nature of the hotel industry. 

Based on our primary business objectives and forecasted operating conditions, our current key priorities and financial strategies include, among other things: 

&#8226; 

acquisition of hotel properties that will be accretive to our portfolio; 

&#8226; 

disposition of non-core hotel properties; 

&#8226; 

pursuing capital market activities to enhance long-term stockholder value; 

&#8226; 

preserving capital, enhancing liquidity, and continuing current cost saving measures; 

&#8226; 

implementing selective capital improvements designed to increase profitability; 

&#8226; 

implementing effective asset management strategies to minimize operating costs and increase revenues; 

&#8226; 

financing or refinancing hotels on competitive terms; 

&#8226; 

utilizing hedges and derivatives to mitigate risks; and 

&#8226; 

making other investments or divestitures that our board of directors deems appropriate. 

In June 2015, our board of directors modified our investment strategy to focus predominantly on full-service hotels in the upscale and upper-upscale segments in the U.S. that have RevPAR generally less than twice the national average. The change in our investment strategy was made in conjunction with our announcement that we plan to sell the vast majority our select-service hotel portfolio.We believe that as supply, demand, and capital market cycles change, we will be able to shift our investment strategy to take advantage of new lodging-related investment opportunities as they may develop. Our board of directors may change our investment strategy at any time without stockholder approval or notice. 

While our current investment strategy is focused on direct hotel investments, as the business cycle changes and the hotel markets continue to improve, we may invest in a variety of lodging-related assets based upon our evaluation of diverse market conditions including our cost of capital and the expected returns from those investments. Our investments may include: (i) direct hotel investments; (ii) mezzanine financing through origination or acquisition; (iii) first-lien mortgage financing through origination or acquisition; and (iv) sale-leaseback transactions. 

Our strategy is designed to take advantage of lodging industry conditions and adjust to changes in market circumstances over time. Our assessment of market conditions will determine asset reallocation strategies. While we seek to capitalize on favorable market fundamentals, conditions beyond our control may have an impact on overall profitability and our investment returns. 

Our strategy of combining lodging-related equity and debt investments seeks, among other things, to: 

&#8226; 

capitalize on both current yield and price appreciation, while simultaneously offering diversification of types of assets within the hospitality industry; and 

&#8226; 

vary investments across an array of hospitality assets to take advantage of market cycles for each asset class. 

To take full advantage of future investment opportunities in the lodging industry, we intend to invest according to the asset allocation strategies described below. However, due to ongoing changes in market conditions, we will continually evaluate the 

appropriateness of our investment strategies. Our board of directors may change any or all of these strategies at any time without stockholder approval or notice. 

Direct Hotel Investments &#32;&#8211; In selecting hotels to acquire, we target hotels that offer either a high current return or the opportunity to increase in value through repositioning, capital investments, market-based recovery, or improved management practices. Our direct hotel acquisition strategy primarily targets full-service hotels with RevPAR less than twice the national average in primary, secondary, and resort markets, typically throughout the United States and will seek to achieve both current income and appreciation. In addition, we will continue to assess our existing hotel portfolio and make strategic decisions to sell certain under-performing or non-strategic hotels that do not fit our investment strategy or criteria due to micro or macro market changes or other reasons. 

Mezzanine Financing &#32;&#8211; Subordinated loans, or mezzanine loans, that we acquire or originate may relate to a diverse segment of hotels that are located across the U.S. These mezzanine loans are secured by junior mortgages on hotels or pledges of equity interests in entities owning hotels. As the global economic environment improves and the hotel industry stabilizes, we may refocus our efforts on the acquisition or origination of mezzanine loans. Given the greater repayment risks of these types of loans, to the extent we acquire or originate them in the future, we will have a more conservative approach in underwriting these assets. Mezzanine loans that we acquire in the future may be secured by individual assets as well as cross-collateralized portfolios of assets. 

First Mortgage Financing &#32;&#8211; From time to time, we may acquire or originate first mortgages. As the dynamics in the capital markets and the hotel industry make first-mortgage investments more attractive, we may acquire, potentially at a discount to par, or originate loans secured by first priority mortgages on hotels. We may be subject to certain state-imposed licensing regulations related to commercial mortgage lenders, with which we intend to comply. However, because we are not a bank or a federally chartered lending institution, we are not subject to state and federal regulatory constraints imposed on such entities. 

Sale-Leaseback Transactions &#32;&#8211; To date, we have not participated in any sale-leaseback transactions. However, if the lodging industry fundamentals shift such that sale-leaseback transactions become more attractive investments, we may purchase hotels and lease them back to their existing hotel owners. 

Other Transactions &#32;- We may also invest in other lodging related assets or businesses that offer diversification, attractive risk adjusted returns, and/or capital allocation benefits. 

BUSINESS SEGMENTS 

We currently operate in one business segment within the hotel lodging industry: direct hotel investments. A discussion of our operating segment is incorporated by reference to note 20 to our consolidated financial statements set forth in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 

FINANCING STRATEGY 

We utilize debt to increase equity returns. When evaluating our future level of indebtedness and making decisions regarding the incurrence of indebtedness, our board of directors considers a number of factors, including: 

&#8226; 

our leverage levels across the portfolio; 

&#8226; 

the purchase price of our investments to be acquired with debt financing; 

&#8226; 

impact on financial covenants; 

&#8226; 

cost of debt; 

&#8226; 

loan maturity schedule; 

&#8226; 

the estimated market value of our investments upon refinancing; 

&#8226; 

the ability of particular investments, and our Company as a whole, to generate cash flow to cover expected debt service; and 

&#8226; 

trailing twelve months net operating income of the hotel to be financed. 

We may incur debt in the form of purchase money obligations to the sellers of properties, publicly or privately placed debt instruments, or financing from banks, institutional investors, or other lenders. Any such indebtedness may be secured or unsecured by mortgages or other interests in our properties. This indebtedness may be recourse, non-recourse, or cross-collateralized. If recourse, such recourse may include our general assets or be limited to the particular investment to which the indebtedness relates. In addition, we may invest in properties or loans subject to existing loans secured by mortgages or similar liens on the properties, or we may refinance properties acquired on a leveraged basis. 

We may use the proceeds from any borrowings for working capital, consistent with industry practice, to: 

&#8226; 

purchase interests in partnerships or joint ventures; 

&#8226; 

finance the origination or purchase of debt investments; or 

&#8226; 

finance acquisitions, expand, redevelop or improve existing properties, or develop new properties or other uses. 

In addition, if we do not have sufficient cash available, we may need to borrow to meet taxable income distribution requirements under the Internal Revenue Code. No assurances can be given that we will obtain additional financings or, if we do, what the amount and terms will be. Our failure to obtain future financing under favorable terms could adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategy. In addition, we may selectively pursue debt financing on our individual properties and debt investments. 

DISTRIBUTION POLICY 

In December 2014, the board of directors approved our dividend policy for 2015 with an annualized target of $0.48 per share. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , we have declared dividends of $0.48 per share. We may incur indebtedness to meet distribution requirements imposed on REITs under the Internal Revenue Code to the extent that working capital and cash flow from our investments are insufficient to fund required distributions. We may elect to pay dividends on our common stock in cash or a combination of cash and shares of securities as permitted under federal income tax laws governing REIT distribution requirements. We may pay dividends in excess of our cash flow. 

Distributions are authorized by our board of directors and declared by us based upon a variety of factors deemed relevant by our directors. No assurance can be given that our dividend policy will not change in the future. In December 2015, the board of directors approved our dividend policy for 2016 and we expect to pay a quarterly dividend of $0.12 &#32;per share during 2016 . The adoption of a dividend policy does not commit our board of directors to declare future dividends or the amount thereof. The board of directors will continue to review our dividend policy on a quarterly basis. Our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders will depend, in part, upon our receipt of distributions from our operating partnership. This, in turn, may depend upon receipt of lease payments with respect to our properties from indirect, wholly-owned subsidiaries of our operating partnership and the management of our properties by our property managers. Distributions to our stockholders are generally taxable to our stockholders as ordinary income. However, since a portion of our investments are equity ownership interests in hotels, which result in depreciation and non-cash charges against our income, a portion of our distributions may constitute a non-taxable return of capital, to the extent of a stockholder&#8217;s tax basis in the stock. To the extent that it is consistent with maintaining our REIT status, we may maintain accumulated earnings of Ashford TRS in that entity. 

Our charter allows us to issue preferred stock with a preference on distributions, such as our Series A, Series D and Series E preferred stock. The partnership agreement of our operating partnership also allows the operating partnership to issue units with a preference on distributions, such as our Class B common units. The issuance of these series of preferred stock and units together with any similar issuance in the future, given the dividend preference on such stock or units, could limit our ability to make a dividend distribution to our common stockholders. 

COMPETITION 

The hotel industry is highly competitive and the hotels in which we invest are subject to competition from other hotels for guests. Competition is based on a number of factors, most notably convenience of location, availability of rooms, brand affiliation, price, range of services, guest amenities or accommodations offered and quality of customer service. Competition is often specific to the individual markets in which our properties are located and includes competition from existing and new hotels. Increased competition could have a material adverse effect on the occupancy rate, average daily room rate and room revenue per available room of our hotels or may require us to make capital improvements that we otherwise would not have to make, which may result in decreases in our profitability. 

Our principal competitors include other hotel operating companies, ownership companies (including hotel REITs) and national and international hotel brands. We face increased competition from providers of less expensive accommodations, such as select-service hotels or independent owner-managed hotels, during periods of economic downturn when leisure and business travelers become more sensitive to room rates. We may also experience competition from alternative types of accommodations such as AirBnb. 

EMPLOYEES 

We have no employees. Our appointed officers and employees are provided by Ashford Hospitality Advisors LLC (&#8220;Ashford LLC&#8221;), a subsidiary of Ashford Inc. (collectively, our &#8220;advisor&#8221;). Services which would otherwise be provided by employees are provided by Ashford LLC and by our executive officers. Ashford LLC has approximately 108 &#32;full-time employees. These employees 

directly or indirectly perform various acquisition, development, asset management, capital markets, accounting, tax, risk management, legal, redevelopment, and corporate management functions pursuant to the terms of our advisory agreement. 

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 

Under various federal, state, and local laws and regulations, an owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on such property. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. Furthermore, a person who arranges for the disposal of a hazardous substance or transports a hazardous substance for disposal or treatment from property owned by another may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances released into the environment at that property. The costs of remediation or removal of such substances may be substantial, and the presence of such substances, or the failure to promptly remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner&#8217;s ability to sell the affected property or to borrow using the affected property as collateral. In connection with the ownership and operation of our properties, we, our operating partnership, or Ashford TRS may be potentially liable for any such costs. In addition, the value of any lodging property loan we originate or acquire would be adversely affected if the underlying property contained hazardous or toxic substances. 

Phase I environmental assessments, which are intended to identify potential environmental contamination for which our properties may be responsible, have been obtained on substantially all of our properties. Such Phase I environmental assessments included: 

&#8226; 

historical reviews of the properties; 

&#8226; 

reviews of certain public records; 

&#8226; 

preliminary investigations of the sites and surrounding properties; 

&#8226; 

screening for the presence of hazardous substances, toxic substances, and underground storage tanks; and 

&#8226; 

the preparation and issuance of a written report. 

Such Phase I environmental assessments did not include invasive procedures, such as soil sampling or ground water analysis. Such Phase I environmental assessments have not revealed any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, results of operations, or liquidity, and we are not aware of any such liability. To the extent Phase I environmental assessments reveal facts that require further investigation, we would perform a Phase II environmental assessment. However, it is possible that these environmental assessments will not reveal all environmental liabilities. There may be material environmental liabilities of which we are unaware, including environmental liabilities that may have arisen since the environmental assessments were completed or updated. No assurances can be given that (i) future laws, ordinances, or regulations will not impose any material environmental liability, or (ii) the current environmental condition of our properties will not be affected by the condition of properties in the vicinity (such as the presence of leaking underground storage tanks) or by third parties unrelated to us. 

We believe our properties are in compliance in all material respects with all federal, state, and local ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances and other environmental matters. Neither we nor, to our knowledge, any of the former owners of our properties have been notified by any governmental authority of any material noncompliance, liability, or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances or other environmental matters in connection with any of our properties. 

INSURANCE 

We maintain comprehensive insurance, including liability, property, workers&#8217; compensation, rental loss, environmental, terrorism, and, when available on commercially reasonable terms, flood and earthquake insurance, with policy specifications, limits, and deductibles customarily carried for similar properties. Certain types of losses (for example, matters of a catastrophic nature such as acts of war or substantial known environmental liabilities) are either uninsurable or require substantial premiums that are not economically feasible to maintain. Certain types of losses, such as those arising from subsidence activity, are insurable only to the extent that certain standard policy exceptions to insurability are waived by agreement with the insurer. We believe, however, that our properties are adequately insured, consistent with industry standards. 

FRANCHISE LICENSES 

We believe that the public&#8217;s perception of quality associated with a franchisor can be an important feature in the operation of a hotel. Franchisors provide a variety of benefits for franchisees, which include national advertising, publicity, and other marketing programs designed to increase brand awareness, training of personnel, continuous review of quality standards, and centralized reservation systems. 

As of December 31, 2015 , we owned interests in 132 &#32;hotels, 127 &#32;of which operated under the following franchise licenses or brand management agreements:

Crowne Plaza is a registered trademark of InterContinental Hotels Group. 

Hotel Indigo is a registered trademark of InterContinental Hotels Group. 

One Ocean is a registered trademark of Remington Hotels LP. 

Our management companies, including Remington Lodging, must operate each hotel pursuant to the terms of the related franchise or brand management agreement and must use their best efforts to maintain the right to operate each hotel pursuant to such terms. In the event of termination of a particular franchise or brand management agreement, our management companies must operate any affected hotels under another franchise or brand management agreement, if any, that we enter into. We anticipate that many of the additional hotels we acquire could be operated under franchise licenses or brand management agreements as well. 

Our franchise licenses and brand management agreements generally specify certain management, operational, recordkeeping, accounting, reporting, and marketing standards and procedures with which the franchisee or brand operator must comply, including requirements related to: &#160; 

&#8226; 

training of operational personnel; 

&#8226; 

safety; 

&#8226; 

maintaining specified insurance; 

&#8226; 

types of services and products ancillary to guestroom services that may be provided; 

&#8226; 

display of signage; and 

&#8226; 

type, quality, and age of furniture, fixtures, and equipment included in guestrooms, lobbies, and other common areas. 

SEASONALITY 

Our properties&#8217; operations historically have been seasonal as certain properties maintain higher occupancy rates during the summer months, while certain other properties maintain higher occupancy rates during the winter months. This seasonality pattern can cause fluctuations in our quarterly lease revenue under our percentage leases. We anticipate that our cash flows from the operations of our properties will be sufficient to enable us to make quarterly distributions to maintain our REIT status. To the extent that cash flows from operations are insufficient during any quarter due to temporary or seasonal fluctuations in lease revenue, we expect to utilize other cash on hand or borrowings to fund required distributions. However, we cannot make any assurances that we will make distributions in the future.
