Our Solution 

We are a global leader in the design, engineering, and manufacturing of production tools, modules and subsystems for the semiconductor capital equipment industry and equipment industry segments with similar requirements including consumer, medical and flat panel display. Our focus is on providing specialized engineering and manufacturing solutions for these highly complex, highly configurable, limited volume applications. We enable our customers to realize lower manufacturing costs and reduced design-to-delivery cycle times while maintaining high quality standards. We offer our customers: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; A vertically integrated solution for complex and highly configurable system s. We provide our original equipment manufacturing (OEM) customers a complete outsourced solution for the development, design, component sourcing, prototyping, engineering, turnkey manufacturing and testing of advanced systems. We utilize our machining, sheet metal, and frame fabrication capabilities with highly specialized engineering, global supply chain management, and assembly capabilities to produce high performance products that are customized to meet the needs of our customers, as well as their respective end users. We minimize the overall number of suppliers and manage our global supply chain logistics to reduce inventory levels that our customers would otherwise be required to manage. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Improved design-to-delivery cycle times. Our strong relationships with our customers and familiarity with their product requirements and the ever changing needs of their customer base help us reduce their design-to-delivery cycle times. We have optimized our supply chain management, design and manufacturing coordination and controls to respond rapidly to order requests enabling us to decrease design-to-delivery cycle times for our customers. Because our engineers work closely with our customers&#146; engineers and understand the fabrication, assembly and testing of their products, we often can improve their design for manufacturability, thereby improving their cost, quality and consistency. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Component neutral design and manufacturing. We do not manufacture active components such as mass flow controllers. Our component neutral position enables us to recommend components on the basis of technology, performance and cost and to optimize our customers&#146; overall designs based on these criteria. Furthermore, our neutral approach allows us to maintain close relationships with a wide range of component suppliers. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Component testing capabilities. We utilize our technical expertise to test and characterize key components and subsystems. We have made significant investments in advanced analytical and automated test equipment, enabling us to test and qualify key components. We can perform diagnostic tests, design verifications and failure analyses for our customers and suppliers. Our analytical and testing capabilities of supplier components provide us the ability to recommend to our customers a wide range of appropriate component and design choices for their products. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Increased integration with OEMs through local presence. Our local presence in close proximity to the facilities of most of our OEM customers enables us to remain closely integrated with their design, development and implementation teams. This level of integration enables us to respond quickly and efficiently to customer changes and requests. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Precision machining capabilities. We manufacture high quality, precision machined parts using equipment capable of efficiently providing complex parts with exacting tolerances. Our diverse precision fabrication equipment enables us to manufacture a broad range of machined parts using a wide range of materials, from exotic metals to high purity plastics. Our manufacturing capabilities include horizontal and vertical milling, turning, welding and joining, amongst numerous others. We own and operate advanced machining and fabrication systems at multiple sites whose locations include in the U.S., Europe and Asia. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Precision frame fabrication. We design and manufacture frames using tubing or sheet metal in all sizes with exacting standards to meet and exceed our customers&#146; needs. We utilize over 25 years of experience in the fabrication of complex frames to provide the cost competitive edge in our vertical integration model. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Precision sheet metal fabrication. Our ability to provide complete sheet metal solutions for our customers enables us to support prototype to volume production, from brackets to sheet metal frames, and from structural to high quality cosmetic finishing of the final product. Our automated equipment and design capabilities allow us to develop accurate prototype and final production products for our customers. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; 3D printing of prototype parts. Our launch of Prototype Asia enables us provide quick turn production for design validation, as well as the production of complex parts not available by traditional manufacturing methods. We are also seeing applications in production support, including fabrication of molds and fixtures. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Custom fabricated heaters. Our acquisition of Marchi enables us to design and manufacture heaters, sensors, and controllers for precise temperature control. These products are complementary to our gas delivery systems. Our Strategy 

Our objective is to maintain our position as a leading solutions provider in the markets we serve, primarily the semiconductor capital equipment market while expanding to other technologically similar markets in the consumer, medical, energy, industrial, flat panel and research industries. Our strategy is comprised of the following key elements: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Expand our market share with semiconductor capital equipment OEMs. We believe that outsourcing among OEMs creates a significant market opportunity for us to grow our business with existing and new customers. We believe our customers will continue to outsource critical subsystems and that we are well positioned to capture a significant portion of these outsourcing opportunities. We believe that our continued focus on efficient manufacturing, reduced design-to-delivery cycle times, and quality and reliability will also allow us to gain market share. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Develop solutions that allow our customer&#146;s customers to succeed at the latest 2x or 1x nanometer semiconductor processing nodes. We are expanding the number and type of subsystems that we offer in this advanced semiconductor market. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Expand our market share in other industries . We believe we can leverage the attributes and skill sets to succeed in the semiconductor capital equipment industry and to increase our market share in technologically similar markets including medical, flat panel and research equipment. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Leverage our geographic presence in lower cost manufacturing regions. In March 2005, we completed improvements of a manufacturing facility in Shanghai, China, allowing us to expand production in a low cost region. In November 2007, we completed construction of a second manufacturing facility in Shanghai, China to house our precision machined parts and subsystem assembly operations. These facilities put us in close proximity to the manufacturing facilities of existing and potential customers and their end users. In Singapore, we opened a procurement office in October 2008 and we expanded 

&#160;

&#160; our operations by opening manufacturing facilities in November 2009 and in October 2014. Our manufacturing facilities are all using the same processes and procedures, enabling us to respond to rapid demand changes by employing as much or as little manufacturing capabilities as required. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Drive profitable growth with our flexible cost structure. We implement cost containment and capacity enhancement initiatives throughout the semiconductor capital equipment demand cycle and benefit greatly from the global presence and efficiencies of our supply chain. In addition, we believe our Shanghai and Singapore facilities position us to respond effectively to future business demands. We employ a core engineering strategy with flexible partnering to augment our staff during the steep rise and fall associated with cycles in the semiconductor industry. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Continue to selectively pursue strategic acquisitions. We will continue to consider strategic acquisitions that will enable us to expand our geographic presence, secure new customers and diversify into complementary products and markets as well as broaden our technological capabilities in the markets we serve. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Develop unique solutions to enhance our customers&#146; manufacturing . With the acquisition of Marchi, we are able to provide additional thermal products, leveraging our core capability in heaters, thermocouples and controllers. With the acquisition of Miconex, we further expanded our capabilities to include manufacturing services in advanced precision milling and welding of plastics. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Identify markets that require rapid &#147;Art to Part&#148; capability. Through our Asian additive manufacturing facility and our new Fremont rapid prototyping facility, we can provide both fast-turn machining as well as 3D printed parts that provide our customers with a new level of design freedom. Products 

We design, develop, prototype, manufacture and test subsystems, primarily for semiconductor capital equipment, and also supporting customers in the consumer, medical, energy, industrial, flat panel and research industries. Our products include precision robotic solutions, gas delivery systems, a variety of industrial and automation production equipment products; subsystems that includes wafer cleaning sub-systems, chemical delivery modules, top-plate assemblies, frame assemblies, and process modules. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Chemical delivery modules: Chemical delivery modules deliver gases and reactive chemicals in a liquid or gaseous form from a centralized subsystem to the reaction chamber. The module may be a gas delivery system in combination with liquid and vapor precursor delivery systems or may be a liquid delivery system in combination with a liquid storage system. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Frame assemblies: Frame assemblies are support structures fabricated from steel tubing or folded sheet metal and form the backbone to which all other assemblies are attached. The complexity of the frames includes pneumatic harnesses and cables that connect other critical subsystems together. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Gas delivery systems: A typical OEM gas delivery system consists of one or more gas lines, comprised of small diameter internally polished stainless steel tubing, filters, mass flow controllers, regulators, pressure transducers and valves, component heaters, and an integrated electronic and/or pneumatic control system. These systems are mounted on a pallet and are typically enclosed in a sheet metal encasing. Our gas delivery system designs are developed in collaboration with our customers and are customized to meet the needs of specific processing requirement for OEMs. Our customers either specify the particular brands of components they want incorporated into a particular system or rely on our design expertise and component characterization capabilities to help them select the appropriate components for their particular system. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Liquid delivery system: A typical OEM liquid delivery system consists of one or more chemical delivery units, comprised of small diameter high purity PFA tubing, filters, flow controllers, regulators, component heaters, and an integrated electronic and/or pneumatic control system. These units are typically contained in a plastic enclosure and further integrated in a frame. Our liquid delivery system 

&#160;

&#160; designs are developed in collaboration with our customers and are customized to meet the needs of specific processing requirement for OEMs. Our customers either specify the particular materials and the brands of components they want incorporated into a particular system or rely on our design expertise and component characterization capabilities to help them select the appropriate components for their particular system.

Process modules include several smaller subsystems such as the frame assembly, top-plate assembly and gas and chemical delivery modules, as well as the chamber and electronic, pneumatic and mechanical subsystems. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Robotic surgery products: Robotic surgery is the process of performing a minimally invasive operation on a patient with the help of robotic equipment operated by a physician. This procedure is intended to minimize traumas on the body, scarring and recovery time. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Other high level assemblies: Other high level assemblies refer to large subsystems used in semiconductor manufacturing, medical, energy, industrial, flat panel and research industries. Customers 

We sell our products primarily to customers in the semiconductor capital equipment industry, and we also have sales to the consumer, medical, energy, industrial, flat panel and research equipment industries. The majority of our revenue is in the semiconductor capital equipment industry, which is highly concentrated, and we are therefore highly dependent upon a small number of customers. Our three largest customers in fiscal year 2015, 2014 and 2013 were Applied Materials, Inc., Lam Research Corporation and ASM International, Inc. Each of Lam Research Corporation and Applied Materials, Inc. accounted for more than 10.0% of our total sales in fiscal year 2015. Each of Applied Materials, Inc., Lam Research Corporation and ASM International, Inc. accounted for more than 10.0% of our total sales in fiscal years 2014 and 2013. As a group, the respective year&#146;s top three customers accounted for 84.3%, 75.7% and 80.6% of the Company&#146;s sales for fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The composition of our most significant customers has changed from time to time based on various factors, including acquisition activity by our customers. 

We have successfully qualified as a supplier with each of our customers who require it. This lengthy qualification process involves the inspection and audit of our facilities and evaluation by our customers of our engineering, documentation, manufacturing and quality control processes and procedures. Our customers generally place orders with suppliers who have met and continue to meet their qualification criteria. 

Sales and Support 

We sell our products through our direct sales force which, as of December 25, 2015, consisted of approximately 95 sales directors, account managers and sales support staff. Our sales directors are responsible for establishing sales strategy and setting the objectives for specific customer accounts. Each account manager is dedicated to a specific customer account and is responsible for the day-to-day management of that customer. Account managers work closely with customers and in many cases provide on-site support. Account managers often attend customers&#146; internal meetings related to production and engineering design and quality to ensure that customer expectations are interpreted and communicated properly to our operations group. Account managers also work with our customers to identify and meet their cost and design-to-delivery cycle time objectives. 

We have dedicated business development managers responsible for new business development for gas delivery systems and other critical subsystems. Our new business development managers initiate and develop 

&#160;

long-term, multilevel relationships with customers and work closely with customers on new business opportunities throughout the design-to-delivery cycle. Our sales force includes technical sales support for order placement, spare parts quotes and production status updates. We have a technical sales representative located at each of our manufacturing facilities. In addition, we have developed a service and support infrastructure to provide our customers with service and support 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Our dedicated global field service engineers provide customer support through the performance of on-site installation, servicing and repair of our subsystems. 

Technology Development 

We engage in ongoing technology development efforts in order to remain a technology leader for gas delivery systems and to further develop our expertise in other critical subsystems. Our design engineering and new product engineering groups support our technology development activities. Our technology development group works closely with our customers to identify and anticipate changes and trends in next-generation equipment. Our technology development group participates in customer technology partnership programs that focus on process application requirements for gas and liquid delivery systems and other critical subsystems. These development efforts are designed to meet specific customer requirements in the areas of subsystem design, materials, component selection and functionality. Our technology development group also works directly with our suppliers to help them identify new component technologies and make necessary changes in, and enhancements to, the components that we integrate into our products. Our analytical and testing capabilities enable us to evaluate multiple supplier component technologies and provide our customers with a wide range of appropriate component and design choices for their gas delivery systems and other critical subsystems. 

Our analytical and testing capabilities also help us anticipate technological changes and requirements in component features for next-generation gas delivery systems and other critical subsystems. We are developing additional features to improve the performance and functionality of our gas delivery systems and other critical subsystems. Our technology development and new product engineering expenses were approximately $9.6 million, $7.1 million and $5.5 million for the 2015, 2014 and 2013 fiscal years, respectively. We perform our technology development activities principally at our facilities in Hayward, California. 

Intellectual Property 

Our success depends in part on our ability to maintain and protect our proprietary technology and to conduct our business without infringing the proprietary rights of others. Our business is largely dependent upon our design, engineering, manufacturing and testing know-how. We also rely on a combination of trade secrets and confidentiality provisions, and to a much lesser extent, patents, copyrights and trademarks, to protect our proprietary rights. We have four patents with various expiration dates ranging from 2016 to 2026 as a result of our acquisition of Marchi in February 2015. We have no pending U.S. patents. Intellectual property that we develop on behalf of our customers is generally owned exclusively by those customers. 

We require our employees, suppliers and potential business partners to enter into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements before we disclose to them any sensitive or proprietary information regarding our products, technology or business plans. We require employees to assign to us proprietary information, inventions and other intellectual property they create, modify or improve. 

Competition 

Our industry is highly fragmented. When we compete for new business, we face competition from other suppliers of gas delivery systems and other critical subsystems as well as the internal manufacturing groups of our customers. Customers that have elected to outsource their gas delivery systems and other critical subsystems could elect in the future to develop and manufacture these subsystems internally, leading to further competition. 

Our principal competitor for our gas delivery systems is Ichor Systems, Inc., and our principal competitors for 

&#160;

other critical subsystems are Flextronics International Ltd., Foxsemicon Integrated Technology Inc. and Celestica. Some of these competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing and marketing resources than we do. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that could adversely affect sales of our current and future products. In addition, the limited number of potential customers in our industry further intensifies competition. The primary competitive factors in our industry are price, technology, quality, design-to-delivery cycle time, reliability in meeting product demand, service and historical customer relationships. We anticipate that increased competitive pressures will cause intensified price-based competition and we may have to reduce the prices of our products. In addition, we expect to face new competitors as we enter new markets. 

Employees 

As of December 25, 2015, we had 1,817 employees, of which 89 were temporary. Of our total employees, there were 45 in engineering, 15 in technology development, 95 in sales and support, 1,044 in direct manufacturing, 488 in indirect manufacturing and 145 in executive and administrative functions. These figures include 672 employees in Asia and 245 employees in Europe. None of our employees are represented by a labor union and we have not experienced any work stoppages. 

Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters 

Our operations are subject to federal, state and local regulatory requirements and foreign laws relating to environmental, waste management and health and safety matters, including measures relating to the release, use, storage, treatment, transportation, discharge, disposal and remediation of contaminants, hazardous substances and waste, as well as practices and procedures applicable to the construction and operation of our facilities. 

Our past or future operations may result in injury or claims of injury by employees or the public which may result in material costs and liabilities to us. Although some risk of costs and liabilities related to these matters is inherent in our business, we believe that our business is in compliance with applicable regulations. However, new, modified or more stringent requirements or enforcement policies could be adopted, which could adversely affect us.
