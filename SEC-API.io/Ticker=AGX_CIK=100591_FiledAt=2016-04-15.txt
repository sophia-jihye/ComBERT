 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 

&#160; 

Argan, Inc. (&#147;Argan&#148;) conducts operations through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Gemma Power Systems, LLC and affiliates (&#147;GPS&#148;), Atlantic Projects Company Limited (&#147;APC&#148;), Southern Maryland Cable, Inc. (&#147;SMC&#148;) and The Roberts Company (&#147;TRC&#148;) (together referred to as the &#147;Company,&#148; &#147;we,&#148; &#147;us,&#148; or &#147;our&#148;). The affiliates of GPS include its majority-controlled joint ventures and any variable interest entities for which Argan or one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. Through GPS, which provided 90%, 98% and 96% of consolidated revenues for the years ended January 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, we provide a full range of engineering, procurement, construction, commissioning, operations management, maintenance, development and consulting services to the power generation and renewable energy markets for a wide range of customers including independent power project owners, public utilities, municipalities, public institutions and private industry. Through APC, we provide construction and technical services for power generation, oil and gas, industrial and process industry customers. Through SMC, we provide telecommunications infrastructure services including project management, construction and maintenance to commercial, federal government and local government customers. Through TRC, we provide fully integrated fabrication, construction and plant services designed to work specifically with heavy and light industrial customers. 

&#160; 

Holding Company Structure 

&#160; 

Argan was organized as a Delaware corporation in May 1961. We intend to make additional acquisitions and/or investments by identifying companies with significant potential for profitable growth. We may have more than one industrial focus. We expect that companies acquired in each of these industrial groups will be held in separate subsidiaries that will be operated in a manner that best provides cash flows for the Company and value for our stockholders. Argan is a holding company with no operations other than its continuing investments in GPS, APC, SMC and TRC. 

&#160; 

Power Industry Services 

&#160; 

GPS is a full service engineering, procurement and construction (&#147;EPC&#148;) contractor with the proven abilities of designing, building and commissioning large-scale energy projects in the United States. The extensive design, construction, start-up and operating experience of GPS has grown with installed and under-contract capacity for more than 76 facilities representing over 14,000 MW of power-generating capacity. Our power projects have included base-load combined-cycle facilities, simple-cycle peaking plants and boiler plant construction and renovation efforts. We have also broadened our experience into the renewable energy industry by providing EPC contracting services to the owners of alternative energy facilities, including biomass plants, wind farms and solar fields. Typically, the scope of work for GPS includes complete plant design and construction from site development through electrical interconnection and plant testing. The durations of our construction projects may extend to three years. The contract backlog of GPS as of January 31, 2016 was approximately $1.1 billion, with an additional $0.4 billion added subsequent to year end. 

&#160; 

On May 29, 2015, we acquired APC, a private company formed in Dublin in the Republic of Ireland over 40 years ago, and its affiliated companies. APC provides turbine, boiler and large rotating equipment installation, commissioning and outage services to original equipment manufacturers, global construction firms and plant owners worldwide. APC has successfully completed projects in more than 30 countries on six continents. With its presence in Ireland and its other offices located in Hong Kong, Singapore and New York, APC expanded our operations internationally for the first time. The fair value of the consideration transferred to the former owners of APC was approximately $11.1 million, including cash and 98,818 shares of our common stock. The operating results of APC have been included in our consolidated operating results since the date of its acquisition and the balance sheet amounts of APC are included in our consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2016. 

&#160; 

GPS and APC represent our power industry services reportable segment. The revenues of our power industry services business segment were $388 million, $377 million and $219 million for the years ended January 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, or 94%, 98% and 96% of our consolidated revenues for the corresponding periods, respectively. 

&#160; 

During our fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 (&#147;Fiscal 2016&#148;), we have seen significant growth in our backlog of projects, have continued construction on the two projects being performed for affiliates of Panda Power Funds (the &#147;Panda Liberty and the Panda Patriot Projects&#148;) that are scheduled for completion during calendar year 2016, and started up five new major projects. 

&#160;

(3) The FNTP for this project is subject to Massachusetts regulatory approvals. 

&#160; 

During our fiscal year ended January 31, 2015 (&#147;Fiscal 2015&#148;), we also completed a biomass-fired project for East Texas Electric Cooperative, Inc. (&#147;ETEC&#148;) covering EPC contracting services for a 50 MW power plant fueled by chipped timber located near Woodville, Texas (the &#147;Woodville EPC Project&#148;). The contract had a value of approximately $169 million and was finished ahead of its December 2014 planned completion date. We have received a contract from ETEC for the operation and maintenance of this power plant for a term of three years beyond the mobilization period. 

&#160; 

During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014, our successfully completed projects included, most significantly, the construction of an 800 MW simple-cycle quick start peaking power plant located near Desert Hot Springs, California, encompassing the delivery and installation of eight gas turbines for the project owner, CPV Sentinel, LLC. 

&#160; 

Contract Backlog 

&#160; 

Contract backlog represents the total accumulated value of projects awarded less the amounts of revenues recognized to date on contracts at a specific point in time. We believe contract backlog is an indicator of future revenues and earnings potential. Although contract backlog reflects business that we consider to be firm, cancellations or reductions may occur and may reduce contract backlog and the future revenues of this reportable business segment. At January 31, 2016, the total contract backlog of this segment was $1.1 billion. With the addition of the CPV Towantic Energy Center which was booked subsequent to fiscal year end, the backlog of projects would have exceeded $1.5 billion. Our total contract backlog amount as of January 31, 2015 was $423 million. 

&#160; 

Project Developmental Activities 

&#160; 

We opportunistically participate in developmental and related financing activities 1) to develop a proprietary pipeline for future EPC activities, 2) to secure exclusive rights to EPC contracts, and 3) to generate profits through interest and success fees. We have partnered with Moxie Energy, LLC (&#147;Moxie&#148;) to take principal positions in the initial stages of development for three projects in the Marcellus Shale Region. All three developmental efforts have successfully been completed resulting in GPS securing the rights for EPC contracts for large scale natural gas-fired power plants. The Panda Liberty Project and the Panda Patriot Project developments were completed in 2013 and the development efforts for the Caithness Moxie Freedom Generating Station project were completed in 2015. Success fees related to these three projects totaled $31 million. 

&#160; 

Joint Ventures 

&#160; 

As is common in our industry, general construction contractors execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through joint ventures, limited partnerships and limited liability companies for the purpose of completing a project or program for a project owner, such as a government agency or a commercial enterprise. These special purpose entities are generally dissolved upon completion of the corresponding project or program. Accordingly, GPS assigned the EPC contracts for the Panda Liberty and Patriot Projects to joint ventures that were formed during our fiscal year ended January 31, 2014 (&#147;Fiscal 2014&#148;) to perform the work for the applicable project and to spread the bonding risk associated with the projects. Our partner for both ventures is the same large, heavy civil contracting firm. The joint venture agreements provide that GPS has the majority interest in any profits, losses, assets and liabilities that may result from the performance of these EPC contracts for the projects. However, if the joint venture partner is unable to pay its share of any losses, GPS would be fully liable. GPS has no significant commitments beyond those related to the completion of the EPC contracts for the Panda Liberty and Panda Patriot Projects. The joint venture partners are dedicating resources to the projects that are necessary to complete the power plants and they are being reimbursed for their costs. GPS is performing most of the activities of these EPC contracts. Due to our financial control over the joint ventures, they are included in our consolidated financial statements for the years ended January 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Materials 

&#160; 

In connection with the engineering and construction of traditional power plants, biodiesel plants and other renewable energy systems, we procure materials for installation on the various projects. With our assistance, the project owners frequently procure and supply certain major components of the power plants such as the natural gas-fired combustion turbines. We are not dependent upon any one source for materials that we use to complete a particular project, and we are not currently experiencing difficulties in procuring the necessary materials for our contracted projects. However, we cannot guarantee that in the future there will not be unscheduled delays in the delivery of materials and equipment ordered by us or a project owner. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We compete with numerous large and well capitalized private and public firms in the construction and engineering services industry. These competitors include Bechtel Corporation and Fluor Corporation, global firms providing engineering, procurement, construction and project management services; SNC-Lavalin Group, Inc., a diversified Canadian construction and engineering firm; Chicago Bridge &#38; Iron Company N.V., a diversified firm providing consulting, engineering, construction and facilities management services; Skanska AB, a leading international project development and construction company; and Kiewit Corporation, an employee-owned global construction firm. These and other competitors are multi-billion dollar companies with thousands of employees. We also may compete with regional construction services companies in the markets where planned projects might be located. 

&#160; 

To compete with these firms, we emphasize our proven track record as a cost-effective choice for the design, build and commissioning of natural gas-fired and alternative power energy systems. Our extensive and successful experience includes the efficient completion of natural gas-fired simple cycle and combined cycle power plants, wood/coal-fired plants, waste-to-energy plants, wind farms, solar fields and biofuel processing facilities, all performed on an EPC contract basis. Through the power industry services segment, we provide a full range of competitively priced development, consulting, engineering, procurement, construction, commissioning and maintenance services to project owners. We are able to react quickly to their requirements while bringing a strong, experienced team to help navigate through difficult technical, scheduling and construction issues. We believe that we are uniquely positioned to assist in the development and delivery of innovative renewable energy solutions as world energy needs grow and efforts to reduce the effects of climate change increase. 

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160; 

For Fiscal 2016, we recognized revenues associated with EPC contract services provided to the owners of the Panda Liberty and Panda Patriot Projects that represented approximately 35% and 38% of consolidated revenues, respectively. Revenues earned in connection with the five new projects and the revenues for Fiscal 2016 contributed by APC since its acquisition by us represented the majority of the remaining revenues of the power industry services business for the year. 

&#160; 

We also recognized significant portions of revenues for Fiscal 2015 pursuant to the EPC contracts for the Panda Liberty and Panda Patriot Projects that represented approximately 45% and 41% of consolidated revenues, respectively, and we recognized revenues related to the Woodville EPC Project, completed during Fiscal 2015, and the related mobilization, maintenance and operating efforts, which together represented approximately 12% of consolidated revenues for the year. 

&#160; 

For Fiscal 2014, we recognized revenues associated with the Woodville EPC Project and an EPC contract with Competitive Power Ventures for the construction of a simple cycle natural gas-fired power plant located in Southern California that was completed during the year. These EPC projects represented approximately 33% and 22% of consolidated revenues for the year, respectively. In addition, the combined revenues recognized pursuant to the EPC contracts associated with the Panda Liberty and Panda Patriot Projects represented approximately 21% of consolidated revenues and the fees earned in connection with the successful development of these projects represented approximately 12% of consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2014. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Regulation 

&#160; 

Our power industry service operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations including: licensing for contractors; building codes; permitting and inspection requirements applicable to construction projects; regulations relating to worker safety and environmental protection; and special bidding, procurement, employee compensation and security clearance requirements. Many state and local regulations governing construction require permits and licenses to be held by individuals who have passed an examination or met other requirements. We believe that we have all the licenses required to conduct our current operations and that we are in substantial compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. 

&#160; 

Industrial Fabrication and Field Services 

&#160; 

On December 4, 2015, we acquired The Roberts Company (&#147;TRC&#148;), which was founded in 1977 and is headquartered near Greenville, North Carolina. TRC is principally an industrial fabricator and constructor serving both light and heavy industrial organizations primarily in the southern United States including pulp and paper, petrochemical and power companies among others. We paid $500,000 to acquire the member interests of TRC, and assumed approximately $16 million in bank debt obligations, which we paid off on the acquisition closing date. We plan to have TRC continue to operate under its own name with its own management team. TRC is currently presented as a separate reportable business segment, Industrial Fabrication and Field Services. TRC historically has primarily been a profitable company that incurred a net loss in its current year (the eleven month and four day period ended December 4, 2015), primarily due to taking on large contracts that resulted in significant losses. With the reengagement and leadership of TRC&#146;s founder, John Roberts, our financial support and the substantial completion of these loss contracts, we acquired TRC with the belief that it is positioned to succeed in the future with a return to profitable operations. We also believe that TRC has the skills and capacity to fabricate piping and pressure vessels for GPS, APC and their suppliers. However, there can be no assurances that TRC will succeed in the future or will resume profitability. From December 5, 2015 through the end of our Fiscal 2016, or for a little under two months, TRC generated $15.3 million in revenues and incurred a $1.0 million loss. Since the acquisition, we have advanced an additional $22.5 million providing TRC with the funds needed to finish the work on the loss contracts, to bolster working capital and for other general corporate purposes. 

&#160; 

Telecommunications Infrastructure Services 

&#160; 

Through SMC, which represents our telecommunications infrastructure services reportable business segment, we provide comprehensive technology wiring and utility construction solutions to customers in the mid-Atlantic region. We perform both outside plant and inside plant cabling. The revenues of SMC were $10.4 million, $6.4 million and $8.8 million for the years ended January 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, or approximately 2%, 2% and 4% of our consolidated revenues for the corresponding periods, respectively. 

&#160; 

Services provided to our outside premises customers include trench-less directional boring and excavation for underground communication and power networks, aerial cabling services, and the installation of buried cable, high and low voltage electric lines, and private area outdoor lighting systems. The outside premises services are primarily provided to state and local government agencies, regional communications service providers, electric utilities and other commercial customers. The wide range of inside premises wiring services that we provide to our customers include the structuring, cabling, terminations and connectivity that provide the physical transport for high speed data, voice, video and security networks. These services are provided primarily to federal government facilities, including cleared facilities, on a direct and subcontract basis. Such facilities typically require regular upgrades to their wiring systems in order to accommodate improvements in security, telecommunications and network capabilities. 

&#160; 

Consistently, a major portion of SMC&#146;s revenue-producing activity each year is performed pursuant to task or work orders issued under master agreements with SMC&#146;s major customers. Over the last three years, these major customers have included the Maryland Transit Administration; Howard County, Maryland; EDS and Southern Maryland Electric Cooperative, a local electricity cooperative. 

&#160; 

SMC operates in the fragmented and competitive telecommunication and infrastructure services industry. We compete with service providers ranging from small regional companies, which service a single market, to larger firms servicing multiple regions, as well as large national and multi-national contractors. We believe that we compete favorably with the other companies in the telecommunication and utility infrastructure services industry. We intend to emphasize our high quality reputation, outstanding customer base and highly motivated work force in competing for larger and more diverse contracts. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Financing Arrangements 

&#160; 

We have financing arrangements with Bank of America (the &#147;Bank&#148;) that are described in a Replacement Credit Agreement, effective August 10, 2015 (the &#147;Credit Agreement&#148;). The Credit Agreement, which supersedes our prior arrangements with the Bank, provides a revolving loan with a maximum borrowing amount of $10.0 million that is available until May 31, 2018 with interest at LIBOR plus 2.00%. We may also use the borrowing ability to cover standby letters of credit issued by the Bank for our use in the ordinary course of business. There were no actual borrowings outstanding under the Bank financing arrangements as of January 31, 2016 and 2015. Borrowing availability in the total amount of $1.35 million has been designated to cover several letters of credit issued by the Bank, with expiration dates ranging from September 23, 2016 to November 5, 2016, in support of the project development activities of a potential power plant owner. 

&#160; 

We have pledged the majority of our assets to secure the financing arrangements. The Bank&#146;s consent is not required for acquisitions, divestitures, cash dividends or significant investments as long as certain conditions are met. The Bank requires that we comply with certain financial covenants at our fiscal year-end and at each of our fiscal quarter-ends. As of January 31, 2016, we were in compliance with the financial covenants of the Credit Agreement. We believe we will continue to comply with our financial covenants under the Credit Agreement. 

&#160; 

Safety, Risk Management, Insurance and Performance Bonds 

&#160; 

We are committed to ensuring that the employees of each of our businesses perform their work in a safe environment. We regularly communicate with our employees to promote safety and to instill safe work habits. GPS, TRC and SMC each have an experienced full time safety director committed to ensuring a safe work place, as well as compliance with applicable permits, insurance and local and environmental laws. Contracts with customers in each of our reportable business segments may require performance bonds or other means of financial assurance to secure contractual performance. Under such circumstances and/or as a means to spread project risk, we may consider an arrangement with a joint venture party in order to provide the required bonding to a prospective project owner (see Note 5 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements). We maintain material amounts of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on our balance sheet, and, as indicated above, we have the commitment of the Bank to issue irrevocable standby letters of credit up to an aggregate amount of $10.0 million in support of our bonding collateral requirements. As of January 31, 2016, we had $822 million in bonded backlog related to GPS. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

The total number of personnel employed by us is subject to the volume of construction in progress and the relative amount of work performed by subcontractors. We had approximately 1,188 employees at January 31, 2016, substantially all of whom were full-time. We believe that our employee relations are good. 

&#160;
