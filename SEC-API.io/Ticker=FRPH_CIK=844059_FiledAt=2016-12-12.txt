 Item 1. BUSINESS. 

&#160;

On January 30, 2015, FRP Holdings, Inc. (&#8220;FRP&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) completed the tax-free Spin-off (&#8220;Spin-off&#8221;) of its transportation business into a new, separately traded public company, Patriot Transportation Holding, Inc. (Nasdaq GM: PATI) (&#8220;Patriot&#8221;). In the Spin-off, FRP distributed all of the outstanding stock of Patriot to FRP's shareholders as of the record date of January 9, 2015. FRP&#8217;s shareholders received one share of Patriot for every three shares of FRP owned on the record date. Patriot now is an independent, publicly traded company, and FRP retains no ownership in Patriot. The Company retained the real estate business, which is now the sole business of the Company.

&#160;

FRP Holdings, Inc. was incorporated on April 22, 2014 in connection with a corporate reorganization that preceded the Spin-off. The Company&#8217;s successor issuer was formed on July 20, 1998. The business of the Company is conducted through our wholly-owned subsidiaries FRP Maryland, Inc., a Maryland corporation, FRP Development Corp., a Maryland corporation and Florida Rock Properties, Inc., a Florida corporation, and the various subsidiaries of each.

&#160; 

Our Business. FRP Holdings, Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a holding company engaged in various real estate businesses. The segments of the Company include: (i) leasing and management of warehouse and office buildings owned by the Company (the &#8220;Asset Management Segment&#8221;), (ii) leasing and management of mining royalty land owned by the Company (the &#8220;Mining Royalty Lands Segment&#8221;) and (iii) real property acquisition, entitlement, development and construction primarily for warehouse and office buildings (the &#8220;Land Development and Construction Segment&#8221;).

&#160;

The Asset Management Segment owns, leases and manages warehouse and office buildings located predominately in the Baltimore, northern Virginia, and Washington, DC market areas. Price, location, rental space availability, flexibility of design and property management services are the major factors that affect competition in the flexible warehouse and office rental market. The Company experiences considerable competition in all of its markets. Tenants of our flexible warehouse/office properties are not concentrated in any one particular industry.

&#160;

Our Mining Royalty Lands Segment owns several properties comprising approximately 15,000 acres currently under lease for mining rents or royalties (not including the 4,280 acres owned in our Brooksville joint venture with Vulcan Materials). Other than one location in Virginia, all of these properties are located in Florida and Georgia. 

&#160;

Our Land Development and Construction Segment owns and continuously monitors the &#8220;highest and best use&#8221; of parcels of land that are in various stages of development. The overall strategy for this segment is to convert all of our non-income producing property into income-producing property through (i) an orderly process of constructing new warehouse and office buildings to be operated by the Company or (ii) a sale to, or joint venture with, third parties.

&#160;

Competition. The Asset Management Segment owns, leases and manages warehouse and office buildings located predominately in the Baltimore, northern Virginia, Washington, DC market areas. As a developer of flexible warehouse and office space, we compete with numerous developers, owners and operators of real estate, many of whom own properties similar to ours in the same submarkets in which our properties are located. Price, location, rental space availability, flexibility of design and property management services are the major factors that affect competition in the flexible warehouse and office rental market.

&#160; 

Customers. Primarily due to our preferred mid-sized (75,000-150,000 square feet) warehouse buildings, the Asset Management Segment mainly caters to local and regional tenants (versus larger national tenants). We do not have any material dependence on a particular industry for our tenants in this segment. With the completion and occupancy of the 3rd build to suit for VADATA at Patriot Business Park in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 this particular tenant accounted for 11% of the Company&#8217;s consolidated revenues during fiscal 2016. In the Mining Royalty Lands segment, we have a total of four tenants currently leasing our mining locations and one particular tenant (Vulcan Materials Company) accounted for 15.6% of the Company&#8217;s consolidated revenues in fiscal 2016. An event affecting either VADATA&#8217;s or Vulcan&#8217;s ability to perform under its lease agreements could materially impact the Company&#8217;s results.

&#160;

Sales and Marketing. We use national brokerage firms to assist us in marketing our vacant warehouse rental properties. Our hands on in-house management team focuses on tenant satisfaction during the life of the lease which we have found to be very beneficial with respect to our tenant renewal success rate over the years.

&#160;

Financial Information. Financial information is discussed by industry segment in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in the accompanying 2016 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is incorporated herein by reference.

&#160; 

Environmental Matters. The Company incurs costs from time to time to investigate and remediate environmental contamination on its real estate. The Company's mining leases contain provisions under which the lessee is responsible for environmental liabilities and reclamation of mining sites at least to the extent required by law.

&#160;

Seasonality. The Company&#8217;s business is subject to limited seasonality factors due to the cyclical nature of our mining customers&#8217; businesses. Revenues generally decline slightly during winter months.

&#160;

Employees. The Company employed 18 people in its real estate group at September 30, 2016.

&#160;

Company Website. The Company&#8217;s website may be accessed at www.frpholdings.com . All of our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission are accessible through our website promptly after filing. This includes annual reports on Form 10-K, proxy statements, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports filed or furnished on Form 8-K and all related amendments.
