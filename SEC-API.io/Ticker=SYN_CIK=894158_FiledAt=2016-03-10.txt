All of our programs are supported by our growing intellectual property portfolio. We are maintaining and building our patent portfolio through: filing new patent applications; prosecuting existing applications; and licensing and acquiring new patents and patent applications. In total, we hold approximately 100 U.S. and foreign patents and have over 55 U.S. and foreign patents pending. 

Our Microbiome-Focused Pipeline Our IBS-C and CDI/AAD programs are focused on protecting the gut microbiome, or gut flora, which is home to billions of bacteria and composed of a natural balance of both &#147;good&#148; beneficial bacteria and potentially &#147;bad&#148; pathogenic bacteria. When the natural balance of these bacteria is disrupted, a person&#146;s health can be compromised. 

SYN-010 &#151; Treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome with Constipation (ISB-C) SYN-010 is our proprietary, modified-release formulation of lovastatin lactone that is intended to reduce methane production by certain microorganisms ( M. smithii ) in the gut while minimizing disruption to the microbiome. Methane produced by M. smithii is perceived as an underlying cause of pain, bloating, and constipation associated with IBS-C, and published reports have associated higher intestinal methane production with increased constipation severity in IBS-C patients. SYN-010 is intended to act primarily in the intestinal lumen while avoiding systemic absorption, thereby targeting the major cause of IBS-C, not just the patient&#146;s symptoms. 

In December 2013, through our subsidiary Synthetic Biomics, Inc. (&#147;SYN Biomics&#148;), we entered into a worldwide exclusive license agreement with Cedars Sinai Medical Center (CSMC) and acquired the rights to develop products for therapeutic and prophylactic treatments of acute and chronic diseases, including the development of SYN-010 to target IBS-C. We licensed from CSMC a portfolio of intellectual property comprised of several U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications for various fields of use, including IBS-C, obesity and diabetes. An investigational team led by Mark Pimentel, M.D. at CSMC discovered that these products may reduce the production of methane gas by certain GI microorganisms. Methane produced by these microorganisms is perceived as an underlying cause of pain, bloating, and constipation associated with IBS-C, and may contribute to the pathology of other diseases. We believe SYN-010 may reduce the impact of methane producing organisms on IBS-C. 

Irritable Bowel Syndrome IBS is a functional GI disorder characterized by gas, abdominal pain, bloating and diarrhea or constipation, or alternating episodes of both. The illness affects both men and women; however, two-thirds of diagnosed sufferers are women. The onset of IBS can begin anytime from adolescence to adulthood. Four bowel patterns may be seen with IBS including: IBS-C (constipation predominant), IBS-D (diarrhea predominant), IBS-M (mixed diarrhea and constipation) and IBS-A (alternating diarrhea and constipation). According to GlobalData&#146;s IBS Global Drug Forecast and Market Analysis to 2023 (December 2014) stringent disease diagnosis criteria to ensure market relevance and a population most likely to receive a diagnosis and prescription drug treatment, the prevalence of IBS in adults in the U.S., Europe and Japan was expected to be 41.1 million in 2015, and it has been reported that up to 20 percent of all IBS patients have IBS-C. 

Extensive studies conducted by Dr. Pimentel and collaborators have shown that overproduction of methane gas is directly associated with bloating, pain and constipation in IBS-C patients. Investigators at CSMC have discovered that inhibiting intestinal methane production may reverse constipation associated with IBS-C, and may be beneficial in treating other major diseases such as obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. We believe our product candidate

Limitations of Current Treatments and Market Opportunity Currently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapies for the treatment of IBS-C and other treatments including prescription and over-the-counter laxatives, which provide patients with temporary symptomatic relief and often cause diarrhea, but do not treat the underlying cause of pain, bloating and constipation associated with IBS-C. According to GlobalData, IBS &#151; Global Drug Forecast and Market Analysis to 2023 (December 2014), the estimated global sales for IBS therapeutics for 2015 was $669.3 million, and global sales are expected to be greater than $1.5 billion in 2023. 

First Phase 2 Clinical Trial Topline Results (4 Week Acute Study) In December 2015, we reported positive topline results from our first Phase 2 placebo-controlled clinical trial of SYN-010, including lowered breath methane and improved stool frequency in patients with IBS-C. This first Phase 2 clinical trial was initiated in June 2015 and enrolled 63 patients who were randomized using a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three groups, including two different SYN-010 dose groups and a placebo group. Patients received single oral doses of SYN-010 or a placebo each day for 28 days. The primary objective of this clinical trial was to evaluate the change from baseline in the area under the curve (AUC) of breath methane, as determined by a lactulose breath test, in methane-positive patients with IBS-C after seven days of treatment with one of two dose levels of SYN-010 as compared with a placebo. The trial&#146;s secondary endpoints included improvement in the number of complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBM) per week, and improvement in abdominal pain and bloating per standard scales required per FDA guidance. There were no serious adverse events observed. 

In the first Phase 2 clinical trial of SYN-010, 65 percent of patients had no detectable plasma trough levels of lovastatin lactone or lovastatin beta-hydroxyacid after 28 days of treatment. In the few patients with detectable trough levels at day 28, concentrations of both lovastatin lactone and lovastatin beta-hydroyacid were significantly lower than observed for commercial lovastatin formulations. Consistent with limited absorption, there were no statistically significant changes in LDL-C levels relative to placebo after 28 days.

Second Phase 2 Clinical Trial Topline Results (8 Week Extension Study) In January 2016, we reported positive topline data from our second Phase 2 clinical trial of SYN-010, which was initiated in October 2015. As the patients completed the first Phase 2 clinical trial, they were eligible to immediately rollover into the second Phase 2 clinical trial (multi-center, open-label) of SYN-010 that evaluated the sustainability of the effect of one dose strength of SYN-010 (42 mg) on breath methane production in 54 breath methane-positive patients with IBS-C, as well as key clinical outcomes, including frequency of CSBM, abdominal pain and bloating. 

A statistically significant decrease in methane production (p=0.002) from the beginning of the first Phase 2 study (Study 1 baseline &#151; Day 1) to the end of the second Phase 2 study (12 weeks of treatment &#151; Day 84), thus meeting the study's primary endpoint. Topline data from the second Phase 2 study also showed improvements in secondary efficacy endpoints, including: (1) a statistically significant reduction in the mean IBS Symptom Severity Score (IBS-SSS; p&#60;0.0001), which includes abdominal pain, bloating, stool frequency and quality of life scores, for all patients from Study 1 baseline to the end of the second Phase 2 study, and (2) an increase in the percentage of patients identified as Monthly Responders, an FDA-defined composite measure incorporating improvements in CSBMs and abdominal pain. There were no serious adverse events observed. 

Phase 3 Planning We have submitted two Type C meeting requests with the FDA and anticipate requesting an end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA during summer 2016. We plan to initiate a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial during the second half of 2016. 

Anticipated Regulatory Strategy We believe that we will be able to utilize the regulatory approval pathway provided in Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) for SYN-010. A New Drug Application (NDA) submitted under Section 505(b)(2), referred to as a 505(b)(2) NDA, contains full safety and efficacy reports but allows at least some of the information required for NDA approval, such as safety and efficacy information on the 

&#160;

&#160;

active ingredient, to come from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. We believe we can rely on the FDA&#146;s previous findings of safety for a currently marketed product and published clinical data. We expect to rely on published clinical trials using a similar drug product to provide support of efficacy. Consequently, we believe we can move directly into a pivotal clinical trial. 

Clinical Advisory Board In April 2014, we formed a Clinical Advisory Board (IBS-C CAB) to support development of SYN-010, and named Dr. Pimentel, the gastroenterologist and lead investigator for our IBS-C program, as the Chair. In October 2014, we announced the expansion of the IBS-C CAB to include William Chey, M.D., Gail M. Comer, M.D., Anthony J. Lembo, M.D., and, Philip Schoenfeld, M.D., MSEd, MSc. 

Preclinical and Experimental Development In November 2015, our peer-reviewed article titled &#147;Inhibition of Methanogenic Archaea by Statins as a Targeted Management Strategy for Constipation and Related Disorders&#148;, evaluating the therapeutic potential of certain statins in inhibiting the production of methane was published online in the Alimentary Pharmacology &#38; Therapeutics journal. The article describes observational and experimental studies which show a strong correlation between the production of methane by the dominant methane-producing microorganism in the gut, M. smithii , and slowed stool transit in the intestines commonly seen in patients with IBS-C. 

In October 2015, experimental results were presented in a poster at the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) Annual Meeting by Dr. Pimentel, demonstrating that of the various statins examined, lovastatin lactone was the only effective inhibitor of methane production in human stool homogenates, significantly inhibiting methane levels by -65% compared to the control stool. 

In August 2015, we evaluated SYN-010 minitablet pharmacokinetics (PK) in an appropriate animal model (canine) to determine if the formulation can deliver the desired in vivo lovastatin release profile as measured by plasma concentrations of lovastatin lactone and lovastatin beta-hydroxyacid. In this preclinical study, the plasma PK of SYN-010 minitablets were compared to equivalent doses of the commercial formulations Mevacor (IR) and Altoprev (XR) to facilitate comparison to previous nonclinical and clinical experience with these medicines. The study demonstrated that SYN-010 minitablets delivered lovastatin lactone and lovastatin beta-hydroxyacid to the GI tract while minimizing systemic drug levels.

In May 2015, preclinical results were presented in a poster at Digestive Disease Week&#174; (DDW) 2015 demonstrating that lovastatin prevented proliferation of methanogens in the small intestines of rats with minimal impact on remaining microbiome. In his practice, Dr. Pimentel translated the use of statins to reduce methane in humans in select IBS-C patients, demonstrating that lovastatin prevented methane production by methanogens in human stool. 

Intellectual Property The SYN-010 intellectual property portfolio includes approximately 55 issued U.S. and foreign patents, and approximately 15 U.S. and foreign patents pending.

In February 2016, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) issued a Notice of Allowance for a patent application which covers the use of a variety of compounds, including the active agent of SYN-010, our proprietary, modified-release formulation of lovastatin lactone designed to treat a major underlying cause of IBS-C. U.S. Patent Application No. 14/211,197 also includes claims that provide protection for proprietary patient screening technology developed by Dr. Pimentel. Upon issuance, this patent, which is owned by CSMC and exclusively licensed to Synthetic Biologics, strengthens the Company's extensive SYN-010-related patent estate and extends the term of the Company's patent protection to at least 2034. 

In November 2015, U.S. Patent No. 9,192,618 was issued and includes claims that cover our clinical SYN-010 IBS-C program. This patent, which is exclusively licensed from CSMC, is the result of research directed by Dr. Pimentel. This new U.S. patent enlarges our SYN-010-related patent estate; patents from the same family have been granted in Europe, Canada and Australia. Additional worldwide patent filings by CSMC and co-owned by us or licensed to us, include composition of matter claims that could extend patent protection of SYN-010 to the year 2035.

SYN-004 &#151; Prevention of C. difficile infections (CDI) and antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) SYN-004 is an oral prophylactic therapy designed to degrade certain IV beta-lactam antibiotics within the GI tract and maintain the natural balance of the gut microbiome for the prevention of CDI, AAD and emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms. Beta-lactam antibiotics are a mainstay in hospital infection management and include the commonly used penicillin and cephalosporin classes of antibiotics. 

In November 2012, we acquired a series of oral beta-lactamase enzymes (P1A, P2A and P3A) and related assets targeting the prevention of CDI, the leading healthcare-associated infection that generally occurs secondary to treatment with IV antibiotics from Prev ABR LLC. The acquired assets include a pre-Investigation New Drug (IND) package for P3A (which we now refer to as SYN-004), Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical data for P1A, manufacturing processes and data, and a portfolio of issued and pending U.S. and foreign patents intended to support an IND and Biologics License Application (BLA) with the FDA. Utilizing this portfolio of assets, we developed a proprietary, second generation oral beta-lactamase enzyme product candidate that we call SYN-004. 

Compared to the first generation oral enzyme candidate of P1A, we believe that the second generation candidate, SYN-004, will have activity against a broader spectrum of beta-lactam antibiotics, including both penicillins and certain cephalosporins. Due to the structural similarities between P1A and SYN-004, and based on previous discussions with the FDA, certain preclinical data collected on P1A was used in support of an IND application for our new product candidate, SYN-004. P1A was evaluated in four Phase 1 and one Phase 2 clinical trials conducted in Europe. In total, 112 patients and 143 healthy normal subjects participated in these studies. 

Beta-lactamase enzymes have the ability to degrade beta-lactam antibiotics that may be excreted into the GI tract. P1A (the first generation candidate) showed acceptable safety and tolerability in a Phase 1 study. In addition, data from two Phase 2 clinical studies demonstrated that P1A had the ability to preserve GI microflora in hospitalized patients treated with IV ampicillin or the combination of piperacillin and tazobactam. 

C. difficile C. difficile is the leading type of hospital acquired infection and is frequently associated with IV beta-lactam antibiotic treatment. According to an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine (Leffler DA et al. N Engl J Med 2015; 372: 1539-1548), CDIs more than quadruple the cost of hospitalizations, increasing annual expenditures by approximately $1.5 billion in the U.S. CDI is a rising global hospital acquired infection (HAI) problem in which the toxins produced by C. difficile bacteria result in AAD, and in the most serious cases, pseudomembranous colitis (severe inflammation of the lower GI tract) that can lead to death. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identified C. difficile as an &#147;urgent public health threat,&#148; particularly given its resistance to many drugs used to treat other infections. CDI is a major, unintended risk associated with the prophylactic or therapeutic use of IV antibiotics, which may alter the natural balance of microflora that normally protect the GI tract, leading to C. difficile overgrowth and infection. Other risk factors for CDI include hospitalization, prolonged length of stay, underlying illness, immune-compromising conditions including the administration of chemotherapy, and advanced age. In addition, many patients experience a recurrence of CDI within one to three months. 

Limitations of Current Treatments and Market Opportunity CDI is a widespread and often drug resistant infectious disease. According to an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine (Leffler DA et al. N Engl J Med 2015; 372:1539-1548), it is estimated that 453,000 patients are infected with C. difficile annually in the U.S., and it has been reported that approximately 29,000 patients die due to a CDI each year. CDI has surpassed methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as the most frequent hospital acquired infection. Controlling the spread of CDI has proven challenging, as the C. difficile spores are easily transferred to patients via normal contact with healthcare personnel and with inanimate objects. There is currently no vaccine or approved product for the prevention of CDI. 

SYN-004&#146;s significant target market is represented by the 117 million average days SYN-004 could be administered with target IV beta-lactam antibiotics. This estimate is based upon data derived from the 

&#160;

&#160;

following report: Arlington Medical Resources (AMR), a Decision Resources Group Company, 2014 Audits of Acute Care Hospital Antibiotic Utilization. Currently there are no approved treatments designed to protect the microbiome from the damaging effects of IV antibiotics. The worldwide market for SYN-004 could represent a multi-billion dollar opportunity for us. 

Phase 1a and 1b Clinical Trial Pharmacokinetic Data In March 2015, we reported positive pharmacokinetic data from our Phase 1a and 1b clinical trials, which suggests that SYN-004 may have no effect on the IV antibiotic in the bloodstream, allowing the antibiotic to fight the primary infection. In February 2015, we reported positive topline results from our Phase 1b clinical trial of escalating doses of oral SYN-004, with no safety or tolerability issues reported at dose levels and dose regimens both meeting and exceeding those expected to be studied in upcoming clinical trials. The Phase 1a (40 participants) and 1b (24 participants) clinical trials of SYN-004 were initiated in December 2014. 

First Phase 2a Clinical Trial Topline Results In December 2015, we reported positive topline results from our Phase 2a clinical trial of SYN-004, including data from ten ileostomized participants that demonstrated SYN-004 successfully degraded residual IV ceftriaxone in the chyme (digestive fluid in the small intestine) without affecting the intended level of ceftriaxone in the bloodstream. This Phase 2a clinical trial was initiated in March 2015 to evaluate the GI antibiotic-degrading effects and the safety of SYN-004. 

Second Phase 2a Clinical Trial Topline Results In June 2015, we initiated a second Phase 2a clinical trial of SYN-004 to evaluate the GI antibiotic-degrading ability and the safety of SYN-004, in the presence of the proton pump inhibitor (PPI), esomeprazole. Topline data is expected from the second Phase 2a clinical trial during the first half of 2016. 

Phase 2b Clinical Trial Design In September 2015, we initiated a Phase 2b proof-of-concept clinical trial of SYN-004. This randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial is expected to enroll approximately 370 patients at up to 75 global clinical sites. This clinical trial is intended to evaluate the ability of SYN-004 to prevent CDI, C. difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) and AAD in patients hospitalized for a lower respiratory tract infection and receiving IV ceftriaxone. Once 120 patients are enrolled and there are 10 confirmed cases of CDI, an interim analysis to evaluate baseline rate of CDI in the placebo group is anticipated to be conducted during the first half of 2016. The interim analysis will be performed by an independent data monitoring committee. As of March 8, 2016, 98 patients are enrolled in the SYN-004 Phase 2b clinical trial. 

Phase 3 Planning A Type C meeting has been requested with the FDA. We plan to initiate a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial during the second half of 2016. 

SYN-007 &#151; Prevention of CDI and AAD Preclinical work is ongoing to determine the ability of SYN-007 to protect the gut microbiome and degrade oral beta-lactam antibiotics. SYN-007 comprises a reformulated version of SYN-004 for use with oral beta-lactam antibiotics versus IV beta-lactam antibiotics. 

SYN-006 &#151; Prevention of CDI and AAD The development of SYN-006 is in the discovery stage. SYN-006 is intended to be an oral prophylactic therapy designed to degrade IV carbapenem antibiotics (a third class of beta-lactam antibiotics) within the GI tract and maintain the natural balance of the gut microbiome for the prevention of CDI and AAD. While SYN-004 is intended to degrade penicillin and certain cephalosporins in the GI tract, the SYN-006 discovery program has the potential to expand the activity to a broader spectrum of IV beta-lactam antibiotics in the GI tract to include carbapenem antibiotics. 

C. difficile CAB In June 2014, we formed a CAB to support development of SYN-004. The CAB is comprised of industry leaders Mark Wilcox, M.D., (Chairman), Curtis Donskey, M.D., Ciar&#225;n Kelly, M.D. and Tom Louie, M.D., all of whom are providing expertise and guidance on aspects of the C. difficile clinical program. 

&#160;

&#160;

C. difficile: Intellectual Property The SYN-004 intellectual property portfolio includes approximately 35 issued U.S. and foreign patents, and approximately 30 U.S. and foreign patents pending.

In March 2016, the USPTO issued Notices of Allowance for three patent applications which cover SYN-004 composition of matter claims and methods of protecting the gut microbiome from certain beta-lactam antibiotics for the prevention of CDI and AAD. Upon issuance, these newly allowed applications reinforce our extensive C. difficile -related patent estate, and carry patent terms that extend from at least 2031 to 2035. 

In November 2014, the USPTO issued U.S. Patent 8,894,994 that has claims to compositions of matter and pharmaceutical compositions of beta-lactamases, including SYN-004, and carries a patent term to at least 2031. In addition to this granted patent, we have numerous related granted and pending U.S. and foreign patent applications that are central to our intellectual property estate. Further, we continue to grow our intellectual property estate with new applications, many of which would expire in at least 2035, if granted. 

Research Programs Infectious disease outbreaks are increasing while intervention options are declining due to widespread multidrug-resistant bacteria, increasing numbers of immuno-compromised patients (e.g., the elderly and cancer patients), and the isolation of new pathogens. 

Monoclonal Antibodies for Infectious Diseases Antibodies are proteins, generally found in the bloodstream, that provide immunity in detecting and destroying pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria and their associated toxins. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can also be designed and produced as therapeutic agents, utilizing protein engineering and recombinant production technologies. The mAbs being developed under our collaboration with Intrexon are intended to supplement a patient&#146;s own immune system by providing the means to specifically and rapidly neutralize and/or clear specific pathogens and toxins of interest in a process known as &#147;passive immunity&#148;. Many pathogens that cause infectious diseases are innately resistant to, or over time have developed increased resistance to, antibiotics and other drugs. 

SYN-005 &#151; Pertussis (Whooping Cough) Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis) is a gram-negative bacterium that infects the upper respiratory tract, causing uncontrollable and violent coughing. Antibiotic treatment does not have a major effect on the course of pertussis. While such treatment can eliminate the B. pertussis bacteria from the respiratory tract, it does not neutralize the pertussis toxin. Infants with pertussis often require hospitalization in pediatric intensive care units, frequently requiring mechanical ventilation. Pertussis in adults generally leads to a chronic cough referred to as the &#147;cough of 100 days.&#148; The incidence of pertussis is increasing due to the declining effectiveness of the acellular vaccine introduced in the 1990s, exposure of unvaccinated and under-vaccinated individuals including infants who are not yet fully vaccinated and exposure of individuals whose immunity has diminished over time. 

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are 50 million cases of whooping cough, and it is estimated that B. pertussis infection causes up to 300,000 deaths each year worldwide, primarily among unvaccinated infants. Recent news reports throughout the U.S. indicate that the pertussis vaccine introduced in the 1990s does not provide long-term protection and, as a result, whooping cough cases have increased to a 60-year high. 

Intrexon Collaboration and The University of Texas at Austin Agreement In August 2012, we entered into a worldwide exclusive channel collaboration with Intrexon through which we intend to develop mAb therapies for the treatment of certain infectious diseases not adequately addressed by existing therapies. In December 2012, we initiated mAb development for the prevention and treatment of pertussis focusing on toxin neutralization. Unlike antibiotics, we are developing a mAb therapy to target and neutralize the pertussis toxin as a prophylaxis for high-risk newborns and in order to reduce the mortality rate in infected infants. This program intends to utilize Intrexon&#146;s comprehensive suite of proprietary technologies, including the mAbLogix TM platform for rapid discovery of fully human mAbs and the LEAP&#174; cell processing station. 

&#160;

&#160;

To further the development of this potential therapy for pertussis, we entered into an agreement with The University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin) to license the rights to certain research and pending patents related to pertussis antibodies. These research efforts are being conducted at the Cockrell School of Engineering in the laboratory of Associate Professor, Jennifer A. Maynard, Ph.D., the Laurence E. McMakin, Jr. Centennial Faculty Fellow in the McKetta Department of Chemical Engineering. Dr. Maynard brings to the project her expertise in defining the key neutralizing epitopes of pertussis toxin to optimize the potential efficacy of antibody therapeutics. 

Preclinical and Clinical Development Working with our collaborator, Intrexon, and our academic collaborator, UT Austin, we have established a humanized mAb product candidate, SYN-005, designed to neutralize pertussis toxin, a major cause of pertussis-mediated infant morbidity and mortality. The two humanized mAbs, hu1B7 and hu11E6, bound tightly to the toxin and potently neutralized the toxin. In addition, the antibodies were highly efficacious in a murine model of pertussis in which they completely mitigated elevations of the white blood cell count that is characteristic of the illness. The antibodies, alone and in combination, were compared to the WHO international pertussis human antiserum standard by ELISA. After administration to non-human primates, SYN-005 was detectable in the blood for more than three weeks. 

In April 2014, and again in September 2014, we received positive preclinical research findings of SYN-005 for the treatment of pertussis in three non-human primate studies (n = 19). In the latter two pertussis studies in particular, SYN-005 rapidly stopped the rise in white blood cell count that is characteristic of the disease and accelerated its return to baseline. 

In September 2014, we received U.S. Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA for SYN-005 for the treatment of pertussis. 

In April 2015, preclinical efficacy data that support advancing SYN-005 toward the clinic were presented in two poster presentations at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases meeting (ECCMID) 2015 in Copenhagen, Denmark. The data suggest that SYN-005 has therapeutic potential to diminish morbidity, long-term complications and mortality from pertussis in critically ill infants. In addition, the data support a prophylactic approach for use in newborns that has the potential to save thousands of lives annually, particularly in the developing world where the unmet need is greatest. 

In October 2015, the Bill &#38; Melinda Gates Foundation awarded a grant to UT Austin to generate preclinical proof-of-concept data to test the hypothesis that antibody administration at birth may also have a role in the prevention of pertussis. 

In December 2015, a non-human primate prophylaxis study was initiated by UT Austin to evaluate the potential of our monoclonal antibody, 1B7, in the prevention of pertussis. This preclinical study is expected to provide support for the use of our 1B7 in potential clinical application. 

Intellectual Property We have patents pending on compositions and uses of SYN-005 and we have an issued U.S. patent and patents pending on other pertussis mAbs from UT Austin. 

SYN-200 &#151; Treatment of Phenylketonuria (PKU) PKU is a genetic disease that begins at birth characterized by a deficiency in the liver enzyme that breaks down the essential amino acid phenylalanine (Phe), a building block of proteins normally obtained through the foods we eat. As a result, Phe accumulates in the body, becoming toxic and leading to serious health consequences, including profound mental retardation, brain damage, mental illness, behavioral problems, seizures, tremors, limited cognitive ability and hyperactivity. If left untreated, the most severe form of PKU leads to permanent cognitive damage. PKU affects more than 14,000 people in the U.S. and 50,000 people in developed nations globally. There is no existing cure for PKU, requiring patients to maintain a life-long treatment program and a carefully controlled diet. 

Intrexon Collaboration In August 2015, we initiated the SYN-200 discovery program for development and commercialization of novel biotherapeutics for the treatment of patients with PKU pursuant to an exclusive channel collaboration 

&#160;

&#160;

with Intrexon. We are utilizing Intrexon&#146;s ActoBiotics platform providing a proprietary method of delivering therapeutic protein and peptides to the gastrointestinal tract through food-grade microbes. This program is in the discovery stage. 

SYN-020 &#151; Oral Intestinal Alkaline Phosphatase The development of SYN-020 is in the discovery stage. SYN-020 is being developed as a modified-release oral dosage form of intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP). Published preclinical and clinical studies on IAP indicate that an oral IAP product may have efficacy in a broad range of significant therapeutic indications including celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, microbial dysbiosis and metabolic syndrome. We have identified cell systems in which IAP can be expressed and anticipate selection of an oral formulation in 2H 2016 for evaluation in preclinical disease models. 

Multiple Sclerosis Program We discontinued our multiple sclerosis (MS) program in February 2016 and the development of a Phase 2 oral estriol drug for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and cognitive dysfunction in MS. Previously, our drug candidate Trimesta (oral estriol) was evaluated in investigator-sponsored Phase 2 clinical trials for RRMS in women, and cognitive dysfunction in women with MS. 

On February 1, 2016, our subsidiary, Putney Drug, Inc. provided written notice to the Regents of the University of California (the &#147;Regents&#148;) that we were terminating our (i) License Agreement with the Regents, dated as of July 11, 2005, as amended on November 8, 2005, January 3, 2007, August 29, 2007, December 31, 2012, July 25, 2014 and July 8, 2015 (collectively, the &#147;License Agreement&#148;) and (ii) Clinical Trial Agreement with the Regents, dated April 29, 2010, as amended July 8, 2015 (collectively, the &#147;CTA&#148;). Pursuant to the terms of the License Agreement, Putney Drug had licensed from the Regents certain U.S. patents for multiple sclerosis therapy related to our drug candidate, Trimesta and Trimesta-combination therapies. Based upon the independent third party analysis of the investigator-sponsored Phase 2 clinical trial that evaluated Trimesta as a treatment for relapsing-remitting MS in women, it was determined that the License Agreement and the CTA should be terminated. In accordance with the termination provisions of the License Agreement and the CTA, the terminations will be effective May 2, 2016. 

Intellectual Property All of our programs are supported by growing patent estates that we either own or exclusively license. Each potential product has issued patents that provide protection. In total, we have approximately 100 U.S. and foreign patents and over 55 U.S. and foreign patents pending. For instance, U.S. Patent 8,894,994, which has claims to compositions of matter and pharmaceutical compositions of beta-lactamases, including SYN-004, carries a patent term to at least 2031. Further, allowed U.S. Patent Application Nos. 14/517,539 and 14/676,559 which, upon issuance, will expire in 2031, cover various uses of beta-lactamases, including SYN-004, in protecting the microbiome, and allowed U.S. Patent Application 14/689,877, which, upon issuance, will expire in 2035, covers further beta-lactamase compositions of matter related to SYN-004. Also, U.S. Patent No. 9,192,618, which expires in approximately 2023, includes claims that cover use of statins, including SYN-010, for the treatment of IBS-C. Allowed U.S. Patent Application No. 14/211,197, which expires in approximately 2033, includes claims that cover the use of a variety of compounds, including the active agent of SYN-010, to treat constipation in certain screened patients. Pending applications PCT /US2015/045140 and US 14/826,115, cover SYN-010 formulations and, if issued (after nationalization), are expected to have a term to at least 2035. 

Our goal is to (a) obtain, maintain, and enforce patent protection for our products, formulations, processes, methods, and other proprietary technologies, (b) preserve our trade secrets, and (c) operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, worldwide. We seek, where appropriate, the broadest intellectual property protection for product candidates, proprietary information, and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents. 

Our Collaborations PKU Collaboration with Intrexon Corporation On August 10, 2015, we expanded our relationship with Intrexon and entered into an Exclusive Channel Collaboration Agreement (the &#147;PKU ECC&#148;) with Intrexon that governs a &#147;channel collaboration&#148; 

&#160;

&#160;

arrangement in which we will use Intrexon&#146;s technology relating to the development and commercialization of novel biotherapeutics (a &#147;Collaboration Product&#148;) for the treatment of patients with PKU. On September 2, 2015, in accordance with the terms of the Intrexon Stock Issuance Agreement that we entered into in connection with the Channel Agreement, we paid Intrexon a technology access fee by the issuance of 937,500 shares of common stock, having a value equal to $3 million as of August 7, 2015. 

In addition, upon the achievement of certain milestones, we agreed to pay Intrexon milestone payments of up to $27 million for each product developed as follows: (i) $2 million upon first dosing of a patient in a Phase 1 clinical trial upon commencement of an IND, payable in stock or cash at our option; (ii) a payment 30 days after achievement of the first commercial sale of a Collaboration Product in the United States or approval of a New Drug Application and/or Biologics License Application for a Collaboration Product by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; and (iii) a payment 30 days after achievement of the first commercial sale of a Collaboration Product in a nation subject to the authority of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) or approval of a Marketing Authorization Application for a Collaboration Product by the EMA. We will pay Intrexon royalties on annual net sales of Collaboration Products, calculated on a product-by-product basis, equal to a percentage of net sales (ranging from mid-single digits on the first $100 million of net sales to mid-teen digits on net sales in excess of $750 million). We have likewise agreed to pay Intrexon a percentage of quarterly revenue obtained from a sublicensor in the event of a sublicensing arrangement. Pursuant to the Second Amendment to Registration Rights Agreement, we filed a &#147;resale&#148; registration statement to register the shares issued under the Intrexon Stock Issuance Agreement, which was declared effective by the SEC on October 15, 2015. 

Cedars-Sinai Medical Center License Agreement On December 5, 2013, through our majority owned subsidiary, SYN Biomics, we entered into a worldwide exclusive license agreement (the &#147;CSMC License Agreement&#148;) for the right to develop, manufacture, use, and sell products for the human and veterinary therapeutic and prophylactic treatments for acute and chronic diseases. An investigational team lead by Dr. Mark Pimentel at CSMC has discovered that these products are intended to target certain pathogenic GI microorganisms that are perceived as an underlying cause of diseases such as IBS-C, obesity and type 2 diabetes. The portfolio of intellectual property licensed to SYN Biomics under the CSMC License Agreement included nine issued U.S. patents, 30 issued patents in various European countries, three issued Australian patents, one Canadian patent and one issued Japanese patent as well as several pending U.S. and international patent applications for most fields of use and modalities (subject to certain agreed-upon exceptions. On December 5, 2013, we also entered into an option agreement regarding IBS with CSMC, which expired unexercised on December 31, 2014. 

Under the terms of the CSMC License Agreement we issued 334,911 unregistered shares of our common stock to CSMC, as payment of an initial license fee and patent reimbursement fees of $150,000 and $220,000, respectively. The parties also entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with respect to such stock issuance and other issuances of unregistered shares of our common stock that may be issued to CSMC in lieu of cash, including license fees, milestone payments, expense reimbursements and option fees under the CSMC License Agreement. Commencing on the second anniversary of the CSMC License Agreement, SYN Biomics began paying an annual maintenance fee, which payment shall be creditable against annual royalty payments owed under the CSMC License Agreement. In addition to royalty payments which are a percentage of Net Sales (as defined in the CSMC License Agreement) of Licensed Products (as defined in the CSMC License Agreement) and Licensed Technology products (as defined in the CSMC License Agreement), SYN Biomics is obligated to pay CMSC a percentage of any non-royalty sublicense revenues, as well as additional consideration upon the achievement of the following milestones (the first two of which are payable in cash or unregistered shares of our stock at our option): (i) successful Phase 1 trial completion of the first Licensed Product or first Licensed Technology Product; (ii) successful Phase 2 trial completion of the first Licensed Product or first Licensed Technology Product; (iii) initiation of Phase 3 dosing for each additional indication of a Licensed Product or Licensed Technology Product; (iv) successful Phase 3 trial completion for each Licensed Product and each Licensed Technology Product; (v) the FDA&#146;s acceptance of a New Drug Application for each Licensed Product and each Licensed Technology Product; (vi) regulatory approval for each Licensed Product and each Licensed Technology Product; and (vii) the first commercial sale of each Licensed Product and each Licensed Technology Product. The stock issuances are subject to prior approval of the NYSE MKT, LLC. 

&#160;

&#160;

Prior to the execution of the CSMC License Agreement, SYN Biomics issued shares of common stock of SYN Biomics to each of CSMC and Dr. Mark Pimentel (the primary inventor of the intellectual property), representing 11.5% and 8.5%, respectively, of the outstanding shares of SYN Biomics (the &#147;SYN Biomics Shares&#148;). The Stock Purchase Agreements for the SYN Biomics Shares provide for certain anti-dilution protection until such time as an aggregate of $3.0 million in proceeds from equity financings are received by SYN Biomics as well as a right, under certain circumstances in the event that the SYN Biomics Shares are not then freely tradeable, and subject to NYSE MKT, LLC approval, as of the 18 and 36 month anniversary date of the effective date of the Stock Purchase Agreements, for each of CSMC and the Dr. Pimentel to exchange up to 50% of their SYN Biomics Shares for unregistered shares of our common stock, with the rate of exchange based upon the relative contribution of the valuation of SYN Biomics to the public market valuation of us at the time of each exchange. The Stock Purchase Agreements also provide for tag-along rights in the event of the sale by us of our shares of SYN Biomics. 

On August 29, 2015, we, SYN Biomics and Dr. Pimentel entered into the Pimentel Amendment to the Pimentel Stock Purchase Agreement entered into dated December 3, 2013, which accelerated the date upon which Dr. Pimentel can exchange his shares of common stock in SYN Biomics for shares of the our common stock. On August 29, 2015, Dr. Pimentel notified us of his intent to exchange all of the shares of common stock in SYN Biomics owned by him for 1,350,000 shares of our common stock in accordance with the terms of the Pimentel Stock Purchase Agreement, as amended and the exchange was effectuated on August 31, 2015. We filed a &#147;resale&#148; registration statement to register 200,000 of shares issued to Dr. Pimentel, which was declared effective by the SEC on October 15, 2015. 

The CSMC License Agreement terminates: (i) automatically if SYN Biomics enters into a liquidating bankruptcy or other specified bankruptcy event or if the performance of any term, covenant, condition or provision of the CSMC License Agreement will jeopardize the licensure of CMSC, its participation in certain reimbursement programs, its full accreditation by the Joint Commission of Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations or any similar state organizations, its tax exempt status or is deemed illegal; (ii) upon 30 days&#146; notice from CMSC if SYN Biomics fails to make a payment or use commercially reasonable efforts to exploit the patent rights; (iii) upon 60 days&#146; notice from CMSC if SYN Biomics fails to cure any breach or default of any material obligations under the CSMC License Agreement; or (iv) upon 90 days&#146; notice from SYN Biomics if CMCS fails to cure any breach or default of any material obligations under the CSMC License Agreement. SYN Biomics also has the right to terminate the License Agreement without cause upon 6 months&#146; notice to CSMC; however, upon such termination, SYN Biomics is obligated to pay a termination fee with the amount of such fee reduced: (i) if such termination occurs after an IND submission to the FDA but prior to completion of a Phase 2 clinical trial, (ii) reduced further if such termination occurs after completion of Phase 2 clinical trial but prior to completion of a Phase 3 clinical trial; and (iii) reduced to zero if such termination occurs after completion of a Phase 3 clinical trial. 

The University of Texas at Austin License Agreement and Sponsored Research Agreement On December 19, 2012, we entered into a Patent License Agreement (the &#147;Texas License Agreement&#148;) with The University of Texas at Austin (the &#147;University&#148;) for the exclusive license of the right to use, develop, manufacture, market and commercialize certain research and patents related to pertussis antibodies developed in the lab of Dr. Jennifer A. Maynard, Associate Professor of Chemical Engineering. In accordance with the terms of the Texas License Agreement we made the following payments to the University: a payment of past patent expenses, an annual payment of $50,000 per year commencing on the effective date through December 31, 2014 and a $25,000 payment on December 31, 2015. The Texas License Agreement also provides that the University is entitled to milestone payments of $50,000 upon commencement of Phase 1 Clinical Trials, $100,000 upon commencement of Phase 3 Clinical Trials, $250,000 upon NDA submission in the United States, $100,000 upon European Medicines Agency approval and $100,000 upon regulatory approval in an Asian country. In addition, the University is entitled to a running royalty upon Net Product Sales and Net Service Sales (as defined in the Texas License Agreement). The License Agreement terminates upon the expiration of the patent rights (as defined in the Texas License Agreement); provided, however that the Texas License Agreement is subject to early termination by us in our discretion and by the University for a breach of the Texas License Agreement by us. 

&#160;

&#160;

In connection with the Texas License Agreement, we also entered into a Sponsored Research Agreement (the &#147;Sponsored Research Agreement&#148;) with the University pursuant to which the University will perform certain research work related to pertussis under the direction of Dr. Jennifer Maynard. All inventions conceived during such research shall be subject to the Texas License Agreement and we will obtain certain rights to patents and technology developed during the course of such research. We paid the University a fixed fee for the first year of $303,287 and the second and third years of $316,438 and $328,758, respectively. The Sponsored Research Agreement was amended on October 22, 2015, to extend its termination date to January 15, 2017; provided, however, the Sponsored Research Agreement is subject to early termination upon the written agreement of the parties, a default in the material obligations under the Sponsored Research Agreement which remain uncured for sixty days after receipt of notice, automatically upon our bankruptcy or insolvency and by us in our sole discretion at any time after the one year anniversary of the date of execution thereof upon no less than 90 days&#146; notice. Upon a termination after December 31, 2014 or due to a breach by the University, we shall only be responsible for all reasonable expenses that do not exceed the fixed annual amount and that are incurred by the University prior to the termination date for services performed prior to the termination date. 

We have patents pending on compositions and uses of SYN-005 that are co-owned UT and ourselves or licensed to us, and we have an issued U.S. patent and patent applications on other pertussis mAbs licensed from UT. 

Oral Enzyme for C. difficile Program Acquisition Agreement On November 8, 2012, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the &#147;Prev Agreement&#148;) with Prev ABR LLC (&#147;Prev&#148;), and subsequently closed the transaction on November 28, 2012. Pursuant to the Prev Agreement we acquired the C. difficile program assets of Prev, including pre-IND package for P3A (SYN-004), Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical data for P1A, manufacturing processes and data, and a portfolio of issued and pending U.S. and international patents intended to support an IND and BLA with the FDA. Pursuant to the Prev Agreement, we paid Prev an initial cash payment of $100,000 upon execution of the Prev Agreement and at closing paid an additional cash payment of $135,000 and issued 625,000 unregistered shares of our common stock to Prev. In addition, upon the achievement of the milestones set forth below, Prev may be entitled to receive additional consideration payable 50% in cash and 50% in our stock, subject to Prev&#146;s option to receive the entire payment in shares of our stock: (i) upon commencement of an IND; (ii) upon commencement of a Phase 1 clinical trial; (iii) upon commencement of a Phase 2 clinical trial; (iv) upon commencement of a Phase 3 clinical trial; (v) upon Biologic License Application (BLA) filing in the U.S. and for territories outside of the U.S. (as defined in the Prev Agreement); and (vi) upon BLA approval in the U.S. and upon approval in territories outside the U.S. As of December 31, 2015, the first three milestones have been met, and at Prev&#146;s option, Prev elected to receive 655,321 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock. The future stock issuances are subject to prior approval of the NYSE MKT, LLC. No royalties are payable to Prev under the Prev Agreement. 

Infectious Disease Collaboration with Intrexon Corporation On August 6, 2012, we expanded our relationship with Intrexon and entered into an Exclusive Channel Collaboration (&#147;ECC&#148;) with Intrexon (the &#147;Infectious Disease ECC&#148;) that governs a &#147;channel collaboration&#148; arrangement in which we will use Intrexon&#146;s technology relating to the identification, design and production of human antibodies and DNA vectors for the development and commercialization of a series of monoclonal antibody therapies for the treatment of certain serious infectious diseases the (&#147;Program&#148;) for the treatment of up to eight specific target infectious disease indications (the &#147;Field&#148;). Our development efforts are targeting pertussis . Such license is exclusive with respect to any clinical development, selling, offering for sale or other commercialization of our products within the Field (&#147;Synthetic Products&#148;), and otherwise is non-exclusive. We may not sublicense the rights described without Intrexon&#146;s written consent. Under the Infectious Disease ECC, and subject to certain exceptions, we are responsible for, among other things, the performance of the Program including the development, commercialization and manufacturing of products. 

Subject to certain expense allocations and other offsets provided in the Infectious Disease ECC, we will pay Intrexon royalties on annual net sales of the Synthetic Products, calculated on a Synthetic Product-by-Synthetic Product basis. We have likewise agreed to pay Intrexon a percentage of quarterly revenue obtained from a sublicensor in the event of a sublicensing arrangement. 

&#160;

&#160;

We may voluntarily terminate the Infectious Disease ECC upon 90 days written notice to Intrexon. Intrexon may also terminate the Infectious Disease ECC if we elect not to pursue the development of a Program identified by Intrexon that is a &#147;Superior Therapy&#148; as defined in the Infectious Disease ECC upon 60 days&#146; notice unless we remedy the circumstances giving rise to the termination during such notice period. Each party has the right to terminate the agreement upon 60 days&#146; notice if the other party commits a material breach of the Infectious Disease ECC, subject to certain cure periods. 

Upon termination of the Infectious Disease ECC, we may continue to develop and commercialize any Synthetic Product that, at the time of termination satisfies one of the following:

&#149; is being commercialized by us, &#149; has received regulatory approval, &#149; is a subject of an application for regulatory approval that is pending before the applicable regulatory authority, &#149; is a subject of at least a Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trial if such termination is by Intrexon due to a material breach by us of the Infectious Disease ECC or by us upon 60 days&#146; notice after the first 18 months. Our obligation to pay the royalties described above with respect to these &#147;retained&#148; products will survive termination of the Infectious Disease ECC. 

On October 16, 2012, we issued 3,552,210 shares of our Common Stock as consideration in connection with the Infectious Disease ECC and the related Stock Issuance Agreement with Intrexon that we entered into on August 6, 2012 (the &#147;Second Stock Issuance Agreement&#148;). 

We also agreed upon the filing of an IND application with the FDA for a Synthetic Product, or alternatively the filing of the first equivalent regulatory filing with a foreign regulatory agency (both as applicable, the &#147;IND Milestone Event&#148;), to pay Intrexon either (i) $2.0 million in cash, or (ii) that number of shares of Common Stock (the &#147;IND Milestone Shares&#148;) having a fair market value equaling $2.0 million where such fair market value is determined using published market data of the share price for Common Stock at the close of market on the business day immediately preceding the date of public announcement of attainment of the IND Milestone Event. 

Upon the first to occur of either first commercial sale of a Synthetic Product in a country or the granting of the regulatory approval of that Synthetic Product (both as applicable, the &#147;Approval Milestone Event&#148;), we agreed to pay to Intrexon either (i) $3.0 million in cash, or (ii) that number of shares of Common Stock (the &#147;Approval Milestone Shares&#148;) having a fair market value equaling $3.0 million where such fair market value is determined using published market data of the share price for Common Stock at the close of market on the business day immediately preceding the date of public announcement of attainment of the Approval Milestone Event. 

We also agreed that we will pay an optional and varying fee whereby we remit a payment, in cash or equity at our sole discretion, to Intrexon calculated as a multiple of the number of targets in excess of three total that we desire to elect (the &#147;Field Expansion Fee&#148;). The Field Expansion Fee must be paid completely in either Common Stock or cash, and will comprise either (i) $2.0 million in cash for each target in excess of three total that we elect, or (ii) that number of shares of Common Stock (the &#147;Field Expansion Fee Shares&#148;) having a fair market value equaling $2.0 million for each such target that we elect in excess of three where such fair market value is determined using published market data establishing the volume-weighted average price for a share of Common Stock over the 30 day period immediately preceding the date of the Field Expansion Fee Closing. 

In connection with the transactions contemplated by the Second Stock Issuance Agreement, and pursuant to the First Amendment to Registration Rights Agreement executed and delivered by the parties at the closing, we filed a &#147;resale&#148; registration statement registering the resale of certain of the shares issued under the Second Stock Issuance Agreement. 

&#160;

&#160;

McLean Hospital Exclusive License Agreement and Meda AB Sublicense Agreement In 2005, as amended in 2007 and 2010, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with the McLean Hospital, a Harvard University teaching hospital, relating to U.S. Patent No. 6,610,324 and its foreign equivalents, entitled &#147;Flupirtine in the treatment of fibromyalgia and related conditions.&#148; Effective May 6, 2010, we entered into a Sublicense Agreement with Meda AB of Sweden. Pursuant to this agreement, Meda has been granted an exclusive sublicense to all of our patents covering the use of oral flupirtine for fibromyalgia. These patents have been issued in the U.S. and are pending in Canada and Japan. Meda AB informed us that due to the decision of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to limit the use of flupirtine for long-term pill and systemic use, it has postponed its planned fibromyalgia clinical trials in the U.S. 

The Regents of University of California License Agreement On February 1, 2016, our subsidiary, Putney Drug, Inc. provided written notice to the Regents that we were terminating our (i) License Agreement and (ii) (collectively, the &#147;CTA&#148;). Pursuant to the terms of the License Agreement, Putney Drug, had licensed from the Regents certain U.S. patents for multiple sclerosis therapy related to our drug candidate Trimesta and Trimesta-combination therapies. Based upon the independent third party analysis of the investigator-sponsored Phase 2 clinical trial that evaluated Trimesta as a treatment for RRMS in women, it was determined that the License Agreement and the CTA should be terminated. In accordance with the termination provisions of the License Agreement and the CTA, the terminations will be effective May 2, 2016. 

Manufacturing Our product candidates are biologics and small molecules that can be readily synthesized by processes that we have developed. We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical quantities. We rely on third-party contract manufacturers, and in most cases only one third-party, to manufacture critical raw materials, drug substance and final drug product for our research, preclinical development and clinical trial activities. Commercial quantities of any drugs we seek to develop will have to be manufactured in facilities and by processes that comply with the FDA and other regulations, and we plan to rely on third parties to manufacture commercial quantities of products we successfully develop. 

Research and Development During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we incurred approximately $32.9 million, $14.5 million and $6.5 million, respectively, in research and development expenses. 

Government Regulation In the U.S., the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, storing, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution and sale of our products are subject to regulation by various governmental agencies, including primarily the FDA. Our proposed activities may also be regulated by various agencies of the states, localities and foreign countries in which our proposed products may be manufactured, distributed and sold. The FDA, in particular, regulates the formulation, manufacture and labeling of prescription drugs, such as those that we intend to distribute. FDA regulations require us and our suppliers to meet relevant cGMP regulations for the preparation, packing, labeling, and storage of all drugs. 

Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing FDA regulation, including record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences, submitting periodic reports, drug sampling and distribution requirements, manufacturing or labeling changes, record-keeping requirements, and compliance with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their facilities with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections for GMP compliance, imposing procedural and documentation requirements upon us and third-party manufacturers. Failure to comply with these regulations could result, among other things, in suspension of regulatory approval, recalls, suspension of production or injunctions, seizures, or civil or criminal sanctions. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future subcontractors will be able to comply with these regulations. 

&#160;

&#160;

The FDA regulates prescription drug labeling and promotion activities. The FDA actively enforces regulations prohibiting the marketing of products for unapproved uses. The FDA permits the promotion of drugs for unapproved uses in certain circumstances, subject to stringent requirements. We and our product candidates are subject to a variety of state laws and regulations which may hinder our ability to market our products. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval by foreign regulatory authorities must be obtained prior to commencing clinical trials, and sales and marketing efforts in those countries. These approval procedures vary in complexity from country to country, and the processes may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. We may incur significant costs to comply with these laws and regulations now or in the future. 

The FDA, comparable foreign regulators and state and local pharmacy regulators impose substantial requirements upon clinical development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products. These and other entities regulate research and development and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising, and promotion of our products. The drug approval process required by the FDA under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act generally involves:

&#149; preclinical laboratory and animal tests; &#149; submission of an IND, prior to commencing human clinical trials; &#149; adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish safety and efficacy for intended use; &#149; submission to the FDA of anNDA or BLA; and &#149; FDA review and approval of an NDA or BLA. The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 

Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of the product candidate, its chemistry, formulation and stability, and animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. Certain preclinical tests must be conducted in compliance with good laboratory practice regulations. Violations of these regulations can, in some cases, lead to invalidation of the studies, requiring them to be replicated. In some cases, long-term preclinical studies are conducted concurrently with clinical studies. 

We will submit the preclinical test results, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before we begin human clinical trials. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after filing, unless the FDA raises questions about conduct of the trials outlined in the IND and imposes a clinical hold, in which case, the IND sponsor and FDA must resolve the matters before clinical trials can begin. It is possible that our submission may not result in FDA authorization to commence clinical trials. 

Clinical trials must be supervised by qualified investigators in accordance with good clinical practice (GCP) regulations, which include informed consent requirements. Each study must be approved and monitored by the appropriate IRBs which are periodically informed of the study&#146;s progress, adverse events and changes in research. Annual updates are submitted to the FDA and more frequently if certain serious adverse events occur. 

&#160;

&#160;

Human clinical trials of drug candidates typically have three sequential phases that may overlap: 

Phase 1: The drug is initially tested in healthy human subjects or patients for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, and excretion. 

Phase 2: The drug is studied in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, determine efficacy for specific diseases and establish dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. 

Phase 3: When Phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a dosage range is effective with an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 trials to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety, are undertaken in an expanded patient population, often at geographically dispersed sites. 

We cannot be certain that we will successfully complete Phase 1, Phase 2, or Phase 3 testing of our product candidates within any specific time period, if at all. Furthermore, the FDA, an Institutional Review Board (IRB) or the IND sponsor may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that subjects or patients are exposed to unacceptable health risk. Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, we also must prepare, within 60 days of an End of Phase 2 meeting, a pediatric study plan or request for waiver or deferral of pediatric studies in the indication under development. Concurrent with these trials and studies, we also develop chemistry and physical characteristics data and finalize a manufacturing process in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must conform to consistency and quality standards, and we must develop methods for testing the quality, purity, and potency of the final products. Appropriate packaging is selected and tested, and chemistry stability studies are conducted to demonstrate that the product does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf-life. Results of the foregoing are submitted to the FDA as part of a NDA (or BLA in case of biologic products) for marketing and commercial shipment approval. The FDA reviews each NDA or BLA submitted and may request additional information. A sixty day period after the sponsor&#146;s submission of an NDA or BLA is used by the FDA to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review, in which case the application is accepted for filing. 

Once the FDA accepts the NDA or BLA for filing, it begins its in-depth review. The FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may disagree with our interpretation of the data submitted or identify new concerns. The process may be significantly extended by requests for new information or clarification of information already submitted. As part of this review, the FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians. Manufacturing establishments often are inspected prior to NDA or BLA approval to assure compliance with GMPs and with manufacturing commitments made in the application. 

Submission of an NDA or BLA with clinical data requires payment of a substantial fee. In return, the FDA assigns a goal for review and decision on the application, in which the FDA may approve or deny the NDA or BLA, or issue a complete response letter outlining information needed to support approval, including a potential need for additional clinical data. Even if these data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide the NDA or BLA does not satisfy approval criteria. If the FDA approves the NDA or BLA, the product becomes available for marketing. Product approval may be withdrawn if regulatory compliance is not maintained or safety problems occur. The FDA may require post-marketing studies, also known as Phase 4 studies, as a condition of approval, and Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) requires surveillance programs to monitor approved products that have been commercialized. The agency has the power to require changes in labeling or prohibit further marketing based on the results of post-marketing surveillance. 

Satisfaction of these and other regulatory requirements typically takes several years, and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product. Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of potential products for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures on our activities. We cannot be certain that the FDA or other regulatory agencies will approve any of our products on a timely basis, if at all. Success in preclinical or early-stage clinical trials does not assure success in later-stage clinical trials. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are not 

&#160;

&#160;

always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Even if a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific indications or uses. 

Even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Delays in obtaining, or failures to obtain regulatory approvals would have a material adverse effect on our business. 

The FDA&#146;s policies may change, and additional government regulations may be enacted which could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our potential products. Increased attention to the containment of health care costs worldwide could result in new government regulations materially adverse to our business. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad. 

Section 505(b)(2) NDAs NDAs for most new drug products generally are based on two full clinical studies which must contain substantial evidence of the safety and efficacy of the proposed new product. These applications are submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA. The FDA is, however, authorized to approve an alternative type of NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. This type of application allows the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA's previous findings of safety and efficacy for the active moiety, or published literature, where such studies were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. 

Orphan Drug Act Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the name of the sponsor, identity of the drug or biologic and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not shorten the duration of the regulatory review or approval process, but does provide certain advantages, such as a waiver of Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, fees, enhanced access to FDA staff and potential waiver of pediatric research requirements. 

If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA, to market the same drug or biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the application user fee. A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. 

Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements In the United States, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale and promotion of drug products and medical devices are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the U.S. Department of Justice, state Attorneys General, and other state and local government agencies. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual, or the 

&#160;

&#160;

furnishing, recommending or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. In addition, various states have enacted anti-kickback statues and false claims laws analogous to the False Claims Act. Also, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) created several federal crimes, including healthcare fraud, and false statements relating to the delivery of or payments for healthcare benefits, items or services. HIPAA and its implementing regulations also established uniform federal standards for certain &#147;covered entities&#148; (healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses) governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information. 

Because of the breadth of these and other laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, private &#147;qui tam&#148; actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. 

Competitive Environment The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition. Our competitors include major multi-national pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies developing both generic and proprietary therapies to treat serious diseases. Many of these companies are well-established and possess technical, human, research and development, financial, and sales and marketing resources significantly greater than ours. In addition, many of our potential competitors have formed strategic collaborations, partnerships and other types of joint ventures with larger, well established industry competitors that afford these companies potential research and development and commercialization advantages in the therapeutic areas we are currently pursuing. Companies that currently sell or are developing proprietary products for the prevention and treatment of C. difficile infection include: Actelion Pharmaceutical Ltd., Merck &#38; Co. Inc., Merus B.V., Pfizer Inc., and Sanofi S.A. Companies that currently sell or are developing proprietary products for IBS-C include: Actavis plc, Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc., and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited. Companies that currently sell or are developing proprietary products for pertussis include: GlaxoSmithKline plc, MitsubishiTanabe Pharma Corporation and Sanofi S.A. Companies that sell or are developing products for the treatment of PKU include: BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc., Codexis, Inc. and Synlogic, Inc. 

Academic research centers, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations are also conducting and financing research activities which may produce products directly competitive to those being developed by us. In addition, many of these competitors may be able to obtain patent protection, obtain FDA and other regulatory approvals and begin commercial sales of their products before us. 

Corporate History Our predecessor, Sheffield Pharmaceuticals, Inc., was incorporated in 1986, and in 2006 engaged in a reverse merger with Pipex Therapeutics, Inc., a publicly-traded Delaware corporation formed in 2001.
