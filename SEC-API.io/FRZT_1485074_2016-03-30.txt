 ITEM 1 &#8211; BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Corporate History 

&#160;

We were incorporated as Freeze Tag, Inc. in February 2006 in the State of Delaware. In March 2006, Freeze Tag, LLC, our predecessor which was formed in October 2005, was merged with and into Freeze Tag, Inc. 

&#160;

Business Overview 

&#160;

Freeze Tag, Inc. is a creator of mobile social games that are fun and engaging for all ages. Based on a free-to-play business model that has propelled games built and marketed by some of our competitors to worldwide success, we employ state-of-the-art data analytics and proprietary technology to dynamically optimize the gaming experience for revenue generation. Players can download and enjoy our games for free, or they can purchase virtual items and additional features within the game to increase the fun factor. Our games encourage players to compete and engage with their friends on major social networks such as Facebook and Twitter. Founded by gaming industry veterans, Freeze Tag has launched several successful mobile games including the number one hit series Victorian Mysteries &#210; and Unsolved Mystery Club &#210; , as well as digital entertainment like Etch A Sketch &#210; . Freeze Tag games have been downloaded millions of times on the Apple, Amazon and Google app stores. 

&#160;

Our mission is to design, develop and deliver innovative digital entertainment that surprises and delights. Our products bring families together by providing fun to kids of all ages. We also strive to create a workplace environment where creativity and fun can thrive in a demanding industry. 

&#160;

Business Strategy 

&#160;

In recent years, we have shifted our business strategy to focus our efforts on creating free-to-play social games for the mobile market. We've made this change because we believe that games that are social and mobile will provide the greatest revenue opportunities now and in the foreseeable future. This change in direction has not been an easy one as we've had to deploy resources differently, learn new techniques, and experiment with new game designs and marketing processes. Our financial statements reflect the investment in this new direction in expenses and losses, but we have yet to realize the fruits of our labors on the revenue side of the equation. However, we do believe this strategy will reap the highest returns for the company and its shareholders going forward. 

&#160;

&#160; 3 

&#160; &#160;

We have also announced our intention to grow the Company through acquisition. We feel that the time is right to build an alliance of mobile game developers who can become stronger and more successful by working together to build a company that can leverage market intelligence, development expertise and cross-promotional opportunities to achieve great results for our customers and shareholders. As noted in detail below, we currently do not have any business opportunities or ventures under contemplation for acquisition or merger. In the event we do enter into any such transactions, such transactions will likely be accomplished with shares of our stock and/or in connection with a strategic financial investor, and not with cash directly from us unless and until our cash position improves. 

&#160;

Free-to-play Business Model 

&#160;

The free-to-play business model for games was pioneered on the PC platform and has exploded globally on the mobile platform. The free-to-play model allows users to download and play an enjoyable, but limited, portion of a game for free. If the user wants to access premium features or special virtual items to increase the fun factor, then the user is required to pay, usually $0.99 per feature or item or $0.99 for a bundle of virtual items. For example, if a player has run out of "lives" or "moves" in a game, the player is given two options: 1) Wait for the lives to re-charge which involves waiting but no expense of money or virtual currency; 2) Spend money or virtual currency to buy additional "lives" and keep playing immediately. 

&#160;

In a just a few years, the free-to-play business model has proven to be a very successful model for mobile games. The revenue potential of a game largely depends on the fun-factor of the game and the game creator's proprietary techniques for encouraging the player to make a purchase decision &#8211; without overly offending the player. The potential for rapidly spreading the game through social networks and small in-game purchases can add up to a very sizeable business opportunity. One of the top grossing games since it was launched in 2012, owned and marketed by King Digital, one of our competitors, is called Candy Crush Saga, a seemingly simple game where a user combines 3 or more color candies on a puzzle board to get points. Think Gaming, a service that analyzes and consults to mobile "freemium" game makers, publishers and investors, estimates that Candy Crush Saga grossed over $425,000 per day in 2015, or over $150 million per year, with a lifetime user revenue of merely $3.00 from in-game purchases. 

&#160;

Candy Crush Saga Estimated Revenue 

(Source: ThinkGaming.com) 

&#160;

While the success of Candy Crush Saga illustrates the potential market of so called "free-to-play" games, we have no relationship with King Digital or any of its games, and cannot expect and cannot predict that any of our launched games or games in development can have anywhere close to the success of games of our competitors. We have historically been unable to break even, much less ever enjoyed success of a game that generates multi-millions of dollars in revenues. Nevertheless, our business model is to attempt to develop and launch successful games. However, there is no expectation or assurance that we ever can do so. 

&#160;

&#160; 4 

&#160; &#160;

In the future, we plan on the majority of Freeze Tag's mobile games to be based on the free-to-play model. In addition, we believe that games are more fun with friends, so we connect our players with major social networks such as Facebook and Twitter to enhance the games' addictiveness, enjoyment and world-of-mouth referrals. In executing our business model, we have previously employed a proprietary game engine and real-time data analytics to dynamically optimize the gaming experience for revenue generation. In the future, we plan to continue to employ our game engine, but in an effort to more quickly develop games by using outside studios and outside talent, we have made a shift to developing games using the Unity Development platform. Unity (www.unity3d.com) has become the development platform of choice for many game studios, and allows us to quickly access additional talent in game development. We will also utilize other technologies in their native development environment (such as HTML5) as circumstances dictate. This shift will allow us to find the best development teams, engineering teams, and partners to help us quickly deploy our games. 

&#160;

Explosive Growth for Mobile Games 

&#160;

According to a 2013 report from Newzoo (a global market research firm with a primary focus on games), in 2013 the mobile games market generated $12.3 billion, or 17.4% of all global game revenues. By 2016, mobile games are forecast to account for 27.8% of global game revenues, or $23.9 billion, translating into a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.3%. This is almost four times higher than the game industry as a whole (6.7%), which includes traditional blockbuster titles such as Grand Theft Auto, Call of Duty and Super Mario. 

&#160;

&#160;

According to Newzoo, there are 5 key reasons why the mobile game segment has and will continue to experience impressive growth. 

&#160;

Two Screens &#8211; As it turns out, consumers view smartphones and tablets as having their own right of existence. They play games on both devices, which increases their play time and fuels the mobile games segment simultaneously on more than one screen. 

&#160;

Accessibility &#8211; Gaming on mobile screens is pushing time spent on games up dramatically as consumers can play at anytime and anywhere. 

&#160;

Global reach &#8211; As smartphones and tablets penetrate every corner of the world, developers can launch titles into any country they choose. Countries that were previously hard to penetrate are now appearing on the opportunity radar. 

&#160;

Free-to-play &#8211; It is the dominant business model for mobile taking over 90% of global revenues. 

&#160;

Hardware innovation &#8211; Driven by fierce competition, the pace of innovation on smartphones and tablets goes unmatched. This continuously provides developers with new opportunities as consumer's interest in purchasing new devices fuels their consumption of new applications, and gaming is the number one category of applications new device owners download. 

&#160;

&#160; &#160;

A Truly Global Market 

&#160;

With the ability to play games anytime and anywhere on powerful smartphones and tablets running primarily Apple iOS or Google Android, the mobile game market is truly a scalable global business opportunity. 

&#160;

These 2013 market statistics from Newzoo describe a very exciting and growing global mobile game market: 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Of the 1.2 billion gamers worldwide, 966 million, or 78%, already play mobile games.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

368 million consumers worldwide, or 38% of all mobile gamers, spend a monthly average of $2.78 on or in mobile games. By 2016, it is forecast these figures will amount to, respectively, 50% and $3.07.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

With 48% of the global revenue, the Asia-Pacific region is by far the biggest market for mobile games.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Western &#38; Eastern Europe will grow fastest with compound annual growth rates (CAGR) of over 33%.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Average monthly spend per paying mobile gamer is highest in Western Europe with $4.40. In comparison, in North America this figure stands at $3.87, with however the highest share of payers amongst players worldwide (45%).

Mobile Games Market to Double in Size 

(Source: http://www.newzoo.com/insights/infographic-mobile-games-market-to-double-in-size-until-2016-and-reach-23-9bn/) 

&#160;

&#160; 6 

&#160; &#160;

The Female Player 

&#160;

The explosive growth of the mobile games market can be partly attributed to a relative increase in the number of female players. Gaming is historically a male dominated market with action-based games. But the modern female with disposable income, a smartphone and time on her hands has changed everything. This market development has opened the door wide for a previously niche category of games referred to as "casual" games. Candy Crush Saga is an example of a casual game, and clearly, this is no longer a niche category. 

&#160;

&#160;

The Freeze Tag Strategy 

&#160;

In targeting the global market for mobile games, we are highly focused on developing mobile social games that are casual, fun and engaging for all ages and gender. The free-to-play business model combined with the use of best-in-class development environments (be it the Freeze Tag Game Engine, Unity3D, or Native HTML5 or other technology) and Analytics and Deployment tools, allows us to systematically launch, optimize and monetize our games. We design our games to be never ending entertainment that our users will enjoy playing and be willing to pay us $0.99 or more from time-to-time for special features and virtual items to keep having fun. We believe that the free-to-play model should not be run as a sprint but rather as a marathon. Over the span of several months, or even years, each game is continuously subject to this optimization process to increase user enjoyment and financial return to the company. 

&#160;

Distribution and Marketing 

&#160;

We market, sell and distribute our games primarily through direct-to-consumer digital storefronts, such as Apple's App Store, the Google Play Store and Amazon's App Store. In addition to publishing our smartphone games on direct-to-consumer digital storefronts, we also publish some of our titles on other platforms, such as the Facebook App Store, the Mac App Store and PC Download portals such as Big Fish Games and Gamehouse. 

&#160;

&#160; 7 

&#160; &#160;

The fragmentation in the Android platform continues to drive porting costs to new levels. Porting costs relate to expenses incurred in changing our games so that they can operate on other hardware and software platforms. For this reason, we usually launch our new titles on the iOS platform first to save the trouble and expense of porting over and over again on multiple devices. Once a game is tuned properly on the iOS platform, then we will invest the time and effort necessary to port the title to the Android platform. Our porting efforts will be reduced somewhat, as we employ the use of the Unity3D Game Engine to do our development work. We do not envision the fragmentation of the Android market to change any time soon, so we anticipate that we will continue to incur porting costs and evaluate business opportunities on the various Android storefronts on a case-by-case basis. 

&#160;

User Acquisition 

&#160;

In the free-to-play business model, a constant stream of new players is necessary to be successful. So, we have partnered with advertising networks and lead generation companies such as Supersonic, Badge Media, Tapjoy, Ad Colony and Facebook (to name a few). We also employ data analytics to determine which creative messages and which lead referral sources are bringing in the most players who spend money in our games. 

&#160;

To help reduce the cost of acquiring downloads, we have embedded social networking mechanisms into our games to enable our best customers to do the marketing for us. Every time a satisfied player invites her friend to play one of our games, we have been introduced to a new potential customer without incurring a cost to entice that player to download the game. We will continue to design methods to encourage our players to invite their friends and spread the word about our games. Each time a user downloads one of our games from a friend referral without a direct expense from us, our user acquisition cost is lower, and therefore our profitability is potentially higher. 

&#160;

Technology and Tools 

&#160;

Free-to-play Revenue Model 

&#160;

The game industry, like many other forms of entertainment (music, TV, books, etc.) is undergoing a major shift. The free-to-play business model increased in appeal to game players of every genre and platform. Nowhere has this been felt more deeply than the mobile market. Free is a very powerful marketing approach that is irresistible to game players. The top grossing charts on popular mobile app stores like Apple, Google, and Amazon continually show that "free" games earn the most revenue for their developers. So with all this "free-ness," how does a game creator make any money? 

&#160;

Optimizing Customer Lifetime Value 

&#160;

The key business metric of any free-to-play game is the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV). A free-to-play gamer starts out as a zero revenue customer, but he or she may become a paying customer throughout the customer's life of playing the game. The game creator's business is an ongoing engagement with the game players to get them to buy things in the game, without ruining the fun. Optimizing this delicate balance is where the most revenue can be extracted. 

&#160;

&#160; &#160;

The following graphic, developed by XEODesign identifies the approach to creating free-to-play games that are fun and engaging to consumers. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 9 

&#160; &#160;

There are many techniques for generating free-to-play revenue. They range from a simple static "pay to access more levels" model to a more dynamic model where player behaviors are systematically analyzed to strategically introduce purchase options to help the user enjoy more of the game. Freeze Tag dynamically optimizes a game's CLV by integrating two important elements: (1) Data Analytics and (2) a Dynamic Game Engine (whether it be the Freeze Tag Game Engine, Unity3D, or other native development environment). 

&#160;

This combination allows us to optimize the features of our games to refresh and update the content so that players are happily engaged and invite their friends to play with them. When players invite their friends, they lower our user acquisition costs. The longer and more often players come back to play, the more likely they are to spend money on virtual goods (through in-game purchases). The net result is a customer with a greater lifetime value. The happier customers are, the more they share with their friends and the more often they come back to spend money. Everything we do is geared to our players having more fun because ultimately customer fun translates into revenue. 

&#160;

Data Analytics 

&#160;

By using commercial and proprietary data analytics tools, we analyze various aspects of the game across the entire pool of players to determine what modifications can be made to the game, which allows us to: (1) make it more fun, and (2) induce a purchase. 

&#160;

Some of the analysis we perform regularly are: 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Analyze the number of users that complete the tutorial process

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Identify the Day 1, Day 7, and Day 30 retention metrics of how many players are returning to play

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Quantify the ARPDAU (average revenue per daily active user) to determine the monetization effectiveness of each game

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Determine the percentage of overall users that are converting to spenders

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Quantify the ARPPDAU (average revenue per paying daily active user)

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Determine what parts of the game users are playing most

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Identify where in the game users are dropping out, and find out why

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Average play time per day and per session

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Importance of social networks, like Facebook and Twitter, to the game and how many players login to social networks

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Frequency of users playing against friends

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Identify what events most correlate with purchase events

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Identify how many invites a user is sending out, how long it takes them to send the first invite out, and how many of those players are coming in.

&#160; 

Dynamic Game Engine(s) 

&#160;

Over the years, we have developed a proprietary dynamic game engine (Freeze Tag Engine) that allows us to make changes to game play and game economies on-the-fly, in most cases, without requiring the download of another update. We also integrate several business analytics packages, and other key game management tools into our games that provide us with real time data to measure detailed player behavior, and respond directly to that behavior. Starting in 2014 and continuing forward, we have also begun to use the Unity3D Development Engine ( www.unity3d.com ). We have optimized and are continuing to optimize this engine in many of the same ways that our own engine was optimized. Using Unity3D has allowed us to shift from focus on developing our own engine to acquiring and allocating our resources mainly on game development. 

&#160;

&#160; 10 

&#160; &#160;

Platform Portability - Dynamic Game Engine(s) 

&#160;

Over the years, the Freeze Tag Game Engine has allowed us to the ability to port across multiple platforms using a single codebase. In 2015, and now into 2016, we continue to look to contract with outside teams and outside contractors, allowing us to maintain a smaller internal team. In 2015, we also made the decision to switch a larger portion of our development efforts to a different engine (Unity3D was our choice), one that was widely used, and one that we could draw from a larger pool of talent to quickly develop games. Unity3D also offers platform portability, with the ability to build games that can quickly be ported to iOS, Android, Mac, PC, and HTML5 (still limited). Throughout all of 2015 and into the foreseeable future, all of our products were and will be created using the Unity game engine. 

&#160;

As we continue our development efforts in 2016, our approach is to review the technical requirements of the game we want to develop, then make a decision as to which Game Engine is the most appropriate to implement for that development effort. Currently, we are using Unity3D for most of our efforts, and for the foreseeable future, we will continue to use Unity. 

&#160;

As we make decisions about which Game Engine to employ, here are a few of the things that we look to have: 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

A single codebase that can be easily ported to other platforms

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Ability to "bolt on" other technologies and codes to easily integrate with other SDK's, platforms and special needs

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Interface easily with scalable backend databases and architecture

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Easily localized into new languages

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Updates can be pushed to the game allowing us to change things like:

&#160;

&#160;

o

adding new characters

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

o 

changing the values in the economy

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

o 

updating text

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

o 

messaging users (in game) about new features

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

o 

instigating a social network based contest

&#160; 

Integrated Feedback Mechanisms 

&#160;

In addition, we aim to integrate feedback mechanisms into our games to provide incentive for our players to communicate their favorite features and any technical difficulties they may be experiencing. By combining dynamic gaming technology and data analytics into one integrated business process, we can optimize the "fun" factor for our players and maximize our revenue potential. 

&#160;

Product Development 

&#160;

We have learned that establishing and following a fairly rigid process is essential to producing commercially successful products, regardless of the platform. The process all begins with the creative development process. The chart below describes the approach we use to filter ideas and make final decisions on which games we will actually produce. After choosing the game that we will focus on, we write a detailed design document. A thorough design document ensures that all of those involved in the creation of the game have a common reference source throughout the production process. Also critical to producing high quality games, a test plan accompanies every design document. Not only do we test for bugs, but also we test the game for usability. Since most casual gamers do not want to read instructions, it is critical that the finished game be easy to play by just tapping at objects on the screen. 

&#160;

&#160; 11 

&#160; &#160;

&#160;

As a developer of mobile social games, we have developed expertise in three core aspects of game production. These core competencies help to give us a competitive advantage in the industry. They are listed below, with the resulting benefit also identified. 

&#160;

1. Create High Quality Products (including art and sound assets). Benefit: Provides high value to distribution partners and consumers, resulting in increased downloads and purchases.

2. Maintain Flexible Engineering Tools and Processes. Benefit: Decreases time-to-market delivery of products.

3. Minimize Risk by doing the following: 1) selecting proven genres, 2) keeping development costs low, and 3) modifying designs "on the fly" based on consumer feedback. Benefit: Increases the number of games released per year and decreases reliance on any one title's success, ultimately improving return on investment for each game.

&#160;

How Long Does it Take to Develop a Mobile Social Game? 

&#160;

Shifting our strategy from traditional game development to the free-to-play model has had a dramatic impact on the way we view the development cycle. In the past, we would look at a game as having four distinct steps: design, production, test, and launch. In the free-to-play environment, the production of a game never stops. Instead of launching a finished and polished game, we introduce a beta version into test markets, capture live data, make adjustments and release updates on a regular basis. In the free-to-play business model, the players must stay engaged over long periods of time for the developer to earn revenue. The majority of players who use free-to-play games do not make any purchases, but they are an important part of the ecosystem because they do invite their friends to play, many of whom may pay for in-app purchases to further their progress or "win" against their friends. To keep these players engaged over time, we must constantly update the game, adding new features and content, providing many reasons for the faithful players to keep coming back over and over again to spend time playing our game. The more time spent, the more likely those players are to buy virtual goods, which is one of the main methods a free-to-play game earns revenue. The other method is through showing advertisements during game play which earn money for the developer based on the cost per impression or cost per install measurement technique. 

&#160;

&#160; 12 

&#160; &#160;

From a technology standpoint, we use a development methodology referred to as "agile development," which focuses on short development and feedback cycles, leading to shortened development times. Because of this, our costs are reduced, and the availability of an almost unlimited number of engineers and programmers makes our development time shorter than most development studios. We use technologies (such as our own Freeze Tag Game Engine and Unity3D) that allow us to build games that will run on multiple platforms, including Apple iOS, Android, Facebook, PC and other opportunities. 

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The business of mobile games is very competitive. New products are introduced frequently and the platforms and devices change rapidly. To be successful in this crowded marketplace, we have to entice consumers to play our games based on the quality and "fun" of the experience. Players evaluate our games based on the game play, graphics quality, the music and sound effects and the efficiency and clarity of our software engineering and user interface design. 

&#160;

We compete with a continually increasing number of successful mobile game companies, including Glu (GLUU), King.com (KING), Kabam, Big Fish Games, DeNA, Gameloft, GREE, GungHo Online Entertainment, Nexon, Zynga (ZYNG), Rovio, Storm 8/Team Lava, Supercell and others. We also compete with traditional game companies who have mobile game divisions such as Activision, Electronic Arts, Square Enix, Take Two Interactive, Ubisoft, and more. 

&#160;

In addition, given the open nature of the development and distribution for mobile devices, we also compete or will compete with a vast number of small companies and individuals who are able to create and launch games and other content for these devices using relatively limited resources and with relatively limited start-up time or expertise. As evidenced by the recent Flappy Bird phenomenon, it is possible for a one-man development team to build and launch a game that is able to achieve millions of downloads. 

&#160;

Some of our competitors and our potential competitors have one or more advantages over us, either globally or in particular geographic markets, which include: 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

significantly greater financial resources;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

greater experience with the free-to-play games and games-as-a-service (GAAS) business models and more effective game monetization;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

more substantial intellectual property of their own from which they can develop games without having to pay royalties;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

better overall economies of scale;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

greater platform-specific focus, experience and expertise; and

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

broader global distribution and presence.

&#160;

&#160; 13 

&#160; &#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

Our intellectual property is an essential element of our business. We use a combination of trademark, patent, copyright, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, confidentiality agreements and license agreements to protect our intellectual property. We have also registered a number of domain names, which we believe will be important to the branding and success of our games. Our employees and independent contractors are required to sign agreements acknowledging that all inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments and other processes generated by them on our behalf are our property, and assigning to us any ownership that they may claim in those works. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use without consent intellectual property that we own or license. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties, and the expenses incurred in protecting our intellectual property rights, may adversely affect our business. 

&#160;

We intend to register ownership of software copyrights in the United States as well as seek registration of various trademarks associated with the Company's name and mobile social games that we will develop. 

&#160;

Wherever possible, we own registered trademark protection for properties we develop. As the digital markets evolve, there are and will continue to be many competitors who will imitate successful game properties. We are investing in trademark protection to create game brands and protect them. For example, we have received approval from the United States Patent and Trademark office to register Party Animals &#210; , Unsolved Mystery &#210; , Unsolved Mystery Club &#210; , Ancient Astronauts &#210; , Victorian Mysteries &#210; , Grimm Reaper &#210; and Rocket Weasel &#210; for all gaming platforms. These marks will assist us in defending against copycats who may try to incorporate these terms into their game titles. 

&#160;

From time to time, we may encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. While we believe that our product and service offerings do not infringe the intellectual property rights of any third party, we cannot be assured that we will prevail in any intellectual property dispute. If we do not prevail in such disputes, we may lose some or all of our intellectual property protection, be enjoined from further sales of the applications determined to infringe the rights of others, and/or be forced to pay substantial royalties to a third party. 

&#160;

Partner Publishing 

&#160;

Another initiative we began in 2015 and will continue to pursue in 2016 is to partner with developers who have completed the production of a game. Occasionally, developers complete production of a free-to-play game but lack the experience in fine tuning the game or lack the funds to promote the game to build a user base. We believe that we can offer significant value to game developers through our experience in tuning free-to-play games to increase key performance indicators such as retention, monetization and engagement. We see partnering with game developers who lack the expertise or funds for user acquisition as an opportunity to increase our revenue and the revenue of our partners. 

&#160;

Business Acquisitions 

&#160;

In addition to our current operations, we propose to seek, investigate and, if warranted, acquire an interest in one or more businesses. However, as of the date hereof, we have no business opportunities or ventures under contemplation for acquisition or merger. We propose to investigate potential opportunities, particularly focusing upon existing privately held businesses whose owners are willing to consider merging their businesses into our company in order to establish a public trading market for their common stock, and whose managements are willing to operate the acquired businesses as divisions or subsidiaries of our company. The businesses we acquire may or may not need an injection of cash to facilitate their future operations. Presently, if we acquire any businesses we envision such acquisition being completed either with our shares of our stock or with the assistance of a strategic funding partner. We currently do not have substantial funds, or a revenue stream, to make acquisitions utilizing our cash. 

&#160;

&#160; &#160;

We are primarily interested in other technology opportunities, but we currently do not intend to restrict our search for investment opportunities to any particular industry or geographical location and may, therefore, engage in essentially any business. Our executive officers will review material furnished to them by the proposed merger or acquisition candidates and will ultimately decide if a merger or acquisition is in our best interests and the interests of our shareholders. We intend to source business opportunities through our officers and directors and their contacts. Those contacts include professional advisors such as attorneys and accountants, securities broker dealers, venture capitalists, members of the financial community, other businesses and others who may present solicited and unsolicited proposals. Management believes that business opportunities and ventures may become available to it due to a number of factors, including, among others: (1) management's willingness to consider a wide variety of businesses; (2) management's contacts and acquaintances; and (3) our flexibility with respect to the manner in which we may be able to structure, finance, merge with or acquire any business opportunity. 

&#160;

The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of our executive officers and directors. Inasmuch as we will have limited funds available to search for business opportunities and ventures, we will not be able to expend significant funds on a complete and exhaustive investigation of such business or opportunity. We will, however, investigate, to the extent believed reasonable by our management, such potential business opportunities or ventures by conducting a so-called "due diligence investigation". 

&#160;

In a so-called "due diligence investigation", we intend to obtain and review materials regarding the business opportunity. Typically such materials will include information regarding a target business' products, services, contracts, management, ownership, and financial information. In addition, we intend to cause our officers or agents to meet personally with management and key personnel of target businesses, ask questions regarding our prospects, tour facilities, and conduct other reasonable investigation of the target business to the extent of our limited financial resources and management and technical expertise. 

&#160;

Our Employees 

&#160;

We have 10 employees and/or contractors, 2 of which are our officers, 7 of which are engaged in art production, publishing and development, and 1 of which is engaged in administrative functions. We have a team of over 40 engineers, artists, and developers available to us on an independent contract basis around the world.
