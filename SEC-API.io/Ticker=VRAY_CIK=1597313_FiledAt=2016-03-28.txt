 Item 1. BUSINESS

Corporate Information

We were incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada on September 6, 2013 under the name &#8220;Mirax Corp&#8221;. Prior to the Merger and Split-Off (each as defined below), we were in the business of selling cell phone cases to retailers.

On July 8, 2015, we completed a 1.185763-for-1 forward stock split of our common stock in the form of a dividend with the result that 4,343,339 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, outstanding immediately prior to the stock split became 5,150,176 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, outstanding immediately thereafter. On July 15, 2015, we changed our name to ViewRay, Inc. by filing the Certificate of Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation. Additionally, on July 21, 2015, we changed our domicile from the State of Nevada to the State of Delaware by reincorporation, or the Conversion, and as a result of the Conversion, increased our authorized capital stock from 75,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, to 300,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share and 10,000,000 shares of &#8220;blank check&#8221; preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share. Upon effectiveness of the Conversion, our corporate matters and affairs ceased to be governed by the Nevada Revised Statutes and became subject to the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. All share and per share numbers in this Report relating to our common stock have been adjusted to give effect to this forward stock split and the Conversion, unless otherwise stated. On July 23, 2015, we amended and restated our certificate of incorporation by filing the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and adopted the Amended and Restated Bylaws.

On July 23, 2015, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Vesuvius Acquisition Corp., a corporation formed in the State of Delaware on July 16, 2015, or the Acquisition Sub, merged with and into ViewRay Technologies, Inc., a corporation incorporated in 2004 in the State of Florida originally under the name of ViewRay Incorporated, subsequently reincorporated in the State of Delaware in 2007. Pursuant to this transaction, or the Merger, ViewRay Technologies, Inc. was the surviving corporation and became our wholly-owned subsidiary. All of the outstanding capital stock of ViewRay Technologies, Inc. was converted into shares of our common stock, as described in more detail below.

Immediately prior to the closing of the Merger, under the terms of a split-off agreement, or the Split-Off Agreement, and a general release agreement, the Company transferred all of its pre-Merger operating assets and liabilities to its wholly-owned special-purpose subsidiary, Mirax Enterprise Corp., a Nevada corporation, or the Split-Off Subsidiary, formed on July 16, 2015. Thereafter, pursuant to the Split-Off Agreement, the Company transferred all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Split-Off Subsidiary to the pre-Merger majority stockholder of the Company, and the former sole officer and director of the Company, in consideration of and in exchange for (i) the surrender and cancellation of an aggregate of 4,150,171 shares of our common stock and (ii) certain representations, covenants and indemnities, together referred to as the Split-Off.

As a result of the Merger and Split-Off, we discontinued our pre-Merger business, acquired the business of ViewRay Technologies, Inc. and continue the business operations of ViewRay Technologies, Inc. as a publicly-traded company under the name ViewRay, Inc.

On August 17, 2015, we completed the third and final closing of a private placement offering, or the Private Placement, through which we sold an aggregate of 5,884,504 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $5.00 per share and raised a total of $26.3 million, net of offering costs. 

The Merger was accounted for as a reverse-merger and recapitalization. ViewRay Technologies, Inc. was the acquirer for financial reporting purposes, and ViewRay, Inc. was the acquired company under the acquisition method. Consequently, the assets, liabilities and operations that were reflected in the historical consolidated financial statements prior to the Merger became those of ViewRay Technologies, Inc. and were recorded at the historical cost basis, and the consolidated financial statements after completion of the Merger included the assets, liabilities and results of operations of ViewRay Technologies, Inc. up to the day prior to the closing of the Merger and the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the combined company from and after the closing date of the Merger in this and all future filings with the SEC.

Also on July 23, 2015, we changed our fiscal year from a fiscal year ending on November 30 of each year, which was used in our most recent annual report filed with the SEC, to one ending on December 31 of each year, which is the fiscal year end of ViewRay Technologies, Inc.

We continue to be a &#8220;smaller reporting company,&#8221; as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the &#8220;Exchange Act,&#8221; following the Merger. As a result of the Merger we have ceased to be a &#8220;shell company&#8221; (as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act).

&#160;

&#160;

As used in this Report henceforward, unless other wise stated or the context clearly indicates otherwise, the terms the &#8220;Company,&#8221; the &#8220;Registrant,&#8221; &#8220;ViewRay,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; refer to ViewRay, Inc., incorporated in Delaware, after giving effect to the Merger and the Split-Off. 

ViewRay, Inc. is the sole stockholder of ViewRay Technologies, Inc., which commenced operations as a Florida corporation in 2004, subsequently reincorporated in Delaware in in 2007, and changed its name to ViewRay Technologies, Inc. in July 2015.

Our authorized capital stock currently consists of 300,000,000 shares of common stock, and 10,000,000 shares of the preferred stock. As of the date of this report, our common stock is quoted on the OTC Markets, OTCQB tier of OTC Markets Group Inc., under the symbol &#8220;VRAY,&#8221; which changed from &#8220;MRXC&#8221; on July 20, 2015. We have been conditionally approved to list our common stock on The NASDAQ Global Market, or NASDAQ, which we anticipate will occur on or about March 31, 2016.

Company Overview

We design, manufacture and market MRIdian, the first and only MRI-guided radiation therapy system that images and treats cancer patients simultaneously. MRI is a broadly used imaging tool which has the ability to differentiate between types of soft tissue clearly, unlike X-ray or computed tomography, or CT, the most commonly used imaging technologies in radiation therapy today. MRIdian integrates MRI technology, radiation delivery and our proprietary software to locate, target and track the position and shape of soft-tissue tumors while radiation is delivered. These capabilities allow MRIdian to deliver radiation to the tumor accurately while delivering less radiation to healthy tissue than existing radiation therapy treatments. We believe this innovation leads to improved patient outcomes and reduced side effects from off-target radiation delivery. We received 510(k) marketing clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for MRIdian in May 2012 and have the right to affix the CE mark to MRIdian since November 2014. There were four MRIdian systems installed in the United States and one MRIdian system installed in Seoul, South Korea as of December 31, 2015. 

Cancer is a leading cause of death globally and the second leading cause of death in the United States. Radiation therapy is a common method used to treat cancer that uses lethal doses of ionizing energy to damage genetic material in cells. Nearly two-thirds of all treated cancer patients in the United States will receive some form of radiation therapy during the course of their illness, according to estimates by the American Society for Radiation Oncology, or ASTRO. In 2013, IMV Medical Information Division, Inc., or IMV, reported that 93% of patients receiving radiation therapy in the United States were treated by a linear accelerator, or linac. The global linac market was $2.8 billion in 2011 and was expected to grow to $3.7 billion by 2016 according to a 2012 Markets and Markets report. IAEA Human Health Campus reported that there are over 11,000 linacs installed at over 7,500 centers worldwide. We believe the addressable market for MRIdian is the annual market for linacs due to MRIdian&#8217;s ability to treat a broad spectrum of disease sites. However, we believe that MRIdian may be used more frequently for complex cancer cases that may be difficult to treat on a standard linac due to the location of the tumor in relation to the surrounding soft tissues. We currently estimate the annual market for linacs to be 1,100 units per year globally, the majority of which are replacement units.

Despite the prevalence of MRI for diagnostic purposes and its ability to image soft tissue clearly, the radiation therapy industry has been unable to integrate MRI into external-beam radiation therapy systems. Existing radiation therapy systems use X-ray-based imaging technologies, such as CT, which cannot differentiate between types of soft tissue or provide an accurate visualization of a tumor and its position in relation to critical organs. In addition, existing systems that offer imaging during the course of a treatment are limited by the rate at which they can image due to the level of radiation to which they expose the patient. These constraints make it difficult for a clinician to locate a tumor accurately, track its motion in real-time or adapt treatment as anatomy changes. It is very difficult to irradiate a tumor while minimizing the amount of radiation hitting critical organs without the ability to see the tumor&#8217;s exact location and shape. If a tumor is insufficiently irradiated, it may not respond to treatment, resulting in a lower probability of survival for the patient. If organs and other healthy soft tissues are irradiated, side effects can be severe, including organ failure and secondary cancers.

MRIdian is a next-generation, radiation therapy solution that enables treatment and real-time imaging of a patient&#8217;s anatomy simultaneously. The high-quality images that it generates clearly differentiate the targeted tumor, surrounding soft tissue and nearby critical organs. MRIdian also records the level of radiation dose that the treatment area has received, enabling physicians to adapt the prescription between treatments as needed. We believe this improved visualization and accurate dose recording will enable better treatment, improve patient outcomes and reduce side effects. Key benefits to users and patients include improved imaging and patient alignment, on-table adaptive treatment planning, motion management and an accurate recording of the delivered radiation dose. 

&#160;

&#160;

Physicians have already used MRIdian to treat a broad spectrum of radiation therapy patients with more than 20 different types of cancer, as well as patients for whom radiation therapy was previously not an option. 

In March 2016, we announced the development of a linear accelerator version of our MRIdian technology. To date, we have demonstrated certain milestones in the development of this combined MRI and linac technology, including human imaging testing, delivery of radiation beams in a magnetic field using a linear accelerator and modification of the treatment planning system to incorporate linac technology. We are in the process of preparing marketing applications for submission in 2016 for 510(k) marketing clearance by the FDA and for CE marking in the European Union, as required for commercial launch of this technology. We believe the MRIdian linac technology, when commercially available, will broaden our addressable market, accelerate our sales cycle, accelerate backlog conversion time and improve gross margins.

We currently market MRIdian through a direct sales force in the United States and distributors in the rest of the world. At December 31, 2015, we had five MRIdian systems installed and had 15 signed orders for new systems for a backlog value of $84.4 million. We generated revenue of $10.4 million, $6.4 million and $3.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and had net losses of $45.0 million, $33.8 million and $27.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Cancer and Radiation Therapy Market

Incidence of Cancer

Cancer is a leading cause of death globally and the second leading cause of death in the United States behind cardiovascular disease. According to the American Cancer Society, approximately 1.6 million people were expected to be diagnosed with cancer in the United States during 2014 and approximately 0.6 million were expected to die from cancer, accounting for nearly one of every four deaths. As a result of a growing and aging population, the World Health Organization&#8217;s, or WHO, Global Initiative for Cancer Registry Development estimates that the number of new cancer cases worldwide will grow from 14.1 million in 2008 to 19.3 million in 2025.

Cancer Therapy

The primary goal of cancer therapy is to kill cancerous tissues while minimizing damage to healthy tissues. There are three main ways to treat cancer: surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. Surgery attempts to physically remove the tumor from the body, while minimizing trauma to healthy tissue and preventing the spread or translocation of the disease to other parts of the body. Surgery is particularly effective because the surgeon can directly observe the tumor and surrounding healthy tissue throughout the course of the procedure and adapt his or her plan mid-procedure accordingly. Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells. Unlike surgery, most forms of chemotherapy circulate systemically to reach cancer cells almost anywhere in the body. Chemotherapy is most effective at destroying microscopic levels of disease. Radiation is used to damage genetic material in cells with a lethal dose of ionizing energy. Effective radiation therapy balances destroying cancer cells with minimizing damage to normal cells. It can be used at high doses to ablate a tumor, an effect similar to surgery, or at moderate doses to target local microscopic disease, as is done with chemotherapy. Other, more recently developed ways of treating cancer include hormone therapy and targeted therapy, such as immunotherapy.

Radiation Therapy

Radiation therapy has become widespread, with nearly two-thirds of all treated cancer patients in the United States receiving some form of radiation therapy during the course of their treatment, according to estimates by ASTRO. For most cancer types treated with radiation therapy, at least 75% of the patients are treated with the intent to cure the cancer. For lung and brain cancers, that number is somewhat lower, with 59% of lung cancer patients and 50% of brain cancer patients being treated with the goal of curing cancer. The remainder of cases are treated with palliative intent to relieve pain. Radiation therapy is a non-invasive outpatient procedure with little or no recovery time and can be used on patients who are inoperable. According to IMV, 93% of patients receiving radiation therapy in the United States are treated using a linac.

Radiation is used to kill cancer cells primarily by damaging their DNA, but can also kill healthy cells in the same way or cause them to become cancerous themselves. As a result, the goal of curative radiation therapy is to balance delivery of a sufficiently high dose of radiation to a tumor to kill the cancer cells while, at the same time, minimizing damage to healthy cells, particularly those in critical organs. Normal cells are better able to repair themselves after radiation than tumor cells, so doses of radiation are often fractionated, or delivered in separate sessions with rest periods in between. As a result, standard radiation therapy is often given once a day, five times a week, for one to seven weeks. In 2012, patients made an estimated 20.9 million radiation therapy treatment visits in the United States.

&#160;

&#160;

Radiation Therapy Equipment Market 

The global linac market was $2.8 billion in 2011 and was expected to grow to $3.7 billion by 2016 according to a 2012 Markets and Markets report. According to IAEA Human Health Campus, there are 11,000 linacs installed at over 7,500 centers worldwide. In the United States, there are 3,800 linacs installed at over 2,500 centers. The annual market for linacs is estimated to be 1,100 units per year globally, the majority of which are replacement units.

In the radiation therapy market, new technologies have historically been adopted at a rapid rate. According to IMV, the percentage of centers performing intensity modulated radiation therapy, or IMRT, grew from 30% in 2002 to 96% in 2012. The percentage of sites utilizing image guided radiation therapy, or IGRT, grew more quickly: from 15% in 2004 to 83% in 2012. The majority of IGRT uses on-board X-ray systems. As leading cancer centers adopt and study MRI-guided radiation therapy, we believe that our next-generation system will also follow a rapid adoption curve among the broader linac replacement market.

Radiation Therapy Treatment Process

Following diagnosis of the disease state, radiation treatment generally consists of the following steps:

&#160;

&#183; 

Imaging and tumor contouring. To design the treatment plan, physicians obtain initial images of the tumor. This is done most commonly using a CT scan, often supplemented by an MRI, a positron emission tomography, or PET, scan, or both. These images, also known as simulation scans, are then imported into a treatment planning software system and aligned to each other. Based on clinical experience, a physician will manually draw, or contour, specific areas on the aligned images to characterize the location and extent of the tumor highlighting the following: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Gross tumor volume, or GTV, a volumetric region encompassing the visible tumor. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Clinical target volume, or CTV, a larger area encompassing the GTV, where the cancer may have already or may be likely to spread. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Planning target volume, or PTV, a further enlarged area to allow for inexact imaging, patient movement during treatment or tumor movement between planning and treatment. The PTV may be sized multiple times larger than the CTV, risking radiation damage to healthy tissue, including in many cases critical organs. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Treatment planning and dose prescription. Once the clinician has a three-dimensional map of the tumor, surrounding healthy tissues and nearby critical organs, a physician determines a treatment plan using one of the methods below. Creation of these plans typically takes one to two weeks. A typical curative radiation therapy treatment dose will be delivered over the course of several weeks with 10 to 35 radiation therapy sessions, referred to as fractions, lasting from a few minutes to an hour or more depending on the treatment plan. 

&#160;

&#183; 

3D-CRT planning. Using a method called three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy, or 3D-CRT, a clinician will decide what beam angles and shapes to use to target a tumor and how long each beam will irradiate it. A computer will then calculate the potential dose delivered, and a clinician will manually adjust the plan to arrive at an acceptable dose. 

&#160;

&#183; 

IMRT planning. Using a method called intensity modulated radiation therapy, or IMRT, a physician will use computer software to optimize a treatment plan to achieve a more precise dose distribution than 3D-CRT by using thousands of beamlets, IMRT has been shown to result in better patient outcomes than 3D-CRT. 

&#160;

&#183; 

SRS and SBRT planning. Stereotactic radiosurgery, or SRS, and stereotactic body radiation therapy, or SBRT, are methods of delivery using 3D-CRT or IMRT designed to deliver high doses of precisely targeted radiation in a reduced number of sessions, usually one to five fractions. SRS is used in brain and spine applications, and has been shown to be particularly effective in those areas, while SBRT is used in the rest of the body, and has been shown to be particularly effective in early-stage lung cancer. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Alignment. Prior to radiation delivery, clinicians typically take images to assist with patient alignment. Most systems use a form of on-board CT called cone-beam CT to image, which delivers inferior contrast and a higher radiation dose than diagnostic CT. A less commonly used imaging technology is fluoroscopy, a real-time 2D X-ray system that can expose a patient to even higher doses of radiation than cone-beam CT. Because of the limited soft tissue contrast of X-ray-based imaging, clinicians often use registration markers such as nearby bone structures or surgically implanted fiducial markers to align patients with the treatment beams. Patients may also be immobilized by restraining devices, or techniques such as respiratory control or abdominal compression, which are employed to minimize motion due to breathing. To track breathing and other body motions during treatment, specific trackers may be used, also known as 4D radiation therapy. Use of any image or registration marker to help with alignment is called image-guided radiation therapy, or IGRT. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Delivery. Based on alignment with these images, markers or other radiation therapy trackers, treatment begins and radiation is delivered to the patient. In some cases, additional 2D X-ray images are taken intermittently or registration makers are monitored during t reatment to try to account for tumor movement. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Review. After a treatment session, a physician will review the delivered treatment to ensure that it is proceeding according to plan. Currently, there are no methods to record the actual dose that was delivered to the tumor and nearby critical structures. In those rare occasions when a physician is able to observe changes in the size or shape of a tumor, he or she may decide to adjust the treatment plan. However, revising a treatment plan may take several days and delays treatment. 

Limitations of Radiation Therapy

Limitations with radiation therapy arise as a result of imaging technologies that make accurate visualization of a tumor and its relation to critical organs difficult or impossible during treatment. As a result, we believe treatments are not as effective or safe as they could be.

&#160;

&#183; 

Inability to accurately locate a tumor for treatment alignment. To locate a tumor, current radiation therapy systems rely on on-table CT scans which are unable to differentiate between types of soft tissue. Therefore, surrogate registration markers, including existing bone structures, external marks and surgically implanted fiducials, are frequently used to align a patient to the treatment beams prior to commencing treatment. 

Comparison of On-Table CT Images to On-Table MRIdian Images 

&#160;

The spatial relationship between the tumors, particularly those in soft tissue, and registration markers is likely to change between initial imaging and the first treatment session. By relying on a proxy for tumor location rather than the tumor itself, clinicians risk missing the tumor when they deliver treatment beams into a patient&#8217;s body. Furthermore, fiducial markers can migrate inside the body, 

&#160;

&#160;

are unable to track changes in the tumor shape , may interfere with imaging, are invasive, require time to heal and have a high incidence of side effects and complications. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Inability to adapt treatment on table. A physician designs a treatment plan and dose prescription based on images that are captured at the beginning of therapy. Creating a treatment plan can take one to two weeks, and treatment itself can take up to seven weeks. However, during the course of therapy, tumors often change size, orientation or shape and patient anatomy can change for reasons such as weight loss or gain. Adjusting for these changes would require replanning which may take several days and is resource intensive. In addition, due to limitations in imaging technologies, physicians may be unaware of changes in the tumor and surrounding anatomy and continue to dose according to the original treatment plan. As a result of these limitations, replanning is infrequently performed. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Inability to track tumor and organ motion accurately. In addition to difficulty locating a tumor accurately in a patient&#8217;s body, a further challenge is accounting for ongoing tumor movement during treatment. Tumors have been shown to move multiple centimeters relative to surrogate registration markers over the course of only a few seconds. Although physicians use internal markers and external cameras and blocks to track respiratory and other motion, they are unable to track the tumor itself and its location relative to other soft tissues. This limitation increases the probability of missing the targeted treatment area. As a result, physicians usually enlarge the total region to be irradiated, causing an additional risk of side effects. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Inability to record cumulative radiation delivered. In order to determine treatment effectiveness, it is important to track how much radiation has been delivered to a tumor or surrounding healthy tissue. Currently, there are no methods to record the actual dose of radiation that was delivered to the tumor and nearby critical structures. Therefore, physicians must assume that the radiation is delivered according to plan, rather than making decisions based on actual dose delivered. 

Each of these limitations increases the risk of missing a tumor and hitting healthy tissue during treatment. If a tumor is insufficiently irradiated, it may not respond to treatment, resulting in a lower probability of survival for the patient. The ability to avoid irradiating healthy tissue has been shown to reduce side effects. If healthy tissues, particularly critical organs, are irradiated, the side effects can be severe, including scarring of lung tissue, fibrosis and cardiotoxicity in lung and breast cancers, incontinence and sexual dysfunction in pelvic and prostate cancers, infertility in pediatric cancers, memory loss, seizures and necrosis in brain cancer and secondary cancers.

Although MR technology is an imaging tool broadly used to differentiate between types of soft tissue in diagnostic settings, to date such technology has not been used with radiation therapy because the magnetic field generated by an MRI interferes with the linac&#8217;s ability to accelerate electrons and the linac produces radio frequencies that distort the MR images. Current forms of CT have improved over time, but issues with radiation dose and image quality limit the utility of these technologies. Fluoroscopy and cone-beam CT involve the use of X-rays, a form of ionizing radiation, and pose an increased risk of radiation-induced cancer to the patient.

Our Solution

We have developed MRIdian to address the key limitations of existing external-beam radiation therapy technologies. MRIdian employs MRI-based technology to provide real-time imaging that clearly defines the targeted tumor from the surrounding soft tissue and other critical organs during radiation treatment. MRIdian allows physicians to record the level of radiation exposure that the tumor has received and adapt the prescription between fractions as needed. We believe this combination of enhanced visualization and accurate dose recording will significantly improve the safety and efficacy of radiation therapy, leading to better outcomes for patients.

We believe that MRIdian provides the following clinical and commercial benefits to physicians, hospitals and patients:

&#160;

&#183; 

Improved tumor visibility and patient alignment. The soft-tissue contrast of MRidian&#8217;s on-board MRI enables clinicians to locate, target and track the tumor and healthy tissues and accurately align a patient to the treatment beams without the use of X-ray, CT or surrogate registration markers. If the clinician prefers, the software has the ability to automatically map the patient&#8217;s soft tissue anatomy each treatment session in less than one minute, and MRIdian can use that information to automatically align the patient. 

&#160;

&#183; 

On-table adaptive planning. Due to changing anatomy the clinician may be unable to obtain an optimal match between the patient on the table and the treatment plan. Using an MR image captured at the beginning of each therapy session, MRIdian automatically maps each patient&#8217;s soft tissue anatomy in 3D and calculates the dose that would be delivered using the current treatment plan. If the prescribed treatment is not clinically acceptable to the physician, MRIdian has the ability to automatically recalculate and adapt the plan to changing anatomy at the time of treatment. Utilizing our proprietary algorithm and software, replanning can be done in less than two minutes while the patient is on the table. We believe hospitals will be able to bill incrementally for this replanning. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Ability to track tumors a nd manage patient motion. MRIdian can capture multiple soft-tissue imaging planes concurrently during treatment, refreshing the image multiple times per second. This real-time imaging enables the physician to track the movement of the tumor and the surroun ding healthy tissue directly, rather than relying on registration markers such as existing bones or implanted fiducials. If a tumor or critical organ moves beyond a physician-defined boundary, the treatment beam automatically pauses. This beam control beco mes especially important in the situations where a tumor may be in close proximity to a critical organ, such as the heart during lung and breast cancer treatments or the rectum during prostate cancer treatments. This knowledge of the tumor location has ena bled physicians to treat patients who would not previously have been considered radiation therapy candidates. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Record and evaluate the delivered dose. Using our proprietary algorithm and advanced MR imaging, MRIdian calculates the dose delivered after each treatment, enabling the physician to review and re-optimize the patient&#8217;s treatment session if needed. In addition, MRIdian can utilize diagnostic CT images that are fused with the MR images at each treatment in order to more accurately calculate dose. MRIdian also captures and records a video, known as a MRIdian Movie&#8482;, of the delivered treatments which can be evaluated by the physician or shared with patients. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Fits into existing treatment paradigms and workflow. MRIdian can be used for 3D-CRT, IMRT, IGRT, SBRT and SRS and can also be used to treat a broad spectrum of disease sites. In addition, we believe MRIdian&#8217;s increased target accuracy will allow physicians to treat patients with higher doses over fewer treatment fractions and potentially improve patient throughput and efficiency. MRIdian fits inside most standard radiation therapy vaults without significant modifications and is supported by existing codes that are available for linac reimbursement. 

We believe the ability to image with MRI and treat cancer patients simultaneously will lead to improved patient outcomes and reduced side effects from off-target radiation delivery.

Our Strategy

Our objective is to make MRI-guided radiation delivery the standard of care for radiation therapy. To achieve this goal, we intend to do the following:

&#160;

&#183; 

Target top-tier hospitals in initial global sales efforts to influence and increase market adoption. We intend to market MRIdian to a broad range of customers worldwide, including university research and teaching hospitals, private practices, community hospitals, government institutions and freestanding cancer centers. We are initially focusing on the leading hospitals worldwide which are typically early adopters of best-in-class technology and are able to influence and promote adoption by other centers both locally and globally. We plan to continue to work with these institutions to position MRIdian as a marketing tool they can use to differentiate their offerings from their peers and promote broader market awareness on the benefits of MRI-guided radiation therapy. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Commercialize MRIdian with a targeted sales force in the United States and through distributors in international markets. We intend to market MRIdian through a combination of direct sales and distributors. We are building a small, specialty sales force for the United States and Canada and are using distributors in international markets. At December 31, 2015, we had six signed orders with U.S. customers and nine signed orders with customers outside the United States for new MRIdian systems, and we intend to continue to expand our presence in key markets to capitalize on the growing international opportunity for MRIdian. We are engaging distributors and seeking government approval where needed to market MRIdian in China and Japan and we intend to work with distributors and regulators in other countries in the future. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Increase broader awareness of MRIdian&#8217;s capabilities to expand our share of the radiation therapy market. We intend to educate radiation oncologists about the capabilities and resulting benefits of MRIdian over traditional radiation therapy systems. In order to drive awareness and adoption, we also intend to support the publication of clinical and scientific data and analysis, work with key opinion leaders, present at leading academic conferences and engage in outreach at leading hospitals worldwide. We also plan to leverage our existing customer network as a reference for new potential users to experience our technology in use in the clinical setting. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Maintain our competitive lead in MRI-guided radiation therapy through continued innovation. We plan to continue to invest in our technology to maintain our leadership position in the emerging MRI-guided radiation therapy market. We intend to develop and introduce enhancements to the system and software to provide improved capabilities for MRIdian users and patients. In addition, we plan to explore potential benefits of integrating our MRI technology with alternative beam technologies. We believe we have a strong intellectual property portfolio that covers the MRIdian system as well as critical design elements and key aspects of its subsystem and components. We will continue to enhance this portfolio as we develop new features and technologies. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Continue to work with leading hospitals to optimize efficiency and patient throughput. We strive to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of the MRIdian system for our customers. We plan to continue to work closely with key opinion leaders, clinicians and hospitals in a proactive manner to determine how best to refine and improve MRIdian&#8217;s features, optimize workflow and maximize patient throug hput. We utilize this customer feedback to guide product development and increase MRIdian&#8217;s reliability and efficiency, which we believe will result in positive experiences for our customers and ensure their continued usage and recommendation of MRIdian. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Drive cost reductions in the design and manufacture of MRIdian and improve our margins. We plan to continue to explore ways to bring down our cost of goods to improve margins for MRIdian. We believe we can reduce costs in the design and manufacture of MRIdian. 

MRIdian

MRIdian is a next-generation, MRI-guided radiation therapy system that is comprised of four major components, (i) the MRI system, (ii) the radiation delivery system, (iii) integrated treatment planning and delivery software and (iv) a safety and control system.

MRIdian 

&#160;

MRI System

The MRI system is the component of MRIdian that captures soft tissue images of the patient&#8217;s body. To address the technical complications that arise from combining an MRI with a linac, we have designed a proprietary split superconducting magnet that allows treatment through a central gap, eliminating MRI components in the path of the beam. Our MRI system captures and displays live, high-quality images in three planes at two frames per second or in one plane at four frames per second. The images are used to track tissues and control radiation treatment beam delivery.

While other MRI systems in development utilize a high field strength magnet to provide a clearer image, use of higher field strength magnets results in distortions of soft tissue images by up to approximately six millimeters at 1.5 tesla and unfavorable dose distribution distortions, which are unacceptable for delivering accurate radiation therapy.

We have engineered our MRI system to be able to produce clear images using a low field strength 0.35 tesla magnet which enables us to avoid the image and dose distortions that are a result of using a higher field strength magnet. In addition, MRIdian&#8217;s 0.35 tesla field strength prevents heating of the patient during uninterrupted imaging, which could occur in a higher field strength magnet requiring the imaging to be discontinued or interrupted.

&#160;

&#160;

Radiation Delivery System

Radiation is delivered from three Cobalt-60 radiation therapy heads symmetrically mounted on a rotating ring gantry, providing full 360 degree coverage and simultaneous dose delivery, as opposed to prior Cobalt-60 systems that have historically been limited by imprecise radiation dose applications. Each head is equipped with a double-focused multi-leaf collimator, designed to overcome the wide-beam edge of previous-generation Cobalt-60 systems and shape the beam for precision radiation therapy treatments. It allows the delivery of treatment plans for 3D-CRT, IMRT and SBRT that are clinically equivalent to those produced on the most advanced linear accelerators available today. Stereotactic procedures are possible with a positioning accuracy of less than one millimeter. Cobalt-60 is used because it does not create any radio frequency which interferes with the MRI.

&#160;

Integrated Treatment Planning and Delivery Software

Our treatment planning and delivery software can create treatment plans and manage the treatment delivery process. It is designed to create optimized 3D-CRT, IMRT and SBRT plans for delivery of MRIdian. Using this software, the on-table adaptive planning process typically takes less than two minutes, and includes: auto-contouring, dose prediction and treatment plan optimization. For contouring, the software will automatically draw the outline of the tumor and nearby organs. The clinician can then make refinements before treatment, if necessary. Dose prediction can be calculated immediately before treatment, allowing the current state of the 

&#160;

&#160;

patient&#8217;s anatomy to be taken into account. The software can generate an optimal treatment plan solution in less than o ne minute, allowing it to re-plan while the patient is on the treatment couch. 

MRIdian has soft-tissue tracking beam control capability. While the radiation dose is being delivered, the software analyzes the acquired images and can determine tumor or organ location relative to set tolerances. If the targeted tumor or a critical organ moves beyond a physician-defined boundary, the treatment beams will automatically pause. When the tumor moves back into the target zone, the treatment will automatically resume. Physicians can set both spatial and time thresholds for pausing treatment delivery. This enables the system to account for tumor and patient motion during treatment.

The software archives all the information generated during treatment and builds a database of patient-specific planning, delivery and imaging data. It also includes a review tool which provides clinicians with a visual comparison of the delivered versus planned treatment. At the end of each treatment, the software determines the delivered dose by combining the recorded actions of the radiation delivery system with the daily image and auto-contouring of the patient. With this information, clinicians can fine-tune prescriptions based on the actual dose delivered. In addition, it provides a MRIdian Movie&#8482; of each delivered treatment which can be evaluated by the physician or exported and shared with the patient.

Safety and Control System

In addition to complying with the applicable FDA and Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or NRC, requirements, the radiation delivery subsystem also meets a double fault tolerant design standard and has redundant safety systems. If any two components in the radiation delivery subsystem fail simultaneously, such as power and pneumatics, the system reverts to a safe state. MRIdian also contains redundant computer control for safety and system logging and double encoders on all axes of motion for safety. The control system continuously monitors performance to ensure all systems are performing and communicating appropriately.

Installed Base and Clinical Use

We received initial 510(k) marketing clearance from the FDA for our treatment planning and delivery software in January 2011 and for MRIdian in May 2012. Since November 2014 we also have the right to affix the CE mark to MRIdian, allowing MRIdian to be sold within the EEA. We received a license and permission to import MRIdian into the United Arab Emirates in December 2014. We received regulatory approval in Italy in January 2015, Korea in September 2015 and are currently seeking government approval to market MRIdian in China and Japan. We may also seek required approvals in other countries in the future.

We have four units installed at four leading cancer centers in the United States including Washington University and Siteman Cancer Center at Barnes-Jewish Hospital, or Washington University in St. Louis; University of California, Los Angeles Health System and Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, or University of California, Los Angeles; University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center, or the University of Wisconsin&#8211;Madison; and Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Miami. We have two units installed outside the United States at Seoul National University in Seoul, South Korea and at VU University Medical Center in Amsterdam. In January 2014, Washington University in St. Louis, a National Cancer Institute Designated Comprehensive Cancer Center, became the first center to treat patients with MRIdian. Washington University in St. Louis has since scaled up its use of MRIdian in its clinical practice, and is now treating as many as 15 patients per day. In September 2014, Washington University in St. Louis used MRIdian to perform the first on-table adaptive treatments as part of an ongoing clinical service. Also in September 2014, the University of Wisconsin&#8211;Madison treated its first patients with MRIdian and became the first center to employ the soft-tissue tracking beam control capability unique to MRIdian. In October 2014, University of California, Los Angeles, became the third center to use MRIdian in clinical practice. In September 2015, the Seoul National University became the first international cancer center to install a MRIdian system. In December 2015, the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Miami became the fourth hospital in the United States to install a MRIdian system. In March 2016, the VU University Medical Center in Amsterdam became the second hospital outside the United States to install a MRIdian system. We are working with each of these centers to determine how best to refine and improve MRIdian&#8217;s features, optimize workflow and maximize patient throughput.

At December 31, 2015, patients have received treatment sessions at the Seoul National University and all United States centers using MRIdian systems, except for the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Miami, which was only installed in December 2015. These included cancers of the prostate, breast, lung, colorectal and bladder, which are among the most prevalent types of cancer in the United States according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, as well as the liver, stomach, esophagus and pancreas, which are among the most prevalent types of cancer outside of the United States according to the WHO.

&#160;

Backlog 

In 2013, we executed new sales contracts with a total value of $17.4 million, in 2014 we executed new sales contracts with a total value of $37.6 million, and in 2015 we executed new sales contracts with a total value of $40.1 million. At December 31, 2015, we had five MRIdian systems installed and had 15 signed orders for new systems for a backlog value of $84.4 million.

We define backlog as the accumulation of all orders for which revenue has not been recognized and we consider valid. Backlog includes customer deposits received which are recorded as a liability on the balance sheet. Orders may be revised or cancelled according to their terms or upon mutual agreement between the parties. Therefore, it is difficult to predict with certainty the amount of backlog that will ultimately result in revenue. The determination of backlog includes objective and subjective judgment about the likelihood of an order contract becoming revenue. We perform a quarterly review of backlog to verify that outstanding orders in backlog remain valid, and based upon this review, orders that are no longer expected to result in revenue are removed from backlog.

Among other criteria, to consider a sale to be in backlog we must possess an outstanding and effective written agreement for the delivery of a MRIdian signed by the customer, as well as receipt of a minimum customer deposit or letter of credit. For removal of an order from our backlog, the following criteria are considered: changes in customer or distributor plans or financial conditions; the customer&#8217;s or distributor&#8217;s continued intent and ability to fulfill the order contract; changes to regulatory requirements; the status of regulatory approval required in the customer&#8217;s jurisdiction, if any; and other reasons for potential cancellation of order contracts.

Installation Process

Following execution of a contract, it generally takes nine to 12 months for a customer to prepare an existing facility or construct a new vault, although in some cases customers may request installation for a date later in the future to meet their own clinical or business requirements. Upon the commencement of installation at a customer&#8217;s facility, it typically takes forty-five to ninety days to complete the installation and on-site testing of the system, including the completion of acceptance test procedures. MRIdian is designed to fit into a typical radiation therapy vault, similar to other replacement linear accelerators. MRIdian&#8217;s components all fit through standard hospital vault entrances for assembly. On-site training takes approximately one week and can be conducted concurrent with installation and acceptance testing.

Our customers are responsible for removing any outgoing linear accelerator and preparing the mounting pad, power and support system connections. Additional room modifications required are consistent with those generally required for MRI systems such as radio frequency shielding of the room and additional power.

Clinical Development

To date, we have primarily relied on clinical symposia and case studies presented at ASTRO and ESTRO to raise awareness of MRI-guided radiation therapy and to market MRIdian to leading cancer centers. In order to promote broader adoption rates at other cancer centers and hospitals, we plan to work with our customers to collect and publish data on clinical efficacy, treatment times and clinical results for patients who have been treated on a MRIdian. While we do not currently have statistically significant, objective evidence that MRIdian improves patient outcomes or decreases healthcare costs, we are currently sponsoring two studies at Washington University in St. Louis to compare MRIdian to other IGRT systems. We plan to continue to support further studies to demonstrate the benefits of MRI-guided radiation therapy and adaptive treatment planning. As data accumulate from the use of MRIdian, we plan to work with professional healthcare organizations to further support global marketing efforts, additional product clearances, approvals and/or registrations and potential improvements in reimbursement.

Selling and Marketing

We currently market MRIdian through a direct sales force in the United States and distributors in the rest of the world. We market MRIdian to a broad range of worldwide customers, including university research and teaching hospitals, community hospitals, private practices, government institutions and freestanding cancer centers. As with the traditional linac market, our sales and revenue cycle varies based on the customer and can be lengthy, sometimes lasting up to 18 to 24 months or more from initial customer contact to contract execution.

To sell MRIdian globally, we use a combination of sales executives, sales directors and a network of international third-party distributors with internal support from sales operations, product management and application specialists. A targeted group of three sales directors and one vice president are responsible for selling MRIdian within the United States. Our product management function helps market MRIdian and works with our engineering group to identify and develop upgrades and enhancements. We also have a team of application specialists who provide post-sales support.

&#160;

&#160;

Although we do not currently engage in advertising efforts, our selling and marketing practices include participating in trade shows and symposia. 

Competition

We compete directly with companies marketing IGRT devices for the treatment of cancer using CT, ultrasound, optical tracking and X-ray imaging. We also compete with companies developing next-generation IGRT devices, specifically those developing MRI-guided devices, amongst others. We expect technological advances, including the ability to provide real-time imaging, clinical outcomes, size, price, operational complexity and operational efficiency to drive competitive market dynamics.

Our major competitors with devices approved for distribution in the United States or globally include Varian Medical Systems, Inc., or Varian, Elekta AB, or Elekta, and Accuray Incorporated. Many of our direct competitors have greater financial, sales and marketing, service infrastructure and research and development capabilities than we do, as well as more established reputations and current market share. The main limitations of currently approved devices are the lack of real-time, clear images before and during the treatment, as well as the ability to perform on-table adaptive planning.

We are also aware of one commercial and two academic ongoing research efforts to develop radiation therapy systems incorporating MRI. Elekta and Royal Philips have formed a consortium to develop a commercial Elekta-Philips MRI-linac. The University of Sydney, Ingham Institute and the University of Queensland have formed a partnership to develop an MRI-linac and the University of Alberta&#8217;s Cross Cancer Institute is working on an MRI-linac as well. Although these academic research efforts may not compete directly with us commercially, if one of our competitors were to form a partnership with one of these institutions to commercialize their system, it could impact our sales negatively. Of these three, we believe the Elekta-Philips MRI-linac is the most advanced in development, although we believe this system may still be years away from approval. MRIdian is the first and only commercially available MRI-guided radiation therapy device to image and treat cancer patients simultaneously.

The limited capital expenditure budgets of our customers results in all suppliers to these entities competing for a limited pool of funds. Our customers may be required to select between two items of capital equipment. For example, some of our potential customers are considering expensive proton therapy systems which could consume a significant portion of their capital expenditure budgets.

Manufacturing

We have adopted a model in which we rely on subsystem manufacturing, assembly and testing by our key suppliers. The MRIdian system is integrated at the customer site. Through this approach, we avoid the majority of the fixed cost structure of manufacturing facilities. We purchase major components and subsystems for MRIdian from national and international third-party OEM suppliers and contract manufacturers. These major components include the magnet, MRI electronics, ring gantry, radiation therapy heads, Cobalt-60 sources, multi-leaf collimators, patient-treatment table and computers. We also directly purchase minor components and parts. At the customer site, we assemble and integrate these components with our proprietary software and perform multiple levels of testing and qualification. The system undergoes a final acceptance test, which is performed in conjunction with the customer.

Many of the major subsystems and components of MRIdian are currently procured through single and sole source suppliers. Among these are the magnet, MRI electronics, MRI coils, ring gantry, Cobalt-60 sources and the patient-treatment table. We have entered into multi-year supply agreements for all major components and subsystems. Our restated joint development and supply agreement with Euromechanics Medical GmbH, as amended, has expired by its terms. We do not believe that that the expiration will have a negative impact on our manufacturing operations or business because we are currently negotiating an extension of the agreement and we are continuing to operate under the agreement as if the agreement had not expired during these negotiations. Except for the MRI power, control and image reconstruction subsystem, we own the design of all other major subsystems and components.

We manage our supplier relationships with scheduled business reviews and periodic program updates. We closely monitor supplier quality and delivery performance to ensure compliance with all MRIdian system specifications. We believe our supply chain has adequate capacity to meet our projected sales over the next several years.

Intellectual Property

The proprietary nature of, and protection for, MRIdian components, new technologies, processes and know-how are important to our business. Our policy is to seek patent protection in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions for our MRIdian systems and other technology where available and when appropriate. We also in-license technology, inventions and improvements we consider important to the development of our business.

&#160;

&#160;

We hold the exclusive worldwide license for certain patents and patent app lications covering our combination of MRI and radiation therapy technologies. Specifically, we hold a license to three issued U.S. patents, 14 issued foreign patents (eight of which were issued in Great Britain, Germany, France and the Netherlands as a res ult of two patent applications filed and allowed through the European Patent Office) , one allowed foreign application and four pending foreign patent applications at March 18, 2016 . We own an additional eight issued U.S. patents, one allowed U.S. applicati on, ten issued foreign patents, 1 9 pending U.S. patent applications and 72 pending foreign patent applications, and, at March 18, 2016 , two of our foreign patent applications are allowed. Assuming all required fees are paid, individual patents or patent ap plications owned or licensed by us will expire between 2025 and 203 7 . We also have a joint ownership interest with Case Western Reserve University in one issued patent and one U.S. patent application. 

Our portfolio includes patents and patent applications directed to system-wide aspects of MRIdian and to key aspects of its subsystems and components. The initial licensed patents for our core technology broadly cover the simultaneous use of MR imaging and isotopic external-beam radiation therapy. Such patents have been granted in the United States, Europe, Hong Kong, Australia and Japan, and additional related patent applications remain pending in China, Canada, the United States, Australia and Japan. We have issued U.S. and foreign patents and pending continuation applications of the licensed patents that extend this core technology to alternate beam technologies. Additionally, we have patents and patent applications that cover critical design elements including, among others, our approach to Cobalt IMRT, our methods for integrating MRI and the radiation delivery system, and the design of our disassemblable, or &#8220;pop apart&#8221;, magnet which enables the MRI sub-system to fit into most standard radiation therapy vaults. The U.S. patent application on our approach to Cobalt IMRT has been issued, the patent application on our split gradient coil has been issued in the United States, Japan, Australia and China and numerous applications on other design elements are pending in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. In addition, we have U.S. and Australian patents and U.S. and foreign patent applications that cover the use of MRI imaging at a frequency sufficient to account for real-time organ motion to provide video rate tissue tracking in disciplines outside of radiation therapy. Many of the patents and applications in our portfolio covering aspects of the MRIdian system also cover the MRIdian linac technology under development. In addition, we have patents issued in the U.S., Australia, Japan and China, and additional applications pending in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, specifically directed to technology enabling the MRIdian linac technology&#8217;s combination of MRI and linear accelerator technology. 

We continue to review new technological developments in our system and in the field as a whole in order to make decisions about what filings would be most appropriate for us. An additional key component of our intellectual property is our proprietary software used in planning and delivering MRIdian&#8217;s therapeutic radiation dose.

In December 2004, we entered into a licensing agreement with the University of Florida Research Foundation, Inc., or UFRF, whereby UFRF granted us a worldwide exclusive license to certain of UFRF&#8217;s patents in exchange for 33,653 shares of common stock and a royalty from sales of products developed and sold by us utilizing the licensed patents. We were obligated to meet certain product development and commercialization milestones by various dates through December 31, 2014. The significant milestones met prior to December 31, 2013 included: (i) completion of a business plan and Small Business Technology Transfer grant application; (ii) securing a minimum of $20.0 million venture financing; (iii) successful relocation and build out of our headquarters; (iv) receipt of the first magnet from an OEM partner; (v) hiring of a chief executive officer with industry experience in developing and commercializing similar products; and (vi) filing for FDA approval. The final milestone, which required us to recognize the first commercial sale of the MRIdian system to retail customers by December 31, 2014, was met during the year ended December 31, 2013. If these milestones had not been accomplished, UFRF would have had the right to terminate the licensing agreement. Royalty payments are based on 1% of net sales, defined as the amount collected on sales of licensed products and/or licensed processes after deducting trade and/or quantity discounts, credits on returns and allowances, outbound transportation costs paid and sales tax. Minimum quarterly royalty payments of $50,000 commenced with the quarter ended March 31, 2014 and are payable in advance. Minimum royalties paid in any calendar year will be credited against earned royalties for such calendar year. The royalty payments continue until the earlier of (i) the date that no licensed patents remain enforceable or (ii) the payment of earned royalties, once begun in 2014, cease for more than four consecutive calendars quarters.

In addition to our patents, we also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, trademarks, copyright protection and continuing technological and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position. We have periodically monitored and continue to monitor the activities of our competitors and other third parties with respect to their use of intellectual property. We require our employees, consultants and outside scientific collaborators to execute confidentiality and invention assignment agreements upon commencing employment or consulting relationships with us. Despite these safeguards, any of our know-how or trade secrets not protected by a patent could be disclosed to, or independently developed by, a competitor.

Coverage and Reimbursement

We believe that reimbursement rates in the United States have generally supported a favorable return on investment for the purchase of new radiotherapy equipment, including MRIdian. Payments for standard radiation therapy treatments using MRIdian, including 3D-CRT, IMRT and SBRT, are generally covered and reimbursed under existing Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, codes and 

&#160;

&#160;

coverage policies currently in place. User experience to date indicates that our initial customers have treated a wi de spectrum of different patients and treatment modalities using MRIdian. Physicians use the MRIdian system&#8217;s on-board MRI to perform a complex simulation weekly for IMRT or daily for SBRT, special physics consult and adaptive re-planning. Each of these ar e distinct procedures which can be billed by physicians using existing CPT codes, so long as such procedures meet medical necessity and other coverage criteria as established by government and other third-party payors. 

Third-party payors, including governmental healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, establish coverage policies and reimbursement rates for diagnostic examinations and therapeutic procedures performed by physicians in hospitals and free-standing clinics. Private insurers often model their payment rates and coverage policies based on those established by the government. The U.S. Congress from time to time considers various Medicare and other healthcare reform proposals that could affect both private and public third-party payor coverage and reimbursement for healthcare services provided in hospitals and clinics. In addition, third-party payors regularly update reimbursement amounts, including annual updates to payments to physicians, hospitals and clinics for medical procedures, including radiation treatments using MRIdian.

The changes to simplify the billing for conventional radiation therapy and IMRT by the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services, or CMS, in its final rule for the Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System, or HOPPS, effective January 1, 2015, are further indicative of an overall U.S. health policy trend towards cost containment. Whether this trend results in capitated payments per patient or case payment per procedure, we believe MRIdian&#8217;s capability of enabling physicians to visualize the treatment area and adapt therapy in real-time to maximize the clinical benefit to the patient will result in cost savings to both providers and third-party payors.

We plan to work with our customers to collect and publish data on clinical results for patients who have undergone procedures on MRIdian. We are currently sponsoring a study that is estimated to be completed in 2017 at Washington University in St. Louis to compare MRIdian to other IGRT systems, and we plan to continue to support further studies to demonstrate the benefits of MRI-guided radiation therapy and adaptive treatment planning. As data accumulate from the use of our system, we plan to work with professional healthcare organizations to further support global marketing efforts, additional product clearances, approvals and/or registrations and potential improvements in reimbursement. Additionally, we currently provide reimbursement support to our customers through a third-party vendor.

Foreign Reimbursement Regulations

Internationally, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary from country to country and include single-payor, government managed systems as well as systems in which private payors and government-managed systems exist side-by-side. In general, the process of obtaining coverage approvals is slower outside of the United States. Our ability to achieve adoption of MRIdian as well as significant sales volume in international markets we enter will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement for procedures performed using MRIdian.

Research and Development 

Continued innovation and development of advanced technologies is critical to our goal of making MRI-guided radiation therapy the standard of care for cancer treatment. Our current development activities include improvements in and expansion of product capabilities, continued clinical workflow refinements, design improvements to reduce system costs and improvements in reliability.

The modular design of MRIdian enables the development of new capabilities and performance enhancements by generally allowing each subsystem to evolve within the overall platform design. Access to regular MRIdian upgrades protects customer investment in MRIdian, and facilitates the adoption of new features and capabilities among existing installed base customers. 

In March 2016, we announced the development of a linear accelerator version of our MRIdian technology. To date, we have achieved critical milestones in the development of this combined MRI and linac technology, including human imaging testing, delivery of radiation beams in a magnetic field using a linear accelerator and modification of the treatment planning system to incorporate linac technology. Other significant technology incorporated into the MRIdian linac technology includes radio frequency &#8220;cloaking&#8221; technology to preserve the integrity of the MR image quality in the presence of radio frequencies emitted by the linear accelerator, magnetic shielding technology to enable undistorted delivery of radiation, double-focused multi-leaf collimator technology for the delivery of sharp radiation beams and incorporation of the existing MRIdian proprietary &#8220;pop-apart&#8221; magnet design. 

During development, we plan to offer a limited number of MRIdian systems with linac technology for non-clinical research purposes. 

We are designing the linac technology such that our commercially-available cobalt-based MRIdian systems should be able to be modified to incorporate the linac technology. We are in the process of preparing marketing applications for submission in 2016 for 

&#160;

&#160;

510(k) marketing clearance by the FDA and for CE marking in the European Union, as required for commercial launch of this technology. 

We believe the MRIdian linac technology, when commercially available, will broaden our addressable market, accelerate our sales cycle, accelerate backlog conversion time and improve gross margins.

In addition, we believe our existing and expanding IP portfolio will enable us to continuously develop innovative technologies to further strengthen the differentiation of MRIdian in the marketplace. Magnetic resonance imaging is a powerful and versatile measurement technique and is widely used throughout radiology and medicine because of its ability to generate information about tissues and disease states.

At December 31, 2015, we had a total of 41 employees in our research and development departments. Research and development expenses were $10.4 million, $9.4 million and $8.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We plan to continue to increase our investment in research and development in future periods.

Government Regulation

U.S. Medical Device Regulation and Nuclear Materials Regulation

As a manufacturer and seller of medical devices and devices that deliver radiation, we and some of our suppliers and distributors are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA, the NRC, other federal, state and local authorities in the United States and foreign regulatory authorities. Regulations promulgated by the FDA relating to medical devices and radiation-producing devices govern, among other things, the following activities that we perform or that are performed on our behalf, and that we will continue to perform or have performed on our behalf:

FDA Clearance and Approval of Medical Devices

The FDA regulates the research, testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, promotion, distribution, and production of medical devices in the United States to ensure that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses. Unless an exemption applies, the FDA requires that all new medical devices and all marketed medical devices that have been significantly changed, or that will be marketed with a new indication for use, obtain either clearance via a 510(k) pre-market notification or approval via a Premarket Approval, or PMA, application before the manufacturer may commercially distribute the product in the United States. The type of marketing authorization necessary is generally linked to the classification of the device. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Devices deemed to pose the lowest risk are placed in Class I, and most Class I devices are exempt from premarket notification requirements. Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be reasonably assured by adherence to a set of regulations referred to as General Controls, which require compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA&#8217;s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, and regulations regarding facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse events and malfunctions, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling and promotional materials. However, some Class I devices, called Class I reserved devices, also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below.

&#160;

&#160;

Moderate risk devices are placed in Class II and are subject to General Controls as well as Special Controls, wh ich can include performance standards, guidelines and post-market surveillance. Most Class II devices are subject to premarket review and clearance by the FDA pursuant to Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA. 

Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device are placed in Class III. Class III devices require FDA approval of a PMA prior to marketing.

MRIdian is a Class II medical device subject to the 510(k) clearance process.

510(k) clearance process. Most Class II devices are subject to premarket review and clearance by the FDA. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification process. Under the 510(k) process, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification, demonstrating that the device is &#8220;substantially equivalent&#8221; to either: 

&#160;

&#183; 

a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, the date upon which the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 were enacted; or 

&#160;

&#183; 

another commercially available, similar device that was cleared through the 510(k) process. 

To be &#8220;substantially equivalent,&#8221; the proposed device must have the same intended use as the predicate device and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological characteristics and not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device. Clinical data are sometimes required to support substantial equivalence.

The process of obtaining 510(k) clearance usually takes from three to 12 months from the date the application is filed and generally requires submitting supporting design and test data, which can be extensive and can prolong the process for a considerable period of time. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent, it will grant clearance to commercially market the device. We received our 510(k) clearances for the treatment planning and delivery software system in January 2011 and for MRIdian in May 2012.

After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in the intended use of the device, may require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, could require approval of a PMA. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision. If the FDA disagrees with the manufacturer&#8217;s decision, it may retroactively require the manufacturer to submit a request for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval and can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the product until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained. Since obtaining 510(k) clearances in 2011 and 2012, we have made changes to MRIdian that we believe do not require new 510(k) clearance.

We are in the process of preparing marketing application for submission in 2016 for 510(k) clearance by the FDA for our linac technology.

Premarket application approval process. Submission and approval of a PMA is required before marketing of a Class III product may proceed. Under the PMA application process, the applicant must generally conduct at least one clinical investigation and submit extensive data and clinical information demonstrating reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction. Accordingly, a PMA application typically includes, but is not limited to, extensive technical information regarding device design and development, pre-clinical and clinical trial data, manufacturing information, labeling and financial disclosure information for the clinical investigators in device studies. The PMA process is much more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. 

Following receipt of a PMA application, the FDA conducts an administrative review to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If it is not, the agency will refuse to file the PMA. If it is, the FDA will accept the application for filing and begin the review. The FDA, by statute and by regulation, has 180 days to review a filed PMA application, although the review of an application more often occurs over a significantly longer period of time. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided, and the FDA may issue a major deficiency letter to the applicant, requesting the applicant&#8217;s response to deficiencies communicated by the FDA. Before approving or denying a PMA, an FDA advisory committee may review the PMA at a public meeting and provide the FDA with the committee&#8217;s recommendation on whether the FDA should approve the submission, approve it with specific conditions, or not approve it. Overall, the PMA application process typically takes between one to three years, but may take significantly longer. The FDA may approve a PMA application with post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device including, among other things, restrictions on 

&#160;

&#160;

labeling, user training requirements, restrictions on promotion, sale and distrib ution, and requirements for the collection of long-term follow-up data. 

MRIdian is not currently approved under a PMA approval, and we have no plans for any indication or system improvements or extensions that we believe would require a PMA.

Clinical trials. Clinical trials are generally required to support a PMA application and are sometimes required for 510(k) clearance. Such trials require submission of an investigational device exemption, or IDE, application to the FDA for a specified number of patients and study sites, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements. If an IDE is required, the FDA and the appropriate institutional review boards, or IRBs, at the clinical sites must approve the study before clinical trials may begin. If the device is considered a non-significant risk device, IDE submission to FDA is not required. Instead, only approval from the IRB overseeing the clinical trial is required. Clinical trials are subject to extensive monitoring, record keeping and reporting requirements. Clinical trials must be conducted under the oversight of an IRB for the relevant clinical trial sites and must comply with FDA regulations, including but not limited to those relating to good clinical practices. To conduct a clinical trial, the patient&#8217;s informed consent must be obtained in form and substance that complies with both FDA requirements and state and federal privacy and human subject protection regulations. The clinical trial sponsor, the FDA or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not adequately demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain FDA clearance or approval to market the product. 

Continuing FDA regulation. Any devices we manufacture or distribute pursuant to 510(k) clearance or PMA approval by the FDA are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA and certain state agencies. These include product listing and establishment registration requirements, which help facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory actions. 

In addition, our manufacturing operations for medical devices and those of our suppliers must comply with the FDA&#8217;s QSR. The QSR requires that each manufacturer, including third party manufacturers, establish and implement a quality system by which the manufacturer monitors the manufacturing process and maintains records that show compliance with FDA regulations and the manufacturer&#8217;s written specifications and procedures. Among other things, the QSR requires that manufacturers establish performance requirements before production and follow stringent requirements applicable to the device design, testing, production, control, record keeping, documentation, labeling and installation, as well as supplier/contractor selection, complaint handling and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process. Compliance with the QSR is necessary to be able to continue to market medical devices that have received FDA approval or clearance, and to receive FDA clearance or approval to market new or significantly modified medical devices. The FDA makes announced and unannounced inspections of medical device manufacturers, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of subcontractors. Following an inspection, the FDA may issue reports, known as FDA Form 483 reports, listing the investigator&#8217;s observations of conditions or practices which indicate the possibility that an FDA-regulated product may be in violation of FDA&#8217;s requirements. FDA may also issue warning letters documenting regulatory violations observed during an inspection. The manufacturer&#8217;s failure to adequately respond to such reports or warning letters may result in FDA enforcement action against the manufacturer and related consequences, including, among other things, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls or seizures of products, total or partial suspension of production, FDA refusal to grant 510(k) clearance or PMA approval to new devices, withdrawal of existing clearances or approvals, and criminal prosecution.

Manufacturers must also comply with post-market surveillance regulations, including medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers review and report to the FDA any incident in which their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur. In addition, corrections and removal reporting regulations require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that may present a risk to health. The FDA may also order a mandatory recall if there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death.

The FDA and the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, also regulate the promotion and advertising of MRIdian. In general, we may not promote or advertise MRIdian for uses not within the scope of our clearances or approvals or make unsupported safety and effectiveness claims.

Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements, including delays in or failures to report incidents to the FDA or off-label promotion, can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which can include any of the following sanctions:

&#160;

&#183; 

warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; 

&#160;

&#183; 

customer notifications or repair, replacement, refunds, recall, administrative detention or seizure of our MRIdian systems; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production; &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new or modified products; 

&#160;

&#183; 

withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted; 

&#160;

&#183; 

refusal to grant export approval for products; or 

&#160;

&#183; 

criminal prosecution. 

Radiological health. We are also regulated by the FDA under the Electronic Product Radiation Control provisions of the FDCA because MRIdian contains gamma radiation producing components, and because we assemble these components during manufacturing and service activities. The Electronic Product Radiation Control provisions require gamma radiation producing products to comply with certain regulations and applicable performance standards. Manufacturers are required to certify in product labeling and reports to the FDA that their products comply with all necessary standards as well as maintain manufacturing, testing and sales records for their products. The Electronic Product Radiation Control provisions also require manufacturers to report product defects and affix appropriate labeling to covered products. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in enforcement action by the FDA, which can include any of the sanctions described above. 

Nuclear Regulatory Commission and U.S. State Agencies

In the United States, as a manufacturer of medical devices and devices utilizing radioactive byproduct material (i.e. depleted uranium shielding and Cobalt-60 sources) we are subject to extensive regulation by not only federal governmental authorities, such as the NRC, but also by state and local governmental authorities, such as the Ohio Department of Health, to ensure such devices are safe and effective. In Ohio, the Department of Health, by agreement with the NRC, regulates the possession, use, and disposal of radioactive byproduct material as well as the manufacture of devices containing radioactive sealed sources to ensure compliance with state and federal laws and regulations. We have received sealed source device approval from the Ohio Department of Health for MRIdian and have entered into a standby letter of credit with PNC for $103,000 to provide certification of financial assurance for decommissioning Cobalt-60 radioactive materials in accordance with Ohio Department of Health regulations. We and/or our supplier of radiation sources must also comply with NRC and U.S. Department of Transportation regulations on the labeling and packaging requirements for shipment of radiation sources to hospitals or other users of MRIdian. Compliance with NRC, state and local requirements is required for distribution, installation, use and service within each state that we intend to install MRIdian systems.

Existing radiation therapy facilities practicing nuclear medicine, brachytherapy or Gamma Knife therapy are already required to have necessary NRC and/or state licenses and a radiation safety program requiring compliance to various provisions under NRC regulations at Part 35 of Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (&#8220;Medical uses of byproduct material&#8221;). Use of MRIdian is regulated under Section 35.1000 of NRC&#8217;s regulations (&#8220;Other medical uses of byproduct material or radiation from byproduct material&#8221;). In 2013, the NRC released a licensing guidance under its regulations to guide our customers in the NRC requirements applicable to the use of MRIdian. We believe that this guidance is favorable in that it is consistent with clinical use of existing image-guided radiation therapy devices.

Moreover, our use, management, and disposal of certain radioactive substances and wastes are subject to regulation by several federal and state agencies depending on the nature of the substance or waste material. We believe that we are in compliance with all federal and state regulations for this purpose.

Outside the United States, various laws apply to the import, distribution, installation and use of MRIdian, in consideration of the nuclear materials within MRIdian.

U.S. Privacy and Security Laws

We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Further, &#8220;business associates,&#8221; defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity are also subject to certain HIPAA privacy and security standards. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney&#8217;s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in 

&#160;

&#160;

certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

U.S. Fraud and Abuse Laws and Regulations

The healthcare industry is also subject to a number of fraud and abuse laws and regulations, including physician anti-kickback, false claims and physician payment transparency laws. Violations of these laws can lead to civil and criminal penalties, including exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs and significant monetary penalties, among others. These laws, among other things, constrain the sales, marketing and other promotional activities of manufacturers of medical products, such as us, by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements we may have with hospitals, physicians and other potential purchasers of medical products who may seek reimbursement from a federal or state health care program such as Medicare or Medicaid.

Anti-kickback laws. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it a criminal offense to knowingly and willfully solicit, offer, receive or pay any remuneration in exchange for, or to induce, the referral of business, including the purchase, order, lease of any good, facility, item or service, that are reimbursable by a state or federal health care program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term &#8220;remuneration&#8221; has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to the purchase of medical devices from a particular manufacturer or the referral of patients to a particular supplier of diagnostic services utilizing such devices. Although, there are established statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors that define certain financial transactions and practices that are not subject to the Anti-Kickback Statute, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. 

Generally, courts have taken a broad interpretation of the scope of the Anti-Kickback Statute, holding that the statute may be violated if merely one purpose of a payment arrangement is to induce referrals or purchases. Further, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.

Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, and can also result in criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act. Many states have also adopted statutes similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to payments in connection with the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only governmental payor programs.

False Claims Act. The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits anyone from knowingly and willfully presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment, that are false or fraudulent, for services not provided as claimed. In addition to actions initiated by the government itself, the statute authorizes actions to be brought on behalf of the federal government by a private party having knowledge of the alleged fraud. Because the complaint is initially filed under seal, the action may be pending for some time before the defendant is even aware of the action. If the government is ultimately successful in obtaining redress in the matter or if the plaintiff succeeds in obtaining redress without the government&#8217;s involvement, then the plaintiff will receive a percentage of the recovery. When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties ranging from $5,500 to $11,000 for each separate false claim, and may be excluded from participation in federal health care programs, and, although the federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, violations may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. Several states have also adopted comparable state false claims act, some of which apply to all payors. 

Civil monetary penalties laws. The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. 

Other fraud and abuse laws. HIPAA also created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes under HIPAA was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act, such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 

&#160;

&#160;

Physician payment transparency laws. There has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers and entities. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, imposed new reporting requirements on certain manufacturers, including certain device manufacturers, for payments provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immed iate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately, and completely the required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for &#8220;knowing failures.&#8221; Devic e manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each calendar year. 

Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare providers and entities.

The laws and regulations and their enforcement are constantly undergoing change, and we cannot predict what effect, if any, changes may have on our business. In addition, new laws and regulations may be adopted which adversely affect our business. There has been a trend in recent years, both in the United States and internationally, toward more stringent regulation and enforcement of requirements applicable to medical device manufacturers and requirements regarding protection and confidentiality of personal data.

State Certificate of Need Laws

In some states, a certificate of need, or CON, or similar regulatory approval is required by hospitals and other healthcare providers prior to the acquisition of high-cost capital items, including MRIdian, or the provision of new services. These laws generally require appropriate state agency determination of public need and approval prior to the acquisition of such capital items or addition of new services. CON requirements may preclude our customers from acquiring, or significantly delay acquisition of, MRIdian and/or from performing treatments using MRIdian. CON laws are the subject of ongoing legislative activity, and a significant increase in the number of states regulating the offering and use of MRIdian through CON or similar requirements could adversely affect us.

Healthcare Reform

In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system seeking, among other things, to reduce healthcare costs that could affect our results of operations.

By way of example, in the United States, the Affordable Care Act was signed into law in March 2010, which is expected to substantially change the way healthcare is delivered and financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among other things, the Affordable Care Act:

&#160;

&#183; 

imposed an annual excise tax of 2.3% on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the United States which, due to subsequent legislative amendments, has been suspended from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2017, and, absent further legislative action, will be reinstated starting January 1, 2018; 

&#160;

&#183; 

established a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee and identify priorities in comparative clinical effectiveness research in an effort to coordinate and develop such research; 

&#160;

&#183; 

implemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

created an independent payment advisory board that will submit recommendations to reduce Medicare spending if projected Medicare spending exceeds a specified growth rate. 

In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the President signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation&#8217;s automatic reduction to several government programs. This included reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and will stay in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and imaging centers.

&#160;

&#160;

We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for MRIdian or additional pricing pressure. 

Foreign Regulation of Medical Devices

Our activities outside the United States are subject to regulatory requirements that vary from country to country and frequently differ significantly from those in the United States. Failure to obtain and maintain regulatory approval or clearance in any foreign country in which we market or plan to market MRIdian may have a negative effect on our ability to generate revenue and harm our business.

In general, MRIdian is regulated outside the United States as medical devices by foreign governmental agencies similar to the FDA and the FTC. In addition, in foreign countries where we have operations or sell MRIdian, we are subject to laws and regulations applicable to manufacturers of medical devices, radiation producing devices and to the healthcare industry, and laws and regulation of general applicability relating to environmental protection, safe working conditions, manufacturing practices and other matters. These laws and regulations are often comparable to, or more stringent than U.S. laws and regulations. Our sales of MRIdian in foreign countries are also subject to regulation of matters such as product standards, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, import restrictions, tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements. We rely in some countries on our foreign distributors to assist us in complying with applicable regulatory requirements.

Regulation in the EU

In the European Union, or EU, we are required under the European Medical Device Directive (Council Directive 93/42/EEC) to affix the CE mark to our MRIdian systems in order to sell the MRIdian systems in member countries of the EU. The CE mark is an international symbol that represents adherence to certain essential principles of safety and effectiveness mandated in the European Medical Device Directive (the so-called &#8220;essential requirements&#8221;). Once affixed, the CE mark enables a product to be sold within the European Economic Area, which is composed of the 28 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.

To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements, we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Except for low risk medical devices (Class I with no measuring function and which are not sterile) where the manufacturer can issue an EC Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the essential requirements of the Medical Devices Directive, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of an organization accredited by a Member State of the EEA to conduct conformity assessments, or a Notified Body. Depending on the relevant conformity assessment procedure, the Notified Body would typically audit and examine the technical file and the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of our devices. The Notified Body issues a CE Certificate of Conformity following successful completion of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in relation to the medical device and its manufacturer and their conformity with the essential requirements. This Certificate entitles the manufacturer to affix the CE mark to its medical devices after having prepared and signed a related EC Declaration of Conformity.

We received the CE Certificate of Conformity from our Notified Body in November 2014, allowing us to affix the CE mark to MRIdian in order to sell it throughout the EEA.

If we modify MRIdian we may need to undergo a new conformity assessment procedure to be able to affix the CE mark to the modified product. Additionally, we will need to undergo new conformity assessments for any new products that we may develop in the future before we are able to affix the CE mark to these new products. We are in the process of preparing marketing applications for submission in 2016 for CE marking in the European Union, as required for our MRIdian linac technology. We cannot be certain that the outcome of these conformity assessments will be positive and that we will be able to affix the CE mark for modified or new products or that we will continue to meet the quality and safety standards required to maintain the CE marks that we already have or may have in the future. In addition, if we are unable to affix the CE mark to our future products, we would be unable to sell them in EU member countries.

Regulation in Other Countries

We will be subject to additional regulations in foreign countries in which we intend to market, sell and import MRIdian. We or our distributors must receive all necessary approvals or clearance prior to marketing and importing MRIdian in those international markets. We received a license and permission to import MRIdian into the United Arab Emirates in December 2014. We received regulatory approval in Italy in January 2015, Korea in September 2015 and are currently seeking government approval to market MRIdian in China and Japan. We will seek approvals in other countries as may be required in the future.

&#160;

&#160;

The International Standards Organization promulgates internationally recognized standards, including those for the requirements of quality systems. We are certified to the ISO 13485:2003 standa rd, which specify the quality system requirements for medical device manufacturers. To support our ISO certifications, we are subject to surveillance audits by a Notified Body yearly and recertification audits every three years that assess our continued co mpliance with the relevant ISO standards. Our most recent recertification audit occurred in March 2015. 

Employees

At December 31, 2015, we had 106 full-time employees. Within our workforce at December 31, 2015, 41 employees are engaged in research and development and 65 employees in business development, finance, human resources, facilities and general management and administration. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees, and we have not experienced any work stoppages. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
