NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF STUART WEITZMAN BRAND 

Stuart Weitzman is a leading global women's premium footwear brand, with a strong opportunity for growth both within North America and international markets. The design team, under Mr. Stuart Weitzman, is responsible for conceptualizing and directing the design of all products, and works closely with its manufacturing partners, primarily in Spain, to construct a broad mix of footwear styles. These manufacturers in aggregate support a broad mix of materials and seasonal influx of new, fashion oriented styles, which allows the Stuart Weitzman brand to quickly meet marketplace demands and changing consumer preferences. Stuart Weitzman products, which substantially consist of footwear, are sold primarily through department stores in North America and international locations, within numerous independent third party distributors and within Stuart Weitzman operated stores (including the Internet) in the United States, Canada and Europe. 

GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS 

Founded in 1941, Coach Inc. was acquired by Sara Lee Corporation (&#8220;Sara Lee&#8221;) in 1985. In June 2000, the Company was incorporated in the state of Maryland. In October 2000, Coach was listed on the New York Stock Exchange and sold approximately 68 million shares of common stock, split adjusted, representing 19.5% of the then outstanding shares. In April 2001, Sara Lee completed a distribution of its remaining ownership in Coach via an exchange offer, which allowed Sara Lee stockholders to tender Sara Lee common stock for Coach common stock. 

The Company's international expansion strategy has been to enter into joint ventures and distributor relationships to build market presence and capability. To further accelerate brand awareness, aggressively grow market share and to exercise greater control of our brand, Coach has historically acquired its partner&#8217;s interests. 

&#8226; 

In June 2001, Coach Japan was initially formed as a joint venture with Sumitomo Corporation. On July 1, 2005, we purchased Sumitomo&#8217;s 50% interest in Coach Japan. 

&#8226; 

In fiscal 2011, the Company purchased a non-controlling interest in a joint venture with Hackett Limited to expand the Coach business in Europe. Through the joint venture, the Company opened retail locations in Spain, Portugal and the United Kingdom in fiscal 2011, in France and Ireland in fiscal 2012 and in Germany in fiscal 2013. In the beginning of fiscal 2014, the Company purchased Hackett Limited&#8217;s remaining 50% interest in the joint venture, and has continued to expand its presence in Europe. 

&#8226; 

Coach acquired the domestic retail businesses from its distributors as follows: 

- 

Fiscal 2009: Hong Kong, Macau and mainland China (&#8220;Greater China&#8221;). 

- 

Fiscal 2012: Singapore and Taiwan. 

- 

Fiscal 2013: Malaysia and South Korea. 

On May 4, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of Stuart Weitzman, a luxury women's footwear company, to complement its current leadership position in premium handbags and accessories. The operating results of the Stuart Weitzman brand have been consolidated in the Company's operating results commencing on May 4, 2015. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company acquired the Stuart Weitzman Canadian retail distributor. 

SEGMENTS 

In fiscal 2016 , the Company has three &#32;reportable segments: 

&#8226; 

North America, which is composed of Coach brand sales to North American consumers through stores, including the Internet, and sales to wholesale customers. This segment represented approximately 53 % of Coach's total net sales in fiscal 2016 . 

&#8226; 

International, which is composed of Coach brand sales to consumers through stores and concession shop-in-shops in Japan, mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia, South Korea, the United Kingdom, France, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Italy, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Additionally, International includes Coach brand sales to consumers through the Internet in Japan, mainland China, the United Kingdom and South Korea, as well as sales to wholesale customers and distributors in approximately 55 &#32;countries. This segment represented approximately 38 % of total net sales in fiscal 2016 . 

&#8226; 

Stuart Weitzman, which includes worldwide sales generated by the Stuart Weitzman brand, primarily &#32; through department stores in North America and international locations, within numerous independent third party distributors and within Stuart Weitzman operated stores (including the Internet) in the United States, Canada and Europe. This segment represented approximately 8 % of total net sales in fiscal 2016 . 

Other, which is not a reportable segment, consists of Coach brand sales and expenses generated in licensing and disposition channels, and represented approximately of 1 % of total net sales in fiscal 2016 . 

Coach Brand North America Segment 

North American Retail Stores &#160;&#8212; Coach retail stores are located in both regional shopping centers and metropolitan areas throughout the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico. The retail stores carry an assortment of products depending on their size, location and customer preferences. Our flagship stores, which offer the broadest assortment of Coach brand products, are located in high-visibility locations. 

In fiscal 2016, we have reduced the number of retail stores and total square footage, as we continue to optimize our real estate position. We expect this trend to continue in the next fiscal year with the anticipated net closure of approximately 10-15 North America retail stores in the fiscal year ending July 1, 2017 ("fiscal 2017"). Furthermore, we expect to continue investing in the elevation of our existing store environments. 

The change in the number of North America Coach retail stores and their total and average square footage is shown in the following table:

North American Outlet Stores &#160;&#8212; Coach brand's outlet stores serve as an efficient means to sell manufactured-for-outlet product, including outlet exclusives, and to a lesser extent, discontinued retail inventory outside the retail channel. These stores operate under the Coach brand name and are geographically positioned primarily in established outlet centers that are generally in close proximity to major markets and Coach branded retail locations. 

Our outlet store design, visual presentations and customer service levels support and reinforce the brand's image. Through these outlet stores, we target value-oriented customers. 

Over the next few years, we generally expect to see no significant growth in outlet store square footage as we continue to optimize our real estate position across channels by expanding our most productive stores to accommodate a broader expression of lifestyle assortment while continuing to assess opportunities to consolidate standalone Men's locations into core stores. 

The change in the number of North America Coach outlet stores and their total and average square footage is shown in the following table:

Internet &#160;&#8212; We view our www.coach.com website as a key communications vehicle for the brand to promote traffic in retail stores and department store locations and build brand awareness, as well as an additional channel to sell Coach brand products directly to customers. With approximately 57 million unique visits to www.coach.com in fiscal 2016 , our online store provides a showcase environment where consumers can browse through a selected offering of the latest styles and colors. Our e-commerce programs also include our invitation-only outlet Internet sales site, where we have considerably reduced the number of promotional events since fiscal 2014. 

North America Wholesale &#160;&#8212; The Coach brand began as a U.S. wholesaler to department stores and this channel continues to remain a part of our overall consumer reach. Today, we work closely with our partners to ensure a clear and consistent product presentation. We enhance our presentation through the creation of shop-in-shops with proprietary Coach brand fixtures within the department store environment. We custom tailor our assortments through wholesale product planning and allocation processes to match the attributes of our department store consumers in each local market. We continue to closely manage inventories in this channel given the current highly promotional environment at point-of-sale. We utilize automatic replenishment with major accounts in an effort to optimize inventory across wholesale doors. 

Over the next year, we expect to continue investing in the elevation of shop-in-shop environments, while also elevating Coach brand&#8217;s positioning in the North American wholesale channel by rationalizing the distribution footprint, including the closure of about 25% of doors from fiscal 2016 year-end levels and a reduction in markdown allowances. 

As of July 2, 2016 , Coach brand's products are sold in approximately 1,000 wholesale locations in the U.S. and Canada. Our most significant U.S. wholesale customers are Macy&#8217;s (including Bloomingdale's), Dillard's, Bon Ton, Lord &#38; Taylor, The Bay, Nordstrom, Belk and Von Maur. Coach products are also available on these customers' websites. 

As of July 2, 2016 &#32;and June 27, 2015 , we did not have any customers who individually accounted for more than 10% of the North America segment's total net sales. 

Coach Brand International Segment 

Our International Markets &#32;operate department store concession shop-in-shop locations and freestanding flagship, retail and outlet stores as well as e-commerce websites. Flagship stores, which offer the broadest assortment of Coach products, are located in select high-visibility shopping districts. 

We expect our International segment to reflect modest growth in store count over the next few years, particularly within mainland China and Europe. 

The following table shows the number of international directly-operated locations and their total and average square footage:

International Wholesale &#160;&#8212; Our international segment also includes sales to international wholesale distributors and authorized retailers. Travel retail represents the largest portion of our sales in this channel. However, we continue to drive growth by expanding our distribution to reach local consumers in new markets. Coach has developed relationships with a select group of distributors who sell Coach products through department stores and freestanding retail locations in approximately 55 &#32;countries. Coach's current network of international distributors serve the following markets: Australia, Austria, Bahamas, Bahrain, Belgium, Brazil, Cambodia, Canada, Chile, Greater China, Colombia, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Kuwait, Lebanon, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Panama, Peru, Philippines, Portugal, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Uruguay, U.S. &#38; Territories, Venezuela and Vietnam. 

For locations not in freestanding stores, the Coach brand has created shop-in-shops and other image enhancing environments to increase brand appeal and stimulate growth. We will continue to seek opportunities for productivity improvements in this channel by opening larger image-enhancing locations, expanding existing stores and closing less productive stores. Coach's most significant international wholesale customers are the DFS Group, True Alliance, Al Tayer Insignia, Lotte Group and Everrich DFS Corp. Coach's products are sold in approximately 600 international wholesale locations. 

As of July 2, 2016 &#32;and June 27, 2015 , we did not have any customers who individually accounted for more than 10% of the International segment's total net sales. 

Stuart Weitzman Segment 

The Stuart Weitzman brand is sold primarily through approximately 620 North America and international wholesale locations, as well as numerous independent third party distributors. Its most significant wholesale customers include Nordstrom, Saks, Bloomingdales and Neiman Marcus. Furthermore, Stuart Weitzman products are also sold in freestanding flagship and retail stores in North America and Europe, and e-commerce websites. 

&#8226; 

As of July 2, 2016 , Stuart Weitzman had 75 &#32;directly operated stores with a total square footage of 117,820 &#32;and an average square footage of 1,571 (including 14 retail stores related to our Canadian retail distributor acquisition in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016). 

&#8226; 

As of June 27, 2015 , Stuart Weitzman had 54 directly operated stores with a total square footage of 91,101 and an average square footage of 1,687. 

We expect our Stuart Weitzman segment to reflect modest growth in new store count and square footage over the next few years as we grow our business domestically and internationally. 

As of July 2, 2016 &#32;and June 27, 2015 , we did not have any customers who individually accounted for more than 10% of the Stuart Weitzman segment's total net sales. 

See Note 15, "Segment Information" for more information about the Company's segments.

Upon the expiration of the footwear license in June 2017, it is the Company's intention to bring all of the Coach brand women's footwear business in-house. 

Products made under license are, in most cases, sold through all of the channels discussed above and, with the Company's approval, these licensees have the right to distribute products selectively through several other channels, including: shoes in department store salons, watches in selected jewelry stores and eyewear and sunwear in selected optical retailers. These venues provide additional, yet controlled, exposure of our brands. Our licensing partners pay royalties on their net sales of our branded products. However, such royalties are not material to our business as they currently comprise less than 1% of the Company's total net sales. The licensing agreements generally give Coach the right to terminate the license if specified sales targets are not achieved. 

Other also consists of Coach brand sales generated in disposition channels.

DESIGN AND MERCHANDISING 

Coach brand's design team, led by the Executive Creative Director, Mr. Stuart Vevers, and Stuart Weitzman brand's design team, currently led by Mr. Stuart Weitzman, are responsible for conceptualizing and directing the design of all products.

Merchandisers also manage the product life cycle to maximize sales and profitability across all channels. The product category teams, each comprised of design, merchandising/product development and sourcing specialists help each brand execute design concepts that are consistent with the brand's strategic direction.

MARKETING 

Our global marketing strategy is to deliver a consistent, relevant and multi-layered message every time the consumer comes in contact with our brands through our communications and visual merchandising.

Our wide range of direct marketing activities include email contacts and catalogs targeted to promote sales to consumers in their preferred shopping venue. In addition to building brand awareness and driving online revenue, our websites serve as an effective brand communication vehicle by providing a showcase environment where consumers can browse through a strategic offering of the latest styles and colors, which drives store traffic and enables the collection of customer data. 

As part of our direct marketing strategy, we use databases primarily consisting of approximately 32 million households in North America, approximately 13 million households in Asia and approximately 776,000 households in Europe. Email contacts and direct mail pieces are an important part of our communication and are sent to selected households to stimulate consumer purchases and build brand awareness. Visitors to our e-commerce sites in the U.S., Canada, Japan, mainland China, the United Kingdom and South Korea provide an opportunity to increase the size of these databases, as well as point of sale transactions globally except where restricted. 

In fiscal 2016 , Coach had informational websites in Mexico, Hong Kong, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, France, Spain and Saudi Arabia, as well as a global informational website where customers from various other countries are directed. In addition, the Company utilizes and continues to explore digital technologies such as blogs and social media websites, including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, WeChat and Sina Weibo, as a cost effective consumer communication opportunity to increase on-line and store sales, acquire new customers and build brand awareness. 

The Coach brand and Stuart Weitzman brand also run national, regional and local marketing campaigns in support of major selling seasons. As a key pillar of the transformation plan, Coach brand has expanded its marketing initiatives to more clearly message the brand's unique modern luxury positioning, rooted in a 75 year history of authenticity and craftsmanship, augmented by Executive Creative Director Stuart Vevers's modern interpretation of American fashion. We plan to continue to support this strategy in the future through an increased presence in relevant fashion, media events and publications. 

MANUFACTURING 

Coach carefully balances its commitments to a limited number of &#8220;better brand&#8221; partners with demonstrated integrity, quality and reliable delivery. Our manufacturers are located in many countries, including Vietnam, mainland China, the Philippines, India, Thailand, Italy, Spain, Hong Kong, Myanmar and the United States. Coach continues to evaluate new manufacturing sources and geographies to deliver the finest quality products at the lowest cost and help limit the impact of manufacturing in inflationary markets. During fiscal 2016 , the Coach brand had two vendors, both located in Vietnam, who individually provided over 10% of the brand's total units (or approximately 28% in the aggregate). During fiscal 2016 , Stuart Weitzman had two vendors, both located in Spain, who individually provided over 10% of the brands total units (or approximately 30% in the aggregate). No other individual vendor currently provides more than approximately 10% of either brand&#8217;s total units. 

Before partnering with a new vendor, Coach evaluates each facility by conducting a quality and business practice standards audit. Periodic evaluations of existing, previously approved facilities are conducted on a random basis. We believe that our manufacturing partners are in material compliance with Coach&#8217;s integrity standards. 

These independent manufacturers each or in aggregate support a broad mix of product types, materials and a seasonal influx of new, fashion oriented styles, which allows us to meet shifts in marketplace demand and changes in consumer preferences. 

Our raw material suppliers, independent manufacturers and licensing partners, must achieve and maintain high quality standards, which are an integral part of our identity. One of our keys to success lies in the rigorous selection of raw materials. We have longstanding relationships with purveyors of fine leathers and hardware. Although our products are manufactured by independent manufacturers, we maintain a level of oversight in the selection of the raw materials that are used in all of our products. Compliance with quality control standards is monitored through on-site quality inspections at independent manufacturing facilities. 

We maintain control of the supply chain process from design through manufacture. We are able to do this by qualifying raw material suppliers and by maintaining sourcing management offices in Vietnam, China, Hong Kong the Philippines and Spain that work closely with our independent manufacturers. This broad-based, global manufacturing strategy is designed to optimize the mix of cost, lead times and construction capabilities. 

DISTRIBUTION 

In North America, the Company operates an 850,000 square foot distribution and consumer service facility in Jacksonville, Florida for Coach brand products. This automated facility uses a bar code scanning warehouse management system. Coach's distribution center employees use handheld scanners to read product bar codes, which allow them to more accurately process and pack orders, track shipments, manage inventory and generally provide excellent service to our customers. Coach brand products are primarily shipped to Coach retail stores and wholesale customers via express delivery providers and common carriers, and direct to consumers via express delivery providers. 

Outside of North America, the Company has established regional distribution centers, through third-parties, in Shanghai, China and Oldenzaal, The Netherlands for Coach brand products. Coach also operates local distribution centers, through third-parties, in Japan, China, Hong Kong, Macau, South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore for Coach brand products as well as in the United States, Canada and Spain for Stuart Weitzman brand products. 

INFORMATION SYSTEMS 

The foundation of Coach's information systems is its Enterprise Resource Planning (&#8220;ERP&#8221;) system. Within the Coach brand, this integrated system supports finance and accounting, procurement, inventory control, sales and store replenishment. The system functions as a central repository for our transactional information. Complementing our current ERP system are several other solutions. The Company's data warehouse system summarizes the transaction information and provides a global platform for management reporting. The supply chain management systems support product development, procurement, inventory planning and reporting functions. 

Under the Coach brand, in North America, product fulfillment is facilitated by our highly automated warehouse management system and electronic data interchange system, while the unique requirements of our Internet business are supported by Coach&#8217;s order management and e-commerce systems. Internationally, the Coach brand selectively relies on the warehouse and distribution systems owned by the third-parties that operate certain of our international distributions centers. Additionally, the point-of-sale system supports all in-store transactions, distributes management reporting to each store, and collects sales and payroll information on a daily basis. This daily collection of store sales and inventory information results in early identification of business trends and provides a detailed baseline for store inventory replenishment. Updates and upgrades of these systems are made on a periodic basis in order to ensure that we constantly improve our functionality. 

Stuart Weitzman warehouse and distribution fulfillment is facilitated by the brand's warehouse management system in North America and Europe. Stuart Weitzman's retail point-of-sale system supports all in-store transactions, including daily management sales reporting, payroll, sales tax, and store inventory management. 

As discussed further within Note 3, "Restructuring Activities," on April 26, 2016, the Company announced a series of operational efficiency initiatives focused on creating an agile and scalable business model, including the replacing and updating our core technology platforms and the retirement of certain information systems, including Stuart Weitzman. 

TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS 

Coach owns all of the material worldwide trademark rights used in connection with the production, marketing and distribution of all Coach branded and Stuart Weitzman branded products. In addition, it licenses trademarks and copyrights used in connection with the production, marketing and distribution of certain categories of goods and limited edition collaborative special projects. Coach also owns and maintains worldwide registrations for trademarks in all relevant classes of products in each of the countries in which all of its products are sold. Major trademarks include COACH, COACH NEW YORK, COACH and Horse &#38; Carriage 

Design, COACH and Story Patch Design, COACH and Lozenge Design, COACH and Tag Design, Signature C Design, and Op Art C Design, COACH LEATHERWARE EST. 1941, SW1, IN OUR SHOES, and STUART WEITZMAN. Coach is not dependent on any one particular trademark or design patent although Coach believes that the Coach and Stuart Weitzman names are important for its business. In addition, Coach owns several design patents and utility patents for its Coach and Stuart Weitzman branded products. Coach aggressively polices its trademarks and trade dress, and pursues infringers both domestically and internationally. It also pursues counterfeiters domestically and internationally through leads generated internally, as well as through its network of investigators, the Coach hotline and business partners around the world. 

The Company expects that its material trademarks will remain in full force and effect for as long as we continue to use and renew them. 

SEASONALITY 

Seasonality primarily impacts the Coach brand. Because Coach brand's products are frequently given as gifts, we experience seasonal variations in net sales, operating cash flows and working capital requirements, primarily related to seasonal holiday shopping. During the first fiscal quarter, we build inventory for the holiday selling season. In the second fiscal quarter, working capital requirements are reduced substantially as we generate higher net sales and operating income, especially during the holiday months of November and December. 

Fluctuations in net sales, operating income and operating cash flows of the Company in any fiscal quarter may be affected by the timing of wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales, including adverse weather conditions or other macroeconomic events. 

&#32;GOVERNMENT REGULATION 

Most of Coach's imported products are subject to duties, indirect taxes, quotas and non-tariff trade barriers that may limit the quantity of products that we may import into the U.S. and other countries or may impact the cost of such products. Coach is not materially restricted by quotas or other government restrictions in the operation of its business, however customs duties do represent a component of total product cost. To maximize opportunities, we operate complex supply chains through foreign trade zones, bonded logistic parks and other strategic initiatives such as free trade agreements. Additionally, Coach operates a direct import business in many countries worldwide. As a result, Coach is subject to stringent government regulations and restrictions with respect to its cross-border activity either by the various customs and border protection agencies or by other government agencies which control the quality and safety of Coach&#8217;s products. Coach maintains an internal global trade and customs organization to help manage its import/export activity. 

COMPETITION 

The global premium men's and women's handbag, accessories and footwear categories are highly competitive. Coach, Inc. competes primarily with European and American luxury and accessible luxury brands as well as private label retailers. Over the last several years these industries have grown, encouraging the entry of new competitors as well as increasing the competition from existing competitors. This increased competition drives interest in these brand loyal categories. 

EMPLOYEES 

As of July 2, 2016 , Coach brand employed approximately 15,100 globally, including both full and part time employees, but excluding seasonal and temporary employees. Of these employees, approximately 8,600 and 3,900 were full time and part time employees, respectively, in the global retail field. As of July 2, 2016 , Stuart Weitzman employed approximately 700 people globally, including both full and part-time employees, but excluding seasonal and temporary employees.
