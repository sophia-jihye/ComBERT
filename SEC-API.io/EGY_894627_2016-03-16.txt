BACKGROUND 

VAALCO Energy, Inc. is a Delaware corporation , incorporated in 1985 and h eadquarter ed at 9800 Richmond Avenue, Suite 700, Houston, Texas 77042 : telephone number is (713) 623-0 801 and the website is www.vaalco.com. &#160; Consolidated subsidiaries are VAALCO Gabon (Etame), Inc., VAALCO Production (Gabon), Inc., VAALCO Angola (Kwanza), Inc., VAALCO UK (North Sea), Ltd., VAALCO International, Inc., VAALCO Energy (EG), Inc., VAALCO Energy Mauritius (EG) Limited and VAALCO Energy (USA), Inc. As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K , the terms, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221;, &#8220;our&#8221;, and &#8220;VAALCO&#8221; mean VAALCO Energy, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires. 

VAALCO is a Houston-based independent energy company principally engaged in the acquisition, exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas. We own producing properties and conduct exploration activities as operator in Gabon, West Africa; we conduct exploration activities as an operator in Angola, West Africa, and we participate in exploration and development activities as a non-operator in Equatorial Guinea, West Africa. In the United States (&#8220;U.S.&#8221;) , we operate unconventional resource properties in North Texas and hold undeveloped leasehold acreage in Montana. We also own minor interests in conventional production activities as a non-operator in the U.S . &#160; 

STRATEGY 

Our strategy has been significantly impacted by the current commodity price environment, in which we have experienced unprecedented oil price declines beginning in the fall of 2014. These price declines have had, and will likely continue to have, a material adverse impact on our cash flows, results of operations and liquidity. As a result of these price declines and significant uncertainties regarding our liquidity, we have substantially adjusted our strategic focus. The consequences of these uncertainties, and our plans to address them, are described in Item 7. &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Current Developments,&#8221; &#8220; &#8212;Going Concern&#8221; and &#8220;&#8211;Capital Resources &#160; and Liquidity ,&#8221; and Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part III, Item 8 &#8211; &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#8221; See also Item 1A. &#8220;Risk Factors &#8211; Due to our substantial liquidity concerns, we may be unable to continue as a going concern.&#8221; 

If oil and natural gas prices continue to remain at the current depressed levels, we expect that for 2016 we will not generate adequate revenue to cover our operating expenses, we will generate losses from operations, and our cash flows will not be sufficient to cover our operating expenses. In addition, we experienced significant negative revisions to our estimated proved reserves based upon this low pricing environment. The low oil and natural gas prices affected the economic feasibility of developing our proved undeveloped reserves. These circumstances lead to the reclassification of certain of our resources from proved undeveloped reserves to unproved, which could have material adverse implications for the value of our company, cash flows, access to capital, liquidity and financial condition. 

In 2016, we embarked on a strategic alternatives initiative designed to identify and execute on that option which is most likely to result in the greatest value for our shareholders. We are considering multiple alternatives, including, but not limited to, additional debt or equity financing, a sale or farm-down of assets, delay of the discretionary portion of our capital spending to future periods, operating cost reductions, joint ventures and a potential sale or merger. The Board of Directors has formed a strategic committee to oversee the evaluation of our strategic alternatives. In addition, we have engaged Scotia Capital (USA) Inc. as financial advisor. We plan to secure funds necessary to continue as a going concern. However, our current cash position and our ability to access additional capital may limit our available opportunities or not provide sufficient cash for operations and there can be no guarantee of future capital acquisition or fundraising success. We are focused on a financially driven operating strategy while pursuing strategic growth opportunities.

G abon S egment 

Offshore &#8211; Etame Marin Block 

Our most significant asset, which accounts for the majority of our revenues, is the Etame Production Sharing Contract (&#8220;PSC&#8221;), which was signed in 1995, relate d to the Etame Marin block located offshore th e Republic of Gabon (&#8220;Gabon&#8221;) . The Etame Marin block covers an area of approximately 28,700 gross acres and consists of subsalt reservoirs that lie 20 miles offshore in water depths of approximately 250 feet. The Etame, Avouma/South Tchibala , Ebouri, Southeast Etame and North Tchibala fields are included in the block. Our working interest in the Etame Marin block is 28.1%, and we operate it on behalf of a consortium of five companies . The development is subject to a 7.5% back-in interest by the Government of Gabon which they assigned to a third party . 

Development 

In late 2012, we and our partners approved a development plan, consisting of two new platforms and a multi-well development drilling campaign. The drilling campaign included drilling three development wells from the Etame platform, three development wells from the Southeast Etame / North Tchibala (&#8220;SEENT&#8221;) platform and workovers of existing wells in the Etame Marin block. &#160; 

In May 2014, w e contracted the Constellation II drilling rig to use in the development drilling campaign. Following the installation of the Etame and SEENT platforms in the third quarter of 2014 , we commenced drilling the first well , the Etame 8-H, in November 2014 from the Etame platform. In December 2014, we shut-in the Etame 8-H well after determining that it was producing hydrogen sulfide (&#8220;H 2 S&#8221;). See &#8220;Hydrogen Sulfide Impact&#8221; below. In 2015, two new development wells were drilled and brought on production from the Etame platform. The Etame 10-H well was brought on production in the first quarter of 2015, and the Etame 12-H well, which began drilling in March 2015, was brought on production in the second quarter of 2015 . W e moved the rig early in the second quarter of 2015 to the SEENT platform . T hree new development wells were drilled and brought on production from th e &#160; SEENT platform in 2015 : the Southeast Etame 2-H, the North Tchibala 1-H and the North Tchibala 2-H. All the wells brought online subsequent to the Etame 8-H have not produced H 2 S. The two wells in the North Tchibala field are the first offshore Gabon wells to produce from the Dentale formation. The rig was moved to the Avouma platform in December 2015 to perform workovers on three wells: South Tchibala 2-H, Avouma 3-H and Avouma 2-H. At the end of 2015, one workover had been completed successfully and the second was underway. In January 2016, the workover campaign was complete. The South Tchibala 2-H was restored to production after being offline since August 2014, and the Avouma 2-H well resumed production at an increased rate. The Avouma 3-H, which was not on production prior to the workover, has been suspended and secured for future use. During the workover operations on the Avouma 3-H, the downhole equipment became lodged in the wellbore with efforts to remove it proving unsuccessful . In 2016, we released the Constellation II rig and no longer intend to drill any wells in 2016 on our Etame Marin block offshore Gabon. We expect to incur costs of up to $7 million related to the contract period from the rig release date through its expiration, for which a liability will be recognized in the first quarter of 2016. 

Production 

Production operations in the Etame Marin block include 12 wells from four platforms, plus three subsea wells across all fields tied back by pipelines to deliver oil and associated natural gas through a riser system to allow for delivery, processing, storage and ultimately offloading the oil from a leased Floating, Production, Storage and Offloading vessel (&#8220;FPSO&#8221;) anchored to the seabed on the block. With the FPSO limitations of approximately 25,000 BOPD and 30,000 barrels of total fluids per day, the challenge is to optimize production on both a near and long-term basis subject to investment and operational agreements between VAALCO and the consortium . During 201 5 and 2014 , aggregate production from the block was approximately 6.8 &#160; MMBbls ( 1.7 MMBbls net to us) and 5.8 MMBbls (1.4 

&#160;

&#160; 

MMBbls net to us), respectively. Our net share of barrels produced reflects an allocation of cost oil and profit oil, after reduction for a royalty of approximately 13%. 

Etame field &#160; &#8211; In 2001, the government of Gabon awarded VAALCO and its partners a 12,000 gross acre exploitation &#160; area for development of the Etame field. The exploitation area has a term of 20 years through June 2021 (a ten year primary term followed by two subsequent five year renewals) and also includes the Southeast Etame field which is discussed below. The Etame field was originally developed with a total of six subsea wells connected to the FPSO . In the third quarter of 2014, we &#160; completed the install ation of a new platform on the field and in the fourth quarter of 2014 commenced the development drilling campaign discussed above which included the drilling of three wells in the Etame field. There are currently five &#160; wells producing in the Etame field. 

Avouma/South Tchibala fiel d &#8211; In 2005 , &#160; the government of Gabon awarded VAALCO and its partners a 13,000 gross acre exploitation area for the joint development of the Avouma/South Tchibala field. The exploitation area has a term of 20 years through March 2025 (a ten year primary term followed by two subsequent five year renewals). In 2006, we installed a platform at the Avouma/South Tchibala field and subsequently drilled four development wells. At December 31, 2015, three wells were producing, and a workover was underway on the fourth well. As discussed above, the workover of the Avouma 3-H was unsuccessful, and it remains off production in 2016. 

Ebouri field &#160; &#8211; We drilled the Ebouri discovery well in January 2004. As a result of this discovery well, i n 2006, the government of Gabon awarded VAALCO and its partners a 3,700 gross acre exploitation area for the development of the Ebouri field. The exploitation area has a term of 20 years through July 2026 (a ten year primary term followed by two subsequent five year renewals). A platform was installed in July 2008 and three development wells were drilled and completed over the following two years . &#160; Currently one well in the Ebouri field is producing; the other two wells were shut-in for safety and marketability reasons in 2012 when the presence of H 2 S was discovered. See &#8220;Hydrogen Sulfide Impact&#8221; below. 

Southeast Etame field &#8211; &#160; The Southeast Etame 2-H well was brought on production in July 2015. It required re-drilling a segment of the well following a mechanical failure while drilling. The Southeast Etame 2-H well was drilled to develop an exploration discovery made in 2010. The well came on-line producing in excess of 3,000 gross BOPD. 

North Tchibala field &#160; &#8211; The North Tchibala 1-H well, targeting the Dentale formation also required re-drilling a segment of the well due to wellbore collapse during drilling. It was brought on production in mid-September 2015 at an initial rate of approximately 3,000 gross BOPD and is currently producing at approximately 1,500 BOPD. Oil discoveries were made in the North Tchibala field in the Dentale formation prior to our acquisition of the Etame Marin block in 1995. The North Tchibala 2-H, our second well drilled to the Dentale formation, was brought on production in December 2015 at an initial rate of approximately 500 gross BOPD. 

Hydrogen Sulfide Impact 

Four of our wells are currently shut-in for safety and marketability reasons because H 2 S was present in their production. In July 2012, we discovered the presence of H 2 S from two of the three producing wells in the Ebouri field (the Ebouri 3-H and Ebouri 4-H wells), and these wells were shut-in. In addition, H 2 S was first detected in January 2014 and later confirmed in July 2014 in the Etame 5-H well in the Etame field . The Etame 8-H well was drilled in the fourth quarter of 2014 and testing in the first quarter of 2015 confirmed the presence of H 2 S. Both the Etame 5-H and 8-H wells remain shut-in. No well drilled after the Etame 8 - H ha s produced H 2 S . 

To re-establish and maximize production from the impacted areas, additional capital investment will be required, including one or more processing facilities capable of removing H 2 S, recompletion of the temporarily abandoned wells and potentially drilling additional wells. W e evaluated fifteen alternatives which were ranked and high-graded. None of the alternatives were deemed economic at current forecasted oil prices, but we believe economic alternatives are available should oil prices recover sufficiently. In 2015, a total of $1. 9 &#160; million related to project design and evaluation was charged to expense. As of December 31, 2015, we have no proved reserves booked for the wells impacted by H 2 S , and their removal generated a 1 ,440 MBOE downward revision of our net proved reserves as compared to December 31, 2014. 

Exploration 

At December 31, 2015, we have no undeveloped leasehold costs related to Etame Marin block. &#160; The sixth extension period of the exploration acreage on this block expired at the end of July 2014, with us having fully met all of the obligations under its terms . 

Abandonment 

As part of securing the first of two &#160; five - year extensions to the Etame field production license to which we were entitled from the government of Gabon, we agreed to a cash funding arrangement for the eventual abandonment of all offshore wells, platforms and facilities on the Etame Marin block. The agreement was finalized in the first quarter of 2014 (effective 2011) providing for annual funding over a period of ten years at 12.14% of the total abandonment estimate for the first seven years with the remaining unfunded estimated costs spread over the last three years of the production license. 

We are required under the Etame production sharing contract to conduct abandonment studies to update the amounts being funded for the eventual abandonment of the offshore wells, platforms and facilities on the Etame Marin block. In January 2016, we completed a new abandonment study. Due to two new platforms and to the development wells drilled since the prior study, the amounts necessary to fund future abandonment obligations increased . This increase d the abandonment estimate used for funding purposes from $10.1 million net to 

&#160;

&#160; 

VAALCO on an undiscounted basis to $17. 2 million, and in turn the annual abandonment requirements net to VAALCO are expected to be $2. 6 million in 2016, $ 2.1 million in 2017 and 2018, and $1.3 million per year for 2019 to 2021. 

The abandonment estimate used for this purpose is approximately $61. 1 million ($17.2 million net to VAALCO) on an undiscounted basis. Through December 31, 2015, $18.3 million ($5.1 million net to VAALCO) on an undi scounted basis has been funded. &#160; The amounts paid are reimbursable through the cost account and are non-refundable. The obligation for abandonment of the Gabon offshore facilities is included in the Asset retirement obligation shown on our consolidated balance sheet. This cash funding is reflected under other long term assets as Abandonment funding &#160; on our consolidated balance sheet. 

Impairment 

In the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded an impairment loss of $98.3 million to write down our investment in certain fields comprising the Etame Marin block to fair value as a result of the declines in the forecasted oil prices used in the impairment testing and calculation. We recorded impairments each quarter of 2015 totaling $ 81.3 million for 2015 to write down our investment in all fields comprising the Etame Marin block, as well as various U.S. fields, primarily as a result of lower forecasted oil prices as well as higher costs for planned development wells used in the impairment evaluation. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of impairments. 

Onshore &#8211; Mutamba Iroru Block 

In November 2005, we signed a PSC for the Mutamba Iroru block onshore Gabon. Under t he five year contract we were awarded exploration rights to approximately 270,000 acres along the central coast of Gabon. We have a 50% operated working interest in the block (41% net working interest assuming Gabon exercises its back-in rights). After drilling two unsuccessful exploration wells on the block in 2009, we entered into a farmout agreement with Total Gabon to continue the exploration activities. Following seismic reprocessing, we drilled the N&#8217;Gongui No. 2 discovery well in 2012. 

Since mid-2014, we have been working to finalize a revised or new PSC with the government of Gabon to allow for development of the discovery and to maintain exploration rights on the block. &#160; A term sheet, which specifies financial and other obligations to be included in a new PSC, was signed in the third quarter of 2014. 

A letter received in September 2015 from the Gabon government expressed their view that the initial PSC has expired and encouraged us to expeditiously enter into a new PSC under the terms of the signed term sheet which, among other factors, honors &#160; the 2012 discovery and the accumulated cost account which is used in the ca lc ulation of Gabon production taxes. &#160; We and our joint venture partner do not agree with the government&#8217;s assertion that the initial &#160; PSC has expired . 

Meetings were held in October 2015 with the government regarding further amendments to the previously agreed terms of a new PSC, taking into account the substantial decrease in oil price s compared to the price environment when the term sheet was signed in the third quarter of 2014. We also met with the joint venture partner in October 2015 and continue to have discussions on the matter. 

We can provide no assurance that we &#160; will enter into a new PSC. &#160; We can provide no assurances as to either the approval of the PSC by the Government of Gabon, or the subsequent approval of a development area by the Government of Gabon. As discussed further in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements , the September 30, 2015 evaluation of the economic viability of the N&#8217;Gongui No. 2 well resulted in a determination that the costs no longer met the necessary criteria for suspended well costs , and accordingly we included the costs in exploration expense in the third quarter of 2015. 

Angola Segment 

Offshore &#8211;Block 5 

In November 2006, we signed a production sharing contract for Block 5, offshore Angola. The four year primary term, with an optional three year extension, awarded us exploration rights to 1.4 million acres offshore central Angola. VAALCO&#8217;s working interest is 40%. Additionally, we are required to carry the Angolan national oil company, Sonangol P&#38;P, for 10% of the work program. During the first four years of the contract, we were required to acquire and process seismic data and drill two exploration wells. The seismic commitments were met within the time period, but the wells were not drilled due to partner non-performance. 

The government-assigned working interest partner was delinquent in paying their share of the costs several times in 2009 and consequently was placed in a default position. By a governmental decree dated December 1, 2010, the delinquent partner was removed from the production sharing contract, and a one year time extension was granted for drilling the two exploration commitment wells. Additional extensions were subsequently granted by the Angolan government until November 30, 2014 to drill the two exploration commitment wells. 

In the fourth quarter of 2013, we received a written confirmation from The Ministry of Petroleum of Angola that the available 40% working interest in Block 5, offshore Angola, had been assigned to Sonangol E.P., the National Concessionaire. The Ministry of Petroleum also confirmed that Sonangol E.P. would assign the aforementioned participating interest to its exploration and production affiliate, Sonangol P&#38;P. The assignment was made effective on January 1, 2014. Sonangol EP and Sonangol P&#38;P agree that the unpaid amounts from the defaulted partner plus the amounts incurred on the partner&#8217;s behalf during the period prior to assignment of the working interest to Sonangol P&#38;P are the responsibility of Sonangol P&#38;P. We invoiced Sonangol P&#38;P for these amounts totaling $7.6 million plus interest in April 2014. Due to the uncertainty of collection, we recorded a full allowance totaling $7.6 million during 2011 through 2013 for the amount owed. Because this amount continued to be owed and due to slow payment history of the monthly cash call 

&#160;

&#160; 

invoices since their assignment date of January 1, 2014, we placed Sonangol P&#38;P in default in the first quarter of 2015. Sonangol E.P. acknowledged the legitimacy of the amounts owed and pledged to work to bring the Sonangol P&#38;P account to a current status. 

On March 14, 2016, we received $19.0 million from Sonangol P&#38;P as payment for the full amounts owed as of December 31, 2015, which included: (i) $8.1 million of partner receivables reported at December 31, 2015 (representing 2015 activity), (ii) the $7.6 million of unpaid costs assumed by Sonangol P&#38;P when they were assigned the participating interest in January 2014, and (iii) $3.2 million of interest as a result of being in default which we have not previously recognized in our financial results. As of December 31, 2015, we had $8.1 million reflected in Accounts with partners, net of an allowance of $7.6 million. As a result of this payment received subsequent to December 31, 2015, net income (loss) for the first quarter of 2016 will reflect the benefit for the reversal of the $7.6 million allowance and the recognition of the $3.2 million of default interest. 

&#160; 

Although Sonangol P&#38;P&#8217;s payment in March 2016 resolves the long outstanding amounts owed, there continues to be uncertainty about the future exploration of Block 5. To date, we have not been successful in farming-down part of our interest in Block 5 and our current liquidity is preventing us from pursuing the project without a partner. Due to the above circumstances regarding our intent and ability to pursue further exploration activities in Angola, we are recording a full impairment totaling $8.2 million of our undeveloped leasehold in the fourth quarter of 2015, the offset being a charge to Exploration expense, and writing off the $1.9 million in equipment inventory to Other operating loss, net. 

In October 2014, we entered into the Subsequent Exploration Phase (&#8220;SEP&#8221;), together with our working interest partner, Sonangol P&#38;P. The SEP extends the exploration period for an additional three year period such that the new expiry date for exploration activities is November 30, 2017. The SEP requires us and our partner to acquire 3D seismic and to drill two additional exploration wells. The seismic related commitment was completed in 2013. The two-well commitment under the primary exploration period carried over to the SEP period. In the first quarter of 2015, we drilled an unsuccessful exploratory well on the Kindele prospect, a post-salt objective, meeting one of the well commitments. 

A $10.0 million dollar assessment ($5.0 million dollars net to VAALCO) applied to each of the three remaining commitment exploration wells for which drilling has not commenced before November 30, 2017. Due to the current outlook for oil prices and the uncertainties about the timing for our partner to pay its share of future costs, there may be delays in drilling the remaining three wells. We have continued to classify the $15.0 million commitment for drilling these wells as long term restricted cash on our balance sheet. We believe that it is not probable that we will incur any liability related to not meeting the commitment deadline to drill the three remaining wells as stated in the production sharing agreement with the Angolan government as the government has caused multiple delays in the Company obtaining a partner to participate in the future well commitments. We will seek to extend the term of the exploration license and hence the well commitment deadline in the coming months. 

Equatorial Guinea Segment 

Offshore &#8211; Block P 

VAALCO has a 31% working interest in a portion of Block P, offshore Equatorial Guinea, which was acquired for $10.0 million in 2012 primarily for the exploration potential on the block. Prior to our acquisition in the block, two oil discoveries had been made on the block, establishing a development and production area in the block (the &#8220;PDA&#8221;). At the time the PDA was established, the block was divided into PDA and non-PDA portions, and we do not have a participating interest in the non-PDA portion of the block. The Ministry of Mines, Industry and Energy and GEPetrol, the current block operator, are currently reviewing a revised joint operating agreement which names us as operator. Given the current depressed commodity price cycle, it is likely we will minimize any near-term expenditures and expenses in Equatorial Guinea. We and our partners are also working on timing and budgeting for development and exploration activities in the PDA, including the approval of a development and production plan. Development project economics are being re-evaluated considering the continued depressed oil prices and the expected decrease in development costs associated with the fall in oil prices. The production sharing contract covering the PDA provides for a development and production period of twenty-five years from the date of approval of a development and production plan. &#160; 

United States Segment 

We acquired a 640 acre lease in the Hefley field (Granite Wash formation) in North Texas in December 2010 , which is held by production from two wells drilled and brought on line in 2011 and 2012. During 201 5 , the two wells produced approximately 3,000 Bbls of condensate and 1 81 &#160; MMcf net to VAALCO. Due to declines in oil and natural gas prices, we recorded an impairment charge of $ 3.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 related to the Hefley and other U.S. field s . No capital expenditures occurred in 2015, and no additional capital expenditures are anticipated in 201 6 for this property. 

In September 2011, we acquired a 65% working interest in approximately 22,000 gross acres (14,300 net acres) covering the Middle Bakken and deeper formations in the East Poplar unit and the Northwest Poplar field in Roosevelt County, Montana. The working interest was subsequently reduced to 50% and 11,000 net acres in December 2012. &#160; Pursuant to the terms of the acquisition, we were required to drill three wells at our sole cost, all three of which were unsuccessful . The related leases are held by production from other zones. &#160; Due to the sustained low oil prices, we determined that it is uneconomic for us to pursue exploration on these leases, and we charged the remaining unimpaired costs of $1.2 million to exploration expense in 2015. 

&#160;

RESERVE INFORMATION 

Net Proved Reserves 

In accordance with the current guidelines of the SEC, estimates of future net cash flow from our properties and the present value thereof are made using an unweighted, arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each of the 12 months the year. Such prices are held constant throughout the life of the properties except where such guidelines permit alternate treatment, including the use of fixed and determinable contractual price escalations. For 2015, such average prices used for our reserve estimates reflected consistently low prices during the year and were $49.36 per Bbl for crude oil from Gabon, $40.43 per Bbl of U.S. crude oil and condensate and $2.35 per Mcf for U.S. natural gas. This compares to much higher average prices for 2014 of $98.88 per Bbl, $86.49 per Bbl and $5.193 per Mcf, respectively. Further declines in prices could result in the estimated quantities and present values of our reserves being reduced. 

Reserves are reported by geographic area. International consists solely of net proved reserves related to the Etame Marin block located offshore Gabon in west Africa. We have no proved reserves related to our other international ventures. There have been no estimates of total proved net oil or gas reserves filed with or included in reports to any federal authority or agency other than the SEC since the beginning of the last fiscal year . Natural gas volumes as of December 31, 2015 include natural gas liquid (&#8220;NGL&#8221;) barrels which were converted to Mmcf using the relative prices of the products. NGLs represent less than 1.5% of our total proved reserves at December 31, 2015 on a barrel of oil equivalent basis. &#160; The table below sets forth our estimated net proved reserve quantities for the years ended December 31, 201 5 , 201 4 , and 201 3 as prepared by Netherland, Sewell &#38; Associates, Inc. (&#8220;NSAI&#8221;), independent petroleum engineers.

The information set forth in the foregoing tables includes revisions for certain reserve estimates attributable to proved properties included in the preceding year&#8217;s estimates. Such revisions are the result of additional information from subsequent completions and production history from the properties involved or the result of a decrease (or increase) in the projected economic life of such properties resulting from changes in product prices. Moreover, crude oil amounts shown for Gabon are recoverable under a service contract and the reserves in place at the end of the contract remain the property of the Gabon government. 

We do not book proved reserves on discoveries until such time as a development plan has been prepared and approved by our partners in the discovery. Furthermore, if a government agreement that the reserves are commercial is required to develop the field, this approval must have been received prior to booking any reserves . 

The net negative revisions of previous estimates in 2015 were primarily a result of the loss of 3 .5 years of production due to lower oil and natural gas prices (2, 705 M BOE ) and the removal of sour reserves (1,440 M B bl), partially offset by positive revisions due to the performance of wells drilled in the 2014-2015 drilling campaign exceeding expectations ( 370 M B bl ) . The oil price used to value reserves for 2015 was $49.36 per Bbl, which is almost 50% lower than the $98.88 per Bbl used for 2014 reserves . This price decrease 

&#160;

&#160; 

accelerated the economic cutoff date for the Etame Marin block reserves from December 2021 as of the end of 2014 to May 2018 as of the end of 2015. Investigations into the cause of the crude souring indicate that the effect is not as widespread as previously projected and the volume of sour resources is less than earlier estimates. As discussed in &#8220;Hydrogen Sulfide Impact&#8221; above, c rude sweetening options were studied extensively over the course of 2015 ; h owever, all of the options were uneconomic in the current commodity price environment. 

The net positive r evisions of previous estimates in 2014 were primarily due to better reservoir performance at the Avouma/South Tchibala field (1,507 MBbls) and a combination of better reservoir performance from existing wells at Etame, and revisions to proved undeveloped reserves at Etame (1,122 MBbls). The Ebouri field proved undeveloped reserves were revised downward (300 MBbls) due to higher costs of developing the reserves rendering them uneconomic. &#160; In 2014, the extensions and discoveries were associated with the booking of the Southeast Etame and North Tchibala reserves. 

The net positive r evisions of previous estimates in 2013 were primarily due to better reservoir performance at the Etame field (800 MBbls). Extensions and discover ies in 2013 were due to the drilling of the Avouma 3H well which extended the reservoir boundary further to the north at the Avouma field. 

There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures, including many factors beyond our control. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner, and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and &#160; judgment. The quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered, production and operating costs, the amount and timing of future development expenditures and future oil and natural gas sales prices may all differ from those assumed in these estimates. The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows should not be construed as the current market value of the estimated oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties. 

Proved Undeveloped Reserves 

We annually review all proved undeveloped reserves (&#8220;PUDs&#8221;) to ensure an appropriate plan for development exists. Continued declines in oil and natural gas prices in 2015 have caused our PUDs to become uneconomic to develop at the prices required by the SEC guidelines. Accordingly, we have no PUDs at December 31, 2015 compared with 5,036 MBbls of PUDs December 31, 2014. Reserves related to the successful wells drilled in 2015 were transferred to proved developed producing reserves during the year. The remaining PUD reserves were reclassified to unproved due to lower oil prices. 

Controls o ver Reserve Estimates 

Our policies and practices regarding internal controls over the recording of reserves is structured to objectively and accurately estimate our oil and natural gas reserves quantities and present values in compl iance with Securities Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) regulations and generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;). Compliance with these rules and regulations with respect to our reserves is the responsibility of a reservoir engineer, who is our principal engineer. Our principal engineer has over 20 years of experience in the oil and natural gas industry, including over 10 years as a reserve evaluator, trainer or manager and is a qualified reserves estimator, as defined by the Society of Petroleum Engineers&#8217; standards. Further professional qualifications include a Bachelor&#8217;s and Master&#8217;s degree in petroleum engineering, extensive internal and external reserve training, and asset evaluation and management. In addition, the principal engineer is an active participant in industry reserve seminars, professional industry groups and has been a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers for over 20 years. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors meets periodically with management to discuss matters and policies related to reserves . 

Our controls over reserve estimat ion include retaining NSAI &#160; as our independent petroleum and geological firm for all years presented . We provide information to NSAI about our oil and natural gas properties which includ es, but is not limited to, production profiles, ownership and production sharing rights, prices , costs and future drilling plans. NSAI prepar es its own estimates of the reserves attributable to our properties. All of the information regarding reserves in this A nnual R eport on Form 10-K is derived from the report of NSAI , &#160; a worldwide leader of petroleum property analysis for industry and financial organizations and government agencies. &#160; NSAI was founded in 1961 and performs consulting petroleum engineering services under Texas Board of Professional Eng ineers Registration No. F-2699. The report of NSAI is filed as an exhibit to this A nnual R eport on Form 10-K. &#160; Within NSAI, the technical persons primarily responsible for preparing the estimates set forth in the NSAI reserves report incorporated herein are Mr. John R. Cliver and Mr. Mike K. Norton. Mr. Cliver, a Licensed Professional Engineer in the State of Texas, has been practicing consulting petroleum engineering at NSAI since 2009 and has over 5 years of prior industry experience. He graduated from Rice University in 2004 with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Chemical Engineering and from University of Texas at Austin in 2008 with a Master of Business Administration Degree. Mr. Norton, a Licensed Professional Geoscientist in the State of Texas, has been practicing consulting petroleum geoscience at NSAI since 1989 and has over 10 years of prior industry experience. He graduated from Texas A&#38;M University in 1978 with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Geology. Both technical principals meet or exceed the education, training, and experience requirements set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers; both are proficient in judiciously applying industry standard practices to engineering and geoscience evaluations as well as applying SEC and other industry reserves definitions and guidelines.

CUSTOMERS 

Prior to the second quarter in 2014, we sold oil from Gabon under contracts with Mercuria Trading NV (&#8220;Mercuria&#8221;) beginning with the calendar year 2011. Beginning in the second quarter of 2014 and through April 2015, &#160; we switched to an agency model by contracting with a third party, The Vitol Group, to sell our crude oil on the spot market &#160; for a fixed per barrel fee . Beginning in May 2015, we have sold our crude oil production from Gabon under a term contract with pricing based upon an average of Dated Brent in the month of lifting, adjusted for location and market factors. The contracted purchasers were TOTSA Total Oil Trading SA (&#8220;Total&#8221;) for May through July of 2015 and Glencore Energy UK Ltd. (&#8220;Glencore&#8221;) for August through December of 2015. The contract with Glencore U.K. ends in July 2016. Sales o f oil to Glencore U . K . and Total w ere 38% and 27% of total revenues for 2015, respectively, with less than 1% related to U.S. production. 

&#160;

&#160; 

EMPLOYEES 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 125 full-time employees, 80 of whom were located in Gabon and &#160; seven of whom were located in Angola. We are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements, although most of the national employees in Gabon are members of the NEOP (National Organization of Petroleum Workers) union. We believe relations with employees are satisfactory. 

COMPETITION 

The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive . Competition is particularly intense from other independent operators and from major oil and natural gas companies with respect to acquisitions of desirable oil and natural gas properties and contracting for drilling equipment . There is also competition for the hiring of experienced personnel. In addition, the drilling, producing, processing and marketing of oil and natural gas is affected by a number of factors beyond our control &#160; which may delay drilling, increase prices and have other adverse effects which cannot be accurately predicted. 

Our competition for acquisitions, exploration, development and production includes the major oil and natural gas companies in addition to numerous independent oil companies, individual proprietors, investors and others. Many of these competitors possess financia l , &#160; technical and personnel resources substantially in excess of those available to us , giving those competitors an enhanced ability to evaluate and acquire desirable leases properties or prospects. Our ability to generate reserves in the future will depend on our ability to select and acquire suitable producing properties and/or developing prospects for future drilling and exploration. 

INSURANCE &#160; 

We are not fully insured against all risks associated with our business either because such insurance is unavailable or because premium costs are considered uneconomic. A material loss not fully covered by insurance could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We maintain insurance at levels we believe to be customary in the industry to limit our financial exposure in the event of a substantial environmental claim resulting from sudden, unanticipated and accidental discharges of certain prohibited substances in to the environment. Such insurance might not cover the complete claim amount and would not cover fines or penalties for a violation of environmental law. 

ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS 

Gener al 

Our activities are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control in Gabon, Angola and the &#160; U.S., and will be subject to the laws and regulations of Equatorial Guinea when exploration drilling occurs in those countries. Although no assurances can be made, we believe that, absent the occurrence of an extraordinary event, compliance with existing laws, rules and regulations regulating the release of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment will not have a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position with respect to its existing assets and operations. We cannot predict what effect future regulation or legislation, enforcement policies, and claims for damages to property, employees, other persons and the environment resulting from our operations could have on our activities. In part because they are developing countries, it is unclear how quickly and to what extent Gabon, Angola or Equatorial Guinea will increase their regulation of environmental issues in the future; any significant increase in the regulation or enforcement of environmental issues by Gabon, Angola or Equatorial Guinea could have a material effect on us . Developing countries, in certain instances, have patterned environmental laws after those in the U.S., which are discussed below. However, the extent to which any environmental laws are enforced in developing countries varies significantly. 

In the U.S. , environmental laws and regulations may require the acquisition of permits before drilling commences, the installation of pollution control equipment for our operations, special handling or disposal of materials used in our operations, or remedial measures to mitigate pollution from our operations or on the properties on which we operate. These laws and regulations may also restrict the types of substances used in our drilling operations which can be used or released into the environment or limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands such as wetlands or sensitive protected areas or restrict the rate of production below the rate th at would otherwise be possible. 

As a general matter, the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry has been and continues to be the subject of increasing scrutiny and regulation by environmental authorities. The Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;) has identified environmental compliance by the energy extraction sector as one of its enforcement initiatives for 2014-2016 (and has solicited comments on continuing this initiative for fiscal years 2017-2019). The trend has been the enactment of new or more stringent requirements on the oil and natural gas industry. These changes result in increased operating costs, and additional changes could results in further increases in our costs for environmental compliance. 

Environmental Regulations in the United States 

Superfund 

We currently own or lease, and in the past we h ave owned or leased, properties that have been used for the exploration and production of oil and natural gas for many years. Although we ha ve used operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under 

&#160;

&#160; 

locations where such wastes have been taken for disposal. In addition, some of these properties are or have been operated by third parties. We ha ve no control over such entities&#8217; treatment of hydrocarbons or other solid wastes and the manner in which such substances may have been disposed or released. State and federal laws applicable to oil and natural gas wastes and properties have gradually become stricter over time. We could, in the future, be required to remediate property, including groundwater, containing or impacted by previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed or released by prior owners or operators, or property contamination, including groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators) or to perform remedial plugging operations to prevent future contamination or mitigate existing contamination. 

The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (&#8220;CERCLA&#8221;), also known as the &#8220;Superfund&#8221; law, generally imposes joint and several liability for costs of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damages, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons with respect to the release into the environment of substances designated under CERCLA as hazardous substances (&#8220;Hazardous Substances&#8221;). These classes of persons, or so-called potentially responsible parties (&#8220;PRPs&#8221;), include the current and certain past owners and operators of a facility where there has been a release or threat of release of a Hazardous Substance and persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of Hazardous Substances found at a facility. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some cases, third parties to take actions in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the PRPs the costs of such action. 

Although CERCLA generally exempts &#8220;petroleum&#8221; from the definition of a Hazardous Substance, in the course of its operations, we ha ve generated and will generate substances that may fall within CERCLA&#8217;s definition of a Hazardous Substance and may have disposed of these substances at disposal sites owned and operated by others. We may also be the owner or operator of sites on which Hazardous Substances have been released. To its knowledge, neither VAALCO nor its predecessors have been designated as a PRP by the EPA under CERCLA; we also do not know of any prior owners or operators of its properties that are named as PRPs related to their ownership or operation of such properties. States such as Texas have comparable statutes which may cover substances (including petroleum) in addition to those covered under CERCLA. In the event contamination is discovered at a site on which we are or has been an owner or operator or to which we sent regulated substances, we could be liable for costs of investigation and remediation and damages to natural resources. 

Solid and Hazardous Waste Handling 

We generate wastes, including hazardous wastes that are subject to the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (&#8220;RCRA&#8221;) and comparable state statutes. The EPA and various state agencies have limited the disposal options for certain wastes, including wastes designated as hazardous under RCRA and comparable state statutes (&#8220;Hazardous Wastes&#8221;). Furthermore, although most oil and natural gas wastes generally are exempt from regulation as hazardous waste, not all current comparable state statutes may provide this exemption, and certain wastes generated may be subject to RCRA or comparable state statutes. It is possible that certain wastes generated by our oil and natural gas operations that are currently exempt may in the future be designated as &#160; Hazardous Wastes under RCRA or other applicable statutes and, therefore, may be subject to more rigorous and costly operating and disposal requirements. 

Clean Water Act 

The Clean Water Act (&#8220;CWA&#8221;) and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge (including spills and leaks) of pollutants, including produced waters and other oil and natural gas wastes, into state waters and waters of the U.S. , a term broadly defined. These controls have become more stringent over the years, and it is probable that additional restrictions will be imposed in the future. Generally, permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants. The CWA provides for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for unauthorized discharges of oil and hazardous substances and of other pollutants. It imposes substantial potential liability for the costs of removal or remediation associated with discharges of oil or other pollutants. The CWA also prohibits the discharge of fill materials to regulated waters, including wetlands, without a permit. State laws governing discharges to water also provide varying civil, criminal and administrative penalties and impose liabilities in the case of a discharge of petroleum or its derivatives, or other pollutants, into state waters. In addition, the EPA has promulgated regulations that may require us to obtain permits to discharge storm water runoff, including discharges associated with construction activities. In the event of an unauthorized discharge of wastes, we may be liable for penalties as well as cleanup and response costs. 

Oil Pollution Act 

The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (&#8220;OPA&#8221;), which amends and augments the oil spill provisions of the CWA, imposes certain duties and liabilities on certain &#8220;responsible parties&#8221; related to the prevention of oil spills and damages resulting from such spills in or threatening U . S . waters or adjoining shorelines. A liable &#8220;responsible party&#8221; includes the owner or operator of a facility, vessel or pipeline that is a source of an oil discharge or that poses the substantial threat of discharge, or in the case of offshore facilities, the lessee or permittee of the area in which a discharging facility is located. OPA assigns joint and several liability, without regard to fault, to each liable party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages. Although defenses exist to the liability imposed by OPA, they are limited. In the event of an oil discharge or substantial threat of discharge, we may be liable for costs and damages. 

&#160;

&#160; 

The OPA also imposes ongoing requirements on a responsible party, including proof of financial responsibility to cover at least some costs in a potential spill. Certain amendments to the OPA that were enacted in 1996 require owners and operators of offshore facilities that have a worst case oil spill potential of more than 1,000 Bbls to demonstrate financial responsibility in amounts ranging from $10.0 million in specified state waters and $35.0 million in federal outer continental shelf (&#8220;OCS&#8221;) waters, with higher amounts, up to $150.0 million based upon worst case oil-spill discharge volume calculations. In light of recent events, it is possible that these requirements may become more stringent. We believe that currently we have established adequate proof of financial responsibility for our offshore facilities. 

Hydraulic Fracturing 

Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand (or other proppant) and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. Hydraulic fracturing activities are typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions but not as extensively at the federal level. For example, the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (&#8220;SDWA&#8221;) protects underground sources of drinking water through the EPA&#8217;s underground injection control (&#8220;UIC&#8221;) program, which regulates the subsurface emplacement of fluid. The definition of &#8220;underground injection&#8221; in the SDWA expressly excludes the &#8220;underground injection of fluids or propping agents (other than diesel fuel) pursuant to hydraulic fracturing operations.&#8221; Due to public concerns raised regarding potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater quality, there have been recent developments at the federal and state levels that could result in regulation of hydraulic fracturing becoming more stringent and costly. 

I n February 2014, the EPA issued guidance regarding federal regulatory authority under the SDWA over hydraulic fracturing using diesel fuel, specifying that owners or operators of wells who inject diesel fuels for hydraulic fracturing related to oil and natural gas operations must obtain a permit under the Class II well category under the EPA&#8217;s UIC program regulations before injection begins. This guidance also identified fluids associated with five Chemical Abstracts Services ( &#8220; CAS &#8221; ) registry numbers as the most appropriate interpretation of the statutory term &#8220;diesel fuels&#8221; to use for permitting hydraulic fracturing that uses diesel fuels under the EPA&#8217;s UIC program. This guidance also clarified that diesel fuels used as a component of drilling muds or pipe joint compounds used in the well construction process or in motorized equipment at the surface are not subject to UIC Class II permitting requirements because such uses of diesel fuels are considered to be part of the well construction process and not diesel fuels injected for purposes of hydraulic fracturing. 

The EPA also commenced a study of the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing in 2012 and released a draft of the study in 2015. This study and EPA&#8217;s enforcement initiative for the energy extraction sector could result in additional regulatory requirements that could make it difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business. 

In addition, a committee of the U.S. House of Representatives conducted an investigation of hydraulic fracturing practices. Moreover, in past sessions legislation was introduced before Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing by eliminating the current exemption in the Safe Drinking Water Act, and, further, to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process. Also, some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances or that require disclosure of the chemicals in the fracturing fluids. Additionally some states, localities and river basin conservancy districts have exercised or considered exercising their regulatory powers to limit, and in some cases place a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing. 

The Bureau of Land Management (&#8220;BLM&#8221;) has regulated hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands since 1983, but the BLM&#8217;s historic regulations were not written to address modern hydraulic fracturing activities. The BLM has finalized revisions to its hydraulic fracturing regulations. Among other things, the BLM rules impose new requirements to validate the protection of groundwater, disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing and higher standards for the interim storage of recovered waste fluids from hydraulic fracturing. This rule is the subject of legal challenges and a federal district court in Wyoming has issued a preliminary injunction temporarily delaying implementation of the BLM rules. 

Further, in response to a petition filed in January 2012 under section 21 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (&#8220;TSCA&#8221;), the EPA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, RIN 2070-AJ93 (&#8220;ANPR&#8221;), which was published in the Federal Register on May 19, 2014. The EPA indicated that the purpose of this ANPR is soliciting public comment on the information that should be reported or disclosed for hydraulic fracturing chemical substances and mixtures and the mechanism for obtaining this information, minimizing reporting burdens and avoiding duplication of state and other federal agency information collections, and soliciting comments on incentives and recognition programs that &#8220;could be used to support the development and use of safer chemicals in hydraulic fracturing&#8221;. The public comment period for this ANPR was extended for an additional month and ended on September 18, 2014. The next phase of this regulatory rulemaking process is still pending at the EPA. Further, in 2015, the EPA proposed wastewater pretreatment standards for discharges of wastewater pollutants from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly-owned treatment works. 

If new laws or regulations imposing significant restrictions or conditions on hydraulic fracturing activities are adopted in areas where we conduct business, we could incur substantial compliance costs and such requirements could adversely delay or restrict our ability to conduct fracturing activities on our U.S. assets. 

National Environmental Policy Act 

Oil and natural gas exploration and production activities on federal lands may be subject to the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, which requires federal agencies, including the Department of Interior, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will prepare an Environmental Assessment that 

&#160;

&#160; 

assesses the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed Environmental Impact Statement that may be made available for public review and comment. To the extent that our current exploration and production activities, as well as proposed exploration and development plans, on federal lands require governmental permits that are subject to the requirements of NEPA, this process has the potential to delay or impose additional conditions upon the development of oil and natural gas projects. 

Endangered Species Act 

The Endangered Species Act (&#8220;ESA&#8221;) was established to protect endangered and threatened species. Pursuant to that act, if a species is listed as threatened or endangered, restrictions may be imposed on activities adversely affecting that species&#8217; habitat. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service must also designate the species&#8217; critical habitat and suitable habitat as part of the effort to ensure survival of the species. A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to land use and may materially delay or prohibit land access for oil and natural gas development. If we were to have a portion of our leases designated as critical or suitable habitat, it may adversely impact the value of the affected leases. 

Climate Change Legislation 

More stringent laws and regulations relating to climate change and greenhouse gases (&#8220;GHGs&#8221;) may be adopted in the future and could cause us to incur material expenses in complying with them. In the absence of comprehensive federal legislation on GHG emission control, the EPA attempted to require the permitting of GHG emissions; although the Supreme Court struck down the permitting requirements, it upheld the EPA&#8217;s authority to control GHG emissions when a permit is required due to emissions of other pollutants. In addition, both houses of the U . S . Congress have considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases without any ultimate resolution and many states have taken or considered legal measures to reduce GHG emissions, including, in a few locations, the consideration of a cap and trade program. Most cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions or major producers of fuels to acquire and surrender emission allowances. Depending on the regulatory reach of the EPA&#8217;s rules or new Clean Air Act (&#8220;CAA&#8221;) legislation or implementing regulations restricting the emission of GHGs or state programs, we could incur significant costs to control our emissions and comply with regulatory requirements. In addition, the EPA adopted a mandatory GHG emissions reporting program which imposes reporting and monitoring requirements on various industries including onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities and onshore oil and natural gas processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities. We will incur costs to monitor, keep records of, and report emissions of GHGs. We do not believe that our compliance with applicable monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements under the reporting rule will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. 

Because of the lack of any comprehensive legislative program addressing GHGs, there is a great deal of uncertainty as to how federal and state regulation of GHGs will unfold and how it may impact our industry. Moreover, the federal, regional, state and local regulatory initiatives could adversely affect the marketability of the oil and natural gas that we produce. The impact of such future programs cannot be predicted, but we do not expect our operations to be affected any differently than other similarly situated domestic competitors. 

In 2015, the EPA proposed new rules limiting methane emissions from the oil and natural gas industry. The proposed rules, if adopted, would amend the air emissions rules for oil and natural gas production sources and natural gas processing and transmission sources to include new standards for methane. In January 2016, BLM has proposed rules governing flaring and venting on public and tribal lands, which could require additional equipment and emissions controls as well as inspection requirements. Simultaneously with the proposal of the methane rules, the EPA released a proposal soliciting comments on two alternatives for aggregating multiple surface sites into a single-source of air quality permitting purposes. Depending upon the alternative selected by the EPA, sites which currently would not require permitting under the Clean Air Act could require permits, an outcome that could result in costs and delays to our operations; however, given the present uncertainty regarding this rule, the extent and magnitude of that impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated. 

Air Emissions 

Our operations are subject to local, state and federal regulations for the control of emissions from sources of air pollution. At the f ederal level, the CAA is the primary statute governing air pollution. Federal and state laws require new and modified sources of air pollutants to obtain permits prior to commencing construction. Major sources of air pollutants are subject to more stringent, federally imposed requirements including additional permits. Federal and state laws designed to control hazardous (or toxic) air pollutants might require installation of additional controls. Administrative enforcement actions for failure to comply with air pollution regulations or permits are generally resolved by payment of monetary fines and correction of any identified deficiencies. Alternatively, regulatory agencies could bring lawsuits for civil penalties or require us to forego construction, modification or operation of certain air emission sources. 

On April 17, 2012, the EPA issued final rules to subject oil and natural gas operations to regulation under the NSPS and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (&#8220;NESHAPS&#8221;) programs under the CAA, and to impose new and amended requirements under both programs. The EPA rules provide &#8220;New Source Performance Standards&#8221; (&#8220;NSPS&#8221;) for completions of hydraulically fractured natural gas wells. These standards are applicable to new hydraulically fractured wells and also to existing wells that are refractured. 

&#160;

&#160; 

For each well completion operation with hydraulic fracturing begun prior to January 1, 2015, these standards require owners/operators to reduce volatile organic compound (&#8220;VOC&#8221;) emissions from natural gas not sent to the gathering line during well completion by flaring using a completion combustion device, with the option to capture the natural gas emissions using reduced emission completions (&#8220;REC&#8221; aka &#8220;green completions&#8221;). For each well completion with hydraulic fracturing begun on or after January 1, 2015, operators must capture the natural gas and make it available for use or sale, which can be done through the use of green completions. 

Further, these regulations also establish specific new requirements, effective in 2012, for emissions from compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage vessels, natural gas processing plants and certain other equipment. These rules may require changes to our operations, including the installation of new equipment to control emissions. We are currently evaluating the effect these rules will have on our bus iness, which consists of two operated producing wells in North Texas. We have no plans at this time to pursue more U.S. properties. 

OSHA and Other Regulations 

To the extent not preempted by other applicable laws, we &#160; are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (&#8220;OSHA&#8221;) and comparable state statutes, where applicable. The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of CERCLA and similar state statutes, where applicable, require us to organize, maintain and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations.
