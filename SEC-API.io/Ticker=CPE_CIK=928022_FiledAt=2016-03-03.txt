Overview 

&#160; 

Callon Petroleum Company has been engaged in the exploration, development, acquisition and production of oil and natural gas properties since 1950. As used herein, the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;Callon,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; refer to Callon Petroleum Company and its predecessors and subsidiaries unless the context requires otherwise. 

&#160; 

Our asset base is concentrated in the Midland Basin, a sub-basin located within the broader Permian Basin. Our drilling activity during 2015 focused on the horizontal development of several prospective intervals, including multiple levels of the Wolfcamp formation and, more recently, the Lower Spraberry shale. As a result of our acquisition and horizontal development efforts, our net daily production for calendar year &#160; 2015 &#160; as compared to calendar year 2014 grew approximately 70% to &#160; 9,610 BOE/d (approximately 80% oil) . &#160; We have assembled a multi-year inventory of potential horizontal well locations and intend to add to this inventory through delineation drilling of emerging zones on our existing acreage and acquisition of additional locations through acreage purchases, joint ventures and asset swaps. In response to the low commodity price environment, we announced in early February our plans to shift from a two rig program to a single active rig in March 2016. We intend to monitor opportunities to redeploy our second drilling rig on our asset base if market conditions improve or in conjunction with potential acquisitions of new acreage. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015 , our net proved reserve volumes increased 65% as compared to year-end 2014 to &#160; 54.3 MMBOE, comprised of 80% crude oil including &#160; 43.3 MMBbls with the remaining 20% natural gas of 65.5 Bcf. A pproximately &#160; 53% &#160; of our net proved year-end 2015 reserves were proved developed on a BOE basis. 

&#160; 

Our Business Strategy 

&#160; 

Our goal is to enhance stockholder value through the execution of the following strategy with an emphasis on safety : 

&#160; 

Maintain fiscal discipline, financial liquidity and our capacity to capitalize on inorganic growth opportunities. We recognize that it takes fiscal discipline and a keen focus on controlling capital allocation and operating costs to operate in a commodity price environment where prices have fallen significantly over the past 18 months. To that end, we intend to continue to work with our service partners to reduce drilling, completion and operating costs while also working internally to reduce our overhead costs. For example, in early 2016, we announced plans to moderate our development pace and preserve liquidity by transitioning to a one-rig drilling program that allows us to reduce our 2016 operational capital budget by nearly 35% but which we believe will still provide for year-over-year production growth. We also raised approximately &#160; $1 83.7 &#160; million in gross proceeds from two common equity offerings during 2015 to support recent acquisitions and our ongoing development efforts in the Midland Basin. Collectively, we believe that the reduction in planned capital expenditures, a 20% increase in the borrowing base under our senior secured revolving credit facility received after our fall 2015 redetermination and the successful raise of proceeds through the sale of common stock during 2015 position us to maintain sufficient liquidity and remain flexible in an uncertain commodity price environment with the ability to increase our acreage footprint through potential acquisition opportunities. 

&#160; 

Drive production and maximize resource recovery and reserve growth through horizontal development of our resource base. &#160; We entered the Midland Basin in 2009 focused on a vertical development program that allowed us to amass a comprehensive database of subsurface geologic and other technical data. This internally derived data in conjunction with our analysis of offsetting and nearby industry activity and best practices, positioned us in 2012 to transition to efficient, multi-pad horizontal development. The success of our horizontal development is reflected in our significant year-over-year production growth, which increased &#160; 70% in 2015 to 3,508 MB OE ( 9,610 B OE /d) compared to 2,062 M B OE ( 5,649 B O E /d) in 2014. Additionally, we grew reserves 65% in 2015 to 54.3 MMB OE from 32.8 MMB OE at year-end 2014, including reserve extensions and discoveries replacement in 2015 of &#160; 22.4 MMBOE . We intend to continue to grow the contribution of horizontal production volumes, both from our existing properties and from properties acquired in recent acquisitions, as we continue to execute a resource development program almost exclusively focused on horizontal development. 

&#160; 

Expand our drilling portfolio through evaluation of existing acreage. Given the challenging commodity price environment, capital allocation decisions have become increasingly important. We have shifted almost all of our near-term development focus to the Lower Spraberry given its potential for strong capital efficiency and returns on capital. However, we intend to continue our efforts to expand 

&#160;

our drilling inventory through selective delineation of additional zones. During 2015, we successfully added the Middle Spraberry to our list of producing zones within our acreage, increasing our producing zone count to five distinct zones including the Lower Spraberry, Wolfcamp A and the Upper and Lower Wolfcamp B zones. We believe incremental opportunities exist to selectively target other prospective zones across various positions of our acreage, including the Clearfork, Jo Mill, Wolfcamp C and Cline (also called the Wolfcamp D) formations (in order of relative depth). In addition, we will continue to monitor the efficiency of our horizontal wells related to reservoir drainage over time, and will pursue down-spacing initiatives within target zones if we believe overall returns would be enhanced. For example, based on an analysis of our own producing wells coupled with our assessment of peer activity, we recently increased our Lower Spraberry wells per section from seven wells-per-section to ten wells-per-section. We will continue to evaluate our well spacing with an eye towards maximizing resource recovery. 

&#160; 

Pursue selective acquisitions in the Permian Basin. During 2015, we continued to acquire and trade acreage in the Midland Basin despite a volatile commodity price environment which is typically characterized by divergent views of asset valuation. In 2015, w e acquired nearly 628 net acres located in our existing Carp e Diem and CaBo area (Cassleman- Bohannon fields) located primarily in Midland and Andrews Counties for approximately $29. 8 million. We also recently acquired 305 net acres located in our CaBo area for approximately $9.3 million. Together, the acquisitions added production of 530 BOE/d (81% oil) and added 56 net potential horizontal drilling locations across all prospective zones, including 42 net potential horizontal drilling locations in currently producing Middle Spraberry, Lower Spraberry, Wolfcamp A and Wolfcamp B zones. Importantly, since the acquired acreage was located within our existing Central Midland Basin area where we have focused our near-term development efforts, we are able to immediately earn returns on these incremental investments. We also remain committed to our &#8220;bolt-on&#8221; strategy of expanding our asset base by identifying and pursuing smaller blocks of offsetting acreage that are potentially inefficient for the current owners to develop but have value to Callon based on their location relative to our acreage. These smaller scale acquisitions generally provide acreage at costs below the value assigned to larger blocks of acreage. While remaining focused on preserving a high level of liquidity, we plan to continue to pursue leasehold acquisitions in the Permian Basin &#160; with horizontal resource potential that can also be further expanded by &#8220;bolt-on acreage&#8221; acquisitions and acreage trades over time. 

&#160; 

Our Strengths 

&#160; 

Established resource base and acreage position in the core of Permian Basin . &#160; Our production is exclusively from the Permian Basin in West Texas, an area that has supported production since the 1940s. The B asin has well &#160; established infrastructure from historical operations, and we believe the Basin also benefits from a relatively stable regulatory environment that has been established over time. We have assembled a position of approximately &#160; 17,675 &#160; net surface acres in the Southern and Central Midland Basin that are prospective for multiple oil-bearing intervals that have been produced by us and other industry participants. As o f December 31, 2015 , our &#160; estimated net proved reserves were comprised of approximately &#160; 80% oil and 20% natural gas, which include s NGLs in the production stream. 

&#160; 

Economic, multi-year drilling inventory in a lower commodity price environment . &#160; O ur current acreage position in the Permian Basin provides growth potential from a horizontal drilling inventory of approximately &#160; 504 &#160; gross locations &#160; based solely on five currently producing zones, including the Lower Spraberry, Middle Spraberry, Wolfcamp A and the Upper and Lower Wolfcamp B. &#160; Our identified well locations across our Southern and Central Midland Basin acreage are based upon the results of horizontal wells drilled by us and other offsetting operators and by our analysis of core data and historical vertical well performance. To the extent that long-term production data and microseismic data support the potential for reduced spacing between lateral wellbores to improve total resource recoveries, our number of drilling locations may increase over time. 

&#160; 

Experienced team operating in the Permian Basin. &#160; We have assembled a management team experienced in acquisitions, exploration, development and production in the Midland Basin. Reflective of this experience, we were an early adopter of efficient multi-well pad development, transitioning to this development model in 2012 which enabled us to realize improvements in our drilling and capital. Since 2012, we have drilled more than 9 0 horizontal wells with lengths varying from approximately 5,000 feet to 10,000 feet, and we continue to evaluate our completion techniques. In addition, we regularly evaluat e our operating results against those of other operators in the area in an effort to benchmark our performance against the best performing operators and evaluate and adopt best practices. We believe that the experience of our team is highlighted by our success in achieving significantly lower well capital costs and reducing our operating cost structure to generate the operating margins and capital efficiency to operate effectively in the current environment. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Significant amount of operational control . We operate nearly all of our Permian Basin acreage and have no drilling obligations within our acreage base, providing us a distinct advantage that enables us to modify our operational plans quickly and drill in areas that offer highest return on capital potential. For example, as commodity prices continued to decline throughout 2015, we announced in the third quarter our plans to shift our development plan exclusively to our Central Midland acreage to focus on the Lower Spraberry which has demonstrated strong returns on capital. Our operating team reacted quickly to pivot our operations and worked with our service partners to coordinate a smooth and efficient transition to the new plan while meeting our previous production targets. 

&#160; 

Operating culture focused on safety and the environment. We have a Health, Safety and Environmental (&#8220;HSE&#8221;) department dedicated to our operations in the Permian Basin. This group is responsible for developing and implementing work processes to mitigate safety and environmental risks associated with our work activities. With emphasis on leadership engagement, planning, training and communication, and empowering both our employees and third party service providers with Stop Work Authority, we continue to improve operational performance. We have enhanced Management of Change, routine facility maintenance and inspections, and compliance action tracking methods with the implementation of a HSE management system software program. We also utilize the program to distribute all incident reports, including near miss events and safety observations to track trends, learn from our mistakes and implement corrective actions to drive improvement across our operations. This department also coordinates closely with our operational team to ensure effective communication with appropriate regulatory bodies as well as landowners. We believe that our proactive efforts in this area have made a positive impact on our operations and culture. 

&#160; 

Exploration and Development Activities &#160; 

&#160; 

Our 2015 total capital expenditures, including acquisitions, on a cash basis were $259.5 million , representing a 43 % d ecrease over 2014 capital expenditures. Of th e $259.5 million, $205.7 mil lion was allocated to operational capital expenditures, including drilling, development and leasehold acquisition activity. During 2015 , we drilled 3 6 gross ( 27.1 net) horizontal and no vertical wells, while completing 33 gross ( 2 5.8 net) horizontal and 1 gross ( 0 . 4 net) vertical wel ls.

In January 2016, we announced an operational capital budget for 2016 in the range of $75 to $80 million on an accrual, or GAAP, basis . In the first quarter of 2016 we plan to transition from a two-rig to a one-rig program , retaining the option to quickly redeploy the second rig to either our existing acreage or new acreage related to an y &#160; potential acquisition opportunit ies . &#160; We expect o ur 2016 horizontal drilling program will focus almost exclusively on the Lower Spraberry zone in the Central Midland Basin with lateral lengths ranging from approximately 5,000&#8217; laterals to 9,000&#8217; laterals. All wells will be completed from two to three well pads. We plan to have 19 gross (1 3.7 net) operated horizontal wells scheduled to be placed on production t arget ing the Lower Spraberry shale during 2016 . Also, we plan to have two gross (0.4 net) non-operated horizontal wells scheduled to be placed on production during 2016 targeting the Lower Spraberry and Wolfcamp A shale. The two non-operated horizonta l wells will be 10,000&#8217; laterals that leverage our existing acreage position. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Recent Developments 

&#160; 

In the first quarter of 2016, we completed the acquisiti on of an additional 4.9% working interest ( 3.7% net revenue interest) in our Ca sselman-B o hannon fields for total cash consideration of $9.3 million, excluding customary purchase price adjustments. We currently own a 71.3% working interest ( 53.5% net revenue interest) in the Ca sselman-B o hannon &#160; fields following the completion of this recent acquisition. &#160; 

&#160; 

Oil and Natural Gas Properties 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015 , our estimated net proved reserves totale d 54.3 MMBOE and include d 43.3 MMBbls of oil an d 65.5 Bcf, of natural gas with a pre-tax present value, discounted at 10%, of $574.6 million. Pre-tax present value is a non-GAAP financial measure, which we reconcile to the GAAP measure of standardized measure of $570.9 million. Oil constituted approximately 80% of our total estimated equivalent net proved reserves and approximately 78% of our total estimated equivalent proved developed reserves. 

&#160;

We convert Mcf to BOE using a conversion ratio of six Mcf to one Bbl. This ratio, which is typical in the industry and represents the approximate energy equivalent of a Mcf to a Bbl, does not reflect to market price equivalence of Mcf of natural gas compared with a Bbl of oil or NGLs. On a market price equivalence basis, a barrel of oil or NGLs has a substantially higher price than six Mcf of natural gas.

Permian Basin 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015 , we owned leaseholds in &#160; 17,675 net acres in the Permian Basin. Average net production from our Permian Basin properties increased 70% to 9,610 BOE/d in 2015 from 5,649 BOE/d in 2014 . 

&#160; 

Our Southern Midland Basin area is comprised of fields located in Upton, Reagan and Crockett Counties, Texas. We commenced our horizontal development efforts for the Permian Basin in this region in 2012. Our Central Midland Basin area, encompassing Midland, Ector, Andrews and Martin Counties, began to transition to horizontal development in 2013.

Proved &#160; Reserves &#160; 

&#160; 

Estimates of volumes of proved reserves at year-end, net to our working interest, are presented in MBbls for oil and in MMcf for natural gas, including NGLs, at a pressure base of 14.65 pounds per square inch. Total equivalent volumes are presented in BOE. For the BOE computation, 6,000 cubic feet of gas are the equivalent of one barrel of oil. The ratio of six Mcf of gas to one BOE is typically used in the oil and gas business and represents the approximate energy equivalent of a barrel of oil and a Mcf of natural gas. The price of a barrel of oil is much higher than the price of six Mcf of natural gas, so the ratio of six Mcf to one BOE does not reflect the economic equivalent of a barrel of oil to six Mcf of gas.

The Company uses the financial measure &#8220; p re-tax discounted present value&#8221; which is a non-GAAP financial meas ure. The Company believes that p re-tax discounted present value, while not a financial measure in accordance with GAAP, is an important financial measure used by investors and independent oil and natural gas producers for evaluating the relative value of oil and natural gas properties and acquisitions because the tax characteristics of comparable companies can differ materially. The total standardized measure calculated in accordance with the guidance issued by the FASB for disclosures about oil and natural gas producing activities for our proved reserves as of December 31, 201 5 wa s $570.9 million net of di scounted estimated future income taxes relating to such future net revenues. The projected per Mcf natural gas price of $2.73 used in the 201 5 reserve estimates ha s been adjusted to reflect the Btu content, transportation charges and other fees specific to the individual properties. The projected per barrel oil price of $47.25 used in the 2015 reserve estimates ha s been adjusted to reflect all wellhead deductions and premiums on a property-by-property basis, including transportation costs, location differentials and crude quality.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s estimated net proved reserves increased 65% t o 54.3 MBOE at December 31, 2015 from 32.8 MBOE at December 31, 2014 . Additions during the year were due to ( 1) 22.4 MMBOE related to the Company&#8217;s horizontal development of a portion of its properties and (2) 3.4 MMBOE related to acquired properties . These increases were partially offset by (1) 3.5 MMBOE related to the Company&#8217;s production during 201 5 and (2) 0. 8 MM BOE of net revisions . 

&#160; 

Proved Undeveloped Reserves 

&#160; 

Annually, the Company reviews its PUDs to ensure appropriate plans exist for development. PUD reserves are recorded only if the Company has plans to convert these reserves into PDPs within five years of the date they are first recorded. Our development plans include the allocation of capital to projects included within our 2016 capital budget and, in subsequent years, the allocation of capital within our long-range business plan to convert PUDs to PDPs within this five year period. In general, our 2016 capital budget and our long-range capital plans are primarily governed by our expectations of internally generated cash flow and senior secured revolving credit facility borrowing availability. Reserve calculations at any end-of-year period are representative of our development plans at that time. Changes in commodity pricing, oilfield service costs and availability, and other economic factors may lead to changes in development plans.

The increase in PUDs was partially offset by the reclassification of 2.7 MMBOE, or 19% , included in the year-end 201 4 PUDs, to PDPs as a result of our horizontal development of properties &#160; at a total cost of approximatel y $55.9 million, net. &#160; 

&#160; 

The Company plans to develop its PUDs as part of a multi-year drilling program. At December 31, 2015 , we had no reserves that remained undevelo p ed for five or more years, and all PUD drilling locations are currently scheduled to be drilled within five years of their initial recording. 

&#160; 

Controls Over Reserve Estimates 

&#160; 

Compliance as it relates to reporting the Company&#8217;s reserves is the responsibility of our Senior Vice President of Operations, who has over 35 years of industry experience , including 2 8 years as a manager , and is our principal engineer. In addition to his years of experience, our principal engineer holds a degree in petroleum engineering and is experienced in asset evaluation and management. 

&#160; 

Callon&#8217;s controls over reserve estimates included retaining DeGolyer and MacNaughton , a Texas registered engineering firm, as our independent p etroleum and geological firm. The Company provided to DeGolyer and MacNaughton information about our oil and gas properties, including production profiles, prices and costs, and DeGolyer and MacNaughton prepared its own estimates of the reserves attributabl e to the Company&#8217;s properties. All of the information regarding &#160; 2015 &#160; and 2014 &#160; reserves in this annual report is derived from DeGolyer and MacNaughton &#8217;s report. DeGolyer and MacNaughton &#8217;s reserve report letter is included as an Exhibit to this annual repor t. The principal engineer at DeGolyer and MacNaughton who certified the Company&#8217;s reserve estimates has over 4 0 years of experience in the oil and gas industry and is a Texas Licensed Professional Engineer. Further professional qualifications include a degree in petroleum engineering and membership in the International Society of Petroleum Engineers and the American Association of Petroleum Geologists . &#160; 

&#160; 

All of the information regarding 2013 reserves in this annual report is derived from reserve reports prepared by Huddleston &#38; Co. , Inc., a Texas engineering firm. &#160; 

&#160; 

To further enhance the control environment over the reserve estimation process, our S trategic Planning Committee , a committee of the Board of Directors, assist s management and the Board with its oversight of the integrity of the determination of the Company&#8217;s oil and 

&#160;

natural gas reserves and the work of our independent reserve engineer . The Committee&#8217;s charter also specifies that the Committee shall perform, in consultation with the Company&#8217;s management and senior reserves and reservoir engineering personnel, the following responsibilities: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Oversee the appointment, qualification, independence, compensation and retention of the independent petroleum and geological firm (the &#8220;Firm&#8221;) engaged by the Company (including resolution of material disagreements between management and the Firm regarding reserve determination) for the purpose of preparing or issuing an annual reserve report. The Committee shall review any proposed changes in the appointment of the Firm, determine the reasons for such proposal, and whether there have been any disputes between the Firm and management. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Review the Company&#8217;s significant reserves engineering principles and policies and any material changes thereto, and any proposed changes in reserves engineering standards and principles which have, or may have, a material impact on the Company&#8217;s reserves disclosure. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Review with management and the Firm the proved reserves of the Company, and, if appropriate, the probable reserves, possible reserves and the total reserves of the Company, including: (i) reviewing significant changes from prior period reports; (ii) reviewing key assumptions used or relied upon by the Firm; (iii) evaluating the quality of the reserve estimates prepared by both the Firm and the Company relative to the Company &#8217;s peers in the industry; and (iv) reviewing any material reserve s adjustments and significant diffe rences between the Company&#8217;s a nd Firm&#8217;s estimates. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

If the Committee deems it necessary, it shall meet in executive session with management and the Firm to discuss the oil and gas reserve determination process and related public disclosures, and any other matters of concern in respect of the evaluation of the reserves. 

&#160; 

During our last fiscal year, we filed no reports with other federal agencies which contain an estimate of total proved net oil and natural gas reserves . &#160;

&#160; 

The expiring acreage set forth in the table above accounts for approximately 8% &#160; of our net undeveloped acreage ( 91 total net acres) and there are no PUD reserves attributable to such acreage. We are continually engaged in a combination of drilling and development 

&#160;

and discussions with mineral lessors for lease extensions, renewals, new drilling and development units and new leases to address any potential expiration of undeveloped acreage that occurs in the normal course of our business . 

&#160; 

Title to Proper ties &#160; 

&#160; 

The Company believes that the title to its oil and natural gas properties is good and defensible in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and gas industry, subject to such exceptions which, in our opinion, are not so material as to detract substantially from the use or value of such properties. The Company&#8217;s properties are potentially subject to one or more of the following: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

royalties and other burdens and obligations, express or implied, u nder oil and natural gas leases; 

&#183; 

overriding royalties and other burdens created by us or our predecessors in title; 

&#183; 

a variety of contractual obligations (including, in some cases, development obligations) ari sing under operating agreements; farm-out agreements, production sales contracts and other agreements that may affect the propert ies or their titles; 

&#183; 

back-ins and reversionary interests existing under purchase agree ments and leasehold assignments; 

&#183; 

liens that arise in the normal course of operations, such as those for unpaid taxes, statutory liens securing obligations to unpaid suppliers and contractors and contractual l iens under operating agreements; 

&#183; 

pooling, unitization and communitization agre ements, declarations and orders; and 

&#183; 

easements, restrictions, rights-of-way and other matters that commonly affect property. 

&#160; 

To the extent that such burdens and obligations affect the Company&#8217;s rights to production revenues, these characteristics have been taken into account in calculating Callon&#8217;s net revenue interests and in estimating the size and value of its reserves. The Company believes that the burdens and obligations affecting our properties are typical within the industry for properties of the kind owned by Callon. 

&#160; 

Insurance 

&#160; 

In accordance with industry practice, the Company maintains insurance against some, but not all, of the operating risks to which its business is exposed. While not all inclusive, the Company&#8217;s insurance policies include coverage for general liability insuring onshore operations (including sudden and accidental pollution), aviation liability, auto liability, worker&#8217;s compensation, and employer&#8217;s liability. The C ompany carries control of well insurance for only those onshore operations that it is contractually bound to do so. At the depths and in the areas in which the Company operates, and in light of the vertical and horizontal drilling that it undertakes, the Company typically does not encounter high pressures or extreme drilling conditions onshore. 

&#160; 

Currently, the Company has general liability insurance coverage up to $1 million per occurrence and $2 million per policy in the aggregate, which includes sudden and accidental pollution liability coverage for the effects of pollution on third parties arising from its operations. The Company&#8217;s insurance policies contain high policy limits, and in most cases, deductibles (generally ranging from $0 to $250,000) that must be met prior to recovery. These insurance policies are subject to certain customary exclusions and limitations. T he Company maintains up to $100 million in excess liability coverage, which is in addition to and triggered if the underlying liability limits have been reached. In addition, the company purchases pollution legal liability coverage in the amount of $5 million , which is excess and difference in conditions of the liability coverage. 

&#160; 

The Company requires all of its third-party contractors to sign master service agreements in which they agree to indemnify the Company for injuries and deaths of the service provider&#8217;s employees, as well as contractors and subcontractors hired by the service provider. Similarly, the Company generally agrees to indemnify each third-party contractor against claims made by employees of the Company and the Company&#8217;s other contractors. Additionally, each party generally is responsible for damage to its own property. 

&#160; 

The third-party contractors that perform hydraulic fracturing operations for the Company sign master service agreements generally containing the indemnification provisions noted above. The Company does not currently have any insurance policies in effect that are intended to provide coverage for losses solely related to hydraulic fracturing operations. However, the Company believes its general liability and excess liability insurance policies would cover foreseeable third party claims related to hydraulic fracturing operations and associated legal expenses, in accordance with, and subject to, the terms of such policies. 

&#160; 

The Company re-evaluates the purchase of insurance, coverage limits and deductibles annually. Future insurance coverage for the oil and natural gas industry could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions. In addition, some forms of insurance 

&#160;

may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that are economically acceptable. While based on the Company&#8217;s risk analysis, it believes that it is properly insured, no assurance can be given that the Company will be able to maintain insurance in the future at rates that it considers reasonable. In such circumstances, the Company may elect to self-insure or maintain only catastrophic coverage for certain risks in the future. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Regulations 

&#160; 

General. Oil and natural gas operations such as ours are subject to various types of legislation, regulation and other legal requirements enacted by governmental authorities. This legislation and regulation affecting the entire oil and natural gas industry is continuously being reviewed for amendment and/ or expansion. Some of these requirements carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. 

&#160; 

Exploration and Production . Our operations are subject to federal, state and local regulations that include requirements for permits to drill and to conduct other operations and for provision of financial assurances (such as bonds and letters of credit) covering drilling and well operations. Other activities subject to regulation are: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

th e location and spacing of wells; 

&#183; 

the method of drilling and completing and operating wells; 

&#183; 

th e rate and method of production; 

&#183; 

the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled a nd other exploration activities; 

&#183; 

notice to surface owners and other third parties; 

&#183; 

the ve nting or flaring of natural gas; 

&#183; 

the p lugging and abandoning of wells; 

&#183; 

the discharge of contaminants into water and the em ission of contaminants into air; 

&#183; 

the disposal of fluids used or other wastes obtaine d in connection with operations; 

&#183; 

the marketing, transportat ion and reporting of production; and 

&#183; 

the valuation and payment of royalties. 

&#160; 

Operations conducted on federal or state oil and natural gas leases must comply with numerous regulatory restrictions, including various nondiscrimination statutes, royalty and related valuation requirements, and certain of these operations must be conducted pursuant to certain on-site security regulations and other appropriate permits issued by the DOI Bureaus or other appropriate federal or state agencies. 

&#160; 

Our sales of oil and natural gas are affected by the availability, terms and cost of pipeline transportation. The price and terms for access to pipeline transportation remain subject to extensive federal and state regulation. If these regulations change, we could face higher transmission costs for our production and, possibly, reduced access to transmission capacity. 

&#160; 

Various proposals and proceedings that might affect the petroleum industry are pending before Congress, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, various state legislatures, and the courts. The industry historically has been heavily regulated and we can offer you no assurance that the less stringent regulatory approach recently pursued by the FERC and Congress will continue nor can we predict what effect such proposals or proceedings may have on our operations. 

&#160; 

We do not currently anticipate that compliance with existing laws and regulations governing exploration and production will have a significantly adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. 

&#160; 

Environmental Matters and Regulation. Our oil and natural gas exploration, development and production operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Numerous federal, state and local governmental agencies, such as the EPA issue regulations which often require difficult and costly compliance measures that carry substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties and may result in injunctive obligations for non-compliance. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences, restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities, limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, ecologically sensitive and other protected areas, require action to prevent or remediate pollution from current or former operations, such as plugging abandoned wells or closing pits, result in the suspension or revocation of necessary permits, licenses and authorizations, require that additional pollution controls be installed and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations or relate to our owned or operated facilities. Violations of environmental laws could result in administrative, civil or criminal fines and injunctive relief. The strict and joint and several liability nature of such laws and regulations could impose liability upon us regardless of fault. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons , air emissions or other 

&#160;

waste products into the environment. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly pollution control or waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could materially adversely affect our operations and financial position, as well as the oil and natural gas industry in general. Further, the EPA has identified environmental compliance by the energy extraction sector as one of its enforcement initiatives for 2014-2016 (and has solicited comments on continuing this initiative for fiscal years 2017-2019) and, as a general matter, the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry has been the subject of increasing scrutiny and regulation by environmental authorities. Our management believes that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and we have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with these environmental requirements. Although such laws and regulations can increase the cost of planning, designing, installing and operating our facilities, it is anticipated that, absent the occurrence of an extraordinary event, compliance with them will not have a material effect upon our operations, capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position in the marketplace. 

&#160; 

Waste Handling. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (&#8220;RCRA&#8221;) , as amended , and comparable state statutes and regulations promulgated thereunder, affect oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activities by imposing requirements regarding the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. With federal approval, the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Although most wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA and its state analogs, it is possible that some wastes we generate presently or in the future may be subject to regulation under RCRA and state analogs. Additionally, we cannot assure you that the EPA or state or local governments will not adopt more stringent requirements for the handling of non-hazardous wastes or categorize some non-hazardous wastes as hazardous for future regulation. Indeed, legislation has been proposed from time to time in Congress to re-categorize certain oil and natural gas exploration, development and production wastes as &#8220;hazardous wastes.&#8221; Any such changes in the laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures and operating expenses. 

&#160; 

Administrative, civil and criminal penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with waste handling requirements. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable requirements related to waste handling, and that we hold all necessary and up-to-date permits, registrations and other authorizations to the extent that our operations require them under such laws and regulations. Although we do not believe the current costs of managing our wastes, as presently classified, to be significant, any legislative or regulatory reclassification of wastes associated with oil and natural gas exploration and production could increase our costs to manage and dispose of such wastes. 

&#160; 

Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act. &#160; T he Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (&#8220; CERCLA &#8221;) , imposes joint and several liability for costs of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damages without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons with respect to the release into the environment of substances designated under CERCLA as hazardous substances. These classes of persons, or so&#8211;called potentially responsible parties (&#8220;PRPs&#8221;) include the current and past owners or operators of a site where the release occurred and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance found at the site. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to take actions in response to threats to public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the PRPs the costs of such action. Many states have adopted comparable or more stringent state statutes. 

&#160; 

Although CERCLA generally exempts &#8220;petroleum&#8221; from the definition of hazardous substance, in the course of our operations, we have generated and will generate wastes that may fall within CERCLA&#8217;s definition of hazardous substance and may have disposed of these wastes at disposal sites owned and operated by others. Comparable state statutes may not provide a comparable exemption for petroleum. We may also be the owner or operator of sites on which hazardous substances have been released. To our knowledge, neither we nor our predecessors have been designated as a PRP by the EPA under CERCLA; we also do not know of any prior owners or operators of our properties that are named as PRPs related to their ownership or operation of such properties. In the event contamination is discovered at a site on which we are or have been an owner or operator or to which we sent hazardous substances, we could be liable for the costs of investigation and remediation and natural resources damages. 

&#160; 

We currently own, lease, or operate numerous properties that have been used for oil and natural gas exploration and production for many years. Although we believe we have utilized operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hazardous substances, wastes or hydrocarbons may have been released on or under the properties owned or leased by us, or on or under other locations, including offsite locations, where such substances have been taken for disposal. In addition, some of these properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous 

&#160;

substances, wastes, or hydrocarbons were not under our control. These properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. In the future, we could be required to remediate property, including groundwater, containing or impacted by previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed or released by prior owners or operators, or property contamination, including groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators) or to perform remedial plugging operations to prevent future or mitigate existing contamination. 

&#160; 

Water Discharges. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended, also known as the &#8220;Clean Water Act,&#8221; the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Oil Pollution Act (&#8220; OPA &#8221;) , and analogous state laws and regulations promulgated thereunder impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the unauthorized discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other gas and oil wastes, into navigable waters of the United States (a term broadly defined to include, among other things, certain wetlands) , as well as state waters for analogous state programs. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or applicable state analog . The Clean Water Act and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit the discharge of dredge and fill material into regulated waters, including jurisdictional wetlands, unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure plan requirements under federal law require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. These laws and regulations also prohibit the discharge of dredge or fill material in regulated waters, including wetlands , unless authorized by a permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The EPA has also adopted regulations requiring certain oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain individual permits or coverage under general permits for storm water discharges. Costs may be associated with the treatment of wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans, as well as for monitoring and sampling the storm water runoff from certain of our facilities. Some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions. 

&#160; 

The Oil Pollution Act is the primary federal law for oil spill liability. The OPA contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to petroleum releases into waters of the United States, including the requirement that operators of offshore facilities and certain onshore facilities near or crossing waterways must develop and maintain facility response contingency plans and maintain certain significant levels of financial assurance to cover potential environmental cleanup and restoration costs. The OPA subjects owners of facilities to strict, joint and several liability for all containment and cleanup costs and certain other damages arising from a release, including, but not limited to, the costs of responding to a release of oil to surface waters. 

&#160; 

Noncompliance with the Clean Water Act or OPA may result in substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as injunctive obligations. We believe we are in material compliance with the requirements of each of these laws. 

&#160; 

Air Emissions. The federal Clean Air Act, as amended, and comparable state and local laws and regulations, regulate emissions of various air pollutants through the issuance of permits and the imposition of other requirements. The EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of air pollutants at specified sources. New facilities may be required to obtain permits before work can begin, and modified and existing facilities may be required to obtain additional permits and incur capital costs in order to remain in compliance. For example, on April 17 , 2012, the EPA published final regulations under the federal Clean Air Act that establish new emission controls for oil and natural gas production and processing operations, which regulations are discussed in more detail below in &#8220;Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing.&#8221; These laws and regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities we own or operate, and federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties and seek injunctive relief for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable air emissions regulations and that we hold all necessary and valid construction and operating permits for our operations. Obtaining or renewing permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. 

&#160; 

In 2015, the EPA proposed new rules limiting methane emissions from the oil and gas industry. The proposed rules, if adopted, would amend the air emissions rules for the oil and natural gas sources and natural gas processing and transmission sources to include new standards for methane. Simultaneously with the proposal of the methane rules, EPA released a proposal soliciting comments on two alternatives for aggregating multiple surface sites into a single-source of air quality permitting purposes. Depending upon the alternative selected by EPA, sites which currently would not require permitting under the Clean Air Act could require permits, an outcome that could result in costs and delays to our operations; however, given the present uncertainty regarding this rule, the extent and magnitude of that impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Greenhouse Gas Regulation. More stringent laws and regulations relating to climate change and GHGs may be adopted in the future and could cause us to incur material expenses in complying with them. In the absence of comprehensive federal legislation on GHG emission control, the EPA attempted to require the permitting of GHG emissions. Although the Supreme Court struck down the permitting requirements, it upheld the EPA&#8217;s authority to control GHG emissions when a permit is required due to emissions of other pollutants. 

&#160; 

The EPA has established GHG reporting requirements for certain sources in the petroleum and natural gas industry, requiring those sources to monitor, maintain records on, and annually report their GHG emissions. Although these requirements do not limit the amount of GHGs that can be emitted, they could require us to incur significant costs to monitor, keep records of, and potentially report &#160; GHG emissions associated with our operations if the reporting threshold is reached with production growth. The EPA recently announced its intention to take measures to require or encourage reductions in methane emissions, including from oil and natural gas operations. Those measures include the development of NSPS regulations in 2016 for reducing methane from new and modified oil and gas production sources and natural gas proc essing and transmission sources discussed in more detail above in &#8220;Air Emissions.&#8221; 

&#160; 

In addition to possible federal regulation, a number of states, individually and regionally, also are considering or have implemented GHG regulatory programs. These potential regional and state initiatives may result in so-called &#8220;Cap-and-Trade programs&#8221;, under which overall GHG emissions are limited and GHG emissions are then allocated and sold, and possibly other regulatory requirements, that could result in our incurring material expenses to comply, such as by being required to purchase or to surrender allowances for GHGs resulting from our operations. These federal, regional and local regulatory initiatives also could adversely affect the marketability of the oil and natural gas we produce. The impact of such future programs cannot be predicted, but we do not expect our operations to be affected any differently than other similarly situated domestic competitors. 

&#160; 

Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing is an important common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons, particularly natural gas, from tight formations, including shales. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. The federal Safe Drinking Water Act (&#8220; SDWA &#8221;) , regulates the underground injection of substances through the Underground Injection Control (&#8220; UIC &#8221;) , program. Hydraulic fracturing generally is exempt from regulation under the UIC program, and the hydraulic fracturing process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions and not at the federal level, as the SDWA expressly excludes regulation of these fracturing activities (except where diesel is a component of the fracturing fluid, as further discussed below) . Legislation to amend the SDWA to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of &#8220;underground injection&#8221; and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing have been proposed in recent sessions of Congress but have not passed. 

&#160; 

The EPA, however, issued guidance on permitting hydraulic fracturing that uses fluids containing diesel fuel under the UIC program, specifically as &#8220;Class II&#8221; UIC wells. At the same time, the White House Council on Environmental Quality is coordinating an administration-wide review of hydraulic fracturing practices and the EPA has commenced a study of the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities on drinking water resources. The EPA has announced that it plans to propose standards that such wastewater must meet before being transported to a treatment plant. The final rule date is estimated to be March 2016. As p art of these studies, the EPA has requested that certain companies provide them with information concerning the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. These studies, depending on their results, could spur additional initiatives to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or otherwise. 

&#160; 

The EPA has adopted regulations under the federal Clean Air Act that establish new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations. Specifically, the EPA&#8217;s rule package includes Ne w Source Performance Standards f or hydraulically fractured natural gas wells to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and processing activities. The final rule seeks to achieve a 95% reduction in VOCs emitted by requiring the use of reduced emission completions or &#8220;green completions&#8221; on all hydraulically-fractured gas wells constructed or refractured after January 1, 2015. The rules also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage tanks and other production equipment. These rules require a number of modifications to our operations, including the installation of new equipment to control emissions from our wells by January 1, 2015. The EPA received numerous requests for reconsideration of these rules from both industry and the environmental community, and court challenges to the rules were also filed. The EPA may issue revised rules that are likely responsive to some of these requests. If revised, these rules could require modifications to our operations or increase our capital and operating costs without being offset by increased product capture. At this point, we cannot predict the final regulatory requirements or the cost to comply with such requirements with any certainty. The BLM finalized regulations for hydraulic fracturing 

&#160;

activities on federal lands. Among other things, the BLM rules impose new requirements to validate the protection of groundwater, disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing and higher standards for the interim storage of recovered waste fluids from hydraulic fracturing. This rule is the subject of legal challenges and a federal district court in Wyoming has issued preliminary injunction temporarily delaying implementation of the BLM rule. In addition, the EPA has announced that it is considering regulations under the Toxic Substance Control Act to require evaluation and disclosure of hydraulic fracturing. 

&#160; 

In addition, there are certain governmental reviews either underway or bei ng proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. The federal government is currently undertaking several studies of hydraulic fracturing&#8217;s potential impacts, most notably the EPA&#8217;s study on the environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing, the final results of which are not yet available. &#160; These ongoing or proposed studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and whether any meaningful results are obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or other regulatory authorities. 

&#160; 

Several states, including Texas, and some municipalities, have adopted, or are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances and/or require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids. The Texas Legislature adopted new legislation requiring oil and gas operators to publicly disclose the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process, effective as of September 1, 2011. The Texas Railroad Commission has adopted rules and regulations implementing this legislation that apply to all wells for which the Railroad Commission issues an initial drilling permit after February 1, 2012. The new law requires that the well operator disclose the list of chemical ingredients subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act ( &#8220; OSHA &#8221; ) for disclosure on an internet W eb &#160; site and also file the list of chemicals with the Texas Railroad Commission with the well completion report. The total volume of water used to hydraulically fracture a well must also be disclosed to the public and filed with the Texas Railroad Commission. 

&#160; 

Additionally, some states, localities and local regulatory districts have adopted or have considered adopting regulations to limit, and in some case impose a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing or other restrictions on drilling and completion operations, including requirements regarding casing and cementing of wells; testing of nearby water wells; restrictions on access to, and usage of, water. Further, there has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to the use of fracturing fluids, impacts on drinking water supplies, use of water and the potential for impacts to surface water, groundwater and the environment generally. A number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country implicating hydraulic fracturing practices. If new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing is further regulated at the federal or state level, our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, plugging and abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs. Such legislative changes could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs, and compliance or the consequences of any failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the impact on our business of newly enacted or potential federal or state legislation governing hydraulic fracturing. 

&#160; 

Surface Damage Statutes (&#8220;SDAs&#8221;) . In addition, a number of states and some tribal nations have enacted SDAs. These laws are designed to compensate for damage caused by oil and gas development operations. Most SDAs contain entry notification and negotiation requirements to facilitate contact between operators and surface owners/users. Most also contain binding requirements for payments to the operator in connection with exploration and operating activities. Costs and delays associated with SDAs could impair operational effectiveness and increase development costs. 

&#160; 

National Environmental Policy Act and Endangered Species Act . Oil and natural gas exploration and production activities on federal lands may be subject to the National Environmental Policy Act (&#8220; NEPA &#8221;) , which requires federal agencies, including the Department of Interior, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will prepare an Environmental Assessment that assesses the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed Environmental Impact Statement that may be made available for public review and comment. To the extent that our current exploration and production activities, as well as proposed exploration and development plans, on federal lands require governmental permits that are subject to the requirements of NEPA, this process has the potential to delay or impose additional conditions upon the development of oil and natural gas projects. 

&#160; 

&#160;

The Endangered Species Act (&#8220;ESA&#8221;) was established to protect endangered and threatened species. Pursuant to that act, if a species is listed as threatened or endangered, restrictions may be imposed on activities adversely affecting that species&#8217; or its habitat. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service must also designate the species&#8217; critical habitat and suitable habitat as part of the effort to ensure survival of the species. A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to land use and may materially delay or prohibit land access for oil and natural gas development. If the Company were to have a portion of its leases designated as critical or suitable habitat or a protected species were located on a lease, it may adversely impact the value of the affected leases. 

&#160; 

Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 (&#8220;Mineral Act&#8221;) . &#160; The Mineral Act prohibits direct or indirect ownership of any interest in federal onshore oil and natural gas leases by a foreign citizen or a foreign corporation except through stock ownership in a corporation formed under the laws of the United States or of any U.S. state or territory, and only if the laws, customs, or regulations of their country of origin or domicile do not deny similar or like privileges to citizens or corporations of the United States. If these restrictions are violated, the oil and gas lease or leases can be canceled in a proceeding instituted by the United States Attorney General. Although the regulations of the BLM (which administers the Mineral Act) provide for agency designations of non-reciprocal countries, there are presently no such designations in effect. The Company own ed an interest in federal leaseholds in Nevada. It is possible that holders of the Company&#8217;s equity interests may be citizens of foreign countries, which could be determined to be citizens of a non-reciprocal country under the Mineral Act. In such event, the federal onshore oil and gas leases held by the Company could be subject to cancellation based on such determination. 

&#160; 

Other Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry. &#160; The oil and natural gas industry is extensively regulated by numerous federal, state and local authorities. Legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion, frequently increasing the regulatory burden. Also, numerous departments and agencies, both federal and state, are authorized by statute to issue rules and regulations that are binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. Although the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and, consequently, affects our profitability, these burdens generally do not affect us any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than they affect other companies in the industry with similar types, quantities and locations of production. 

&#160; 

The availability, terms and cost of transportation significantly affect sales of oil and natural gas. The interstate transportation of oil and natural gas is subject to federal regulation, including regulation of the terms, conditions and rates for interstate transportation, storage and various other matters, primarily by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC. Federal and state regulations govern the rates and other terms for access to oil and natural gas pipeline transportation. FERC&#8217;s regulations for interstate oil and natural gas transmission in some circumstances may also affect the intrastate transportation of oil and natural gas. 

&#160; 

Although oil and natural gas sales prices are currently unregulated, the federal government historically has been active in the area of oil and natural gas sales regulation. We cannot predict whether new legislation to regulate oil and natural gas sales might be proposed, what proposals, if any, might actually be enacted by Congress or the various state legislatures, and what effect, if any, the proposals might have on our operations. Sales of condensate, oil and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at market prices. 

&#160; 

Exports of US Crude Oil Production . The federal government has recently ended its decades-old prohibition of exports of oil produced in the lower 48 states of the US. It is too recent an event to determine the impact this regulatory change may have on our operations or our sales of oil. The general perception in the industry is that ending the prohibition of exports of oil produced in the US will be positive for producers of U . S . oil. 

&#160; 

Drilling a nd Production. Our operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local level. These types of regulation include requiring permits for the drilling of wells, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. The state, and some counties and municipalities, in which we operate also regulate one or more of the following: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

the location of wells; 

&#183; 

the method of drilling and casing wells; 

&#183; 

the timing of construction or drilling activities, including seasonal wildlife closures; 

&#183; 

the rates of production or &#8220;allowables&#8221;; 

&#183; 

the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled; 

&#183; 

the plugging and abandoning of wells; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

notice to, and consultation with, surface owners and other third parties. 

&#160; 

State laws regulate the size and shape of drilling and spacing units or proration units governing the pooling of oil and natural gas properties. Some states allow forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In some instances, forced pooling or unitization may be implemented by third parties and may reduce our interest in the unitized properties. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose requirements regarding the ratability of production. These laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells or limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction. States do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct regulation, but we cannot assure you that they will not do so in the future. The effect of such future regulations may be to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells, negatively affect the economics of production from these wells or to limit the number of locations we can drill. 

&#160; 

Federal, state and local regulations provide detailed requirements for the abandonment of wells, closure or decommissioning of production facilities and pipelines and for site restoration in areas where we operate. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and many other state and local authorities also have regulations for plugging and abandonment, decommissioning and site restoration. Although the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers does not require bonds or other financial assurances, some state agencies and municipalities do have such requirements. 

&#160; 

Natural Gas Sales and Transportation. Historically, federal legislation and regulatory controls have affected the price of the natural gas we produce and the manner in which we market our production. FERC has jurisdiction over the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce by natural gas companies under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. Since 1978, various federal laws have been enacted which have resulted in the complete removal of all price and non-price controls for sales of domestic natural gas sold in &#8220;first sales,&#8221; which include all of our sales of our own production. Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, FERC has substantial enforcement authority to prohibit the manipulation of natural gas markets and enforce its rules and orders, including the ability to assess substantial civil penalties. 

&#160; 

FERC also regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions and establishes the terms under which we may use interstate natural gas pipeline capacity, which affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas and for the release of our excess, if any, natural gas pipeline capacity. Commencing in 1985, FERC promulgated a series of orders, regulations and rule makings that significantly fostered competition in the business of transporting and marketing gas. Today, interstate pipeline companies are required to provide nondiscriminatory transportation services to producers, marketers and other shippers, regardless of whether such shippers are affiliated with an interstate pipeline company. FERC&#8217;s initiatives have led to the development of a competitive, open access market for natural gas purchases and sales that permits all purchasers of natural gas to buy gas directly from third-party sellers other than pipelines. However, the natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated; therefore, we cannot guarantee that the less stringent regulatory approach currently pursued by FERC and Congress will continue indefinitely into the future nor can we determine what effect, if any, future regulatory changes might have on our natural gas related activities. 

&#160; 

Under FERC&#8217;s current regulatory regime, transmission services must be provided on an open-access, non-discriminatory basis at cost-based rates or at market-based rates if the transportation market at issue is sufficiently competitive. Gathering service, which occurs upstream of jurisdictional transmission services, is regulated by the states onshore and in state waters. Although its policy is still in flux, FERC has in the past reclassified certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as non-jurisdictional gathering facilities, which has the tendency to increase our costs of transporting gas to point-of-sale locations. 

&#160; 

The pipelines used to gather and transport natural gas being produced by the Company are also subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation (&#8220;DOT&#8221;) under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended (&#8220;NGPSA&#8221;), the Pipeline Safety Act of 1992, as reauthorized and amended (&#8220;Pipeline Safety Act&#8221;), and the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011. The DOT Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (&#8220;PHMSA&#8221;) has established a risk-based approach to determine which gathering pipelines are subject to regulation and what safety standards regulated gathering pipelines must meet. In August 2011, the PHMSA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding pipeline safety, including questions regarding the modification of regulations applicable to gathering lines in rural areas. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Oil and NGLs Sales and Transportation. Sales of oil, condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices. Nevertheless, Congress could reenact price controls in the future. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s sales of oil and natural gas liquids are also affected by the availability, terms and costs of transportation. The rates, terms, and conditions applicable to the interstate transportation of oil and natural gas liquids by pipelines are regulated by the FERC under the Interstate Commerce Act. &#160; The FERC has implemented a simplified and generally applicable ratemaking methodology for interstate oil and natural gas liquids pipelines to fulfill the requirements of Title XVIII of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 comprised of an indexing system to establish ceilings on interstate oil and natural gas liquids pipeline rates. Intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates, varies from state to state. Insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers, we believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will not affect our operations in any materially different way than such regulation will affect the operations of our competitors. 

&#160; 

Further, interstate and intrastate common carrier oil pipelines must provide service on a non-discriminatory basis. Under this open access standard, common carriers must offer service to all shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates. When oil pipelines operate at full capacity, access is governed by prorationing provisions set forth in the pipelines&#8217; published tariffs. Accordingly, we believe that access to oil pipeline transportation services generally will be available to us to the same extent as to our competitors. 

&#160; 

Any transportation of the Company&#8217;s crude oil, natural gas liquids and purity components (ethane, propane, butane, iso-butane, and natural gasoline) by rail is also subject to regulation by the DOT&#8217;s PHMSA and the DOT&#8217;s Federal Railroad Administration (&#8220;FRA&#8221;) under the Hazardous Materials Regulations at 49 CFR Parts 171-180 (&#8220;HMR&#8221;), including Emergency Orders by the FRA and new regulations being proposed by the PHMSA, arising due to the consequences of train accidents and the increase in the rail transportation of flammable liquids. 

&#160; 

In October 2015, the PHMSA issued proposed new safety regulations for hazardous liquid pipelines, including a requirement that all hazardous liquid pipelines have a system for detecting leaks and establish a timeline for inspections of affected pipelines following extreme weather events or natural disasters. 

&#160; 

State Regulation. Texas regulates the drilling for, and the production, gathering and sale of, oil and natural gas, including imposing severance taxes and requirements for obtaining drilling permits. Texas currently imposes a 4.6% severance tax on oil production and a 7.5% severance tax on natural gas production. States also regulate the method of developing new fields, the spacing and operation of wells and the prevention of waste of oil and natural gas resources. States may regulate rates of production and may establish maximum daily production allowables from oil and natural gas wells based on market demand or resource conservation, or both. States do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct economic regulation, but we cannot assure you that they will not do so in the future. The effect of these regulations may be to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells and to limit the number of wells or locations we can drill. 

&#160; 

The petroleum industry is also subject to compliance with various other federal, state and local regulations and laws. Some of those laws relate to resource conservation and equal employment opportunity. We do not believe that compliance with these laws will have a material adverse effect on us. 

&#160; 

Commitments and Contingencies 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s activities are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control. Although no assurances can be made, the Company believes that, absent the occurrence of an extraordinary event, compliance with existing federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations governing the release of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment will not have a material effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings or the competitive position of the Company with respect to its existing assets and operations. The Company cannot predict what effect additional regulation or legislation, enforcement policies included, and claims for damages to property, employees, other persons, and the environment resulting from the Company&#8217;s operations could have on its activities. See Note 14 for additional information.
