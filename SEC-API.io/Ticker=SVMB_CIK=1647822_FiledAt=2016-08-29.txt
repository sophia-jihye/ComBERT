 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160;

Business Overview 

&#160;

On March 6, 2015 Mr. Lakwinder Singh Sidhu, president and sole director incorporated the Company in the State of Nevada and established a fiscal year end of May 31. We intend to provide application software to a global vendor platform to connect people to businesses and provide a new shopping experience. This begins with our proposed Mobile Marketing Platform that enables vendors to send targeted promotion and, offers to Members based on their location and needs. Members only receive promotions that they want, when they want it. The platform eliminates the need for searching by delivering information based on demand. The Company has registered offices located at 2880 Zanker Road, Suite 203, San Jose, California, 95134. The Company has an office provided at no charge by Mr. Sidhu in India; 73B Bank Avenue, Amritsar, Punjab &#8211; 143001, India.

&#160;

The Company has not yet implemented its business model and to date has generated no revenues. It is the Company's intention to provide vendor tools technology. The proposed planned platform connects businesses to consumers based on location and preferences for products and services. Consumers received promotions while they are travelling via their smartphone. Vendors can send promotions and special offers simply through the web. When the consumer goes to the vendor's location, they can redeem the promotion through their smartphone allowing the proposed platform to keep track of performance analytics. SavMobi's proposed Mobile Marketing Platform intends to help businesses by bringing customers into their door and increasing sales.

&#160;

SavMobi Technology Inc. intends to develop and deliver application Mobile Marketing Platform, containing the Vendor Center and Mobile Apps. The Vendor Center intends to allow SavMobi vendors to manage and monitor their promos. It is at the proposed core of all SavMobi Vendor Services. SavMobi Members can use the mobile apps to receive, view &#38; redeem promos, set their preferences, and discover new vendors in their area. 

&#160;

Every business is different, so we've given the Vendor the ability to determine the discount or offer that is appropriate for them. They don't have to agree to profit-crushing deals that are forced upon by other companies. 

&#160;

The proposed SavMobi Mobile Apps intends to provide members with the full consumer experience of the proposed Mobile Marketing Platform. Members can use the mobile apps to receive, view &#38; redeem promos, set their preferences, and discover new vendors in their area. 

&#160;

We have focused our current operations on the organization and development of our business plan. Our business plan is intended to design and to create a targeted and organized approach to building our intended Vendor and Member enrollment. We believe that once the proposed development of SavMobi's Mobile Marketing Platform is completed, this will allow SavMobi to hit the ground running with many options for our proposed customers.

&#160;

We have begun to develop metrics within our business plan to stay on track. Relevant metrics intended to be used to measure Vendor and Member marketing activities would include: Vendor sign-ups per month; Vendor sign-ups after promotional events; Member registrations per month; Member registrations after promotional events; Campaign rates; Sent rates; View rates; Redemption rates.

&#160;

In addition, our current operations have included the beginning of a pricing strategy for our proposed product. Since our intended revenue source will come from businesses, we have centered on pricing strategy on how much a business is willing to pay for advertising. Research from Borrell Associates ( April 2008-The market data presented in this section represents calculations that the Company has made based on the underlying data contained in the Borrell Associates report rather than data points actually contained in the report.) published that the average amount paid for a business per location is $299. The range for this average is just over $18,000 at the high end to just under $100 at the low end. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Our intended core pricing strategy involves three components around CPM (cost per thousand of impressions), Allowance and Performance model. We have weighted our strategy more heavily on the Performance model. We believe by doing so our proposed goal it to establish actual results for our vendors. We believe that once the see the value of SavMobi's proposed Mobile Marketing Platform, that the intended increase in sales for the customer will provided on going renewal revenues for SavMobi.

Industry Analysis/Competition 

&#160;

Market Analysis 

&#160;

SavMobi proposed Marketing Platform and Mobile App is to provide Vendors to deliver and for customers/Member to receive, view and redeem promotional offers. SavMobi pre-empts a general web search , making our marketing efforts a step ahead of our competitors broad general search advertisements. This will also allow our proposed Vendors to provide set distances to send their promos and with the Members/customers to opt-in preferences, the promos the Members receive (as per their preferences) have a high relevancy. This allows Vendors to target consumers within a specific neighborhood if they so choose. 

&#160;

Research from Nielsen's U.S. Digital Consumer Report (February 23, 2012) revealed that 29 percent of smartphone owners use their phone for shopping-related activities. Top activities among mobile shoppers include in-store price comparisons (38%), browsing products through websites or apps (38%), reading online product reviews (32%), searching for/using online coupons (24%), and purchasing products (22%). Mobile is transforming into a powerful commerce tool, facilitating consumer transactions and access to real-time information and deals.

The smartphone market is experiencing rapid growth and the time to capitalize on that market is now! According to mobile statistics, there are over 2.6 billion smartphones in the world and over 182.6 million smartphones in the U.S. alone; and that by 2020 there will be 6.1 billion smartphones worldwide. Every year, smartphone manufacturers are releasing many new and affordable products, which have led to smartphones being two out of every three new mobile phones purchased. SavMobi has an opportunity with every new smartphone user to potentially gain a new user/customer and provide Vendors of our proposed Marketing Platform the opportunity to generate more sales. SavMobi has the potential to generate increased revenues via the increase use of our Mobile Marketing Platform and Mobile App. 

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

Although SavMobi can be considered to operate in many industries, our proposed revenue streams we expect to come from the hyper-local marketing space. Our proposed primary source of revenue we expect will come from local, small businesses. We're fighting for their marketing dollars in a competitive market dominated by traditional advertisements such as print &#38; radio, and upcoming digital advertisement from Google Ads, Microsoft/Bing Advertising, Foursquare, and Waze. Other major players in the hyper-local space are Groupon, LivingSocial, Yelp, and Pirq. 

&#160;

By having Members set their preferences, they can receive promos without the need of searching. In essence, SavMobi pre-empts searching making our marketing efforts a step ahead of search advertisement. Since Vendors have set the distance to send their promos and Members opt-in to preferences, the promos that Members receive have high relevancy. 

&#160;

SavMobi is not reliant on check-ins or maps, even though we have similar features. The check-in model gives consumers discounts and offers after they intended to visit that business. Users of Foursquare, a social, check-in network, primarily use the service to notify their friends of their current location. Foursquare is experimenting with ways to monetize their business model and enhance the business experience through promotions. Their current efforts involve methods of exploration and discovery. 

&#160;

Waze created a traffic and navigation app that allows businesses to advertise by pinning their location on maps. Waze is promoting to businesses that they will reach a community of millions of drivers and everyday commuters. However, Waze users are primarily looking for the best route to their intended location not for pins on a map. 

&#160;

Daily deal sites such as Groupon and LivingSocial transformed the hyperlocal market. They brought local vendors new customers through a digital option that had no upfront costs, and they changed consumer perception of redeeming coupons. Although a revolutionary concept, the sustainability of daily deals has not been proven. Businesses that participate in daily deals have mixed experiences including loss of profit, overwhelming peak traffic, and inconsistent results.

&#160;

Yelp and Pirq are expected to be our biggest competitors once our proposed product(s) are launched. Yelp is a local directory service with social networking and user reviews. In the first quarter of 2015, they had more than 142 million unique visitors to their website, yelp.com. Their primary source of revenue comes from local business advertising. Businesses may advertise with Yelp for preferred search result placement and extra listing features. The advertising fee may include an individualized message, video, and photo slide show onto their listing as well as analytic reports. Businesses that advertise with Yelp pay to be at preferred locations on a search page hoping that consumers will see their listing and come to their location. Although that is a strong message, SavMobi goes a step further by putting a more enticing message in front of our Members, a discount or offer. 

&#160;

Pirq's business model is similar to our business model. They've built an app that displays businesses in the area and the discount that is offered. Users look for the business and discount they'd like, enter the business location, and scan a Microsoft tag (similar to a QR code) to receive their discount. Pirq initially launched as a restaurant deals app. They are currently trying to expand to other industries and services. After being in operations for 4.5 years, they are still positioned as a restaurant deals app in the eyes of businesses and consumers. They operate nationwide.

&#160;

There are many competitors that exist. This is a clear indication on the growth and potential of the hyper-local market. Although our competitors share traits and similarities to us, SavMobi intends to build from the ground up to become a preferred vendor platform provided that attracts consumers to local businesses. What distinguishes our proposed Company's software are features that are unique and are not included in our competitors software and apps; these included; Firstly, our proposed Members are able to set their preferences and then receive promos via their smartphones without the need of a general search on the web. In essence, SavMobi pre-empts searching, making our marketing efforts a step ahead of our competitors broad general search advertisements. Secondly, we also allow our proposed Vendors to provide set distances to send their promos and with the Members opt-in preferences, the promos the Members receive (as per their preferences) have a high relevancy. This allows Vendors to target consumers within a specific neighborhood if they so choose.
