 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

COMPANY OVERVIEW &#160; 

Based in the Kansas City metropolitan area, Compass Minerals is a leading producer and marketer of essential minerals, including salt, sulfate of potash specialty fertilizer ("SOP"), magnesium chloride and micronutrients. As of December 31, 2015, we operated 13 production and packaging facilities, including the largest rock salt mine in the world in Goderich, Ontario, Canada, and the largest dedicated rock salt mine in the U.K. in Winsford, Cheshire. Our solar evaporation facility located in Ogden, Utah, is both the largest SOP production site and the largest solar salt production site in North America. We provide highway deicing salt to customers in North America and the U.K. and plant nutrition products to growers and fertilizer distributors worldwide. Our principal plant nutrition product is SOP, which we began marketing under the trade name Protassium+ in 2014. We also sell various premium micronutrient products under our Wolf Trax brand. Additionally, we produce and market consumer deicing and water conditioning products, ingredients used in consumer and commercial food preparation, and other mineral-based products for consumer, agricultural and industrial applications. In the U.K., we operate a records management business utilizing excavated areas of our Winsford salt mine with one other location in London, England. 

SALT SEGMENT &#160; 

Salt is indispensable and enormously versatile with thousands of reported uses. In addition, there are no known cost-effective alternatives for most high-volume uses. As a result, our cash flows from salt have not been materially impacted through a variety of economic cycles. We are among the lowest-cost salt producers in our markets due to our high-grade quality salt deposits, which are among the most extensive in the world, and through the use of effective mining techniques and efficient production processes. 

Through our salt segment, we mine, produce, process, distribute and market sodium chloride and magnesium chloride in North America and sodium chloride in the U.K. Our salt segment products include rock salt, mechanically evaporated and solar evaporated salt, and brine and flake magnesium chloride. We also purchase potassium chloride ("KCl") and calcium chloride to sell as finished products or to blend with sodium chloride to produce specialty products. Sodium chloride (either as a single mineral or in combination with other chlorides) represents the vast majority of the products we produce and sell. Accordingly, we refer to these products collectively as "salt," unless otherwise noted. In 2015, the salt segment accounted for approximately 77% of our gross sales (see Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for segment financial information). 

Salt is used in a wide variety of applications, including as a deicer for highway, consumer and professional use (rock salt and specialty deicers, which include pure or blended magnesium chloride, potassium chloride and calcium chloride salts with sodium chloride), as an ingredient in chemical production, for water treatment, human and animal nutrition, and for a variety of other consumer and industrial uses. 

The demand for salt has historically remained relatively stable during periods of rising prices and through a variety of economic cycles due to its relatively low cost and a diverse number of end uses. However, demand for deicing products is affected by the number and intensity of winter precipitation events in our service territories. 

Salt Industry Overview 

The salt industry has historically been characterized by modest growth and steady price increases across various types of products, after factoring in the impact of winter weather variability. Salt is one of the most common and widely consumed minerals in the world due to its low relative cost and its utility in a variety of applications. We estimate that the consumption of highway deicing rock salt in North America, including rock salt used in chemical manufacturing processes, is approximately 37 million tons per year based on average winter weather conditions, while the consumer and industrial market totals approximately 9 million tons per year. In the U.K., we estimate that the size of the highway deicing market is approximately 2 million tons per year based on average winter weather conditions. According to the latest available data from the U.S. Geological Survey ("USGS"), during the 30 year period ending 2013, the production of salt used in highway deicing and for consumer and industrial products in the U.S. has increased at a historical average rate of approximately 1% per year, although there have been recent fluctuations above and below this average. 

Salt prices vary according to purity and end use, and its pricing differences reflect, among other things, variations in refining and packaging processes. According to the latest USGS data, during the 30 year period ending 2013, prices for salt used in highway deicing and consumer and industrial products in the U.S. have increased at a historical average rate of approximately 3% per year, although there have been recent fluctuations above and below this average. Due to salt&#8217;s relatively low production cost, transportation and handling costs tend to be a significant component of the total delivered cost, which makes logistics management and customer service key competitive factors in the industry. The high relative cost associated with transportation tends to favor producers located nearest to the customers.

Processing Methods 

Our current production capacity, excluding salt and other minerals purchased under contracts, is approximately 15.6 million tons of salt per year. As of December 31, 2015, mining, other production activities and packaging are conducted at 13 of our facilities. The three processing methods we use to produce salt are described below. 

&#160; 

Underground Rock Salt Mining &#8211; &#32;We primarily use a drill and blast mining technique at our North American underground rock salt mines. In addition, we use continuous mining equipment at our Goderich, Ontario, facility. At our Winsford, U.K., facility, we primarily use continuous mining equipment. Mining machinery moves salt from the salt face to conveyor belts, which transport the salt to the mill center where it is crushed and screened. It is then hoisted to the surface where the processed salt is loaded onto shipping vessels, railcars or trucks. The primary power sources for each of our rock salt mines are electricity and diesel fuel. Rock salt is sold in our highway deicing product line and for numerous applications in our consumer and industrial product lines. Underground rock salt mining represents approximately 84% of our current annual salt production capacity. 

&#160; 

Mechanical Evaporation &#8211; &#32;Mechanical evaporation involves obtaining salt brine from underground salt deposits through brine wells and subjecting that salt-saturated brine to vacuum pressure and heat to precipitate and crystallize salt. The primary power 

sources are natural gas and electricity. The resulting product is high purity and has a uniform physical shape. Mechanically evaporated salt is primarily sold through our consumer and industrial salt product lines and represents approximately 6% of our current annual salt production capacity. 

&#160; 

Solar Evaporation &#8211; &#32;Solar evaporation is used in areas of the world where high-salinity brine is available and where weather conditions provide for a high natural evaporation rate. The brine is pumped into a series of large open ponds where sun and wind evaporate the water and crystallize the salt, which is then mechanically harvested and processed through washing, drying and screening. We produce solar salt at the Great Salt Lake in Utah, and sell it through both our consumer and industrial and our highway deicing product lines. Solar evaporation represents approximately 10% of our current annual salt production capacity. 

We also produce magnesium chloride through the solar evaporation process. We precipitate sodium chloride and potassium-rich salts from the brine, leaving a concentrated magnesium chloride brine solution. This resulting concentrated brine becomes the raw material used to produce several magnesium chloride products, which are sold through both our consumer and industrial and highway deicing product lines, as well as our plant nutrition segment. 

Operations and Facilities 

Canada &#8211; &#32;We produce finished salt products at four locations in Canada. Rock salt mined at our Goderich, Ontario, mine serves the highway deicing markets and the consumer and industrial markets in Canada and the Great Lakes region of the U.S., principally through a series of depots located around the Great Lakes and through packaging facilities. Mechanically evaporated salt used for our consumer and industrial product lines is produced at three facilities strategically located throughout Canada: Amherst, Nova Scotia, in Eastern Canada; Goderich, Ontario, in Central Canada; and Unity, Saskatchewan, in Western Canada. 

United States &#8211; &#32;Our Cote Blanche, Louisiana, rock salt mine serves highway deicing customers through a series of depots located along the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers (and their major tributaries) and chemical and agricultural customers in the Southern and Midwestern U.S. Our solar evaporation facility located in Ogden, Utah, is the largest solar salt production site in North America. This facility principally serves the Midwestern and Western U.S. consumer and industrial markets, provides salt for highway deicing and chemical applications, and produces magnesium chloride, which is used in deicing, dust control and unpaved road surface stabilization applications. The production capacity for solar-evaporated salt at our Ogden facility is currently only limited by demand. Our Central and Midwestern U.S. consumer and industrial customer base is primarily served by our mechanical evaporation plant in Lyons, Kansas. Additionally, we serve areas with evaporated salt purchased from other suppliers&#8217; facilities. We also operate four salt packaging facilities in Illinois, Minnesota, New York and Wisconsin, which principally serve consumer deicing and water conditioning customers in the Central, Midwestern and parts of the Northeastern U.S. 

United Kingdom &#8211; &#32;Our Winsford rock salt mine in Northwest, England, near Manchester, serves the U.K. highway deicing market, primarily in England and Wales.

(a) Annual production capacity is our estimate of the tons that can be produced assuming a normal amount of scheduled down time and operation of our facilities under normal working conditions. 

(b) We continue to invest in the mine to achieve production capacity of approximately 9.0 million tons annually. 

(c) Solar salts deposited annually substantially exceed the amount converted into finished products. The amount presented here represents an approximate average amount produced based on recent market demand. 

(d) The magnesium chloride amount includes both brine and flake. 

Salt production, including magnesium chloride, at these facilities totaled 14.9 million tons, 15.2 million tons and 12.8 million tons for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We also purchase salt and other minerals under contracts with third-parties to supplement our production when needed. Variations in production volumes are typically attributable to variations in the winter season weather typically ending in March of each year, which impacts the demand during the winter for highway and consumer deicing products. 

Salt deposits are found throughout the world, and where it is commercially produced or extracted, it is typically deposited in extremely large quantities. Our production facilities have access to vast mineral deposits. In most of our production locations, we estimate the recoverable salt reserves to last at least several more decades at current production rates and capacities. Our rights to extract those minerals may be contractually limited by either geographic boundaries or time. We believe that we will be able to continue to extend these agreements, as we have in the past, at commercially reasonable terms without incurring substantial costs or material modifications to the existing lease terms and conditions, thereby allowing us to extract the additional salt necessary to fully develop our existing mineral rights. 

Our underground mines in Canada (Goderich, Ontario), the U.S. (Cote Blanche, Louisiana) and the U.K. (Winsford, Cheshire) make up 84% of our salt producing capacity. See Item 1A., "Risk Factors &#8211; Our operations are dependent on our rights and ability to mine our properties and having renewed or received the required permits and approvals from third-parties and governmental authorities." Each of these mines is operated with modern mining equipment and utilizes subsurface improvements such as vertical shaft lift systems, milling and crushing facilities, maintenance and repair shops, and extensive raw materials handling systems. We believe our properties and our operating equipment are maintained in good working condition. 

We own the mine site at Goderich, Ontario. We also maintain a mineral lease at Goderich with the provincial government, which grants us the right to mine salt. This lease expires in 2022 with our option to renew until 2043 after demonstrating to the lessor that the mine&#8217;s useful life is greater than the lease&#8217;s term. The Cote Blanche mine is operated under land and mineral leases with third-party landowners who grant us the right to mine salt. The mine site and salt reserves at the Winsford mine are owned. 

Our mines at Goderich, Cote Blanche and Winsford have been in operation for approximately 56, 50 and 170 years, respectively. We estimate that our mines at Goderich, Cote Blanche and Winsford have approximately 894.1 million, 248.8 million and 34.2 million tons, respectively, remaining at December 31, 2015. At current average rates of production, we estimate that our remaining years of production for the recoverable minerals we presently own or lease to be 119, 75 and 35 years, respectively. In 2014, we received a third-party study which increased the estimated number of tons available to be mined at our Winsford mine based upon a new extraction method. In addition, we amended the lease at our Cote Blanche mine in 2014 to extend the lease term by providing two extension periods of 25 years, each at our option. The amended lease also includes the right to mine additional mineral reserves. We are working with a third-party to estimate the number of tons that will be available to be mined. Until we receive an

2015 FORM 10-K 

independent third-party study, our estimate of Cote Blanche&#8217;s remaining years of production is based upon an estimate of an additional 18.6 million tons of mineral reserves. 

Our mineral interests are amortized on an individual mine basis over estimated useful lives not to exceed 99 years using primarily the units-of-production method. Our estimates are based on, among other things, the results of reserve studies completed by a third-party geological engineering firm. The reserve estimates are primarily a function of the area and volume covered by the mining rights and estimates of our extraction rates based upon an expectation of operating the mines on a long-term basis. Established criteria for proven and probable reserves are primarily applicable to mining deposits of discontinuous metal, where both the presence of ore and its variable grade need to be precisely identified. However, the massive continuous nature of evaporative deposits, such as salt, requires proportionately less data for the same degree of confidence in mineral reserves, both in terms of quantity and quality. Reserve studies performed by a third-party engineering firm suggest that our salt reserves most closely resemble probable reserves and we have therefore classified our reserves as probable reserves. 

In addition, we acquired the mining rights to approximately 100 million tons of salt reserves in the Chilean Atacama Desert in 2012. This reserve estimate is based upon an initial report. We will need to complete a feasibility study before we proceed with the development of this project to ensure our salt reserves are probable. The development of this project will require significant infrastructure to establish extraction and logistics capabilities. 

We package salt products at four additional Company-owned and operated facilities. Our packaging capacity is based on our estimate of the tons than can be packaged at these facilities assuming a normal amount of scheduled down-time and operation of our facilities under normal working conditions. The chart below shows the packaging capacity at each of these facilities: 

&#160; 

In early 2015, we began operation of a packaging facility in Buffalo, New York. As of December 31, 2015, we also have a contract to purchase salt from one supplier in North America, which has a minimum purchasing commitment. 

&#160; 

Products and Sales &#8211; &#32;We sell our salt products through our highway deicing product line (which includes brine magnesium chloride as well as rock salt treated with this mineral) and our consumer and industrial product line (which includes salt as well 

as products containing magnesium chloride and calcium chloride in both pure form and blended with salt). Highway deicing, including salt sold to chemical customers, constituted approximately 47% of our gross sales in 2015. Our principal customers are states, provinces, counties, municipalities and road maintenance contractors that purchase bulk deicing salt, both treated and untreated, for ice control on public roadways. Highway deicing salt in North America is sold primarily through an annual tendered bid contract process with governmental entities, as well as through some longer-term contracts, with price, product quality and delivery capabilities as the primary competitive market factors. See Item 1A., "Risk Factors &#8211; The Company is subject to numerous laws and regulations with which we must comply in order to operate our business and obtain contracts with governmental entities." Some sales also occur through negotiated sales contracts with third-party customers, particularly in the U.K. Since transportation costs are a relatively large portion of the cost to deliver products to customers, the locations of the salt sources and distribution networks also play a significant role in the ability of suppliers to serve customers. We have an extensive network of approximately 80 depots for storage and distribution of highway deicing salt in North America. The majority of these depots are located on the Great Lakes and the Mississippi and Ohio River systems (and their major tributaries) where our Goderich, Ontario, and Cote Blanche, Louisiana, mines are located to serve those markets. Salt and brine magnesium chloride from our Ogden, Utah, facility are also used for highway deicing in the Western and upper Midwest regions of the U.S. Treated rock salt, which is typically rock salt treated with brine magnesium chloride and organic materials that enhance the performance of the salt, is sold throughout our markets. 

We produce highway deicing salt in the U.K. at our mining facility at Winsford, Cheshire, the largest dedicated rock salt mine in the U.K. We believe our production capability and favorable logistics position enhance our ability to meet the U.K.&#8217;s winter demands. Due to our strong position, we are viewed as a key supplier by the U.K.&#8217;s Highways Agency. In the U.K., approximately 70% of our highway deicing business customers have multi-year contracts.

Winter weather variability is the most significant factor affecting salt sales for deicing applications, because mild winters reduce the need for salt used in ice and snow control. On average, over the last three years, approximately two-thirds of our deicing product sales occurred during November through March each year when winter weather was most severe. Lower than expected sales during this period could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The vast majority of our North American deicing sales are made in Canada and the Midwestern U.S. where inclement weather during the winter months causes dangerous road conditions. In keeping with industry practice, we stockpile quantities of salt to meet estimated requirements for the next winter season. See Item 1A., "Risk Factors &#8211; The seasonal demand for our products and the variations in our operations from quarter to quarter due to weather conditions, including any effects from climate changes, may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and the price of our common stock" and Item 7, "Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Seasonality." 

Our principal chemical customers are producers of intermediate chemical products used in the production of vinyls and other chemicals, pulp and paper, as well as water treatment and a variety of other industrial uses. We typically have multi-year supply agreements, which are negotiated privately with our chemical customers. Price, service, product quality and security of supply are the major competitive market factors. 

Sales of our consumer and industrial products accounted for approximately 30% of our 2015 gross sales. We are the third largest producer of consumer and industrial salt products in North America. This product line includes commercial and consumer applications, such as water conditioning, consumer and professional ice control, food processing, agricultural applications, table salt and a variety of industrial applications. We believe that we are among the largest private-label producers of water conditioning and table salt products in Canada. Our Sifto &#174; &#32;brand encompasses a full line of salt products, which are well recognized in Canada. 

Our consumer and industrial sales are driven by broad product lines, strong customer relationships and products using both private-label and Company brands. Our consumer and industrial product line is distributed through many channels including, but not limited to, retail, agricultural, industrial, janitorial and sanitation, and resellers. The consumer and industrial product line is channeled from our plants and third-party warehouses to our customers using a combination of direct sales personnel, contract personnel and a network of brokers or manufacturers&#8217; representatives. 

The chart below shows our shipments of salt products: 

Competition &#8211; &#32;We face strong competition in each of the markets in which we operate. In North America, other large, nationally and internationally recognized companies compete against our salt products. In addition, there are also several smaller regional producers of salt. There are several importers of salt into North America, which mostly impact the East Coast and West Coast of the U.S. where we have minimal market presence. Two competitors serve the highway deicing salt market in the U.K.: one in Northern England and one in Northern Ireland. There are typically not significant imports of highway deicing salt into the U.K. See Item 1A., "Risk Factors &#8211; Competition in our markets and governmental policies and regulations could limit our ability to attract and retain customers, force us to continuously make capital investments, alter supply levels, and put pressure on the prices we can charge for our products."

PLANT NUTRITION SEGMENT 

&#160; 

Fertilizers serve a significant role in efficient crop production around the world. Potassium is a vital nutrient for virtually all crops, as it assists in regulating plants&#8217; growth and improves durability. There are two major forms of potassium-based fertilizer, SOP and muriate of potash ("MOP"). SOP is primarily used as a specialty fertilizer, providing potassium and sulfur with no chlorides, which is essential in increasing the yield and quality of high-value and chloride-sensitive crops, such as vegetables, fruits, potatoes, nuts, tobacco and turfgrass. Many high-value or chloride-sensitive crop yields and/or quality are improved when SOP is used as a potassium nutrient, rather than MOP. We are the leading SOP producer and marketer in North America, and we may also market SOP products internationally depending on market conditions. In 2014, we branded our SOP products under the name Protassium+. We offer several grades of Protassium+ products, which are designed to serve the special needs of our customers. Our plant in Ogden, Utah, is the largest in North America and one of only four large-scale solar brine evaporation operations for SOP in the world. Our SOP plant in Wynyard, Saskatchewan, is Canada&#8217;s only producer of SOP. 

In April 2014, we completed the acquisition of Wolf Trax, Inc., a privately-held Canadian corporation (renamed Compass Minerals Manitoba Inc. ("Compass Manitoba")), which develops and distributes micronutrient products under the Wolf Trax brand. Compass Manitoba develops and markets these innovative crop products based upon proprietary and patented technologies. The acquisition has provided us an opportunity to enter new product and geographic markets and position ourselves as a key resource for premium plant nutrition products. 

In December 2015, we completed the acquisition of a 35% equity stake in Produqu&#237;mica Ind&#250;stria e Com&#233;rcio S.A. ("Produqu&#237;mica"), a Brazilian corporation. Produqu&#237;mica is one of Brazil's leading manufacturers and distributors of specialty plant nutrients. The investment includes a path to full ownership by early 2019 at the latest. This strategic investment represents an important step in our growth plan to reach $500 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") by 2018. With this investment, we gained access to one of the world's most important agriculture markets and a partner who has a 50-year history of innovation and growth in the Brazilian specialty plant nutrition market. 

In 2015, the plant nutrition segment accounted for approximately 22% of our gross sales (see Note 15 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for segment financial information). 

Historically, our domestic sales of Protassium+ have been concentrated in the Western and Southeastern U.S. where the crops and soil conditions favor the use of low-chloride potassium nutrients, such as SOP. Consequently, weather patterns and field conditions in these locations can impact plant nutrition sales volumes. Additionally, the demand for, and market price of, SOP may be affected by the broader potash market and the economics of the crops SOP serves. The plant nutrient market is influenced by many factors such as world grain and food supply, changes in consumer diets, general levels of economic activity, government food programs, and governmental agriculture and energy policies in the U.S. and around the world. Economic factors may affect the amount or type of crop grown in certain locations, or the type or amount of fertilizer product used. 

Plant Nutrition Industry Overview 

Our plant nutrition segment includes sales of SOP and micronutrients. The average annual worldwide consumption of all potash fertilizers is approximately 77 million tons. MOP is the most common source of potassium and accounts for approximately 85% of all potash consumed in fertilizer production. SOP represents approximately 10% of all potash consumption. The remainder is supplied in forms containing varying concentrations of potassium (expressed as potassium oxide) along with different combinations of co-nutrients. 

MOP is the most widely used potassium source for most crops and is a less expensive form of potash fertilizer than SOP. SOP (which contains the equivalent of approximately 50% potassium oxide) is utilized by growers for many high-value crops, especially where there are needs or a desire for fertilizers with low chloride content or when the grower seeks a higher yield or quality for their crops. The use of SOP has been proven to improve the yield and/or quality of many high-value or chloride-sensitive crops such as citrus fruits, grapes, almonds, some vegetables, tobacco, and turfgrass, including turf for golf courses. SOP market pricing has historically been above MOP market pricing. 

Worldwide consumption of potash has increased in response to growing populations and the need for additional food supplies. We expect the long-term demand for potassium nutrients to continue to grow as arable land per capita decreases, thereby encouraging improved crop yields. 

The micronutrients market has been growing over the last several years, and we expect it to continue its growth in the future. While used in small amounts, these plant food elements play important roles in plant development, and nutrient deficient soils must be replenished to obtain higher crop yields using the current available land resources. 

Approximately 91% of our annual plant nutrition sales volumes in 2015 were made to domestic customers, who include retail fertilizer dealers and distributors of agricultural products as well as professional turf care customers. In some cases, these dealers and distributors combine or blend our plant nutrition products with other fertilizers and minerals to produce fertilizer blends tailored to individual requirements. See Item 1A., "Risk Factors &#8211; Competition in our markets and governmental policies and regulations could limit our ability to attract and retain customers, force us to continuously make capital investments, alter supply levels, and put pressure on the prices we can charge for our products."

Operations and Facilities 

We produce Protassium+ at two facilities, both located in North America: at the Great Salt Lake, near Ogden, Utah, and at a site near Wynyard, Saskatchewan. Our Ogden facility is the largest SOP production site in North America. The facility operates more than 45,000 acres of solar evaporation ponds to produce SOP and salt, including magnesium chloride, from the naturally occurring brine of the Great Salt Lake. The facility operates on land that is both owned and leased under renewable leases from the state of Utah. We believe that our property and operating equipment are maintained in good working condition. This facility has the capability to produce up to 320,000 tons of solar-pond-based SOP, approximately 750,000 tons of magnesium chloride and 1.5 million tons of salt annually when weather conditions are typical. 

These recoverable minerals exist in vast quantities in the Great Salt Lake. We believe the recoverable minerals exceed 100 years of reserves at current production rates and capacities and the lake quantities are so vast that they will not be significantly impacted by our production. While our rights to extract these minerals are contractually limited, we believe we will be able to extend our lease agreements, as we have in the past, at commercially reasonable terms, without incurring substantial costs or incurring material modifications to the existing lease terms and conditions. 

Initially, we draw mineral-rich lake water, or brine, from the Great Salt Lake into our solar evaporation ponds. The brine moves through a series of solar evaporation ponds over a two- to three-year production cycle. As the water evaporates and the mineral concentration increases, some of those minerals naturally precipitate out of the brine and are deposited on the floors of the ponds. We manage the brine through the entire solar pond system. This process produces the salts necessary to process into SOP, salt and magnesium chloride. The evaporation process is dependent upon sufficient lake brine levels and hot, arid summer weather conditions. The potassium-bearing salts are mechanically harvested out of the solar evaporation ponds and refined to high-purity SOP in our production facility. 

We can use KCl and other potassium-rich minerals as a raw material feedstock to supplement our solar harvest to help meet demand when it is economically feasible. In the last three years, we have purchased and consumed KCl and/or raw material feedstock to supplement production. 

We have invested in our Ogden facility to strengthen our solar-pond-based SOP production through upgrades to our processing plant and our solar evaporation ponds. The objectives have included some modification to our existing solar evaporation ponds to increase the annual solar harvest and the extraction yield from the harvest and processing capacity of our SOP plant. These improvements have increased our current annual solar-pond-based SOP production capacity from our prior capacity of 250,000 tons per year up to our current capacity of 320,000 tons. 

We have identified opportunities and have begun to further expand our solar-pond-based SOP production capacity. After the completion of this additional expansion, we expect our SOP production capacity to be approximately 550,000 tons, including tons produced using KCl feedstock. 

We also own and operate Compass Minerals Wynyard Inc., which contributes 40,000 tons to our annual SOP capacity. The facility is located on the Big Quill Lake near Wynyard, Saskatchewan, Canada. We combine sulfate-rich brine with sourced potassium chloride to create SOP through ion exchange and glaserite processes. This product is high purity and is used in addition to crop nutrient applications as well as specialty, non-agricultural applications. 

We hold numerous governmental, environmental, mining and other permits, water rights, and approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities. 

Products and Sales &#8211; &#32;Historically, our domestic sales of SOP have been concentrated in the Western and Southeastern U.S. where the crops and soil conditions favor the use of SOP as a source of potassium nutrients. In 2013, we increased our focus on our core domestic market which recognizes the value of SOP and is closer to our production facilities which further benefits our net selling price. Our Wolf Trax product line expands the markets that we serve. Our micronutrient products are essential to a wide range of crops, including commodity row crops, as different plants and soil conditions require different micronutrients. International plant nutrition sales volumes in 2015 were 9% of our annual plant nutrition sales. See Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We have an experienced sales group focusing on the specialty aspects and benefits of SOP as a source of potassium nutrients and the benefits of various micronutrients to plant health.

The chart below shows our domestic and international shipments of our plant nutrient products: 

Competition &#32;&#8211; Approximately 56% of the world SOP capacity is located in East Asia/China, 23% in Western Europe, 4% in North America, 4% in South America and the remaining 13% in other countries. The world capacity of SOP totals about 11 million tons. Our major competition for SOP sales in North America includes imports from Germany, Chile and Belgium. In addition, there is functional competition between SOP and other forms of potassium crop nutrients. Internationally, we compete on a global level with a variety of other producers. See Item 1A., "Risk Factors &#8211; &#32;Competition in our markets and governmental policies and regulations could limit our ability to attract and retain customers, force us to continuously make capital investments, alter supply levels, and put pressure on the prices we can charge for our products." The micronutrient market is highly fragmented with many suppliers serving differing needs. Commodity and specialty crops require micronutrients in varying degrees depending on the crop and soil conditions. While sales of Wolf Trax products have historically been concentrated in North America, we also sell our micronutrient products globally, primarily in Europe, Central and South America, and the Caribbean. 

During 2015, the Company's domestic and international net sales accounted for 91% and 9%, respectively, of total net sales. Information regarding financial data by geographic segment is set forth in Note 15 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

OTHER 

&#160; 

DeepStore is our records management business in the U.K. that utilizes portions of previously excavated space in our salt mine in Winsford, Cheshire, for secure underground document storage and one warehouse location in London, England. Currently, DeepStore does not have a significant share of the document storage market in the U.K., nor is it material in comparison to our salt and plant nutrition segments. 

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyright and trade secret protection, employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements, license arrangements, and domain name registrations to protect our intellectual property. We sell many of our products under a number of registered trademarks that we believe are widely recognized in the industry. The following items are some of our registered trademarks pursuant to applicable intellectual property laws and are the property of our subsidiaries: American Stockman; Chlori-Mag; DDP; DeepStore; DustGuard; FreezGard; IceAWay; K-Life; Nature&#8217;s Own; Protassium and design; ProSoft; Protinus; Safe Step; Sifto; Sure Soft; Sure-Paws; Thawrox; and Wolf Trax and design. No single patent, trademark or trade name is material to our business as a whole. 

Any issued patents that cover our proprietary technology and any of our other intellectual property rights may not provide us with substantial protection or be commercially beneficial to us. The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity or its enforceability. Competitors may also be able to design around our patents. If we are unable to protect our patented technologies, our competitors could commercialize our technologies. 

With respect to proprietary know-how, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements. Monitoring the unauthorized use of our technology is difficult, and the steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology. The disclosure or misappropriation of our intellectual property could harm our ability to protect our rights and our competitive position. See Item 1A., "Risk Factors &#8211; Our intellectual property may be misappropriated or subject to claims of infringement."

With respect to each facility at which we extract salt, brine or SOP, permits or licenses are obtained as needed in the normal course of business based on our mine plans and federal, state, provincial and local regulatory provisions regarding mine permitting and licensing. Based on our historical permitting experience, we expect to be able to continue to obtain necessary mining permits to support historical rates of production. 

Our mineral leases have varying terms. Some will expire after a set term of years, while others continue indefinitely. Many of these leases provide for a royalty payment to the lessor based on a specific amount per ton of minerals extracted or as a percentage of revenue. In addition, we own a number of properties and are party to non-mining leases that permit us to perform activities that are ancillary to our mining operations, such as surface use leases for storage at depots and warehouse leases. We believe that all of our leases were entered into at market terms.

The following map shows the locations of our principal mineral extraction, packaging and document storage operating facilities as of December 31, 2015: 

ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY MATTERS 

&#160; 

We produce and distribute crop and animal nutrients, salt, and deicing products. These activities subject us to an evolving set of international, federal, state, provincial and local environmental, health and safety ("EHS") laws that regulate, or propose to regulate: (i) product content; (ii) use of products by both us and our customers; (iii) conduct of mining and production operations, including safety procedures followed by employees; (iv) management and handling of raw materials; (v) air and water quality impacts from our facilities; (vi) disposal, storage and management of hazardous and solid wastes; (vii) remediation of contamination at our facilities and third-party sites; and (viii) post-mining land reclamation. For new regulatory programs, it is difficult for us to ascertain future compliance obligations or estimate future costs until implementation of the regulations has been finalized and definitive regulatory interpretations have been adopted. We address regulatory requirements by making necessary modifications to our facilities and/or operating procedures. 

We have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, financial and managerial resources to comply with EHS laws and regulations, as well as Company EHS standards. We estimate that our 2016 EHS capital expenditures will total approximately $3.3 million. We expect that our estimated expenditures in 2016 for reclamation activities will be approximately $0.1 million. It is possible that greater than anticipated EHS capital expenditures or reclamation expenditures will be required in 2016 or in the future. 

We maintain accounting accruals for certain contingent environmental liabilities and believe these accruals comply with generally accepted accounting principles. We record accruals for environmental investigatory and non-capital remediation costs when we believe it is probable that we will be responsible, in whole or in part, for environmental remediation activities, and the expenditures for such activities are reasonably estimable. Based on current information, it is the opinion of management that our contingent liabilities arising from EHS matters, taking into account established accruals, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. As of December 31, 2015, we had recorded environmental accruals of $1.4 million.

Product Requirements and their Impact 

International, federal, state and provincial standards (i) require registration of many of our products before such products can be sold; (ii) impose labeling requirements on those products; and (iii) require producers to manufacture the products to formulations set forth on the labels. Environmental, natural resource and public health agencies at all regulatory levels continue to evaluate alleged health and environmental impacts that might arise from the handling and use of products such as those we manufacture. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA"), the State of California and The Fertilizer Institute have each completed independent assessments of potential risks posed by crop nutrient materials. These assessments concluded that, based on the available data, crop nutrient materials generally do not pose harm to human health. It is unclear whether any further evaluations may result in additional standards or regulatory requirements for the producing industries, including us, or for our customers. It is the opinion of management that the potential impact of these standards on the market for our products or on the expenditures that may be necessary to meet new requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

Operating Requirements and Impacts 

We hold numerous environmental and mining permits, water rights, and other permits or approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities. Our operations are subject to permits for extraction of salt and brine, emissions of process materials to air and discharges to surface water, and injection of brine and wastewater to subsurface wells. Some of our proposed activities may require waste storage permits. A decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed permit or approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility. In addition, changes to environmental and mining regulations or permit requirements could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility. Expansion of our operations also is predicated upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals. See Item 1A., "Risk Factors &#8211; Environmental laws and regulation may subject us to significant liability and could require us to incur additional costs in the future." 

We have also developed alternative mine uses. For example, we sold an excavated portion of our salt mine in the U.K. to a subsidiary of Veolia Environnement ("Veolia"), a business with operations in the waste management industry. That business is permitted by the jurisdictional environmental agency to dispose of certain stable types of hazardous waste in the area of the salt mine owned by them. We believe that the mine is stable and provides a secure disposal location separate from our mining and records management operations. However, we recognize that any temporary or permanent storage of hazardous waste may involve risks to the environment. Although we believe that we have taken these risks into account during our planning process, and Veolia is required by U.K. statute to maintain adequate security for any potential closure obligation, it is possible that material expenditures could be required in the future to further reduce this risk or to remediate any future contamination. 

Remedial Activities 

Remediation at Our Facilities &#8211; Many of our current and formerly owned facilities have been in operation for decades. Operations have historically involved the use and handling of regulated chemical substances, salt and by-products or process tailings by us and predecessor operators, which have resulted in soil, surface water and groundwater contamination. 

At many of these facilities, spills or other releases of regulated substances have occurred previously and potentially could occur in the future, possibly requiring us to undertake or fund cleanup efforts under the U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA") or state, provincial or other federal laws in other jurisdictions governing cleanup or disposal of hazardous substances. In some instances, we have agreed, pursuant to consent orders or agreements with the appropriate governmental agencies, to undertake investigations, which currently are in progress, to determine whether remedial action may be required to address such contamination. At other locations, we have entered into consent orders or agreements with appropriate governmental agencies to perform required remedial activities that will address identified site conditions. At still other locations, we have undertaken voluntary remediation and have removed formerly used underground storage tanks. Expenditures for these known conditions currently are not expected, individually or in the aggregate, to be significant. However, material expenditures could be required in the future to remediate the contamination at these or at other current or former sites. 

The Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection ("DATCP") has information indicating that agricultural chemicals are present within the subsurface area of the Kenosha, Wisconsin, plant. The agricultural chemicals were used by previous owners and operators of the site. None of the identified chemicals have been used in association with Compass Minerals&#8217; operations since it acquired the property in 2002. DATCP directed us to conduct further investigations into the possible presence of agricultural chemicals in soil and ground water at the Kenosha plant. We have completed such investigations of the soils and ground water and have provided the findings to DATCP. We are presently proceeding with select remediation activities to mitigate agricultural chemical impact to soils and ground water at the site. All investigations and mitigation activities to date, and any potential future remediation work, are being conducted under the Wisconsin Agricultural Chemical Cleanup Program ("ACCP"), which would provide for reimbursement of some of the costs. We may seek participation by, or cost reimbursement from, other parties responsible for the presence of any agricultural chemicals found in soil and ground water at this site if we do not receive an acknowledgment of no further action and are required to conduct further investigation or remedial work that may not be eligible for reimbursement under the ACCP.

Remediation at Third-Party Facilities &#32;&#8211; Along with impacting the sites at which we have operated, various third parties have alleged that our past operations have resulted in contamination to neighboring off-site areas or third-party facilities including third-party disposal facilities for regulated substances generated by our operating activities. CERCLA imposes liability, without regard to fault or to the legality of a party&#8217;s conduct, on certain categories of persons who are considered to have contributed to the release of "hazardous substances" into the environment. Under CERCLA, or its various state analogues, one party may potentially be required to bear more than its proportional share of cleanup costs at a site where it has liability if payments cannot be obtained from other responsible parties. 

We have entered into " de minimis" &#32;settlement agreements with the EPA with respect to several CERCLA sites, pursuant to which we have made one-time cash payments and received statutory protection from future claims arising from those sites. In some cases, however, such settlements have included "reopeners," which could result in additional liability at such sites in the event of newly discovered contamination or other circumstances. 

At other sites for which we have received notice of potential CERCLA liability, we have provided information to the EPA that we believe demonstrates that we are not liable, and the EPA has not asserted claims against us with respect to such sites. In some instances, we have agreed, pursuant to orders from or agreements with appropriate governmental agencies or agreements with private parties, to undertake or fund investigations, some of which currently are in progress, to determine whether remedial action, under CERCLA or otherwise, may be required to address contamination. At other locations, we have entered into consent orders or agreements with appropriate governmental agencies to perform required remedial activities that will address identified site conditions. 

At present, we are not aware of any additional sites for which we expect to receive a notice from the EPA or any other party of potential CERCLA liability that would have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, based on past operations, there is a potential that we may receive notices in the future for issues at sites of which we are currently unaware or that our liability for issues at sites currently known may increase. 

Expenditures for our known environmental liabilities and site conditions currently are not expected, individually or in the aggregate, to be material or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
