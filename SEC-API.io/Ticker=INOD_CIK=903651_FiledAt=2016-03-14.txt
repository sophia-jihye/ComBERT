Business Overview 

&#160; 

Innodata (NASDAQ: INOD) is a global digital services and solutions company. Our technology and services power leading information products and online retail destinations around the world. Our solutions help prestigious enterprises harness the power of digital data to re-imagine how they operate and drive performance. We serve publishers, media and information companies, digital retailers, banks, insurance companies, government agencies and many other industries. Founded in 1988, we comprise a team of 5,000 diverse people in eight countries who are dedicated to delivering services and solutions that help the world embrace digital data as a means of enhancing our lives and transforming our businesses.&#8203;&#8203;

&#160;

The Company operates in three reporting segments: Content Services (CS), Innodata Advanced Data Solutions (IADS) and Media Intelligence Solutions (MIS).

&#160;

Content Services (CS) Segment 

&#160;

Our CS segment provides solutions to digital retailers, information services companies, publishers and enterprises that have one or more of the following broad business requirements: development of digital content (including e-books); development of new digital information products; and operational support of existing digital information products and systems.

&#160;

&#160; 1 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Many of our clients are driving or are responding to rapid and fundamental changes in the way end users discover, consume and create published information. For some of our publishing and information services clients, this means transforming information products from print to digital; for others, it means migrating already-digital products from web-only distribution to multiple-channel distribution that includes mobile and tablet devices and incorporates mobility, social platform and semantic search; and for others still, it means re-tooling pure search-based information products into workflow-embedded analytical tools that combine content with software to enable context-aware decision-making; and for a select number of our information services clients, it means embracing the content-as-a-service model to integrate content with other tools, applications and data. Each of these transformations requires shifts in products, as well as the technology and the operations that support them.

&#160;

For our enterprise publishing clients, changes in the way end users discover, consume and create published information often necessitates replacing old processes and technologies that generated static, whole documents with new processes and technologies that enable content to reside as modular components which are re-combined dynamically to create up-to-date, product-specific assembly guides, engineering diagrams/schematics, compliance documentation, field operations guides and clinical documentation destined simultaneously for the web, tablets and smartphones.

&#160;

By blending consulting, technology and operations sourcing, along with deep domain expertise, we provide measurable outcomes for publishing companies, information services companies and enterprises through business transformation, accelerating innovation and efficient operations.

&#160;

E-Book Production and Distribution 

&#160; 

We are one of the largest producers of e-books, serving four of the five leading digital retailers of e-books as well as 80 leading trade, education and professional publishers that sell e-books. We manufacture both standard e-books and interactive e-books in a variety of formats (including EPUB, Mobi and Kindle) and in 12 major languages (including Japanese and Chinese). In addition, we distribute e-books on behalf of publishers and authors to more than 25 e-book retailers across North America, the United Kingdom, Australia and 24 countries in the European Union. Since the fall of 2011, we have produced over 1,000,000 e-book titles.

&#160;

Information Product Development 

&#160; 

We help our clients develop high-value information products. Our clients include four of the ten largest information industry companies in the world, spanning financial, legal, healthcare and scientific information. Information and publishing is a $766 billion industry consisting of more than 7,000 publishers, information providers and software service firms worldwide. Many of our clients specialize in the scientific, technical and medical (STM) segment (estimated revenues of $33.7 billion) and the legal and regulatory (L&#38;R) segment (estimated revenues of $21.2 billion) 1 .

&#160;

Both STM and L&#38;R publishers make some or all of their revenues from the sale of information products created from the primary and secondary data produced by professionals and researchers (in the case of STM) or courts, legislatures, administrative bodies and rule-making institutions (in the case of L&#38;R).

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

We enable our clients to rapidly develop new digital products without direct investments in staff, facilities and technology. We embrace agile development methodologies that provide the benefits of early solution visualization and an iterative development process that spans content, technology and user interface development. We use a combination of onsite project management, onshore solutions architecture and offshore globally distributed teams of developers, analysts and subject matter experts.

&#160;

For example, a leading legal publisher sought to develop a new digital product that would provide lawyers and compliance officers a workflow tool for rule checking, rapid research and fact checking. The new digital tool needed to be accessible via laptops, smart phones and tablet devices. Moreover, it needed to be updated daily to maintain pace with rapid regulatory developments (it was destined to replace a printed loose leaf series that was updated only monthly). Our technology architects, developers and content analysts designed and implemented the new digital tool within budget and on schedule. Using the new digital tool, lawyers and compliance officers can now confidently react faster to their clients&#8217; increased regulatory burdens with up-to-date information.

&#160;

For another leading global publisher, we developed an eReader application designed specifically for complex professional reference material. The publisher saw an opportunity to increase sales by re-publishing its printed reference works as e-books, but was unable to market them as e-books because existing eReader applications were built for simple fiction and trade books. We developed an eReader application for the client that changed this &#8211; it enabled advanced search, linking and cross-references to external sources, subscriber annotations, frequent textual updates and a host of other functions the publisher required in order to distribute its complex reference books as e-books over the iPad &#174; as well as Android and Windows-enabled mobile devices.

&#160;

Operational Support 

&#160;

We help our clients significantly lower the cost of maintaining their high-value information products, applications and systems. Clients for which we perform such services include five of the top ten leading legal, tax and regulatory information providers, three of the top ten credit and financial information providers, and four of the top ten scientific, technical and medical information providers. Relative to information products, our focus is on the underlying &#8220;content supply chain&#8221; activities that are necessary to maintain the product. These activities often include content aggregation; extraction; encoding; indexing and abstracting; fabrication; and distribution. We deliver these activities on an outsourced basis.

&#160;

For example, for a leading provider of networking equipment, we provided digital enhancement and related production systems support for its product guides, release notes, configurations guides, installation guides and other documents.

&#160;

For an $8 billion leading provider of financial and news information, we aggregate public source documentation from a variety of government agencies, which we transform, analyze and extract in order to support a real-time, high-value information product.

&#160;

For a leading wholesale textbook distributor, we provided support and maintenance for its digital book platform, including its customizable bookshelf and eReader applications and its conversion and fulfillment processes.

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Digital Content Supply Chain Strategy 

&#160;

We work with clients at a strategic business and technology level to address business process and technology challenges related to digital content supply chain optimization and strategy. By aligning operations and technology with business goals, we help businesses accelerate new product development and introduction; control cost; consolidate and leverage technology investment; and obtain benefits of scale.

&#160;

For a multinational information services company, we worked in conjunction with a client&#8217;s internal teams to design new content architectures and implement new content technologies that enabled the client to migrate its operations away from process and technologies designed primarily for print output to new processes and technologies that were designed around the nature of the content itself and supported multiple simultaneous delivery channels.

&#160;

A global information company had acquired two businesses that each collected, processed and managed some of the same public law content. The company recognized the opportunity to reduce cost by consolidating the processing of this overlapping content. To accomplish this cost savings, we implemented a new, consolidated workflow system using Alfresco and jBPM which provided a common framework for content reuse, while enabling content enrichment processes to be performed by external and internal resources in a fully managed environment.

&#160;

For a publisher of legal treatises and practice guides and provider of on-demand learning, we created a future-state vision of operational workflows required to support an increasing array of technologies and online products. This future-state vision included recommendations regarding process improvements and new technologies.

&#160;

Innodata Advanced Data Solutions (IADS) Segment 

&#160;

Many enterprises are embracing new digital information technologies and workflow processes within their operations in order to improve internal decision-support systems. We formed our IADS segment in mid-2011 to design and develop new capabilities to enable clients in the financial services, insurance, medical and healthcare sectors to improve decision-support through digital technologies. We believe that by creating and commercializing innovative business strategies and technology solutions we will be able to accelerate our growth and reduce our revenue volatility.

&#160;

IADS operates through two subsidiaries: Synodex and docGenix. As of December 31, 2015 we owned 90% of Synodex and 94% of docGenix.

&#160;

The main focus of the Synodex business is the extraction and classification of data from unstructured medical records in an innovative way to provide improved data service capabilities for insurance underwriting, insurance claims, medical records management and clinical trial support services. Synodex has developed and deployed its APS.Extract &#174; product for specific use with life insurance underwriting and claims.

&#160;

At the end of 2015, Synodex had 8 clients, including RGA Reinsurance Company, the principal operating subsidiary of Reinsurance Group of America, Incorporated (NYSE: RGA), one of the top 10 largest providers of life reinsurance in the world according to A.M. Best, and John Hancock Insurance, the insurance operating unit of John Hancock Financial (a division of Manulife) and one of the largest life insurers in the United States. RGA announced its strategic relationship with Synodex in 2014 for the purpose of using Synodex's APS.Extract &#174; data and incorporating other Synodex data into its product offerings. John Hancock Insurance announced its strategic relationship with Synodex in 2015 for the purpose of licensing a customized version of Synodex's proprietary software and utilizing Synodex services to streamline internal business processes. Synodex is engaged in business discussions with other reinsurance companies and insurance carriers that have expressed interest in utilizing its services. We are planning market testing and commercial release of our APS.Extract &#174; 4.0 system in the first half of 2016.

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The main focus of the docGenix business is the extraction and classification of data from unstructured legal documents in order to improve an organization&#8217;s ability to analyze documentation and feed actionable data to downstream applications.

&#160;

We offer docGenix services to banks and hedge funds. One of our clients, a large New York-based global investments company party to more than 5,000 derivative contracts, utilizes the docGenix service and software platforms to monitor and react to market changes and counterparty and collateral changes and to comply with increasing regulatory requirements. Prior to utilizing docGenix, these were slow and resource-intensive activities because contract creation, storage and retrieval processes were all still paper or image based. Using docGenix&#8217;s system, complex derivative contracts are transformed into machine readable, computer-addressable data that is down-streamed to risk collateral and other mission-critical systems, and users can perform multi-dimensional, complex queries instantaneously.

&#160;

In 2015, our investment net of revenues in these subsidiaries was approximately $3.7 million (consisting of $3.4 million in operating expenses and $0.3 million in capital expenses). The Company wrote off all of the fixed assets of IADS in the third quarter of 2013 and has expensed all investments in IADS since that time. In the immediate future we intend to continue to invest in these subsidiaries at the combined rate of $0.8 to $1.0 million per quarter.

&#160;

Media Intelligence Solutions (MIS) Segment 

&#160;

Our MIS segment operates through our MediaMiser and Bulldog Reporter subsidiaries.

&#160;

MediaMiser provides media monitoring and analysis software and professional services to several Fortune 500 companies and Canadian government institutions as well as small- and medium-sized businesses. Through web-based and mobile solutions, MediaMiser enables companies to reduce the time and effort required to extract, analyze and share valuable business intelligence from traditional and social media sources. For organizations that prefer to outsource, MediaMiser provides detailed analysis reports and daily media briefings through an expert client services team.

&#160;

MediaMiser&#8217;s proprietary technology platform monitors, aggregates, analyzes and shares content from more than 200,000 sources across social, traditional and digital media. The platform includes a unique and patented sentiment analysis engine that identifies whether opinions expressed in a particular document or online text are positive, negative or neutral.

&#160;

Increasingly, companies looking to market their products, identify market opportunities and manage their reputations are seeking technology and technology-enabled services to help them keep pace with the proliferation of traditional and social media news sources. We believe that MediaMiser&#8217;s technology platform is well suited to this need and will provide MediaMiser with a competitive advantage as it seeks to expand into new geographical markets and penetrate further into its existing market.

&#160;

Our Global Operations 

&#160;

We provide our services using a globally distributed workforce utilizing advanced technologies that automate portions of our process and help ensure that our work product is highly accurate and consistent.

&#160;

Our delivery centers in Asia are ISO 27001 certified. In addition, we comply with the requirements of the United States Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 as amended (HIPAA) (including by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Data (HITECH)) and the United Kingdom&#8217;s Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA), as applicable. Both Innodata and Synodex are U.S. Safe Harbor registered entities that adhere to both the European Union and the Switzerland Safe Harbor Frameworks on the protection of personal data. We encrypt all individual protected health information, both at rest and in motion, to the AES 256 or similar standard, and we employ a range of security features including monitored firewalls and intrusion detection devices.

&#160;

For our data extraction services, we maintain staff in a wide spectrum of disciplines, including medicine, law, engineering, management, finance, science and the humanities.

&#160;

Our services are organized and managed around three vectors: a vertical industry focus, a horizontal service/process focus, and a supportive operations focus.

&#160;

The vertically-aligned groups understand our clients&#8217; businesses and strategic initiatives. The vertical group for each particular industry includes experts hired from that industry.

&#160;

Our service/process-aligned groups include engineering personnel and delivery personnel. Our engineering teams are responsible for creating secure and efficient custom workflows and integrating proprietary and third-party technologies to automate manual processes and improve the consistency and quality of our work product. These tools include categorization engines that utilize pattern recognition algorithms based on comprehensive rule sets and related heuristics, data extraction tools that automatically retrieve specific types of information from large data sources, and workflow systems that enable various tasks and activities to be performed across our multiple facilities.

&#160;

Our globally distributed delivery personnel are responsible for executing our client engagements in accordance with service-level agreements. We deliver services from facilities in the United States, India, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Israel, Canada and Germany.

&#160;

Other support groups are responsible for managing diverse enabling functions including human resources, organizational development, network and communications technology infrastructure support and physical infrastructure and facilities management.

&#160;

Our sales staff, program managers and consultants operate primarily from our North American and European locations, as well as from client sites.

&#160;

Our Opportunity 

&#160;

Rapid changes in digital content technologies have created the need for all sorts of companies to refashion their product offerings and their operations. Media, publishing and information services companies contend with new monetization models, delivery platforms, and channels. They seek to develop new digital products as print product revenue wanes; to broaden their markets by distributing content over the iPad&#174;, iPhone&#174;, Android and other portable devices; and to monetize existing content in new, highly targeted custom products through flexible reuse and repurposing.

&#160;

Meanwhile, for enterprises that rely on content to support operations, this shift to digital technology offers opportunities to improve internal decision support and risk mitigation in complex data operations by harnessing the power of machine-readable, digital data to drive improved decision support. For enterprises that rely on content to support products, this shift to digital technology offers opportunities to create and manage content more efficiently, while at the same time distributing content through an increased number of channels.

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

As a result, media, publishing and information services companies, and content-intensive enterprises, are increasingly relying on service providers, such as Innodata, to provide digital content-related services.

&#160;

Clients 

&#160; 

Two clients in our CS segment each generated more than 10% of our total revenues in the fiscal year ended 2015. Revenues from Reed Elsevier affiliated companies (the &#8220;RE Clients&#8221;) were approximately $10.0 million or 17% of total revenues, and revenues from Wolters Kluwer affiliated companies (the &#8220;WK Clients&#8221;) were approximately $9.6 million, or 16.3% of total revenues. No other client generated more than 10% of our total revenues in 2015. These two clients together generated approximately 33%, 31% and 26% of our total revenues in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Revenues from clients located in foreign countries (principally in Europe) accounted for 51%, 47% and 35% of our total revenues for these respective fiscal years.

&#160;

We have long-standing relationships with many of our clients, and we have provided services to the two clients mentioned in the preceding paragraph for over ten years. Our track record of delivering high-quality services helps us to solidify client relationships. Many of our clients are recurring clients, meaning that they have continued to provide additional projects to us after our initial engagement with them.

&#160;

Our contractual arrangements with the RE Clients during 2015 consisted of four master services agreements (&#8220;MSAs&#8221;) and separately agreed to statements of work (&#8220;SOWs&#8221;) for specific services. Three of the MSAs have indefinite terms, and the fourth MSA has a term that ends on the expiration date of all SOWs issued under that MSA. RE Clients may terminate the MSAs on notice periods ranging from zero to six months, and they may terminate certain individual SOWs on notice periods of up to 180 days. They may also terminate certain of the MSAs and SOWs on notice periods of three months or less for &#8220;cause&#8221; and for insolvency related events, and on changes of control, force majeure and the imposition of certain price increases by the Company that are not acceptable to them. We may terminate three of the MSAs on notice periods of 180 days, and the fourth on a notice period of three months, and it may also terminate certain MSAs and SOWs for &#8220;cause&#8221;, insolvency related events affecting the RE Clients, and other defined events. The MSAs contain confidentiality, limitation of liability, indemnification and other standard provisions.

&#160;

Our contractual arrangements with the WK Clients during calendar year 2015 consisted of five MSAs and separately agreed to SOWs for specific services. Three MSAs have indefinite terms, one MSA continues in effect until the completion of all services performed under the MSA, and the fifth MSA has a term that ends on the later of March 2017 or the expiration date of all SOWs issued under the MSA. WK Clients may terminate certain MSAs on notice periods ranging from 30 days to three months, and they may terminate certain individual SOWs on notice periods ranging from 10 days to six months. WK Clients may also terminate certain of the MSAs and SOWs on notice periods of 60 days or less for &#8220;cause&#8221; and for insolvency related events, and on changes of control, force majeure and the imposition of certain price increases by the Company that are not acceptable to them. We may terminate certain of the MSAs on notice periods ranging from 30 days to three months, and it may also terminate certain MSAs and SOWs for &#8220;cause&#8221;, insolvency related events affecting the WK Clients, and other defined events. The MSAs contain confidentiality, limitation of liability, indemnification and other standard provisions.

&#160;

Our agreements with our other clients are in many cases terminable on 30 to 90 days' notice. A substantial portion of the services we provide to our clients is subject to their requirements.

&#160;

&#160;

Our long-term relationships with clients. We have long-term relationships with many of our clients, who frequently retain us for additional projects after a successful initial engagement. We believe there are significant opportunities for additional growth with our existing clients, and we seek to expand these relationships by increasing the depth and breadth of the services we provide. This strategy allows us to use our in-depth client-specific knowledge to provide more fully integrated services and develop closer relationships with those clients.

&#160;

Our ability to scale. &#160; We have demonstrated the ability to expand our teams and facilities to meet the needs of our clients. By virtue of the significant numbers of professional staff working on projects, we are able to build teams for new engagements quickly. We have also demonstrated the ability to hire and train staff quickly in order to service diverse and often large-scale needs of our clients.

Our internal infrastructure. &#160; We utilize established facilities, technology and communications infrastructure to support our business model. We own and operate some of the most advanced delivery centers in the world, which are linked by multi-redundant data connections. Our Wide Area Network &#8211; along with our Local Area Networks, Storage Area Networks and data centers &#8211; is configured with industry standard redundancy, often with more than one backup to help ensure 24x7 availability. Our infrastructure is built to accommodate advanced tools, processes and technologies that support our content and technical experts. We encrypt all individual protected health information, both at rest and in motion, to the AES 256 or similar standard, and we employ a range of security features including managed firewalls and intrusion services.

&#160;

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

For our CS and IADS segments, we market and sell our services directly through our professional staff, senior management and direct sales personnel operating primarily from various locations in the U.S. and for our MIS segment we market and sell our services primarily from our office in Canada. Our corporate headquarters are located in Hackensack, New Jersey, just outside New York City. During 2015, we had four executive-level business development and marketing professionals and approximately 28 sales and marketing personnel. We also deploy solutions architects, technical support experts and consultants who support the development of new clients and new client engagements. These resources work within teams (both permanent and ad hoc) that provide support to clients.

&#160;

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Our sales professionals identify and qualify prospects, securing direct personal access to decision makers at existing and prospective clients. They facilitate interactions between client personnel and our service teams to define ways in which we can assist clients with their goals. For each prospective client engagement, we assemble a team of our senior employees drawn from various disciplines within our Company. The team members assume assigned roles in a formalized process, using their combined knowledge and experience to understand the client&#8217;s goals and collaborate with the client on a solution.

&#160;

Sales activities include lead generation, nurturing leads, engaging in discussions with prospective customers to understand their needs, demonstrating our products, designing solutions, responding to requests for proposals, and managing account and client relationships and activities.

&#160;

Personnel from our solutions analysis group, our client services group and our engineering services group closely support our direct sales effort. These individuals assist the sales force in understanding the technical needs of clients and providing responses to these needs, including demonstrations, prototypes, pricing quotations and time estimates. In addition, account managers from our customer service group support our direct sales effort by providing ongoing project-level support to our clients.

&#160;

Our marketing organization is responsible for developing and increasing the visibility and awareness of our brand and our service offerings, defining and communicating our value proposition, generating qualified, early-stage leads and furnishing effective sales support tools.

&#160;

As part of our marketing strategy we partner with media organizations to build awareness, establish a reputation as an industry thought leader, and generate leads. Media partners include trade associations and publications, trade show producers and consulting organizations. These partnerships are particularly valuable in enterprise industries as we build our presence among digital content leaders and decision makers.

&#160;

Primary marketing outreach activities include content marketing, event marketing (including exhibiting at trade shows, conferences and seminars), direct and database marketing, public and media relations (including speaking engagements and active participation in industry and technical standard bodies), and web marketing (including integrated marketing campaigns, search engine optimization, search engine marketing and the maintenance and continued development of external websites).

&#160;
