ITEM I &#8211; BUSINESS 

&#160;

As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms "we", "us", "our", "the Company", "MEEC", and "Midwest Energy Emissions Corp." refer to Midwest Energy Emissions Corp. and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. 

&#160;

Background 

&#160;

Midwest Energy Emissions Corp., a Delaware corporation, is an environmental services company specializing in mercury emission control technologies, primarily to utility and industrial coal-fired units. Our business plan is to deliver cost-effective mercury capture technologies to coal-fired power plants in the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia. We believe that our patented, proprietary technology allows customers to meet the highly restrictive standards the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued on December 21, 2011 for mercury emissions in an effective and economical manner with the least disruption to the current equipment and on-going operations. 

&#160;

MEEC was incorporated under the laws of the State of Utah on July 19, 1983 under the name of Digicorp. In 2006, MEEC entered into a merger agreement with Digicorp, Inc., a Delaware corporation, for the purpose of effecting a change of the corporation's domicile and in February 2007 the Company changed its domicile from Utah to Delaware. In October 2008, Digicorp changed its name to China Youth Media, Inc. &#160;

&#160; 4 

&#160; 

&#160; 

In December 2008, Midwest Energy Emissions Corp. (a corporation in the development phase) was incorporated in the state of North Dakota ("Midwest") under the name RLP Energy, Inc. and subsequently changed its name in January 2011 to Midwest Energy Emissions Corp. Midwest was engaged in the business of developing and commercializing state-of-the-art control technologies relating to the capture and control of mercury emissions from coal-fired boilers in the United States and Canada. 

&#160;

On June 21, 2011, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with Midwest pursuant to which at closing China Youth Media Merger Sub, Inc., the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary formed for the purpose of the merger (the "Merger Sub"), merged into Midwest, the result of which Midwest would become the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary (the "Merger"). The Merger closed effective on June 21, 2011 (the "Closing"). As a result of the Closing and the Merger, the Merger Sub merged with and into Midwest and with Midwest surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of China Youth Media, Inc. Effective at the time of the Closing, Midwest changed its name to MES, Inc. For accounting purposes, the Merger was treated as a reverse merger and a recapitalization of the Company. 

&#160;

Pursuant to a Certificate of Amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation filed with the State of Delaware and effective as of October 7, 2011, China Youth Media, Inc. (i) changed its corporate name from "China Youth Media, Inc." to "Midwest Energy Emissions Corp.", (ii) effected a reverse stock split of all the outstanding shares of our common stock at an exchange ratio of one for one hundred ten (1:110) (the "Reverse Stock Split") and (iii) changed the number of authorized shares of common stock, par value $.001 per share, from 500,000,000 to 100,000,000. Pursuant to an additional Certificate of Amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation filed with the State of Delaware and effective as of November 18, 2014, the number of authorized shares of common stock was increased to 150,000,000. 

&#160;

As a result of the Merger, all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Midwest were exchanged for 10,000 shares of newly created Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the "Merger Shares") of China Youth Media, Inc. The former shareholders of Midwest, upon conversion of all the Merger Shares, which occurred automatically on the filing of an October 2011 amendment to China Youth Media, Inc.'s certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares (see below) then owned approximately 90% of the Company's issued and outstanding common stock which were deemed issued and outstanding as of the closing of the Merger and conversion. 

&#160;

As a result of the Merger, our business is now focused on the delivery of mercury capture technologies to power plants in North America, Europe and Asia. Our prior businesses - focusing on youth marketing and media in China by providing advertisers and corporations with direct and centralized access to China's massive but difficult to reach student population, including the business of aggregation and distribution of international content and advertising for Internet or online consumption in China - have been terminated. 

&#160;

In November 2011, MEEC moved its corporate headquarters to Worthington, Ohio and on March 1, 2015 moved its corporate headquarters to 670 D Enterprise Drive, Lewis Center, Ohio 43035. We currently have 12 fulltime employees. Our employees are not represented by labor unions. We believe that relations with our employees are good. 

&#160;

Regulations and Markets 

&#160;

The markets for mercury removal from plant emissions are largely driven by regulations (state, provincial and federal). Changes in regulations have profound effects on these markets and the companies that compete in these markets. This is especially true for smaller companies such as MEEC. &#160;

&#160; 5 

&#160; 

&#160; 

On December 21, 2011 the EPA issued its Mercury and Air Toxics Standards ("MATS") for power plants in the U.S. The new MATS rule is intended to reduce air emissions of heavy metals, including mercury (Hg), from all major U.S. power plants burning coal or oil, which are the leading source of non-natural mercury emissions in the U.S. Existing power plants were granted three years (plus a potential one year extension in cases of hardship, ruled on by State EPA's where the plant is domiciled) from April 16, 2012, to comply with the new emission limits. 

&#160;

The new MATS rule applies to Electric Generating Units ("EGUs") that are larger than 25 megawatts ("MW") that burn coal or oil for the purpose of generating electricity for sale and distribution through the national electric grid to the public. They include investor-owned units, as well as units owned by the Federal government, municipalities, and cooperatives that provide electricity for commercial, industrial, and residential uses. At the time of MATS being promulgated, the EPA estimated that there were approximately 1,400 units affected by this new rule, approximately 1,100 existing coal-fired units and 300 oil-fired units at about 600 power stations. Since this time, we believe that of the 1100 EGUs, as many as 300 have been shuttered, or will soon be shuttered, as a result of this regulation, and due to competitive disadvantage to newer or gas-fired EGUs. We believe the remaining 800-850 EGU's will remain competitive in the power market for the long-term foreseeable future, and make up the large mercury-emissions control market into which we sell. 

&#160;

The final MATS rule identifies two subcategories of coal-fired EGUs, four subcategories of oil-fired EGUs and a subcategory for units that combust gasified coal or solid oil (integrated gasification combine cycle [IGCC] units) based on the design, utilization, and/or location of the various types of boilers at different power stations. The rule includes emission standards and/or other requirements for each subcategory. The rule sets nationwide emission limits and is estimated to reduce mercury emissions in coal-fired plants by about 90%. 

&#160;

Overall, the EPA estimated the total national annual cost of the MATS rule would be $9.6 billion. 

&#160;

These on-going annual operating costs increases include all functions of the MATS regulation, and not just mercury emissions reductions. It is also important to note that a number of states currently have regulations to limit mercury emissions, and these regulations remain in place until or unless superseded by MATS in 2015. Finally, we estimate that over half of the utility industry EGU's applied for and received the one-year extension for compliance. The deadline for applications for this extension has since passed as of December 17, 2014. 

&#160;

With the adoption of the MATS rule, utilities have and will explore and have conducted and will conduct numerous demonstrations of various technologies to determine which will work best to achieve the required reductions to bring each individual unit under the maximum allowed emissions rate. There are several choices of pollution control technologies available to reduce mercury emissions, but they do not all work consistently or cost-effectively for every plant design or for all of the various types of coal. The most common technology employed to reduce mercury emissions is the injection of powdered activated carbon ("PAC") or brominated PAC ("BAC") into the flue-gas of an EGU after the boiler itself but in front of the Electro-Static Precipitators ("ESP"). Such injections have proven effective with many coals, especially at reduction levels of 70% or less. At required mercury reduction levels above 80%, these injection systems require substantial injection rates which often have severe operational issues including over-loading the ESP and rendering the fly ash unfit for sale to concrete companies, and at times even causing combustion concerns with the fly ash itself. 

&#160;

Mercury is also removed as a co-benefit by special pollution control equipment installed to remove oxides of sulfur ("SO X ") and nitrogen ("NO X "). To achieve very high levels of SO X reduction, large, complex and expensive (capital costs in the hundreds of millions of dollars for a medium-sized EGU) systems called Scrubbers can be installed in the plant exhaust system, typically just before the flue-gas goes up the stack for release. As a co-benefit to their primary mission, Scrubbers have been shown to remove significant quantities of oxidized mercury. 

&#160;

Mercury is typically found in two basic forms in coal: elemental and oxidized. The amount of each form varies in any given seam of coal and is affected by the other natural elements (such as chlorine) which might also be present in the coal. We believe about 40% of the mercury in the post-combustion flue-gas exists in the oxidized state. Mercury is found in only tiny trace amounts in coal and its presence is difficult to detect. It is in the burning of millions of tons of coal that these trace amounts become problematic, and why MATS was promulgated. &#160;

&#160; 6 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The other major pollution control system which contributes significantly to the co-benefits of mercury removal is a Selective Catalytic Reduction ("SCR") system which can be installed to achieve high levels of removal of NO X . SCRs are also very large and expensive systems (costing hundreds of millions of dollars in capital costs to install on a medium-size EGU) that are typically installed just after the flue-gas exits from the unit boiler. As a co-benefit, SCRs have been shown to oxidize a considerable percentage of the elemental mercury in many types of coal. If the EGU then has a combination of an SCR and a Scrubber, we estimate that the EGU might achieve an overall reduction of 80-85% of the mercury in many types of coal. The exact level of mercury emission reductions depends on the designs of these systems and the types of coal being burned. 

&#160;

It is thus anticipated that the large majority of the over 800 coal-fired EGUs in the U.S. will employ some sort of sorbent injection system to achieve the very low mercury emission levels required by the MATS rule. Either the sorbent injection system will be the primary removal method or such a system will likely be employed as a supplemental system to SCR/Scrubber combinations to achieve the new emission limits. 

&#160;

MEEC's Technology 

&#160;

Our mercury removal technology and systems have been shown in long-term, full-scale trials on operating units to achieve mercury removal levels above the new MATS requirements and to do so with lower cost and plant systems impacts than typical PAC or BAC sorbent injection systems. Our technology was originally developed by the University of North Dakota's Energy and Environmental Research Center ("EERC"). It was tested and refined on numerous operating coal-fired EGUs, with the founder of MES, Inc. participating with the EERC on these tests since 2008. The EERC Foundation obtained patents on this technology. MEEC has an "Exclusive Patent and Know-How License Agreement Including Transfer of Ownerships" for the exclusive world-wide rights to the commercial application of these related patents. In our agreement with the EERC Foundation, we pay an annual license maintenance fee plus royalties on operational systems and have the right to purchase the commercial application patent rights for a payment specified in the agreement. In 2013 and 2014, EERC and MEEC negotiated significant amendments to their agreement which strengthened the existing patent rights of MEEC, eliminated certain contract provisions and compliance issues and restructured license maintenance and royalty fee schedules and issued an equity interest in MEEC to EERC. 

&#160;

In 2010, we were awarded our first commercial contract to design, build and install our solution on two large (670MW each) coal units in the western part of the U.S. This was a multi-million dollar, three year renewable contract, which was awarded as a result of a competitive demonstration process. We invested more than $1.4 million in the capital equipment for this project. Our systems out-performed the contract guarantees in all operational areas during startup and testing and went into commercial operation at the start of 2012. The system is used for mercury control whenever the plant is in operation. 

&#160;

In 2014, we contracted for units with four US utilities, bringing our total of EGUs under contract for MATS to 15 as of year-end 2015. Four of the EGUs that we have under contract were compliant units in 2015. Additional contract awards have been won in 2016, and we expect to make further additions to the number of customer EGUs that use our technologies to achieve compliance with MATS in 2016. 

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

MEEC has the rights to 30 domestic and foreign patents, pending patent applications and provisional patent applications under an agreement with the EERC Foundation. We believe that our patent position is strong in the US, Canada, China and Europe and sublicensing and enforcing these patents will be a key part of our business strategy going forward. &#160;

&#160; 7 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Business Opportunities 

&#160;

Our success depends, in part, on the success of demonstrations performed with utility customers and the resulting contract awards to meet the MATS requirements in the long-term period and our operational performance with EGUs under contract. With over 800 coal-fired EGUs in the U.S. affected by MATS, MEEC has a near-term business goal to achieve at least 5-10% of this available market. 

&#160;

In the U.S., we have won contracts on 19 EGU's to date, and expect that we will conduct numerous demonstrations on prospective customer units in the coming years. Our technology has been running on four boilers in the western U.S. where we are fully operational under MATS compliance mercury capture rates of 90%. We expect that our value proposition will be fully demonstrated. It is important for the utility industry to see MEEC fully demonstrating that its patented approach for mercury control at MATS levels of mercury reduction. We feel that further contract wins in 2016 and beyond will come because of the success that utilities will have in complying with MATS with us, versus our competitors offerings, all of which will be evidenced beginning this year when MATS compliance begins. 

&#160;

Another major opportunity for us is in Canada, where there is a Country-wide mercury reduction agreement among all the provinces that required a 60% reduction in 2012, and which will likely require an 80% reduction beginning in 2018, while individual provinces may move faster to stricter emissions control. We believe we have the most effective technology for the EGUs in Canada and a strong patent position there. 

&#160;

In China, there exists no specific mandate for mercury capture that demands services such as ours. We are sanguine on the prospects for mercury emissions regulations in China in the coming years, and because we have very broad patent rights in China, this has the potential to become a large business opportunity for us in future years. We estimate that the China market could be many times the size of the U.S. market, and with the Minimata Convention of 2013, we are hopeful that all countries will follow the U.S. in regulating mercury emissions. 

&#160;

In order to achieve significant near and long-term sales success and control overhead, MEEC employs a model of using Manufacturer Sales Representatives ("Reps") under the leadership of its experienced Vice President of Sales, and a Regional Manager of Sales. These Reps cover the entire country and are highly incentivized on a commission-only basis to introduce our technology into their customer EGUs. This approach has been very successfully employed by other companies operating in the electric utility industry market. 

&#160;

Raw Materials 

&#160;

We buy all the materials needed for our systems and do not manufacture our products or systems. Material components of our proprietary Sorbent Enhancing Additive ("SEA TM ") Technology are readily available from numerous sources in the market. Our current principal suppliers include companies, some of whom are our major competitors in the mercury control market. When we use PAC as a component of our sorbent material, we buy it in the market from large activated carbon manufacturers. We believe that we have excellent relationships with our suppliers. If any of our suppliers should become unavailable to us for any reason, we believe that there are a number of potential replacements, although we might incur some delay in identifying such replacements. &#160;

&#160; 8 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160;

Our major competitors in the U.S. and Canada include companies such as Cabot Corporation, Calgon Carbon Corporation, Albemarle Corporation, Carbonxt, Inc., Nalco Company, Novinda Corporation, ADS-ES, Inc. and ADA Carbon Solutions LLC. These companies employ large sales staff and are well established in the market. However, we believe our technology has consistently performed better in mercury removal in operational tests than PAC or BAC injections alone. We believe our technology is superior to offerings of our competitors, and with our experienced team of sales representatives, we believe we can compete effectively in these markets. 

&#160;

Seasonality 

&#160;

Our business is generally not seasonal in nature, although we will experience some regional seasonal declines during holiday periods and some weather-related seasonality. 

&#160;

Backlog 

&#160;

We do not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of the level of future sales activity. In general, we do not manufacture our products against a backlog of orders. Production and inventory levels are based on the level of incoming orders as well as projections of future demand. Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to understanding our overall business and is not a reliable indicator of our ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance.
