U.S. CELLULAR OPERATIONS 

General 

U.S. &#160; Cellular, incorporated under the state laws of Delaware in 1983, provides wireless telecommunications services to approximate ly 4.9 million customers in 23 states, collectively representing a total population of 32.0 million. &#160; U.S. Cellular operates in one reportable segment, and all of its wireless operating markets are in the United States. U.S. Cellular&#8217;s strategy is to attract and retain wireless customers through a value proposition comprised of a high-quality n etwork , outstanding customer service, and competitive devices, plans, and pricing, all provided with a local focus. 

Customers, Services and Products 

Customers. &#160; &#160; U.S. &#160; Cellular provides service to postpaid and prepaid customers from a variety of demographic segments. U.S. Cellular focuses on retail consumers, government, and small-to-mid-size business customers in industries such as construction, retail, professional services and real estate. &#160; These customers are served primarily through U.S. Cellular&#8217;s reta il and direct sales channels. U.S. Cellular builds customer loyalty by offering high-quality network services, outstanding customer - focused support services, effective pricing, and other benefits as discussed further in &#8220;Marketing, Customer Service, and S ales and Distribution Channels.&#8221; 

Services. &#160; &#160; U.S. &#160; Cellular&#8217;s postpaid customers are able to choose from a variety of national plans with voice, messaging and data usage options and pricing that are designed to fit different customer needs, usage patterns an d budgets. &#160; Helping a customer find the right pricing plan is an important element of U.S. &#160; Cellular&#8217;s brand positioning. &#160; U.S. Cellular offers Shared Connect d ata plans wh ich allow customers to share data usage among all users and devices connected to the plan. &#160; Business rate plans are designed to meet the unique needs of the business customer. &#160; U.S. Cellular&#8217;s national plans price all domestic calls as local calls, regardless of where they are made or received in the United States, with no long distance or roaming charges , and can do so through the existence of roaming partnerships. &#160; U.S. Cellular also offers monthly prepaid service plans, which provide customers unlimited voice and unlimited messaging with a specified amount of high - speed data and unlimite d data at lower speeds once the high - speed data limit is reached to ensure customers are never witho ut data access . 

U.S. Cellular&#8217;s portfolio of smartphones, tablets and other connected devices is a key part of its strategy to deliver wireless devices whic h allow customers to stay productive, entertained and connected on the go ; these devices are backed by U.S. Cellular&#8217;s high-speed networks, including a fourth generation (&#8220; 4G &#8221;) Long-Term Evolution (&#8220; LTE &#8221;) network, which, as of December 31, 2015 , covered 99% of its postpaid customers and supports nationwide roaming . &#160; U.S. C ellular&#8217;s 4G LTE network features smartphone messaging, data and internet services that allow customers to access the web and social network sites, e-mail, text, picture and video message, utilize turn-by-turn GPS navigation, and browse and download thousands of applications to customize their wireless de vices to fit their lifestyles. &#160; 

In 2015, U.S. Cellular expanded its solutions to business and government customers, including a growing suite of machine to machine solutions across the categories of monitor and control (e.g. , sensors and c ameras), business automation/operations (e.g. , e-forms), communication (e.g. , back-up router for business continuity services) and asset management (e.g. , fleet management). U.S. Cellular intends to continue to further enhance its advanced wireless servic es and connected solutions for consumer and business customers in 2016 and beyond. 

Devices and Products. &#160; &#160; U.S. &#160; Cellular offers a comprehensive range of wireless devices such as handsets, modems, mobile hotspots, home phone s and tablets for use by its custo mers. &#160; U.S. Cellular offers wireless devices that are compatible with most of its 4G LTE and third generation (&#8220; 3G &#8221;) networks and a ll are compliant with the Federal Co mmunications Commission (&#8220;FCC&#8221;) enhanced wireless 911 requirements. &#160; In addition, U.S. Ce llular offers a wide range of accessories, significantly expanding the breadth of products offered, from wireless basics such as carrying cases, hands-free devices, batteries, battery chargers, and memory cards to related consumer electronics such as headp hones, speakers, and Bluetooth keyboards. U.S. Cellular also sells wireless devices to agents and other third-party distributors for resale. U.S. &#160; Cellular frequently discou nts wireless devices sold to new and current customers in order to attract new cust omers or to retain existing customers by reducing the cost of becoming or remaining a wireless customer . U.S. Cellular also offers customers the option to purchase certain devices under installment contracts over a specified time period while providing a discount on their connection charge . &#160; For certain inst allment plans, after a specified period of time, the customer may have the right to upgrade to a new device, thus enabling customers to more easily access the latest smartphones and provide a better ove rall customer experience. &#160; 

U.S. Cellular continues to offer several programs that allow the customer to receive a replacement device through a retail store or through direct mail. &#160; U.S. Cellular also offers its Device Protection+ program which includes overnight delivery while continuing to provide customers peace of mind by covering lost and stolen devices. 

The devices offered include a full array of value and iconic smartphones and feature phones. During 2015, U.S. Cellular continued to bolster its exp anding smartphone and tablet portfolio with Android wireless devices and tablets such as the Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge+, Samsung Galaxy Note 5, LG G4, Motorola G LTE, Samsung Galaxy Tab S2, and LG Gpad 8.0, and Apple products such as the iPhone 6S, iPh one 6S Plus, and the full complement of iPads. &#160; U.S. Cellular&#8217;s smartphone offerings play a significant role in driving data service usage and revenues. &#160; U.S. Cellular also offered additional products and services including LTE wireless routers and hotspot s for broadband coverage as well as home phones and OnLook connected home. &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

U.S. Cellular purchases wireless devices and accessory products from a number of manufacturers, including Samsung, Apple, Motorola, LG, Superior Communications, Kyocera, ZTE, Tessc o, and Sierra Wireless. U.S. &#160; Cellular negotiates volume discounts with its suppliers and works with them in promoting specific equipment in its local advertising. &#160; U.S. Cellular does not own significant product warehousing and distribution infrastructure. &#160; Instead, it contracts with third party providers for substantially all of its product warehousing, distribution and direct customer fulfillment activities. U.S. Cellular also contracts with third party providers for services related to its device replacem ent programs. 

U.S. Cellular continuously monitors the financial condition of its wireless device and accessory suppliers. &#160; Because U.S. Cellular purchases wireless devices and accessories from numerous suppliers, U.S. Cellular does not expect the financial condition of any single supplier to affect its ability to offer a competitive variety of wireless devices and accessories for sale to customers. 

Marketing, Customer Service, and Sales and Distribution Channels 

Marketing and Advertising. &#160; &#160; U.S. &#160; Cellular&#8217;s m arketing plan is focused on acquiring, retaining and growing customer relationships by maintaining a high-quality wireless network, providing outstanding customer service, and offering a comprehensive portfolio of products and services built around custome r needs at fair prices. 

U.S. Cellular believes that creating positive relationships with its customers enhances their wireless experience and builds customer loyalty. &#160; U.S. Cellular currently offers several customer-centric programs and services to custome rs. &#160; The Overage Protection service provides customers peace of mind by sending them text message alerts when they come close to reaching their allowable monthly plan minutes, text messages or data usage in order to avoid overage charges. &#160; With the launch o f Shared Data plans, whereby customer s select the size of the data bucket to share among all of their lines/devices, U.S. Cellular also offers a service to allow customers to limit data usage on specific lines &#8211; or for the entire account &#8211; thereby providi ng controls to manage account overages. &#160; This service, Data Usage Controls, allows customers an easy way to split up their data bucket by line. 

U.S. &#160; Cellular increases consumer awareness using media such as television, radio, newspaper, direct mail advertising, digital, social media, and sponsorships. &#160; U.S. Cellular has achieved its current level of penetration of its markets through a combination of a strong brand position, promotional advertising, broad distribution, maintaining a high-quality wire less network and providing outstanding customer service. &#160; U.S. &#160; Cellular&#8217;s advertising is directed at increasing the public awareness and understanding of the wireless services it offers, improving potential customers&#8217; awareness of the U.S. &#160; Cellular brand, attracting and retaining customers, and increasing existing customers&#8217; usage of U.S. &#160; Cellular&#8217;s services. U.S. &#160; Cellular attempts to select the advertising and promotional media that are most appealing to the targeted groups of potential customers in each l ocal market. &#160; U.S. &#160; Cellular supplements its advertising with a focused public relations program that drives store traffic, supports sales of products and services, and builds brand awareness and preference. &#160; The approach combines national and local media r elations in mainstream and social media channels with market-wide activities, events, and sponsorships. U.S. Cellular focuses its charitable giving strategy on supporting initiatives relevant to consumers in its service areas. &#160; These initiatives include su pport of programs that focus on youth in the communities U.S. Cellular serves, such as the Boys and Girls Clubs and 4H Societies of America. 

Customer Service. &#160; &#160; U.S. &#160; Cellular manages customer retention by focusing on outstanding customer service through the development of processes that are customer-friendly, extensive training of frontline sales and support associates and the implementation of retention programs. 

U.S. &#160; Cellular currently operates four regional customer care centers in its operating markets w ith personnel who are responsible for customer service activities, and a national financial services center with personnel who perform credit and other customer payment activities. &#160; U.S. Cellular also contracts with third parties that provide additional cu stomer care and financial services support. 

Sales and Distribution Channels. &#160; &#160; U.S. &#160; Cellular supports a multi-faceted distribution program, including retail sales, direct sales, third-party national retailers, and independent agents, plus a website and tele sales. 

Company retail store locations are designed to market wireless products and services to the consumer and small business segments in a setting familiar to these types of customers. &#160; As of December 31, 2015 , retail sales associates work in approximately 270 U.S. Cellular-operated retail stores and kiosks. Direct sales consultants market wireless services to mid-size business customers. Additionally, the U.S. &#160; Cellular website enables customers to activate ser vice and purchase wireless devices online. 

U.S. &#160; Cellular maintains an ongoing training program to improve the effectiveness of retail sales associates and direct sales consultants by focusing their efforts on obtaining customers by facilitating the sale of appropriate packages for the customer&#8217;s expected usage and value-added services that meet the individual needs of the customer. 

U.S. &#160; Cellular has relationships with exclusive and non-exclusive agents, which are independent businesses that obtain customers for U.S. &#160; Cellular on a commission basis. &#160; At December 31, 2015 , U.S. &#160; Cellular had contracts with t hese businesses aggregating 580 locations. &#160; U.S. &#160; Cellular provides additional support and training to its exclusive agents to increase customer satisfaction and to ensure a consistent customer experience. &#160; U.S. &#160; Cellular&#8217;s agents are generally in the business of selling wireless devices, wireless service packages and other related products. &#160; No single agent accounted fo r 10% or more of U.S. Cellular&#8217;s operating revenues during the past three years. 

Since 2013 , U.S. Cellular has expanded its distribution through third-party national and on-line retailers. Wal-Mart, Sam&#8217;s Club, and Dollar General offer U.S. Cellular produ cts and services at select retail locations in U.S. Cellular&#8217;s service areas. Further, Amazon offers U.S. Cellular&#8217;s postpaid and prepaid services on-line. &#160; U.S. Cellular continues to explore new relationships with additional third-party retailers as part of its strategy to expand distribution. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Seasonality. &#160; &#160; There is seasonality in operating expenses, which tend to be higher in the fourth quarter than in the other quarters due to increased marketing and promotional activities during the holiday season, whic h may cause operating income to vary from quarter to quarter. 

Competition 

The wireless telecommunication industry is highly competitive. &#160; U.S. &#160; Cellular competes directly with several wireless service providers in each of its markets. In general, there are between two and four competitors in each wireless market in which U.S. Cellular provides service, excluding resellers and mobile virtual network operators. In its footprint, U.S. Cellular competes to varying degrees against each of the national wireless co mpanies: Verizon Wireless, AT&#38;T Mobility, Sprint, and T-Mobile USA, in addition to a few smaller regional carriers in specific areas of its footprint. &#160; Verizon is U.S. Cellular&#8217;s largest competitor, in terms of both customer acquisition opportunities and c ustomer defection risk in the majority of its markets. However, all of the national competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than U.S. &#160; Cellular. Additionally, U.S. Cellular competes with other companies that use alternative comm unication technology and services to provide similar products and services. 

Since each of these wireless competitors operates on systems using spectrum licensed by the FCC and has comparable technology and facilities, competition among wireless service pro viders for customers is principally on the basis of types of products and services, price, size of area covered, network quality, network speed and responsiveness of customer service. &#160; U.S. Cellular employs a customer satisfaction strategy that includes ma intaining an outstanding wireless network throughout its markets. &#160; U.S. Cellular owns and operates low-band spectrum (less than 1 GHz) that covers the majority of its footprint and enables more efficient, superior coverage in rural areas (compared to spect rum above 1 GHz), which strengthens its network quality positioning. As discusse d below , the FCC will be auctioning low band (600MHz) spectrum in 2016. To the extent existing competitors or new entrants acquire such spectrum in U.S. C ellular markets, U.S. Cellular c ould face increased competition over time from competitors that hold such more-efficient and superior low-band spectrum. 

The use of national advertising and promotional programs by the top four wireless service providers is a source of additiona l competitive and pricing pressures in all U.S. Cellular markets, even if those operators do not provide direct service in a particular market. &#160; Over the past year, competition among top carriers has continued to be aggressive, with the top four carriers e ngaging in rich promotional initiatives including contract buyouts and limited-time and permanent price reductions. &#160; In addition, in the current wireless environment, U.S. Cellular&#8217;s ability to compete depends on its ability to continue to offer national v oice and data plans. U.S. Cellular provides wireless services comparable to the national competitors, but the national wireless companies operate in a wider geographic area and are able to offer no - cost roaming over a wider area on their own networks than U.S. Cellular can offer on its network. &#160; Although U.S. Cellular offers the same coverage area as these competitors, U.S. Cellular incurs roaming charges for data sessions and calls made in portions of the coverage area which are not part of its network, t hereby increasing its cost of operations. U.S. Cellular depends on roaming agreements with other wireless carriers to provide voice and data roaming capabilities in areas not covered by U.S. Cellular&#8217;s network. Similarly, U.S. Cellular provides roaming ser vices on its network to other wireless carriers&#8217; customers who travel within U.S. Cellular&#8217;s coverage areas. 

Convergence of connectivity is taking place on many levels, including dual-mode wirel ess devices that act as wireless or wireline devices depending on location and the incorporation of wireless &#8220;hot spot&#8221; technology in wireless devices making internet access seamless regardless of location. &#160; Although less directly a substitute for other wireless services, wireless data services such as Wi-Fi may be adequate for those who do not need mobile wide-area roaming or full two-way voice services. &#160; Technological advances or regulatory changes in the future, such as the rollout and consumer adoption of Wi-Fi calling and Voice over Long - Term Ev olution (&#8220;VoLTE&#8221;) capabilities, may make available other alternatives to current wireless service, thereby creating additional sources of competition that shift consumers&#8217; perceptions and preferences of network strength, speed and reliability. &#160; If the tren d toward convergence continues , U.S. Cellular is at a competitive disadvantage to larger competitors, including the national wireless carriers and other potential large new entrants with much greater financial and other resources in adapting to such conver gence. 

U.S. Cellular&#8217;s approach in 2016 and in future years will be to focus on the unique needs and attitudes of its customers towards wireless service. U.S. Cellular will deliver high- quality products and ser vices at competitive prices and intends to continue to differentiate itself by seeking to provide an overall outstanding custom er experience, including a high- quality network. U.S. Cellular&#8217;s ability to compete successfully in the future will depend upon i ts ability to anticipate and respond to changes related to new service offerings, consumer preferences, competitors&#8217; pricing strategies and new product offerings , technology, demographic trends, economic conditions and its access to adequate spectrum resou rces. 

System Usage 

U.S. &#160; Cellular&#8217;s main sources of revenues are from its own customers and from customers of competitors who roam on its network. The interoperability of wireless service enables a customer who is in a wireless service area other than the c ustomer&#8217;s home service area to place or receive a call or use data in that service area. &#160; U.S. &#160; Cellular has entered into reciprocal roaming agreements with operators of other wireless systems covering virtually all systems with Code Division Multiple Acces s (&#8220;CDMA&#8221;) technology in the United States, Canada and Mexico. &#160; Roaming agreements offer customers the opportunity to roam on these systems. &#160; These reciprocal agreements automatically pre-register the customers of U.S. &#160; Cellular&#8217;s systems in the other carri ers&#8217; systems. &#160; In addition, a customer of a participating system roaming in a U.S. &#160; Cellular market where this arrangement is in effect is able to make and receive calls or data on U.S. &#160; Cellular&#8217;s system. &#160; The charge for this service is negotiated as part o f the roaming agreement between U.S. &#160; Cellular and the roaming customer&#8217;s carrier. U.S. &#160; Cellular bills this charge to the customer&#8217;s home carrier, which then may bill the customer. &#160; In many instances, based on competitive factors, carriers, including U.S. &#160; C ellular, generally do not charge their customers for roaming , or charge lower amounts to their customers than the amounts actually charged to them by other wireless carriers for roaming. Since 2010, U.S. Cellular has offered nationwide 3G data roaming serv ices, allowing its customers to access high-speed data across the country. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

U.S. Cellular has entered into 4G LTE roaming agreement s with national wireless companies . The FCC&#8217;s adoption of mandatory 4G LTE roaming rules, which were upheld by the United Stat es Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, may be of assistance in the negotiation of 4G LTE roaming agreements with other wireless operators in the future. However, technological challenges currently exist which can limit the interoperability of 4G LTE wireless devices on other carriers&#8217; networks. Specifically, wireless devices support certain configurations of spectrum frequencies and as a result 4G LTE wireless devices offered by carriers are not necessarily compatible with the networks of other c arriers. U.S. Cellular is working with other carriers, original equipment manufacturers and potential LTE roaming vendors to mitigate interoperability issues. &#160; 

Access Technology and System Design 

Technology. &#160; Wireless telecommunication systems transmit vo ice, data, graphics and video through the transmission of signals over networks of radio towers using radio spectrum licensed by the FCC. &#160; Access to local, regional, national and worldwide telecommunications networks is provided through system interconnect ions. &#160; A high-quality network, supported by continued investments in that network, will remain an important factor for wireless companies to remain competitive. 

U.S. Cellular has deployed 4G LTE technology in conjunction with King Street Wireless L.P. that covered approximately 99% of its postpaid customers as of December 31, 2015 . 4G LTE technology enables more network c apacity for more data per user as well as faster access to data. In 2015, U.S. Cellular began user trials of its VoLTE servic e in selected operating markets. &#160; VoLTE will allow U.S. Cellular&#8217;s customers and customers of other wireless carriers that have ro aming agreements with U.S. Cellular to utilize U.S. Cellular&#8217;s LTE network for voice and data services. &#160; U.S. Cellular continues to offer services based on 3G technology and CDMA digital technology across its networks. 

Through roaming agreements with other CDMA-based wireless carriers, U.S. Cellular&#8217;s customers may access CDMA service in virtually all areas of the United States, as well as parts of Canada and Mexico. &#160; Another digital technology, Global System for Mobile Communication (&#8220;GSM&#8221;), has a larger i nstalled base of customers worldwide. U.S. Cellular customers now have the ability to roam on GSM carriers with voice, data and SMS in Canada, Mexico and internationally. &#160; Both CDMA and GSM technologies are being succeeded by 4G LTE technology. &#160; U.S . Cellu lar customers can also experience nationwide 4G LTE covera ge as a result of roaming agreement s with national carrier s. 

System Design and Construction. &#160; &#160; U.S. &#160; Cellular designs and constructs its systems in a manner it believes will permit it to provide high- quality service to substantially all types of compatible wireless devices. &#160; Designs are based on engineering studies which relate to specific markets, in support of the larger network. &#160; Network reliability is given careful consideration and extensive backu p redundancy is employed in many aspects of U.S. Cellular&#8217;s network design. &#160; Route diversity, redundant equipment, ring topology and extensive use of emergency standby power also are used to enhance network reliability and minimize service disruption from any particular network element failure. 

In accordance with its strategy of building and strengthening its operating market areas, U.S. Cellular has selected high-capacity, carrier-class digital wireless switching systems that are capable of serving multipl e markets through a single mobile telephone switching office. &#160; Centralized equipment, used for network and data management, is located in high-availability facilities supported by multiple levels of power and network redundancy. U.S. Cellular&#8217;s systems are designed to incorporate Internet Protocol (&#8220;IP&#8221;) packet-based Ethernet technology, which allows for increased data capacity and a more efficient network. Interconnection between the mobile telephone switching office and the cell sites utilizes Ethernet te chnology for nearly all 4G LTE sites, over fiber or microwave links. 

U.S. Cellular believes that currently available technologies and appropriate capital additions will allow sufficient capacity on its networks to meet anticipated demand for voice and data services over the next few years. However, increasing demand for high-speed data may require the acquisition of additional spectrum licenses to provide sufficient capacity and throughput. 

Construction of wireless systems is capital-intensive, requiring s ubstantial investment for land and improvements, buildings, towers, mobile telephone switching offices, cell site equipment, transport equipment, engineering and installation. &#160; U.S. Cellular primarily uses its own personnel to engineer each wireless system it owns and operates, and engages contractors to construct the facilities. 

The costs (inclusive of the costs to acquire licenses) to develop the systems which U.S. &#160; Cellular operates have historically been financed primarily through proceeds from debt and equity offerings, with cash generated by operations, and proceeds from the sales of wireless interests and other non-strategic assets. 

Business Developmen t Strategy 

U.S. Cellular groups its individual markets (geographic service areas as defined by the FCC in which wireless carriers are licensed, for fixed terms, to provide service) into broader geographic market areas to offer customers large service areas that primarily utilize U.S. Cellular&#8217;s network. &#160; U.S. Cellular&#8217;s ownership interests in wireless licenses include both consolidated and investment interest s in operating and non-operating licenses covering portions of 31 states and a total population of 50.5 million at December 31, 2015 . 

&#160; 

&#160; 

U.S. Cellular&#8217;s business development strategy is to obtain interests in and access to wireless licenses in its current opera ting markets and in areas that are adjacent to or in close proximity to its other wireless licenses, thereby building contiguous operating market areas. &#160; U.S. Cellular believes that the acquisition of additional licenses within its current operating market s will enhance its network capacity to meet its customers&#8217; increased demand for data services. &#160; U.S. Cellular may continue to make opportunistic acquisitions or exchanges that further strengthen its current operating markets or other attractive markets. &#160; F rom time to time, U.S. Cellular has divested outright or included in exchanges for other wireless interests certain consolidated and investment interests that were considered less essential to its current and expected future operations. &#160; As part of its bus iness development strategy, U.S. Cellular from time to time may be engaged in negotiations relating to the acquisition, exchange or disposition of companies, strategic properties or wireless spectrum. &#160; See Note 6 &#8212; Acquisitions, Divestitures and Exchanges and Note 8 &#8212; Investments in Unconsolidated Entities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of significant acquisitions, divestitures and exchanges in the years 2013 through 2015 . &#160; 

From time to time, the FCC conducts auctions through which additional spectrum is made available for the provision of wireless services. &#160; U.S. Cellular may participate as a bidder, or member of a bidding group, in future auctions. In February 2016, U.S. Cellular filed an application to participate as a forward auction bidder for 600MHz broadcast television spectrum licenses in an FCC auction referred to as A uction 1000. Auction 1000 is expected to commence with the broadcaster initial commitment deadline on March 29, 2016. Forward auction bidding is likely to begin a couple of months later and could continue for three months or longer. Due to the FCC&#8217;s anti- collusion rules, U.S. Cellular may not disclose any details relating to its participation or information about whether or not it is a winning bidder unless and until it is announced as a winning bidder by the FCC. See Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K, under &#8220;R egulatory Matters &#8211; FCC Auction 1000.&#8221; 

U.S. Cellular has participated in certain prior FCC auctions indirectly through its limited partnership interests. &#160; Each entity that qualified as a &#8220;designated entity&#8221; was eligible for bidding credits with respect to most licenses purchased in accordance w ith the rules defined by the FCC for each auction. &#160; In most cases, the bidding credits resulted in a 25% discount from the gross winning bid. 

In January 2015, the FCC released the results of Auction 97. &#160; U.S. Cellular participated in Auction 97 indirectly through its limited partnership interest in Advantage Spec trum L.P . &#160; Advantage Spectrum L.P. applied as a &#8220;designated entity&#8221; and expects to receive bid credits resulting in a 25% discount with respect to spectrum purchased in Auction 97. See Note 14 &#8212; Variable Interest Entities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

Due to changes in FCC rules, U.S. Cellular will not be participating in Auction 1000 through a limited partnership that is a &#8220;designated entity&#8221; which qualifies for a discount of 25% on any licenses won in the auction. Instead, U.S. Cellular will be participating in the auction directly and will not qualify for any discount on licenses tha t may be won in the auction. 

In 2012, the FCC conducted a single round, sealed bid, reverse auction to award Mobility Fund Phase I support to bidders that commit to provide wireless service in areas designated as unserved by the FCC. &#160; U.S. Cellular and several of its subsidiaries were winning bidders in eligible areas within 10 states. See &#160; Note 19 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Supplemental Cash Flow Disclosures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

&#160; 

TDS &#160; TELECOM OPERATIONS 

General 

TDS Telecom provides broadband, video and voice services to approximately 1.2 million connections in 34 states through its Wireline and Cable operations. &#160; The overall strategy for the Wireline and C able businesses is to &#8220; own the best pipe in the market &#8221; in order to capitalize on data growth and cust omers&#8217; needs for higher broadband speeds. 

In addition, TDS Telecom provides a wide range of Information T echnology (&#8220;IT&#8221;) services including colocation, cloud computing , hosted and manage d services , hosted application management, and sales of IT hardwar e and related professional services through its HMS business . 

Business Development Strategy 

TDS Telecom seeks to grow its operations through the acquisition of businesses that support and complement its existing products and services. TDS Telecom may also seek to divest or exchange interests that are not strategic to its long-term success. See N ote 6 &#8212; Acquisitions, Divestitures and Exchanges in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of significant acquisitions, divestitures and exchanges. T here can be no assurance that TDS or TDS Telecom will be able to negotiate additional acquisitions on terms acceptable to them or that regulatory approvals, w here required, will be received, or that TDS will have the financial resources to continue to make acquisitio ns. 

Core Network 

TDS Telecom has developed and deployed an inter-regional data routing infrastructure using leased fiber capacity which allows it to reach over 91 % of its Wireline physical access lines and 100% of its Cable access lines with its multi-gi gab i t core network. This configuration , along with the continued development of an Internet Protocol network that interconnects substantially all the existing service territories , allows for next generation IP service offerings: IP-based video, TDS manage dIP, residential Voice over IP, least-cost routing and comprehensive IP policy management. 

The TDS Telecom core network is also standardizing equipment and processes to increase efficiency in maintaining its network. TDS Telecom utilizes centralized monitoring and management of its network to reduce costs and improve service reliability. Network standardization has aided TDS Telecom in operating its 24-hours-a-day / 7-days-per-week Network Management Center, which continuously monitors the network in an effort to proactively identify and correct network faults prior to any customer impact. In addition, TDS Telecom antici pates reducing costs through the sharing of best practices across operations, centralization or standardization of functions and processes, and deployment of technologies and systems that provide for greater efficiencies and profitability. 

Wireline 

Operations 

Wireline operations are located in a mix of rural, small town and suburban markets, with the largest concentrations of customers in the Upper Midwest and the Southeast. As of December 31, 2015 , TDS Telec om operates 105 incumbent local exchange carriers (&#8220;ILEC&#8221;) in 25 states and provides telecommunications services as a competitive local exchange carrier (&#8220;CLEC&#8221;) in Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wi sconsin. Wireline operations provide retail telecommunications services to both residential and commercial customers that reside within its respective service territories. Wireline also provides services to wholesale customers, who are primarily interexch ange carriers (companies that provide long-distance telephone and data services between local exchange areas) that compensate TDS Telecom for the use of its facilities to originate and terminate their voice and data transmissions. 

Customers, Services and P roducts 

Wireline operations generate revenues by providing the following services and products to residential and commercial customers and carriers: 

Broadband : Fiber technology is being deployed to select markets to provide Internet speeds of up to 1 gigab it. In non-fiber markets, TDS Telecom continues to upgrade the data networks to increase data speeds reaching up to 50 Megabits per second (&#8220;Mbps&#8221;). Premium security and support services are available to enhance the customers&#8217; high-speed Internet experience. Video: TDS TV is a comprehensive all-digital TV service available in select TDS markets that provides customers with connected-home DVRs, video-on-demand ( &#8220; VOD &#8221; ) and TV Everywhere ( &#8220; T VE &#8221; ) . Where TDS TV is not available, TDS Telecom partner s with DISH&#174; to offer digital satellite television. Voice : Call plans includ e local and long-distance telephone service, Voice over Internet Protocol (&#8220;VoIP&#8221;) and enh anced local services like voice ma il, caller ID , call forwarding and more. Many features are bundled with calling plans to give customers the best value . Network access services are provided to interexchange carriers for the origination and termination of interstate and intrastate long di stance phone calls on TDS Telecom&#8217;s network and special access services to carriers and others. 7 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Wireline&#8217;s objective is to be the preferred broadband provider in its markets, focusing on broadband as the core growth component of its service offerings. Wir eline believes that its residential and business customers have a strong preference to purchase complementary telecommunications services from a single provider. Wireline has found that by offering and bundling services in high-value based packages with a strong customer service orientation, it can build customer loya lty and reduce customer churn. The Wireline residential customer strategy is to provide broadband, video and voice services through value-added bundling of these services. The commercial foc us is to provide advanced IP-based data and voice services. 

Residential . Wireline residential customer operations provide high-speed data products , video services and local and long-distance voice service. In selected residential markets, Wireline &#8217;s mark eting and promotional strategies focus on its Internet Protocol Television Service (&#8220; IPTV &#8221;) service offering under the brand TDS TV. This interactive video offering is intended to counter intensifying competition for video and broadband services . &#160; In mark ets where IPTV is not offered, TDS Telecom has partnered with a satellite TV provider to allow for triple or double play bundling. &#160; Approximately 79% of ILEC customers have at least two services. 

Commercial . Wireline commercial customer operations provide broadband, IP based ser vices, local and long-distance voice service and other services to small to medium sized businesses. Wireline operations provide commercial cust omers with secure and reliable I nternet access, data connections and advanced voice ser vice with innovative VoIP features. The Wireline flagship product is m anagedIP, a fully-hosted software and hardware solution that pr ovides customers with a secure I nternet connection and the latest VoIP features and capabilities. TDS m anagedIP is availa ble in markets coverin g 8 8 % of all commercial customers at December 31, 2015 . TDS managedIP is also available to customers who have locations outside the traditional wireline footprint by of fering the service over the customer&#8217;s data network. 

Wireline has continued to expand its presence in the business broadband market with managedIP telephony, high-speed symmetrical dedicated broadband and point-to-point Ethernet services. TDS m anagedIP de livers business customers a converged voice and data communications solution to the desktop. Point-to-point Ethernet provides customers secure and reliable high-speed data links for two or more locations over TDS Telecom&#8217;s internal network, not the public Internet. The strategy includes leveraging products such as managedIP and hosted and managed services to all of Wireline&#8217;s commercial customers, differentiating both on service excellence and a superior product portfolio. 

Wireline focuses its commercial marketing on information-intensive industries such as financial services, health services, real estate, hotels and motels, retail, education and government. Wireline uses its direct sales force, indirect agents, inside sales, telemarketing, digital market ing, and targeted mailings to sell products and services to commercial markets, which are segmented into tiers based on size (in terms of connections and revenues) and strategic importance. Different sales and distribution channels are used to target each segment. 

Wholesale . Wireline operations continue to provide a high level of service to traditional interexchange carriers. Wireline&#8217;s wholesale market focus is on access revenues, which is the compensation received from the interexchange carriers for ca rrying long distance and data traffic on TDS Telecom&#8217;s networks. Federal and state Universal Service Fund (&#8220;USF&#8221;) revenues, which support the cost of providing telecommunication services in high cost areas, are also included in wholesale service revenues. &#160; In 2015, TDS Telecom recognized $ 181.4 million in wholesale revenues which included $7 4.6 million received under all the Federal USF programs. Recent and proposed regulatory changes may affect the amounts of future Wireline wholesale revenues. See additional information in Risk Factors and information incorporated by reference from Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K, Annual Report section &#8220;Regulatory Matters&#8221;. 

Access Technology a nd System Design 

Wireline operates an integrated, hi ghly-reliable network that consists of central office host and remote sites, primarily equipped with digital and IP switches. Fiber optic and copper cable connect the host central offices with remote switches and ultimately with end customers. Wireline c ontinues to upgrade and expand its telecommunications network to respond to the needs of its customers for greater bandwidth and advanced technologies . B roadband service is provided to 94% of its ILEC physical access lines. The network is transitioning from its legacy circuit-switched network to a highly reliable IP-based broadband network to facilitate the integration of broadband, video and voice services. 

Wireline has pursued a plan to deploy fiber to the home technology, which enables significantly greater broadband speeds to selected residential subdivisions and to commercial customers, when the investment is economically ju stified. Approximately 36% of W ireline service addresses are capable of 25 M bps or greater broadband speeds at the end of 201 5. Fiber technology is being deployed to provide internet speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second. 

Competition 

The competitive environment in the telecommunications industry has changed significantly as a result of technological advances, customer expectat ions , and changes to regulation. Wireline continues to seek to develop and maintain an efficient cost structure to ensure that it can compete with price-based initiatives from competitors. Wireline is faced with significant challenges, including competition f rom cable, VoIP, wireless and other wireline providers as well as decreases in intercarrier compensation received for the use of TDS Telecom&#8217;s networks. 

Wireline has experienced customer connection and access minute declines due to competition from wirel ess carriers offering local and nationwide voice and data plans, from cable providers offering voice and data services via cable modems, from fiber overbuilders, and from other VoIP providers. &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Cable companies have developed technological improvements tha t have allowed them to extend their competitive operations beyond major markets and have enabled them to provide a broader range of data and voice services over their cable networks. Cable companies have aggressively pursued the bundling of data, video an d voice products at discounted prices to attract customers from traditional telephone companies. In addition, cable companies continue to add value to their I nternet offerings by increasing speeds at little to no additional cost to the customer. Wireline estimates that 72% of its ILEC access lines face active competition from cable providers at December 31, 2015 . Cable companies are increasingly targeting commercial customers. 

Wireless telephone service providers offering feature-rich wireless devices and improved network quality constitute a significant source of voice and broadband competition. A growing segment of customers have chosen to completely forego the use of traditional wireline telephone service and instead rely solely on wireless service for voice communications services. This trend is more pronounced among residential customers, which comprise approximately 6 3 % of Wireline connections as of December 31, 2015 . Some small businesses have followed the residential path by choosing wireless service and disconnecting wireline voice service. 

VoIP technology also h as improved and has led cable, I nternet and other communications companies to substantially increase their offerings of VoIP service to commercial and residential customers. VoIP providers route calls partially or wholly over the Internet, without the use of ILEC circuit switches and, in the case of cable operators and CLECs, without the use of ILEC netw orks to carry their communications traffic. VoIP pro viders frequently use existing I nternet networks to deliver flat-rate, unlimited nationwide calling plans. These plans are generally priced below the prices currently charged for traditional ILEC local and long-distance telephone services. 

While TDS Telecom positions itself as a high-quality telecommunications provider, it is experiencing competition from : Regional Bell Operating Companies (&#8220;RBOCs&#8221;) in areas where TDS Telecom competes as a CLEC, from oth er CLECs, cable providers, wireless carriers, VoIP p roviders and fiber overbuilders . In addition, the RBOCs are continuing to implement technological changes that could impede TDS Telecom&#8217;s access to facilities used to provide CLEC telecommunications serv ices. To mitigate this risk TDS Telecom has implemented and is working on other forms of last mile access alternatives to deliver services. 

C able 

Operations 

TDS Telecom enter ed the cable business with the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Baja Broadband , LLC (&#8220;Baja&#8221;) on August 1, 2013 , which operates cable systems in markets primarily in Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, and Utah. Baja w as rebranded as TDS in 2015. On September 1, 2014, TDS Telecom expanded its cable operations with the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of a group of companies operating as BendBroadband, headquartered in Bend, Oregon. As part of the agreeme nt, a Tier III data center providing colocation and managed services and a cable advertising and broadcast business were also acquired . The operations of the data center are included in the HMS segment. The operations of the cable and the advertising and broadcast businesses are included in the Cable segment. 

Through its Cable operations, TDS Telecom is expanding broadband services while leveraging its core competencies in network management and customer focus. The Cable strategy is to operate in markets with a growing population. Through investment in plant upgrades, and improvements in progra m ming and cust omer service levels, TDS Telecom intends to grow its revenue base. 

Customers, Services and Products 

Residential. &#160; Cable offers advanced broadband, vi deo and voice services. These services are actively bundled at competitive prices to en courage cross-selling within Cable&#8217;s customer base and to attract new customers. Approximately 5 4 % of residential customers subscribe to a bundle of services. 

Broadband: DOCSIS 3.0 technology is deployed to 9 5 % of service addresses which allows Cable to offer enhanced transmission speeds . TDS Telecom anticipates offering 300 Mbps service in key markets in the near future. &#160; Access to 24/7 technical support and security features is also provided to broadband customers. Video: C ustomers have access to basic service, premium programming and high-definition television combined with DVR service. &#160; TDS Telecom recently introduced &#8220;CatchTV,&#8221; a branded whole-home DVR sol ution. Voice: Telephony service uses IP to transport digitized voice signals over the same private network that brings cable television and high-speed data services to customers. All residential voice service customers have access to direct international calling and can subscribe to various long distance plans. &#160; 

Commercial. &#160; Business services are delivered over a robust network to provide broadband products, multi-line phone solutions and video. Cable provides advanced business services, including data networking, Ethernet, hosting, broadband access and VoIP services, to small and mediu m sized businesses. TDS Telecom is currently extendi ng its managedIP product line to its Cable operations. Cable&#8217;s commercial service team works with its customers&#8217; IT managers to develop customized telecommunications solutions and provides implementation capabilities essential to the needs of the individu al business. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Access Technology a nd System Design 

Cable&#8217;s telecommunication systems are designed to transmit data, video and voice services using a broadband hybrid fiber-coaxial network that consists of optical fiber transport from a headend facility to no des where coaxial cable is then used to reach residential and business customers. In certain markets, Cable has an all-fiber network to the home or business. These fiber- rich networks offer substantial bandwidth capacity and, through the use of DOCSIS 3. 0 technology, enable Cable to offer robust broadband and voice services as well as traditional and tw o-way video services. All C a ble markets are connected to TDS Telecom&#8217;s core network . This allows Cable to leverage existing internet connectivity, voice services, and support systems , which enhanc es reliability and redundancy and builds greater dependability as a service provider. 

C ompetition 

Cable seeks to be the leading provider of broadband and video services in its targeted markets. From a broadband perspective, Cable will compete against the incumbent local telephone providers, which primarily offer DSL-based services. Cable offers a supe rior, higher bandwidth data product using its DOCSIS technology. Video competition is primarily satellite providers, and on a limited basis, telephone companies that offer video services and compete for broadband and voice customers. Other telecommunicat ions providers, including Internet-based VoIP providers and wireless providers may compete directly for both residential and commercial voice and data service customers. Changes in consumer behavior (e.g. &#8220;cord-cutting&#8221;) or new technologies or both could cause consumers to reduce or cancel their cable video services and instead seek to obtain video on demand over the internet or through new technologies. Since cable systems are operated under non-exclusive franchises, competing cable systems may be built in the same area. Cable intends to avoid markets served by such over-builders or municipalities which have constructed their own ca ble systems or where other ILEC s provide fiber to the premise broadband and video service offerings.

HMS &#8217; strategy is to position itself not to comp ete head-to-head with these providers, but rather to fill the gap between large business process outsourcers and fragmented IT service providers. However, new entrants may emerge and grow rapidly creating additional sources of competition. 

TDS &#8212; REGULATIO N 

&#160; 

TDS&#8217; operations are subject to federal, state and local regulation. Key regulatory considerations are discussed below. Additional information relating to TDS&#8217; regulatory environment is in Risk Factors and incorporated by reference from Exhibit 13 to t his Form 10-K, Annual Report section &#8220;Regulatory Matters.&#8221; 

U.S. Cellular 

TDS provides various wireless services, including voice and data services, pursuant to licenses granted by the FCC. The construction, operation and transfer of wireless systems in th e United States are regulated to varying degrees by the FCC pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (&#8220;Communications Act&#8221;). The FCC currently does not require wireless carriers to comply with a number of statutory provisions otherwise appli cable to common carriers that provide, originate or terminate interstate or international telecommunications. However, the FCC has enacted regulations governing construction and operation of wireless systems, licensing (including renewal of licenses) and technical standards for the provision of wireless services under the Communications Act. 

Wireless licenses are granted by the FCC based on various geographic areas. The completion of acquisitions, involving the transfer of control of all or a portion of a wireless system requires prior FCC approval. The FCC determines on a case-by-case basis whether an acquisition of wireless licenses is in the public interest. Wireless licenses are generally granted for a ten year term or, in some cases, for a fifteen y ear term. The FCC has established standards for conducting comparative renewal proceedings between a wireless license holder seeking renewal of its license and challengers filing competing applications. All of U.S. Cellular&#8217;s licenses for which it applie d for renewal between 1995 and 2015 have been renewed. The FCC is pursuing proceedings to modify the license renewal process. U.S. Cellular expects to meet the criteria of any license renewal process. 

As part of its data services, U.S. Cellular provides internet access. As described more fully in Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K under &#8220;Regulatory Matters &#8211; FCC Net Neutrality Order,&#8221; there are developments and proposals that may result in greater regulation of wireless data services relating to internet acces s. 

Although the Communications Act generally pre-empts state and local governments from regulating the entry of, or the rates charged by, wireless carriers, certain state and local governments regulate other terms and conditions of wireless services, inclu ding billing, termination of service arrangements, imposition of early termination fees, advertising, network outages, the use of handsets while driving, zoning and land use. Further, the Federal Aviation Administration also regulates the siting, lighting and construction of transmitter towers and antennae. 

Wireline 

The FCC generally exercises jurisdiction over all facilities of, and services offered by, TDS Telecom&#8217;s ILECs as telecommunications common carriers, to the extent they provide, originate or ter minate interstate or international telecommunications. State public utility commissions generally exercise jurisdiction over intrastate telecommunications facilities and services. 

The Communications Act requires, among other things, that telecommunication s common carriers offer interstate services when requested at just and reasonable rates at terms and conditions that are non-discriminatory. Maximum rates for regulated interstate services are prescribed by the FCC, and local rates paid by end user custom ers and intrastate access charges paid by carriers continue to be subject to state commission approval in many states. 

TDS Telecom&#8217;s CLEC operations are subject to similar but reduced regulation compared to ILECs. 

In addition to traditional circuit-switche d voice service that is fully regulated as a telecommunications common carrier service, TDS Telecom also provides interconnected VoIP, which is currently subject to less regulation. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

In addition to traditional voice communications and VoIP, TDS Telecom offe rs broadband, including internet access. As described more fully in Exhibit 13 to this form 10-K under &#8220;Regulatory Matters &#8211; FCC Net Neutrality Order,&#8221; there are developments and proposals that may result in greater regulation of such services. 

Cable 

As a cable multiple systems operator (&#8220;MSO&#8221;), Cable is subject to regulation by the FCC, covering matters such as technical operations, administrative requirements, consumer protection, access by people with disabilities, subscriber privacy and content. The o peration of cable systems requires the MSO to obtain franchises from state or local governmental authorities to occupy public rights of way with network facilities. These franchises typically are nonexclusive and limited in time, contain various condition s and limitations, and provide for the payment of fees to the local authority, determined generally as a standard percentage of gross revenues. 

TDS&#8217; Cable operations also provide interconnected VoIP and broadband services, including internet access. The i nterconnected VoIP and internet regulatory matters and issues described above under &#8220;Wireline&#8221; are substantially similar for cable providers, including proposals that may result in greater regulation of broadband internet services as described more fully i n Exhibit 13 to this form 10-K under &#8220;Regulatory Matters &#8211; FCC Net Neutrality Order.&#8221; 

HMS 

HMS is subject to varying degrees of regulation in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. Federal, state and local laws and regulations, and their interpretation and enforcement may be applicable and may differ significantly among those jurisdictions. These regulations and laws may cover taxation, privacy, d ata protection, copyrights and other intellectual property, electronic communications and regulations applicable to electronic products and services.
