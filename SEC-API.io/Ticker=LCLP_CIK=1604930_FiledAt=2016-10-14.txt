The Energy Unit consists of a custom designed plastic casing, shaped as a small can of energy drink, hosting a powerful lithium battery. The energy &#8220;can&#8221; has a rail used to connect it to the adapter through a rail connection. This unit is designed to be seen as the &#8220;energy drink for the mobile devices&#8221;. It is for a single use, non-rechargeable. 

&#160;

The adapter is a small plastic device that connects to the Battery through 2 connectors and to the mobile device through the specific connector on user&#8217;s cellphone, which could be Lightning or Deck for iPhones, micro-USB for Android devices, Blackberries and others. The Adapter features an On/Off switch and a LED to indicate when is charging. Within the adapter, there is a smart, electronic charging circuit on a circuit board. 

&#160; 

Sales 

&#160; 

We plan to sell our products through retailers directly and through distributors. We are focused on building close relationships with our retailers and distributors, educating our partners&#8217; sales forces about our products, working with them to merchandise our products in a compelling manner in-store, as well as providing consumers with informative and convenient ecommerce experiences at retail partner websites. 

&#160; 

Direct sales 

&#160; 

In addition to our international sales, we plan to sell directly to large and small retailers in the United States, directly to some retail outlets. 

&#160; 

&#9679; Independent specialty retailers. We plan to use a network of location-based independent manufacturer representatives to sell our products to independent specialty retailers focused on action sports markets. Our representatives provide highly personalized service to these retailers, including assisting with product mix planning, channel marketing and in-store merchandising, taking orders and providing clinics to educate retail sales personnel about Life Clips products. We also have an internal, regionally focused sales team that provides a secondary level of service to both the manufacturer representatives and the independent specialty retailers. &#160; &#160; &#9679; Big box retailers. We plan to try and sell to large retailers with a national presence, including Amazon.com, Inc., Best Buy, Target Corporation and Wal-Mart, Inc. We hope our internal sales teams and our consulting relationships will allow entry into these stores. &#160; &#160; &#9679; Mid-market retailers. We plan to sell to retailers with a large regional or national presence, often focused on specific verticals such as consumer electronics, sporting goods, military, hunting and fishing and motor sports, which we refer to as our &#8220;mid-market&#8221; channel. &#160; &#160; &#9679; Ecommerce channel. We sell our full line of products directly to consumers around the world through our online store at klearkapture.com. We will drive consumers to our website through online and offline advertising, as well as marketing promotions carried out at tradeshows and sponsored events. &#160;

&#160; 

Distribution 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s sales strategy is to distribute its HP&#174; branded products, as well as the Mobeego products worldwide through a series of distributors and representatives. The Company will also sell online on its website and to a selected few direct retail accounts. However, the Company is relying on its distribution relationships to grow and maintain revenues. Our target stores are typically chains that have established relationships with known distributors and representatives. 

&#160; 

Growth Strategy 

&#160; 

The Company is focused on the marketing of the HP&#174; branded products as well as the Mobeego products in the United States as well as internationally. 

&#160; 

Competition, competitive position in the industry and methods of competition 

&#160; 

The photo and video hardware and software industry, as well as the battery industry are highly competitive. The Company faces intense competition from very large, international corporations, as well as from local and national companies. In addition, the Company faces competition from well-known companies that have large market share. 

&#160; 

The intensity of competition in the future is expected to increase and no assurance can be provided that the Company can sustain its market position or expand its business. 

&#160; 

Many of the Company&#8217;s current and potential competitors are well established and have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial and operational resources, and name recognition than the Company has. However, we believe that with our new Mobeego product and access to distributors, it will give us the ability to sell our photo and video products using the same methodsas the Mobeego product, and we will be able to generate sales and compete in the industry. 

&#160; 

Status of any publicly announced new product or service 

&#160; 

None. 

&#160;
