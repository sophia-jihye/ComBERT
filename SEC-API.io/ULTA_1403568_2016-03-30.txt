 Item 1. Business Overview 

Ulta Beauty is the largest beauty retailer in the United States and the premier beauty destination for cosmetics, fragrance, skin care products, hair care products and salon services. We focus on providing affordable indulgences to our guests by combining unmatched product breadth, value and convenience with the distinctive environment and experience of a specialty retailer. Key aspects of our business include: 

All Things Beauty, All in One Place&#153;. Our guests can satisfy all of their beauty needs at Ulta Beauty. Our stores and website offer more than 20,000 products from over 500 well-established and emerging beauty brands across all categories and price points, including Ulta Beauty&#146;s own private label, the Ulta Beauty Collection. The beauty products are arranged in self-service displays and full-service boutiques in a bright open store environment that encourages our guests to enjoy discovering new products and services. We believe we offer the widest selection of categories across prestige and mass cosmetics, fragrance, haircare, skincare, bath and body products and salon styling tools. We also offer a full-service salon in every store featuring hair, skin and brow services. 

Our Value Proposition. We believe our focus on delivering a compelling value proposition to our guests across all of our product categories drives guest loyalty. We offer a comprehensive loyalty program, Ultamate Rewards, and targeted promotions through our Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform. We also offer frequent promotions and coupons, in-store events and gifts with purchase. 

Convenience. Our stores are predominantly located in convenient, high-traffic locations such as power centers. Our typical store is approximately 10,000 square feet, including approximately 950 square feet dedicated to our full-service salon. Our store design, fixtures and open layout provide the flexibility to respond to consumer trends and changes in our merchandising strategy. As of January 30, 2016, we operated 874 retail stores across 48 states and distributed our products through our website, which includes a collection of tips, tutorials and social content. 

We were founded as a Delaware corporation in 1990 as a beauty retailer at a time when prestige, mass and salon products were sold through distinct channels &#150; department stores for prestige products, drug stores and mass merchandisers for mass products and salons and authorized retail outlets for professional hair care products. We developed a unique specialty retail concept that offers All Things Beauty, All in One Place&#153;, a compelling value proposition, and a convenient and a welcoming shopping environment. 

The following description of our business should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Item 7 and our Financial Statements and Supplementary Data included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Our competitive strengths 

We believe the following competitive strengths differentiate us and are critical to our success: 

Differentiated merchandising strategy with broad appeal. We believe our broad selection of merchandise across categories, price points and brands offers a unique shopping experience for our guests. While the products we sell can be found in department stores, specialty stores, salons, drug stores and mass merchandisers, we offer all of these products in one retail format so that our guests can find everything they need in one shopping trip. We offer more than 500 brands, such as Bare Minerals, Clinique and Urban Decay prestige cosmetics, NYX and Maybelline mass cosmetics, Coty and Est&#233;e Lauder Companies fragrances, Redken and Matrix haircare, as well as Dermalogica and Philosophy skincare and Clarisonic, CHI and Helen of Troy personal care appliances. We also offer Ulta Beauty Collection products in key categories such as cosmetics, skincare and bath and exclusive products such as IT Brushes for Ulta. Because we offer a broad array of products in prestige, mass and salon, we appeal to a wide range of consumers including women of all ages, demographics and lifestyles. 

Our unique guest experience. We combine unmatched product breadth, value and convenience with the distinctive environment and experience of a specialty retailer. Our well-trained, non-commissioned beauty 

&#160; 

advisors provide unbiased and customized advice tailored to our guests&#146; needs. Our customer service strategy, convenient locations, attractive store design and compelling e-commerce offerings combine to create a unique shopping experience. 

Loyal and active customer base. Over 18 million Ulta Beauty guests are active members of our Ultamate Rewards loyalty program. We use this valuable proprietary database to drive traffic, better understand our guests&#146; purchasing patterns and support new store site selection. We regularly employ a broad range of media, including digital, catalogs and newspaper inserts and targeted promotions driven by our CRM platform, to drive traffic to our stores and website. 

Strong vendor partnerships across product categories. We have strong, active relationships with over 350 vendor partners, including Bare Minerals, Coty, Est&#233;e Lauder Companies, L&#146;Or&#233;al and Procter &#38; Gamble. We believe that the scope of these long-term relationships, which span the three beauty categories of prestige, mass and salon creates an impediment for other retailers to replicate our model. We work closely with our vendor partners to market both new and existing brands in a collaborative manner. 

Experienced management team . We have an experienced senior management team that brings a creative merchandising approach and a disciplined operating philosophy to our business. We continue to expand the depth of our management team at all levels and in all functional areas to support our growth. 

Six strategic imperatives 

We are committed to the following six strategic imperatives to drive sustainable long-term growth: 

Acquire new guests and deepen loyalty with existing guests. We believe there is an opportunity to use consumer insights and effective marketing tactics to acquire new guests and increase our &#147;share of wallet&#148; of existing guests. We have sharpened our brand positioning, and are increasing awareness of the Ulta Beauty brand by communicating our brand differentiation through broad scale advertising. We continue to leverage our direct mail advertising, catalogs and newspaper inserts to communicate with our guests. We are also deploying additional marketing tactics, such as digital, in-store events and public relations to drive brand engagement, deepen the guest connection to Ulta Beauty and strengthen our authority in the beauty category. In addition, we plan to grow and further leverage our loyalty program and CRM platform. We have over 18 million active Ulta Beauty guests enrolled in our Ultamate Rewards loyalty program. Loyalty member transactions represent more than 80% of our annual total net sales, and the transaction data demonstrates that loyalty members shop with higher frequency and spend more per visit as compared to non-members. The customer data captured by our loyalty program, together with our CRM platform, enable customer segmentation and targeted marketing communications tailored to our guests&#146; unique beauty needs. We believe our loyalty program, combined with our growing CRM capabilities, provide a significant long-term competitive advantage for Ulta Beauty. 

Differentiate by delivering a distinctive and personalized guest experience across all channels. The Ulta Beauty guest experience today is differentiated by our broad array of categories, brands and price points, high quality services and friendly and helpful associates. Our opportunity is to sharpen that experience, by making it more relevant, differentiated and personalized in-store and online. Our store associates are the key to delivering a distinctive guest experience that is personal, informative and fun. We continue to invest in labor and technology to enable this experience. For example, we are testing in-store technology solutions like clienteling and have rolled out task management tools. At the same time, we are improving our e-commerce guest experience to ensure it is easy and informative with content that inspires, educates and enables sharing and social engagement. Through our loyalty and CRM capabilities, we are gaining efficiencies in our marketing by targeting communications and promotions to be more personalized and relevant to our guests. 

Offer relevant, innovative and often exclusive products that excite our guests. Our strategy is to continue to partner with existing and new key vendor partners to bring new and exclusive products to delight our guests and to introduce new brands both in-store and online. We regularly add new brands across product categories, especially in prestige cosmetics, currently the beauty industry&#146;s highest growth category. We continue to increase the presence of prestige brands and boutiques in our stores. We are also refining and growing the Ulta Beauty Collection, our private label products. Our private label strategy could include partnerships or acquisitions to create more exclusive brands for Ulta Beauty in the future. 

&#160; 

Deliver exceptional services in three core areas: hair, skin health and brows. The salon represents a small percent of our total sales, but salon guests are our best guests. Salon guests shop more frequently and spend more than twice as much as non-salon guests based on loyalty guest data. We provide haircare services in our full service salons, using high quality Redken products and offering trend-right hairstyles and color in partnership with Rodney Cutler of Redken. We also offer skin services in partnership with Dermalogica in all stores and brow services through Benefit Brow Bars in most of our stores. We plan to establish Ulta Beauty as a leading salon authority by providing high quality and consistent services from our licensed stylists, with a focus on the key pillars of hair, skin health and brows. Our strategy is to drive awareness and trial of our salon services with new guests as well as accelerate the frequency of existing guests&#146; visits. We plan to grow the expertise and tenure of our salon professionals through more frequent training and programs to reduce turnover. 

Grow stores and e-commerce to reach and serve more guests. We believe that over the long-term, we have the potential to grow our store base to more than 1,200 Ulta Beauty stores in the United States and significantly grow our e-commerce business. We have a solid track record of executing an aggressive store growth program and a rigorous analytical approach to site selection that has translated into a high performing real estate portfolio. We plan to continue opening stores both in markets in which we currently operate and new markets. We expect to open approximately 100 new stores per year for the next several years. 

We opened 103 new stores during our fiscal year ended January 30, 2016 (fiscal 2015), representing a 13% increase in square footage growth compared to 100 new stores in fiscal 2014. We also remodeled four stores and relocated five stores in fiscal 2015. Our fiscal 2015 new store program was comprised of approximately 70% new stores opened in existing shopping centers and 30% in new shopping centers. In fiscal 2015, approximately one third of new stores were in new markets and two thirds were filling-in existing markets.

Our omni-channel guests are extremely valuable, spending two to four times as much as single channel guests. We continue to develop and add new website features and functionality, marketing programs, product assortment, new brands and omni-channel integration points. We intend to establish ourselves as a leading online beauty resource by providing our guests with a rich online experience for information on key trends and products, editorial content, expanded assortments, best in class features and functionality and social media content. In addition, our investment and focus in 2015 continued to build out our order fulfillment capabilities resulting in increased capacity, faster order and delivery time, enhanced guest shipping communications and improved order quality. Our long-term goal is to grow our e-commerce business from approximately 6% of sales as of January 30, 2016 to approximately 10% of total sales over the next several years. We believe our website and retail stores provide our guests with an integrated shopping experience and increased flexibility for their beauty buying needs. 

Invest in infrastructure to support our guest experience and growth and capture scale efficiencies. We expect to continue to grow enterprise inventory capabilities to better anticipate and respond to our guests&#146; demand across all channels. This includes optimizing our distribution network, improving inventory turns by moving product faster and more frequently through all channels and improving inventory visibility, forecast accuracy, and product life cycle through investments in people, process and technology. We also plan to invest in guest-facing labor hours, training and tools to deliver a differentiated and personalized guest experience. We 

&#160; 

expect to capture operational efficiencies in new enterprise inventory capabilities to help fund those investments in-store labor and tools. We will also pursue opportunities to optimize our marketing spend to maximize effectiveness. Finally, we plan to drive scale and cost efficiencies across the enterprise. 

Our market 

We operate within the large and growing U.S. beauty products and salon services industry. This market represents approximately $127 billion in sales, according to Euromonitor International and IBIS World Inc. The approximately $74 billion beauty products industry includes cosmetics, haircare, fragrance, bath and body, skincare, salon styling tools and other toiletries. Within this market, we compete across all major categories as well as a range of price points by offering prestige, mass and salon products. The approximately $53 billion salon services industry consists of hair, skin and nail services. 

Competition 

Our major competitors for prestige and mass products include traditional department stores, specialty stores, drug stores, mass merchandisers and the online businesses of national retailers as well as pure-play e-commerce businesses. The market for salon services and products is highly fragmented. Our competitors for salon services and products include chain and independent salons. 

Stores 

Our stores are predominantly located in convenient, high-traffic locations such as power centers. Our typical store is approximately 10,000 square feet, including approximately 950 square feet dedicated to our full-service salon. We opened 103 (100 net of closings) stores in fiscal 2015 and the average investment required to open a new Ulta Beauty store is approximately $1.2 million, which includes capital investments, net of landlord contributions, pre-opening expenses and initial inventory, net of payables. Our net investment required to open new stores and the net sales generated by new stores may vary depending on a number of factors, including geographic location. Our retail store concept, including physical layout, displays, lighting and quality of finishes, has evolved over time to match the rising expectations of our guests and to keep pace with our merchandising and operating strategies. Approximately 98% of our stores feature our most current store design. We expect the net investment to open a new store in 2016 will increase due to store enhancements and boutique additions. As of January 30, 2016, we operated 874 stores in 48 states. 

Salon 

We offer a full range of services in all of our stores, focusing on the three key pillars of hair, skin health and brow services. Our current Ulta Beauty store format includes an open and modern salon area with approximately eight to ten stations and the majority of our stores offer brow services. The entire salon area is approximately 950 square feet with a concierge desk, skin treatment room or dedicated skin treatment area, semi-private shampoo and hair color processing area. We employ licensed professional stylists and estheticians who offer highly skilled services as well as an educational experience, including consultations, styling lessons, skincare regimens and at-home care recommendations. 

Ulta.com 

Our e-commerce business represented approximately 6% of our total sales and grew 47.5% in fiscal 2015. We offer more than 20,000 beauty products from hundreds of brands. Ulta.com is also an important resource for our guests to access product and store information, beauty trends and techniques. We continue to enhance the site with a collection of tips, tutorials and social content. We expect Ulta.com to maintain rapid growth with the long-term goal of 10% of total sales. We are in the process of significantly improving our e-commerce fulfillment capabilities through new distribution centers and systems. 

&#160; 

Merchandising 

Strategy 

We focus on offering one of the most extensive product and brand selections in our industry, including a broad assortment of branded and private label beauty products in cosmetics, fragrance, haircare, skincare, bath and body products and salon styling tools. A typical Ulta Beauty store carries more than 20,000 prestige, mass and professional beauty products. We present these products in an assisted self-service environment using centrally produced planograms (detailed schematics showing product placement in the store) and promotional merchandising planners. Our merchandising team continually monitors current fashion trends, historical sales trends and new product launches to keep Ulta Beauty&#146;s product assortment fresh and relevant to our guests. We believe our broad selection of merchandise, from moderate-priced brands to higher-end prestige brands, offers a unique shopping experience for our guests. Many of the products we sell can also be found in department stores, specialty stores, salons, mass merchandisers and drug stores, but we offer all of these products in a single store environment that represents All Things Beauty, All in One Place TM . We offer a comprehensive customer loyalty program, Ultamate Rewards, and targeted promotions through our CRM platform. We also offer promotions and coupons, in-store events and gifts with purchase. 

We believe our private label products, the Ulta Beauty Collection, are a strategically important category for growth and profit contribution. Our objective is to provide quality, trend-right private label products to continue to strengthen our guests&#146; perception of Ulta Beauty as a contemporary beauty destination. Ulta Beauty manages the full development cycle of these products from concept through production in order to deliver differentiated packaging and formulas to build brand image. The Ulta Beauty Collection has a strong following and we may expand our private label products into additional categories. We also offer products such as IT Brushes for Ulta, Japonesque cosmetics and Ultra CHI hair care appliances that are exclusive to Ulta Beauty. The Ulta Beauty Collection and Ulta Beauty exclusive products represented approximately 6% of total Company sales in fiscal 2015. 

Assortment 

We offer products in the following categories: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Cosmetics, which includes products for the face, eyes, cheeks, lips, nails and brushes; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Haircare, which includes shampoos, conditioners, styling products, hair accessories and hair brushes; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Salon styling tools, which includes hair dryers, curling irons and flat irons; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Skincare and bath and body, which includes products for the face, hands and body; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Fragrance; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Nail polish and nail care products; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Men&#146;s skincare, haircare and fragrance products; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Ulta Beauty Collection, consisting of cosmetics, skincare, bath and body products and haircare; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Other health and beauty products. 

Organization 

Our merchandising team consists of a Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer overseeing two Senior Vice Presidents who in turn oversee a team of category Vice Presidents, Divisional Merchandise Managers and their team of buyers. Our merchandising team works with our centralized merchandise planning and forecasting group to ensure a consistent execution across our store base and e-commerce platform. 

Our planogram department assists the merchants and inventory teams to keep new products flowing into stores on a timely basis. All major product categories undergo planogram revisions on a regular basis and adjustments are made to assortment mix and product placement based on current sales trends. 

&#160; 

Our visual department works with our merchandising team on strategic placement of promotional merchandise, along with functional and educational signage and creative product presentation standards in all of our stores. All stores receive a centrally produced promotional planner to ensure consistent implementation of our marketing programs. 

Planning and allocation 

Our merchandising team works to ensure consistent execution across our store base and e-commerce platform. We have developed a disciplined approach to buying and a dynamic inventory planning and allocation process to support our merchandising strategy. We centrally manage product replenishment to our stores through our merchandise planning group. This group serves as a strategic partner to, and provides financial oversight of, the merchandising team. The merchandising team creates a sales forecast by category for the year. Our merchandise planning group creates an open-to-buy plan, approved by senior executives, for each product category. The open-to-buy plan is updated weekly with point-of-sale (POS) data, receipts and inventory levels and is used throughout the year to balance buying opportunities and inventory return on investment. We believe this structure maximizes our buying opportunities while maintaining organizational and financial control. Regularly replenished products are presented consistently in all stores utilizing a merchandising planogram process. POS data is used to calculate sales forecasts and to determine replenishment levels. We determine promotional product replenishment levels using sales history from similar or comparable events. To ensure our inventory remains productive, our planning and replenishment group, along with senior executives, monitor the levels of clearance and aged inventory in our stores on a weekly basis. In 2015, we began to implement a new merchandising planning and forecasting system, which we expect to fully roll out in 2016. 

Vendor partnerships 

We have close relationships with our more than 350 vendor partners. Our top ten vendor partners, such as Bare Minerals, Coty, Est&#233;e Lauder Companies, L&#146;Or&#233;al and Procter &#38; Gamble, among others, represented approximately 50% of our total net sales in fiscal 2015. We believe our vendor partners view us as a significant distribution channel for growth and brand enhancement. 

Marketing and advertising 

Marketing strategy 

We employ a multi-faceted marketing strategy to increase brand awareness, drive traffic to our stores and website, acquire new guests, improve guest retention and increase frequency of shopping. We communicate with our guests and prospective guests through multiple vehicles, including direct mail catalogs, free-standing newspaper inserts, television, radio and digital advertising. These vehicles highlight the breadth of our selection of prestige, mass and salon beauty products, new products and services and special offers and are designed to increase brand awareness. Our comprehensive public relations strategy enhances Ulta Beauty&#146;s reputation as a beauty destination, increases brand awareness, supports our charitable efforts on behalf of The Breast Cancer Research Foundation, and drives awareness of new products, in-store events and new store openings. 

Our loyalty program, Ultamate Rewards, is an important tool to increase retention of existing guests and to enhance their loyalty to the Ulta Beauty brand. Over 18 million active loyalty program members generated more than 80% of Ulta Beauty&#146;s annual total net sales. Ultamate Rewards enables customers to earn points based on their purchases. Points earned are valid for at least one year and may be redeemed on any product we sell. Our CRM platform enables sophisticated mining of the customer data in our loyalty member database as well as greater personalization of our marketing campaigns. 

A growing percentage of our marketing expense is being directed toward email marketing, digital marketing, and national TV and radio advertising. We believe these channels are highly effective in communicating with existing guests, as well as reaching those who have not yet shopped with us. Our email marketing program has been effective in communicating with our existing online and retail guests in a targeted and relevant way. Our digital marketing strategy includes search engine optimization, paid search, mobile advertising, affiliate relationships such as online coupon sites, social media, display advertising, and other digital marketing channels. 

&#160; 

Digital marketing, coupled with our national TV and radio advertising, has helped us grow brand awareness among those not familiar with Ulta Beauty, which we believe has resulted in new guests and reactivation of guests who have not shopped at Ulta Beauty within the last year. 

Staffing and operations 

Retail 

Our current Ulta Beauty store format is staffed with a general manager, a salon manager, two associate managers, a part-time manager and approximately twenty full and part-time associates; including approximately four to eight prestige consultants and eight to ten licensed salon professionals. The management team in each store reports to the general manager. The general manager oversees all store activities including salon management, inventory management, merchandising, cash management, scheduling, hiring and guest services. Members of store management receive bonuses depending on their position and based upon various metrics. Each general manager reports to a district manager, who in turn reports to a Regional Vice President of Operations, who in turn reports to the Senior Vice President of Store Operations, who in turn reports to our Chief Store Operations Officer, who in turn reports to the Chief Executive Officer. Each store team receives additional support from time to time from recruiting specialists for the retail and salon operations, regionally based human resource managers, a field loss prevention team, salon technical trainers, management trainers and vendor partners. 

Ulta Beauty stores are open seven days a week, eleven hours a day, Monday through Saturday, and seven hours on Sunday. Our stores have extended hours during the holiday season. 

Salon 

A typical salon is staffed with eight to ten licensed salon professionals, including a salon manager, six stylists and one or two estheticians. Our most productive salons have a guest coordinator and an assistant manager. Our salon technical trainers and vendor partner education classes create a comprehensive educational program for approximately 6,800 Ulta Beauty salon professionals. 

Training and development 

Our success is dependent in part on our ability to attract, train, retain and motivate qualified associates at all levels of the organization. We have developed a corporate culture that enables individual store managers to make store-level operating decisions and we consistently reward high performance. We are committed to continually developing our associates and providing career advancement opportunities. Our associates and management teams are essential to our store expansion strategy. We use a combination of existing managers, promoted associates and outside hires to support our new stores. 

All of our associates participate in an interactive new-hire orientation through which each associate becomes acquainted with Ulta Beauty&#146;s mission, vision and values. Training for new store managers, prestige beauty advisors and sales associates familiarizes them with our beauty products and services, opening and closing routines, guest service expectations, loss prevention practices, our policies and procedures and our culture. We provide continuing education to salon professionals and retail associates throughout their careers at Ulta Beauty. Our learning management system allows us to provide ongoing training to all associates to continually enhance their product knowledge, technical skills and guest service expertise. In contrast to the sales teams at traditional department stores, our retail sales teams are not commissioned. Our prestige beauty advisors are trained to work across all prestige lines and within our prestige boutiques, where guests can receive makeup demonstrations, skin analysis and assistance in selecting the products and services that suit them best. 

Distribution 

We operate four distribution facilities. The first facility, located in Romeoville, Illinois, is approximately 291,000 square feet. The second distribution facility is in Phoenix, Arizona and is approximately 437,000 square feet. The third distribution center, located in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, opened in April 2012. The Chambersburg warehouse is approximately 373,000 square feet. We embarked on a multi-year supply chain project beginning in 2014. As a result, the fourth distribution facility, located in Greenwood, Indiana, opened in August of 2015 and is 

&#160; 

approximately 671,000 square feet. We also expect to open a fifth distribution center in 2016 in Dallas, Texas and to implement system improvements to support expanded omni-channel capabilities. The Dallas warehouse is approximately 671,000 square feet. 

Inventory is shipped from our suppliers to our distribution facilities. We carry more than 20,000 products and replenish our stores with such products primarily in eaches (i.e., less-than-case quantities), which allows us to ship less than an entire case when only one or two of a particular product is required. Our distribution facilities use warehouse management and warehouse control software systems to maintain and support product purchase decisions. Store replenishment order selection is performed using pick-to-light processing technologies. Product is delivered to stores using a broad network of contract and local pool (final mile) carriers. We fulfill e-commerce orders from our Romeoville, Illinois, Chambersburg, Pennsylvania and Greenwood, Indiana distribution centers. 

Information technology 

We are committed to using technology to enhance our competitive position. We depend on a variety of information systems and technologies to maintain and improve our competitive position and to manage the operations of our growing store base. We rely on computer systems to provide information for all areas of our business, including supply chain, merchandising, POS, e-commerce, marketing, finance, accounting and human resources. Our core business systems consist mostly of purchased software programs that integrate with our internally developed software solutions. Our technology also includes a company-wide network that connects all corporate users, stores and our distribution infrastructure and provides communications for credit card and daily polling of sales and merchandise movement at the store level. We intend to leverage our technology infrastructure and systems where appropriate to gain operational efficiencies through more effective use of our systems, people and processes. We update the technology supporting our stores, distribution infrastructure and corporate headquarters on a regular basis. We will continue to make investments in our information systems to facilitate our growth and enable us to enhance our competitive position. 

Intellectual property 

We have registered over 40 trademarks in the United States and other countries. The majority of our trademark registrations contain the ULTA mark, including Ulta Salon Cosmetics Fragrance (and design), Ulta.com and Ulta Beauty and two related designs. We maintain our marks on a docket system to monitor filing deadlines for renewal and continued validity. All marks that are deemed material to our business have been applied for or registered in the United States and select foreign countries, including Canada. 

We believe our trademarks, especially those related to the Ulta brand, have significant value and are important to building brand recognition. 

Government regulation 

We are affected by extensive laws, governmental regulations, administrative determinations, court decisions and similar constraints. Such laws, regulations and other constraints may exist at the federal, state or local levels in the United States. Many of the products we sell in our stores, such as cosmetic, dietary supplement, food and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, medical devices and styling tools, including our Ulta branded products, are subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), state regulatory agencies and State Attorneys General (AGs). Such regulations principally relate to the safety, labeling, manufacturing, advertising, packaging and distribution of the products. 

Products classified as cosmetics (as defined in the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDC Act)) are not subject to pre-market approval by the FDA, but the products must generally be safe and must be properly manufactured and labeled. Certain products, such as sunscreens and acne treatments, are classified as OTC drugs, certain ingestible products, such as vitamins and minerals, are classified as dietary supplements. Both OTC drugs and dietary supplements have specific ingredient, labeling and manufacturing requirements. The labeling of these products is subject to the requirements of the FDC Act and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act. Products such as wrinkle reducing lights may be classified as medical devices and, in addition to being subject to labeling and 

&#160; 

manufacturing requirements, may also be subject to premarketing review by the FDA. Finally, products such as styling tools (e.g. blow dryers, curling irons) are regulated by the CPSC, which has strict requirements with respect to reporting possible product defects. 

Further, claims we make in advertising, including claims about the safety or efficacy of products, pricing claims and environmental claims, are subject to regulation by the FTC and State AGs who generally prohibit unfair or deceptive practices. 

The government regulations that most impact our day-to-day operations are the labor and employment and taxation laws to which most retailers are typically subject. We are also subject to typical zoning and real estate land use restrictions and typical advertising and consumer protection laws (both federal and state). Our services business is subject to state board regulations and state licensing requirements. 

In our store leases, we require our landlords to obtain all necessary zoning approvals and permits for the site to be used as a retail site and we also ask them to obtain any zoning approvals and permits for our specific use (but at times the responsibility for obtaining zoning approvals and permits for our specific use falls to us). We require our landlords to deliver a certificate of occupancy for any work they perform on our buildings or the shopping centers in which our stores are located. We are responsible for delivering a certificate of occupancy for any remodeling or build-outs that we perform and are responsible for complying with all applicable laws in connection with such construction projects or build-outs. 

Employees 

As of January 30, 2016, we employed approximately 9,700 people on a full-time basis and approximately 16,800 on a part-time basis. We have no collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced any work stoppages and believe we have good relationships with our employees. 

Seasonality 

Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuation. Significant portions of our net sales and profits are realized during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to the holiday selling season. To a lesser extent, our business is also affected by Mothers&#146; Day as well as the &#147;Back to School&#148; season and Valentine&#146;s Day.
