 ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS 

Overview 

&#160; 

We are a global provider of domain name registry services and Internet security, enabling Internet navigation for many of the world&#8217;s most recognized domain names and providing protection for websites and enterprises around the world (&#8220;Registry Services&#8221;). Our Registry Services ensure the security, stability, and resiliency of key Internet infrastructure and services, including the . com &#32;and . net &#32;domains, two of the Internet&#8217;s root servers, and operation of the root-zone maintainer functions for the core of the Internet&#8217;s Domain Name System (&#8220;DNS&#8221;). Our product suite also includes Security Services, which was formerly known as Network Intelligence and Availability, or NIA Services, consisting of Distributed Denial of Service (&#8220;DDoS&#8221;) Protection Services, Verisign iDefense Security Intelligence Services (&#8220;iDefense&#8221;) and Managed Domain Name System (&#8220;Managed DNS&#8221;) Services. 

&#160; 

We have one reportable segment, which consists of Registry Services and Security Services. We have operations inside as well as outside the United States (&#8220;U.S.&#8221;). For certain additional information about our segment, including a geographic breakdown of revenues and changes in revenues, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Item 7 and Note 8, &#8220;Geographic and Customer Information&#8221; of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K. 

&#160;

&#160; Registry Services 

&#160; 

Registry Services operates the authoritative directory of all .com, .net, .cc, .tv, and &#32;.name &#32;domain names, among others and the back-end systems for all &#32;.gov , .jobs, &#32;and .edu domain names, among others. Registry Services allows individuals and organizations to establish their online identities, while providing the secure, always-on access they need to communicate and transact reliably with large-scale online audiences. 

&#160; 

We are the exclusive registry of domain names within the .com, .net, &#32;and .name generic top-level domains (&#8220;gTLDs&#8221;) under agreements with ICANN and also, with respect to the .com &#32;agreement, the U.S. Department of Commerce (&#8220;DOC&#8221;). As a registry, we maintain the master directory of all second-level domain names in these gTLDs (e.g., johndoe.com and janedoe.net). Our global constellation of domain name servers provides Internet Protocol (&#8220;IP&#8221;) address information in response to queries, enabling the use of browsers, email systems, and other systems on the Internet. In addition, we own and maintain the shared registration system that allows all registrars to enter new second-level domain names into the master directory and to submit modifications, transfers, re-registrations and deletions for existing second-level domain names (&#8220;Shared Registration System&#8221;). 

&#160; 

Separate from our agreements with ICANN, we have agreements to be the exclusive registry for the .tv &#32;and .cc &#32;country code top-level domains (&#8220;ccTLDs&#8221;) for Tuvalu and Cocos (Keeling) Islands, respectively, and to operate the back-end registry systems for the .gov , .jobs, &#32;and .edu gTLDs, among others. These TLDs are also supported by our global constellation of domain name servers and Shared Registration System. 

&#160; 

With our existing gTLDs and ccTLDs, we also provide internationalized domain name (&#8220;IDN&#8221;) services that enable Internet users to access websites in characters representing their local language. Currently, IDNs may be registered in as many as 350 different native languages and scripts. 

&#160; 

Domain names can be registered for between one and 10 years, and the fees charged for .com , .net and &#32;.name may only be increased according to adjustments prescribed in our agreements with ICANN over the applicable term. With respect to . com, price increases require prior approval by the DOC according to the terms of Amendment 32 of the Cooperative Agreement, as amended, between the DOC and Verisign (&#8220;Cooperative Agreement&#8221;). Revenues for .cc &#32;and .tv &#32;domain names are based on a similar fee system and registration system, though the fees charged are not subject to the same pricing restrictions as those imposed by ICANN. The fees received from operating the . gov registry are based on the terms of Verisign&#8217;s agreement with the U.S. General Services Administration. The fees received from operating the .jobs registry infrastructure are based on the terms of Verisign&#8217;s agreement with the registry operator of .jobs. No fees are received from operating the .edu &#32;registry infrastructure. 

Historically, we have experienced higher domain name growth in the first quarter of the year compared to other quarters. Our quarterly revenue does not reflect these seasonal patterns because the preponderance of our revenue for each quarterly period is provided by the ratable recognition of our deferred revenue balance. The effect of this seasonality has historically resulted in the largest amount of growth in our deferred revenue balance occurring during the first quarter of the year compared to the other quarters. In the second half of 2015, we experienced an increase in the level of new domain name registrations in our Australia, China, India, and other Asia Pacific countries (&#8220;APAC&#8221;) region which were coming largely through registrars in China. 

&#160; 

Security Services 

&#160; 

Security Services provides infrastructure assurance to organizations and is comprised of iDefense, Managed DNS Services, and DDoS Protection Services. 

DDoS Protection Services supports online business continuity by providing monitoring and mitigation services against DDoS attacks. We help companies stay online without needing to make significant investments in infrastructure or establish internal DDoS expertise. As a cloud-based service, it can be deployed quickly and easily, with no customer premise equipment required. This saves time and money through operational efficiencies, support costs, and economies of scale to provide detection and protection against the largest DDoS attacks. Customers include financial institutions, software-as-a-service providers, e-commerce providers, and media companies. Customers pay a subscription fee that varies depending on the customer&#8217;s network requirements. 

&#160; 

iDefense provides 24 hours a day, every day of the year, access to cyber intelligence related to vulnerabilities, malicious code, and global threats. Our teams enable companies to improve vulnerability management, incident response, fraud mitigation, and proactive mitigation of the particular threats targeting their industry or global operations. Customers include financial institutions, large corporations, and governmental and quasi-governmental organizations. Customers pay a subscription fee for iDefense. 

&#160; 

Managed DNS Services is a hosting service that delivers DNS resolution, improving the availability of web-based systems. It provides DNS availability through a globally distributed, securely managed, cloud-based DNS infrastructure, allowing enterprises to save on capital expenses associated with DNS infrastructure deployment and reduce operational costs and complexity associated with DNS management. Managed DNS service provides full support for DNS Security Extensions (&#8220;DNSSEC&#8221;) compliance features and Geo Location traffic routing capabilities. DNSSEC is designed to protect the DNS infrastructure from man-in-the-middle attacks that corrupt, or poison, DNS data. Geo Location allows website owners to customize responses for end-users based on their physical location or IP address, giving them the ability to deliver location-specific content. Customers include financial institutions, e-commerce, and software-as-a-service providers. Customers pay a subscription fee that varies based on the amount of DNS traffic they receive. 

Operations Infrastructure 

Our operations infrastructure consists of three secure data centers in Dulles, Virginia; New Castle, Delaware; and Fribourg, Switzerland as well as more than 100 resolution sites around the world. These secure data centers operate 24 hours a day, supporting our business units and services. The performance and scale of our infrastructure are critical for our business, and give us the platform to maintain our leadership position. Key features of our operations infrastructure include: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Distributed Servers: We operate a large number of high-speed servers globally to support localized capacity and availability demands. In conjunction with our proprietary software, processes and procedures, this platform offers automatic failover, global and local load balancing, and threshold monitoring on critical servers. 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Networking: We deploy and maintain a redundant and diverse global network, maintain high-speed, redundant connections to numerous Internet service providers and maintain peering relationships globally to ensure that our critical services are readily accessible to customers at all times. 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Security: We incorporate architectural concepts such as protected domains, restricted nodes and distributed access control in our system architecture. In addition, we employ firewalls and intrusion detection software, as well as proprietary security mechanisms at many points across our infrastructure. We perform recurring internal vulnerability testing and controls audits, and also contract with third-party security consultants who perform periodic penetration tests and security risk assessments on our systems. Verisign has engineered resiliency and diversity into how it hosts classes of products throughout its set of interconnected sites to mitigate unknown vendor defects and zero-hour security vulnerabilities. This includes different physical security silos, which themselves are separated into bulkheads, and in which servers are located. Corporate networks are in their own physical silo. Thus, the corporate networks to which personnel directly connect are separated from the silos that house production services; administration of production gear from corporate systems must go through an internal, fortified intermediary; and account credentials used within the corporate networks are not used within the production silos, nor on the fortified systems. 

&#8226; 

Data Integrity: &#32;Verisign employs both phased and systemic integrity validation operations via a number of proprietary mechanisms on all internal DNS publication operations. 

&#160; 

As part of our operations infrastructure for our Registry Services business, we operate all authoritative domain name servers that answer domain name queries for the .com &#32;and .net &#32;zones, as well as for the other TLDs for which we are the registry. We also administer and operate two of the 13 root zone servers that contain authoritative data for the very top of the DNS hierarchy. Our domain name servers provide the associated authoritative name servers and IP addresses for every .com &#32;and .net &#32;domain name on the Internet and a large number of other TLD queries, resulting in an average of over 120 billion transactions per day. These name servers are located in resolution sites which are in a controlled and monitored environment, incorporating security and system maintenance features. This network of name servers is one of the cornerstones of the Internet&#8217;s DNS infrastructure. 

In 2014 &#32;and 2015 , we continued to expand our infrastructure to meet demands to support normal and peak system load and attack volumes based on what we have experienced historically, as well as to accommodate projected Internet attack trends. 

&#160; 

Call Centers and Help Desk: We provide customer support services through our phone-based call centers, email help desks and Web-based self-help systems. Our Virginia call center is staffed 24 hours a day, every day of the year to support our 

businesses. All call centers have a staff of trained customer support agents and also provide Web-based support services utilizing customized automatic response systems to provide self-help recommendations. 

&#160; 

Operations Support and Monitoring: Through our network operations centers, we have an extensive monitoring capability that enables us to track the status and performance of our critical database systems and our global resolution systems. Our network operations center is staffed 24 hours a day, every day of the year. 

&#160; 

Disaster Recovery Plans: We have disaster recovery and business continuity capabilities that are designed to deal with the loss of entire data centers and other facilities. Our Registry Services business maintains dual mirrored data centers that allow rapid failover with no data loss and no loss of function or capacity, as well as off-continent tertiary Registry Services capabilities. Our critical data services (including domain name registration and global resolution) use advanced storage systems that provide data protection through techniques such as synchronous mirroring and remote replication. 

Marketing, Sales and Distribution 

&#160; 

We offer promotional marketing programs for our registrars based upon market conditions and the business environment in which the registrars operate. We seek to expand our existing businesses through focused marketing programs that target growth in the . com &#32;and . net &#32;domain name base, particularly in emerging international markets, and by extending our brand and serving new markets through the IDN gTLDs which we have begun launching. We market our Security Services worldwide through multiple distribution channels, including direct sales and indirect channels. We have marketing and sales offices throughout the world. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

We believe that timely development of new and enhanced services, including monitoring and visualization, registry provisioning platforms, navigation and resolution services, data services, value added services, and Security Services is necessary to remain competitive in the marketplace. During 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;our research and development expenses were $63.7 million , $67.8 million &#32;and $70.3 million , respectively. 

&#160; 

Our future success will depend in large part on our ability to continue to maintain and enhance our current technologies and services, and to develop new ones. We actively investigate and incubate new concepts, and evaluate new business ideas through our innovation pipeline. In conjunction, we also continue to focus on growing our patent portfolio and consider opportunities for its strategic use. We expect that most of the future enhancements to our existing services and our new services will be the result of internal development efforts in collaboration with suppliers, other vendors, customers and the technology community. Under certain circumstances, we may also acquire or license technology from third parties. 

&#160; 

The markets for our services are dynamic, characterized by rapid technological developments, frequent new product introductions, and evolving industry standards. The constantly changing nature of these markets and their rapid evolution will require us to continually improve the performance, features, and reliability of our services, particularly in response to competitive offerings, and to introduce both new and enhanced services as quickly as possible and prior to our competitors. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We compete with numerous companies in each of the Registry Services and Security Services businesses. The overall number of our competitors may increase and the identity and composition of competitors may change over time. 

New technologies and the expansion of existing technologies may increase competitive pressure. In addition, our markets are characterized by announcements of collaborative relationships involving our competitors. The existence or announcement of any such relationships could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers. 

Competition in Registry Services: &#160; We face competition in the domain name registry space from other gTLD and ccTLD registries that are competing for the business of entities and individuals that are seeking to obtain a domain name registration and/or establish a Web presence. In addition to the three gTLDs we operate (. com , . net &#32;and . name ), other gTLDs and ccTLDs for which we provide back-end registry services, and the IDN gTLDs that we began to launch in late 2015, there are over 840 other operational gTLD registries, over 250 Latin script ccTLD registries and more than 40 IDN ccTLD registries. Under our agreements with ICANN, we are subject to certain restrictions in the operation of .com , .net &#32;and .name &#32;on pricing, bundling, marketing, methods of distribution, the introduction of new registry services and use of registrars that do not apply to ccTLDs and other gTLDs and therefore may create a competitive disadvantage. 

We also face competition from service providers that offer outsourced domain name registration, resolution and other DNS services to organizations that require a reliable and scalable infrastructure. Among the competitors are Neustar, Inc., Afilias plc, 

Donuts Inc., RightSide Group, Ltd., and CentralNic Ltd. In addition, to the extent end-users navigate using search engines or social media, as opposed to direct navigation, we may face competition from search engine operators such as Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo!, operators of social networks such as Facebook, and operators of microblogging tools such as Twitter. In addition, we may face competition from these social media businesses to the extent they are used to establish an online presence by end users instead of through the use of a domain name. Furthermore, to the extent end-users increase the use of web and phone applications to locate and access content, we may face competition from providers of such web and mobile applications. 

Competition in Security Services: Several of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and/or significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do and therefore may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards and customer requirements. Many of these competitors also have broader and more established distribution channels that may be used to deliver competing products or services directly to customers through bundling or other means. If such competitors were to bundle competing products or services for their customers, we may experience difficulty establishing or increasing demand for our products and services or distributing our products successfully. In addition, it may be difficult to compete against consolidation and partnerships among our competitors which create integrated product suites. 

Our Security Services business faces competition from companies such as International Business Machines Corporation, Secunia ApS, Dell SecureWorks, McAfee, Inc., Akamai Technologies, Inc., AT&#38;T Inc., Verizon Communications Inc., Dynamic Network Services, Inc., Neustar, Inc., BlueCat Networks, Infoblox Inc., Nominum, Inc., FireEye, Inc., Cyveillance, Inc., ThreatConnect, Inc., ThreatStream, Inc., RiskIQ, Inc., Level 3 Communications, Inc. and Imperva, Inc. 

Industry Regulation 

&#160; 

Registry Services: Within the U.S. Government, oversight of the DNS is provided by the DOC. Effective October 1, 2009, the DOC and ICANN entered into a new agreement, known as the Affirmation of Commitments (&#8220;AOC&#8221;) which replaced the seventh amendment of the original Memorandum of Understanding and known as the Joint Project Agreement. Under the AOC, the DOC became one of several parties working together with other representative constituency members in providing an on-going review of ICANN&#8217;s performance and accountability. The AOC sets forth a periodic review process by committees which provide for more international and multi-discipline participation. These review panels are charged with reviewing and making recommendations regarding: (i) the accountability and transparency of ICANN; (ii) the security, stability and resiliency of the DNS; (iii) the impact of new gTLDs on competition, consumer trust, and consumer choice; and (iv) the effectiveness of ICANN&#8217;s policies with respect to registrant data in meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement and promoting consumer trust. Under the AOC, the Assistant Secretary of Communications and Information of the DOC will be a member of the &#8220;Accountability and Transparency&#8221; review panel. Individual reviews from each panel generally are to occur no less than every three to four years. 

&#160; 

As the exclusive registry of domain names within the .com , .net and .name gTLDs, we have entered into certain agreements with ICANN and, in the case of . com , the DOC: 

&#160; 

.com &#32;Registry Agreement: On November 29, 2012, we renewed our Registry Agreement with ICANN for the .com gTLD (the &#8220; .com &#32;Registry Agreement&#8221;). The .com &#32;Registry Agreement provides that we will continue to be the sole registry operator for domain names in the .com &#32;gTLD through November 30, 2018. The .com &#32;Registry Agreement includes pricing restrictions for .com domain name registrations consistent with the terms of the Cooperative Agreement as set forth below. Additionally, on a quarterly basis, we pay $0.25 to ICANN for each annual increment of a domain name registered or renewed during such quarter. See Note 12, &#8220;Commitments and Contingencies&#8221; of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K. We are required to comply with and implement temporary specifications or policies and consensus policies, as well as other provisions pursuant to the .com &#32;Registry Agreement relating to handling of data and other registry operations. The .com &#32;Registry Agreement also provides a procedure for Verisign to propose, and ICANN to review and approve, additional registry services. 

The .com &#32;Registry Agreement provides that it shall be renewed for successive terms unless it has been determined that Verisign has been in fundamental and material breach of certain provisions of the .com &#32;Registry Agreement and has failed to cure such breach. As further described below, Verisign may not enter into any renewal of the .com &#32;Registry Agreement, or any other extension or continuation of, or substitution for, the . com &#32;Registry Agreement without prior written approval by the DOC. 

ICANN and Verisign submitted a proposal to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (&#8220;NTIA&#8221;) describing how best to remove NTIA&#8217;s administrative role associated with the root zone management in a manner that maintains the security, stability and resiliency of the Internet&#8217;s domain name system. ICANN and Verisign are in the final stages of drafting the new Root Zone Maintainer agreement to perform this Root Zone Maintainer role as a commercial service for ICANN upon the successful transition of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (&#8220;IANA&#8221;) functions. To ensure that root operations continue to perform at the same high level during the expected 10-year term of the Root Zone Maintainer agreement, ICANN and Verisign are in discussions to extend the term of the .com &#32;Registry Agreement to coincide with the expected 10-year term of the Root Zone 

Maintainer agreement. While ICANN and Verisign are in the final stages of preparing the Root Zone Maintainer agreement and the . com &#32;Registry Agreement extension documents, there are several important steps that need to occur including completing the drafting of the agreements, posting them for public comment, and obtaining approvals from ICANN&#8217;s and Verisign&#8217;s Boards of Directors. Additionally, under the Cooperative Agreement, we may not enter into the contemplated extension of the . com &#32;Registry Agreement without the prior written approval of the DOC. If the DOC does not approve the extension, then the current . com &#32;Registry Agreement will remain unchanged. There can be no assurance that either the Root Zone Maintainer agreement or the changes to the . com &#32;Registry Agreement will be approved, or, if approved, will be in the form described. 

&#160; 

Cooperative Agreement: On November 29, 2012, Verisign and the DOC entered into Amendment Number Thirty-Two (32) (&#8220;Amendment 32&#8221;) to the Cooperative Agreement between Verisign and the DOC (the &#8220;Cooperative Agreement&#8221;), which approved the renewal of the . com &#32;Registry Agreement on the terms and conditions described below as in the public interest. Except as modified by Amendment 32, the terms and conditions of the Cooperative Agreement, including Amendment Thirty (30) to the Cooperative Agreement, which was entered into on November 29, 2006 by the Company and the DOC, remain unchanged. Amendment 32 provides that the Maximum Price (as defined in the .com &#32;Registry Agreement) of a .com &#32;domain name shall not exceed $7.85 for the term of the .com &#32;Registry Agreement, except that the we are entitled to increase the Maximum Price of a .com &#32;domain name due to the imposition of any new Consensus Policy or documented extraordinary expense resulting from an attack or threat of attack on the Security or Stability of the DNS as described in the .com &#32;Registry Agreement, provided that we may not exercise such right unless the DOC provides prior written approval that the exercise of such right will serve the public interest, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld. Amendment 32 further provides that we shall be entitled at any time during the term of the . com &#32;Registry Agreement to seek to remove the pricing restrictions contained in the .com &#32;Registry Agreement if we demonstrate to the DOC that market conditions no longer warrant pricing restrictions in the .com &#32;Registry Agreement, as determined by the DOC. Amendment 32 also provides that the DOC&#8217;s approval of the .com &#32;Registry Agreement is not intended to confer federal antitrust immunity on us with respect to the .com &#32;Registry Agreement and extends the term of the Cooperative Agreement through November 30, 2018. The Cooperative Agreement also provides that any renewal or extension of the .com &#32;Registry Agreement is subject to prior written approval by the DOC. Amendment 30 to the Cooperative Agreement provides that the DOC shall approve such renewal if it concludes that approval will serve the public interest in (a) the continued security and stability of the Internet DNS and the operation of the .com &#32;registry including, in addition to other relevant factors, consideration of Verisign&#8217;s compliance with consensus policies and technical specifications, its service level agreements as set forth in the .com &#32;Registry Agreement, and the investment associated with improving the security and stability of the DNS, and (b) the provision of Registry Services as defined in the .com &#32;Registry Agreement at reasonable prices, terms and conditions. The parties have an expectancy of renewal of the .com &#32;Registry Agreement so long as the foregoing public interest standard is met and Verisign is not in breach of the .com &#32;Registry Agreement. 

&#160; 

.net &#32;Registry Agreement: On June 27, 2011, we entered into a renewal of our Registry Agreement with ICANN for the .net gTLD (the &#8220; .net &#32;Registry Agreement&#8221;). The .net &#32;Registry Agreement provides that we will continue to be the sole registry operator for domain names in the .net &#32;TLD through June 30, 2017. The .net &#32;Registry Agreement provides that it shall be renewed unless it has been determined that Verisign has been in fundamental and material breach of certain provisions of the .net &#32;Registry Agreement and has failed to cure such breach. 

&#160; 

The descriptions of the .com &#32;Registry Agreement, Amendment 32, Amendment 30, the Cooperative Agreement, and the .net &#32;Registry Agreement are qualified in their entirety by the text of the complete agreements that are incorporated by reference as exhibits in this Form 10-K. 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We rely on a combination of copyrighted software, trademarks, service marks, patents, trade secrets, know-how, restrictions on disclosure and other methods to protect our proprietary assets. We also enter into confidentiality and/or invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants and current and potential affiliates, customers and business partners. We also generally control access to and distribution of proprietary documentation and other confidential information. 

&#160; 

We have been issued numerous patents in the U.S. and abroad, covering a wide range of our technologies. Additionally, we continue to file numerous patent applications with respect to certain of our technologies in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and internationally. Patents may not be awarded with respect to these applications and even if such patents are awarded, such patents may not provide us with sufficient protection. We continue to focus on growing our patent portfolio and consider opportunities for its strategic use. 

&#160; 

We have obtained trademark registrations for the VERISIGN mark and VERISIGN logo in the U.S. and certain countries, and have pending trademark applications for the VERISIGN logo in a number of other countries. We have common law rights in other proprietary names. We take steps to enforce and police Verisign&#8217;s trademarks. We rely on the strength of our Verisign brand to help differentiate ourselves in the marketing of our products and services. 

&#160; 

Our principal intellectual property consists of, and our success is dependent upon, proprietary software used in our Registry Services businesses and certain methodologies (many of which are patented or for which patent applications are pending) and technical expertise and proprietary know-how we use in both the design and implementation of our current and future registry services and Internet-based products and services businesses. We own our proprietary Shared Registration System through which registrars submit second-level domain name registrations for each of the registries we operate, as well as the ATLAS distributed lookup system which processes billions of queries per day. Some of the software and protocols used in our registry services are in the public domain or are otherwise available to our competitors. Some of the software and protocols used in our business are based on open standards set by organizations such as the Internet Engineering Task Force. To the extent any of our patents are considered &#8220;standard essential patents,&#8221; we may be required to license such patents to our competitors on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms or otherwise be limited in our ability to assert such patents. 

&#160; 

As a result of the sale of our Authentication Services business, Symantec obtained the rights to the domain name and operation of the website www.verisign.com for a period of five years. The five year term expired in August 2015, at which time, the domain name and operation of the website www.verisign.com reverted back to us.

We have never had a work stoppage, and no U.S.-based employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements. Our ability to achieve our financial and operational objectives depends in large part upon our continued ability to attract, integrate, train, retain and motivate highly qualified sales, technical and managerial personnel, and upon the continued service of our senior management and key sales and technical personnel. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry and in some of our geographical locations is intense, particularly for software development personnel.
