Corporate History and Change in Control 

&#160;

The Company was incorporated in the Nevada on August 9, 2011 as Bespoke Tricycles Inc. for the purpose of designing, manufacturing, and selling vending tricycles for commercial customers. On August 10, 2011, the Company purchased all of the issued and outstanding shares of Bespoke Tricycles, Ltd., a company organized under the laws of England and Wales, from John Goodhew, the Company's then sole officer and director, in exchange for shares of our common stock. Also on August 10, 2011, the Company purchased all of the assets from Mr. Goodhew related to its business, including notably a UK patent application for our foldable/collapsible tricycle. Through its then wholly-owned subsidiary, Bespoke Tricycles, Ltd., the Company manufactured vending tricycles.

&#160;

On June 24, 2015, Albert Mitrani purchased an aggregate of 135,000,000 shares of common stock of Bespoke Tricycles, Inc. from John Goodhew, representing approximately 87.8% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company on a fully-diluted basis and constituting a change in control of the Company. The transaction was in accordance with the terms and provisions of the stock purchase agreement, dated May 29, 2015 ("Mitrani Purchase Agreement"), by and among the Company, Mr. Mitrani and Mr. Goodhew. The purchase price for the shares of $40,000 is payable by Mr. Mitrani to Mr. Goodhew on June 24, 2016. In connection with the execution and delivery of the Mitrani Purchase Agreement, as of May 29, 2015, Mr. Goodhew resigned as the sole officer of the Company and appointed Albert Mitrani to the Board of Directors and as the sole officer of the Company. Mr. Goodhew remained on the Board of Directors of the Company.

&#160;

On August 6, 2015, Mr. Mitrani returned 60,120,000 shares of common stock of the Company and the Company cancelled those shares. As a result, Mr. Mitrani's ownership was 74,880,000 shares of common stock of the Company, representing approximately 80% of the 93,600,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding on such date. 

&#160;

On September 1, 2015, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Secretary of State of Nevada therein changing its name to Biotech Products Services and Research, Inc. and increasing the amount of authorized common stock from 90 million (90,000,000) shares to 250 million (250,000,000) shares. The amount authorized "blank check" preferred stock remained 10 million (10,000,000) and the par value of the common stock and preferred stock remained $0.001 per share. 

&#160;

On September 17, 2015, the Company completed an eighteen-for-one (18:1) forward split of the Company's issued and outstanding common stock. Unless otherwise noted, the disclosure in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated audited financial statements contained herein, reflect a retroactive adjustment for the forward stock split. The forward stock split had no effect on the authorized capital stock of the Company. 

&#160;

Discontinued Operations 

&#160;

On October 30, 2015, the Company, entered into a stock purchase agreement (the " Goodhew Purchase Agreement ") with John Goodhew, the Company's former officer and then current director, pursuant to which all of the shares of Bespoke UK were transferred to Mr. Goodhew in consideration for $10. As a result of such sale, the Company ceased its business line of designing, manufacturing, and selling vending tricycles. The Goodhew Purchase Agreement contained customary representations, warranties and covenants for a transaction of this nature. In connection with the Goodhew Purchase Agreement, Mr. Goodhew resigned from the Company's board of directors. 

&#160;

Overview 

&#160;

Since the change in control of our Company in June 2015 and change in the Company's operations in July 2015, we have been engaged in the health care industry, principally focusing on supplying products and services related to the growing field of regenerative anti-aging medicine ("RAAM"). Our goal is to supply state-of-the-art RAAM-related products developed by third parties under exclusive supply arrangements with outside manufacturers and/or from products developed from internally based research and development activities ("RAAM Products"). Additionally, we intend to distribute the RAAM Products and market RAAM-related services through a referral network of doctors and clinics (collectively, the "Providers"). We also intend to develop a network of branded destination domestic and international clinics capable of providing comprehensive and/or longer term RAAM-based therapies and treatments.

&#160;

Since July 2015, our main revenue stream has been generated from patient marketing and product sales to Providers enrolled in our marketing advertising social media services. Our internet-based services draw customers desiring treatment for various neurodegenerative, inflammatory and autoimmune conditions. We market registered cellular products and human allografts used in the disease management for osteoarthritis, ophthalmic and other conditions to Providers, including those enrolled in our marketing program and those who are not.

&#160;

&#160; 4 

&#160; 

&#160;

Currently, our RAAM-related operations are conducted through the following wholly-owned subsidiaries:

&#160;

&#167; Beyond Cells Corp., a Florida corporation formed with a business purpose to provide consumers with access to anti-aging and cellular therapy through marketing campaigns featuring enrolled Providers ("Beyond Cells"); and

&#160; &#167; General Surgical Florida, Inc., a Florida corporation with a business purpose of selling and distributing cellular therapy products to doctors and hospitals ("General Surgical").

&#160;

We also operate two other wholly-owned subsidiaries that are either inactive and/or not related to our RAAM operations:

&#160;

&#167; Ethan New York, Inc., a New York corporation formed with a business purpose of selling clothing and accessories through a retail store in New York City ("Ethan NY"); and

&#160; &#167; BD Source and Distribution, Corp ., a Florida corporation ("BD Source") formed with a business purpose of selling cellular therapy products to doctors and hospitals. 

&#160;

Until October 30, 2015, we also generated revenue from our former wholly-owned subsidiary, Bespoke Tricycles, Ltd., a corporation organized under the laws of England and Wales for the purpose of designing, manufacturing, and selling vending tricycles for commercial customers ("Bespoke"). On October 30, 2015, we sold all of the outstanding equity of Bespoke to John Goodhew, the Company's former officer and then current director. In connection with the transaction, Mr. Goodhew resigned from the Company's board of directors. As a result of the sale of Bespoke, we ceased the business of designing, manufacturing, and selling vending tricycles for commercial customers.

Industry Overview 

&#160;

Health Care Industry Overview: 

&#160;

The traditional health care industry in the United States is predominantly controlled by the rules of the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services (CMS) (wwws.cms.gov) and commercial health insurance companies. This control limits patients access to alternative medical therapies, that recent medical literature demonstrates highly beneficial outcomes in the field of anti-aging and regenerative medicine. Traditional allopathic medicine of health care provided to patients in the United States relies on government and commercial health insurance for payment of the costs associated with their day-to-day health care. Because of this close relationship, physicians must follow government and commercial insurers guidelines in order to stay in the plans and receive reimbursement. Physicians are restricted in their ability to expand the nature of the treatments provided beyond industry practices because of legal ramifications and/or lack of knowledge concerning protocol of cutting edge anti-aging and regenerative medical treatments. 

&#160;

Despite the above, anecdotal and medical literature has shown an increased demand by patients for access to alternative medical therapies and treatments. Patients are seeking these alternatives to traditional allopathic medicine, due to the adverse events associated with traditional pharmaceuticals, risks associated with surgeries, and that traditional medicine and insurers are not addressing wellness or preventive medicine sufficiently. To address a wide variety of aging issues, safe alternatives to pathologies, including access to other treatments and pharmaceuticals and to achieve beneficial "elective" health treatments, we intend utilize the latest regenerative technologies. These alternative pathways to date have had significant restrictions because of regulations imposed by the FDA, other regulatory bodies and insurers due to lack of randomized controlled studies, yet many published case series demonstrate safety and efficacy. Patients and consumers are looking to safe alternatives compared more traditional medicine, including the following:

&#160;

&#183; Identify an alternative business model for Ethan NY.

&#160;

Since the change of control in our Company in June 2015, we have funded our capital needs from the proceeds of sales of equity to "accredited investors" under Section 4(a)(2) and Rule 506(b) under Regulation D of the Securities Act.. 

&#160;

From June 11, 2015 through September 2, 2015, the Company sold an aggregate of 311,200 Units to various third parties. Each Unit cost $1.00 and consisted of two shares of common stock, one Class A Warrant and one Class B Warrant. The Company issued a 622,400 shares of common stock, Class A warrants to purchase 311,200 common shares and Class B warrants to purchase 311,200 common shares. The Class A Warrant and Class B warrant have exercise prices of $0.50 and $1.00, respectively, and have a four year term. 

&#160;

From August 2015 to October 2015, the Company sold 192,857 Units to various investors. Each Unit cost $0.70 and consisted of two shares of common stock, one Class A Warrant and One Class B Warrant. The Company issued 385,714 shares, Class A warrants to purchase 192,857 common shares and Class B warrants to purchase 192,857 common shares. The Class A Warrant and Class B warrant have exercise prices of $0.50 and $1.00, respectively, and have a four year term. 

&#160;

From November 2015 to March 2016, The Company sold an aggregate of 364,685 Units to various investors. Each Unit cost $0.70 and consisted of two shares of common stock, one Class A Warrants and One Class B Warrants. As a result of the above transactions, the Company issued a total of 729,370 shares, Class A warrants to purchase 364,685 common shares and Class B warrants to purchase 364,685 common shares. The Class A Warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of our common stock for $0.50 until the fourth anniversary of the date the warrant was originally issued. The Class B Warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of our common stock for $1.00 until the fourth anniversary of the date the warrant was originally issued.

&#160;

On April 15, 2016, the Company sold 25,000 shares of common stock to a consultant of the Company at $0.20 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $5,000.

&#160;

In addition the sale of equity, the Company has also funded capital needs through proceeds received from the issuance of debt.

&#160;

On November 12, 2015, the Company entered into an unsecured loan agreement with an unaffiliated lender pursuant to which the Company received proceeds of $15,000. The loan bears interest at 8% per annum compounded annually and is due one year after the date of issuance. 

&#160;

On December 24, 2015, the Company entered into an unsecured loan agreement with an unaffiliated lender pursuant to which the Company received proceeds of $50,000. The loan bears interest at 8% per annum compounded annually and is due one year after the date of issuance. 

&#160;

&#160; 7 

&#160; 

&#160;

On April 27, 2016, the Company entered into an unsecured loan agreement with a consultant of the Company pursuant to which the Company received proceeds of $35,000. The payoff amount of the loan is $42,000 and was due on May 31, 2016. The consultant has not made any demand against the Company for repayment of the loan.

&#160;

Since we commenced our RAAM operations in July 2015, we have incurred net operating losses, primarily due to reduced revenues from our inability to fund the necessary costs required for maintaining minimum marketing levels for our business and increased general and administrative costs. In addition, there is not sufficient working capital to pursue growth opportunities, increase sales personnel and for research and development. In their report for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015 and included in this Annual Report, our auditors have expressed their doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. We incurred a net loss of $738,354 for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015. In addition, we had a working capital deficiency of $13,555 and stockholders' deficit of $860,410 at October 31, 2015. We currently do not have sufficient capital to expand our operations. Our current available funds combined with revenues will not fund our activities for the next twelve months. We believe that we will need to raise additional capital to fund our current expenses and execute our business plan over the next twelve months. There can be no assurance that additional capital will be available to us or available on terms favorable to us. If adequate funds are not available or not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund our operations and develop our business.

&#160;

Recent Developments 

&#160;

As previously disclosed in a Form 8-K filed on March 21, 2016, on February 23, 2016, our Distribution Agreement, dated August 11, 2015, between Amnio Technology, LLC ("Amnio Technology") and our wholly-owned subsidiary, BD Source, was terminated by Amnio Technology. Pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, Amnio Technology had engaged BD Source pursuant to the Distribution Agreement in connection with the marketing, sales and distribution of certain of Amnio Technology's products. Amnio Technology is engaged in the business of human tissue procurement, processing and distribution to customers and third party distributors. Amnio Technology terminated the Distribution Agreement due to BD Source's non-payment of the outstanding balance of $4,815 under the Distribution Agreement. BD Source has since paid such balance and believes that all obligations owed to Amnio Technology have been satisfied.

&#160;

Services and Products 

&#160;

Currently, we distribute RAAM-related products ( i.e., placental-based products) used to treat a variety of musculoskeletal conditions. We purchase these products from third party tissue banks and resell them directly to Providers within our network. 

&#160;

Our main revenue stream is generated from patient referral and product sales through our BD Source and Distribution Corp. and Beyond Cells Corp. subsidiaries. We also generated revenue from our Bespoke Tricycles, Ltd. subsidiary through October 30, 2015, the date that those operations were discontinued. As of October 31, 2015, we did not generate any revenue from our Ethan NY subsidiary. To date, Ethan NY has not generated sufficient reveues to meet its direct operating costs. 

&#160;

Since February 2016, we also commenced buying and reselling homeopathic products and cosmetic anti-aging creams directly to consumers and the Providers. 

&#160;

Upon identifying suitable partners and/or funding resources, we intend to commence research and development activities to develop topical medications, skin and hair products, injectable and intravenous placental-based products, intramuscular approved products that are novel and are FDA cleared technologies and to also develop an accredited tissue bank for a multitude of tissue-based products. We also intend to develop a network of branded destination domestic and international clinics capable of providing comprehensive and/or longer term RAAM-based therapies and treatments.

Market Overview 

&#160;

The population of the United States and the developed world is getting older and living longer. According to a United States Consensus Bureau's report, "An Aging World: 2015," America's 65-and-over population is projected to nearly double over the next three decades, ballooning from 48 million to 88 million by 2050 and that worldwide, the 65-and-over population will more than double to 1.6 billion by 2050. According to the report, in 2015, 14.9 percent of the U.S. population was 65 or over and the United States was the 48th oldest country out of 228 countries and areas in the world in 2015. Baby boomers began reaching age 65 in 2011 and by 2050 the older share of the U.S. population will increase to 22.1 percent. 

&#160;

The world average age of death has increased by 35 years since 1970, with declines in death rates in all age groups, including those aged 60 and older (Source: Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, 2013; Mathers et al., 2015). The leading causes of death are shifting, in part because of increasing longevity. Between 1990 and 2013, the number of deaths from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) has increased by 42 percent; and the largest increases in the proportion of global deaths took place among the population aged 80 and over. An estimated 42.8 percent of deaths worldwide occur in the population aged 70 and over, with 22.9 percent in the population aged 80 and over. 

&#160;

Also, according to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), "Medical Tourism" (a term commonly used to describe people traveling outside their home country for medical treatment) is a worldwide, multibillion-dollar phenomenon that is expected to grow substantially in the next 5&#8211;10 years. Studies have estimated that hundreds of thousands of medical tourists travel from the United States annually and that patients pursue medical care abroad for a variety of reasons, including a desire to receive a procedure or therapy not available in their country of residence. Common categories of procedures that US travelers pursue during medical tourism trips include orthopedic surgery, cosmetic surgery, cardiology (cardiac surgery), oncologic care, and dentistry. Common destinations include Thailand, Mexico, Singapore, India, Malaysia, Cuba, Brazil, Argentina, and Costa Rica. 

&#160;

If we are able to implement our intended business plan, we believe that we will be well situated to address this increased consumer demand for alternative medical treatments. 

&#160;

Marketing and Sales 

&#160;

We have a network of Providers to whom we market our services. As of October 31, 2015, we had five sales people who marketed our products and services by using social media and through our professional relationships. Since October 31, 2015, our sales force was reduced due to cash flow constraints. Recently we have once again increased our sales force to five sales people. We intend to engage a direct representative sales force, expand our social media presence and attend medical conferences and seminars. We also intend to develop and offer our own training seminars to provide the best possible information on the latest advances on anti-aging, and regenerative medicine. 

&#160;

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials and the Names of Principal Suppliers 

&#160;

Currently, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, General Surgical, we purchase placental-related products from unaffiliated third-party laboratories pursuant to purchase orders or distribution agreements ("Supply Arrangements"). The Supply Arrangements are non-exclusive, do not obligate us to purchase minimum volumes and contain customary product pricing and payment terms. We are not dependent on any one supplier. In the event any one or more of our current suppliers are unwilling or unable to sell us products, we believe that we will be able to purchase similar products from other suppliers with minimal, if any, interruption to our business operations. 

&#160;

Dependence on One or a Few Major Customers 

&#160;

Our business is not dependent on any one or more customers. We expect that our customer and consumers will be broad based, worldwide based on our use of web based social media marketing.

&#160;

&#160; 9 

&#160; 

&#160;

Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises, Concessions, Royalty Agreements or Labor Contracts 

&#160;

We do not currently own any patents or trademarks nor are we a party to any licenses, franchises, concessions, royalty agreements or labor contracts.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The regenerative medicine field is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change and regulation. Companies compete on the basis of product efficacy, pricing, and ease of handling/logistics. A critically important factor for growth in the US market is third-party reimbursement, which is difficult to obtain, it can be time-consuming and expensive. We expect that it will take some time to get health insurance coverage, we intend to work towards a biologics license status from FDA to accelerate our acceptance in traditional insurance plans. Initially we are positioning ourselves as a cash based health care alternative for consumers. Offering higher levels of improvement, that is not available from traditional allopathic medicine at this time.

&#160;

The Company competes in multiple areas of clinical treatment where regenerative biomaterials may be employed to modulate inflammation, enhance healing and reduce scar tissue formation: advanced wound care treatment, spine, orthopedic, surgery and sports medicine. 

&#160;

The primary competitive products in this space include other amniotic membrane allografts, tissue-engineered living skin equivalents, and porcine- or bovine-derived collagen matrix products, cadaveric engineered bone grafts, tendon and fascial grafts among others. Our competitors include MiMedix Group, Inc., Organogenesis Inc., TissueTech (Amniox), Osiris, and BioD (dermaSciences). Additionally, there are a variety of accredited bone and soft tissue banks most notably MFT that we will be competing against, but the demand is very high and expected to grow with the growing baby boomer generation getting older.

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160;

In connection with the Company's intention to pursue research and development of RAAM-products, the Company will be subject to FDA regulations. We anticipate these regulations will be changed by the FDA in September 2016, and we intend to develop products expected to satisfy more restrictive regulations. A summary of the current FDA regulations is set forth below: 

&#160;

FDA Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements 

&#160;

Tissue Products 

&#160;

The products that will be manufactured and processed by the Company are derived from human tissue. As discussed below, some tissue-based products are regulated solely under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act as human cells, tissues and cellular and tissue-based products, or HCT/Ps, which do not require premarket clearance or approval by the FDA. Other tissue products are regulated as biologics and, in order to be lawfully marketed in the United States, require an FDA-approved biologics application (BLA).

&#160;

Though for some of our products this will be changing as the FDA is formulating new guidelines for this industry. Draft guidelines have been published, but the public outcry has been expansive, and the FDA has rescheduled public comment to a larger venue in September 2016.

&#160;

Products Regulated as HCT/Ps 

&#160;

The FDA has specific regulations governing human cells, tissues and cellular and tissue-based products, or HCT/Ps. An HCT/P is a product containing or consisting of human cells or tissue intended for transplantation into a human patient. HCT/Ps that meet the criteria for regulation solely under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act (so-called "361 HCT/Ps") are not subject to approval requirements and they are subject to post-market regulatory requirements.

&#160;

&#160; 10 

&#160; 

&#160;

To be a 361 HCT/P, a product generally should meet following criteria:

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Be minimally manipulated, no structural change, or be mixed with anything ;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Be intended for homologous use, essentially used for the same purpose that it was used in the donor;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Its manufacture must not involve combination with another article, except for water, crystalloids or a sterilizing, preserving or storage agent; and

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

It must not be dependent upon the metabolic activity of living cells for its primary function.

&#160;

Products Regulated as Biologics- The Biologics License Application (BLA) Pathway 

&#160;

The typical steps for obtaining FDA approval of a BLA to market a biologic product in the U.S. include: 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulations studies under the FDA's good laboratory practices regulations;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and which must include independent Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval at each clinical site before the trials may be initiated;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in accordance with Good Clinical Practices to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each indication;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application for marketing the product, which includes, among other things, reports of the outcomes and full data sets of the clinical trials, and proposed labeling and packaging for the product;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) regulations,

&#160;

Generally, clinical trials are conducted in three phases:

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase I trials typically involve a small number of healthy volunteers and are designed to provide information about the product safety.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase II trials are conducted in a larger but limited group of patients afflicted with a specific diagnosis in order to determine preliminary efficacy, and to identify possible adverse effects.

&#160; 

o Dosage studies are designated as Phase IIA and efficacy studies are designated as Phase IIB.

&#160;

&#160; 11 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase III clinical trials are generally large-scale, multi-center, comparative trials conducted with patients who have a specific condition in order to provide statistically valid proof of efficacy, as well as safety and potency.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

In some cases, the FDA will require Phase IV, or post-marketing trials, to collect additional data after a product is on the market.

&#160;

The process of obtaining an approved BLA requires the expenditure of substantial time, effort and financial resources and may take years to complete.

&#160;

FDA Post-Market Regulation 

&#160;

Tissue processors are required to register as an establishment with the FDA. We intend on becoming a registered establishment, and be accredited by the AATB (American Association of Tissue Banks). Once we are registered we will be required to comply with regulations regarding labeling, record keeping, donor eligibility, and screening and testing, process the tissue in accordance with established Good Tissue Practices, and report any adverse reactions attributed to our tissue. Our facilities will be subject to periodic inspections to assess our compliance with the regulations.

&#160;

Products covered by a BLA, 510(k) clearance, or a PMA are subject to numerous additional regulatory requirements, which include, among others, compliance with cGMP, which imposes certain procedural, substantive and record keeping requirements, labeling regulations, the FDA's general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or "off-label" uses, and additional adverse event reporting.

&#160;

Other Regulation Specific to Tissue Products 

&#160;

The American Association of Tissue Banks (AATB), has issued operating standards for tissue banking. Compliance with these standards is a requirement in order to become licensed, tissue bank. 

&#160;

Fraud, Abuse and False Claims 

&#160;

We are directly and indirectly subject to various federal and state laws governing relationships with healthcare providers and pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws. In particular, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for or recommending a good or service for which payment may be made in whole or part under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. (See 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1320a-7b). Penalties for violations include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. In implementing the statute, the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ("OIG") has issued a series of regulations, known as the "safe harbors." These safe harbors set forth provisions that, if all their applicable requirements are met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the Anti-Kickback Statute. 

&#160;

AdvaMed has established guidelines and protocols for medical device manufacturers in their relationships with healthcare professionals on matters including research and development, product training and education, grants and charitable contributions, support of third-party educational conferences, and consulting arrangements. Adoption of the AdvaMed Code by a medical device manufacturer is voluntary, and while the OIG and other federal and state healthcare regulatory agencies encourage its adoption and may look to the AdvaMed Code, they do not view adoption of the AdvaMed Code as proof of compliance with applicable laws. We have incorporated the principles of the AdvaMed Code in our standard operating procedures, sales force training programs, and relationships with health care professionals.

Manufacturing (Processing) 

&#160;

Our strategy intends to develop appropriate laboratories (tissue bank) in the United States southeast. We intend to seek AATB accreditation. We also intend to be registered with the FDA as a tissue establishment and are subject to the FDA's quality system regulations, state regulations, and regulations promulgated by the European Union. Once built, our facilities more likely than not expect to be subject to periodic unannounced inspections by regulatory authorities, and may undergo compliance inspections conducted by the FDA and corresponding state and foreign agencies.

&#160;

Placental Donation Program 

&#160;

We expect to develop a comprehensive network of hospitals that participate in our placenta donation program, including a dedicated staff that works at these hospitals, collecting donated placentas from mothers who undergo Cesarean section births and consent to donation. We believe and expect to be able to procure an adequate supply of tissue to meet anticipated demand. 

&#160;

Research and Development Activities 

&#160;

We have not spent any money on research and development activities during the fiscal years ended October 31, 2015 and 2014. We do not expect to spend any money on research and development until we obtain sufficient working capital. Upon obtaining sufficient working capital, we expect that we will dedicate most of our available cash resourcs towards our funding on Research and development activities in order to build out our laboratories, tissue bank and produce our products over the next 12-18 months.

&#160;

Environmental Laws 

&#160;

The chemical and biomedical wastes that will be generated by our tissue processing operations will be placed in appropriately constructed and labeled containers and are segregated from other wastes. We plan on contracting with third parties for transport, treatment, and disposal of waste. We plan on being compliant with applicable laws and regulations promulgated by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and similar state agencies.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

We have one full-time employee, Mr. Albert Mitrani, our President and Chief Executive Officer. We also engage one consultant on a full-time basis and six consultants on a part-time basis, one for administration services and five for sales. The Company currently plans to hire two to three full-time employees by quarter ended July 31, 2016, whose principal responsibilities will be as sales representatives. We also engage an outside consultant for accounting and bookkeeping services. There are no collective bargaining agreements. 

&#160;

Dividend Policy 

&#160;

We have never paid or declared dividends on our securities. The payment of cash dividends, if any, in the future is within the discretion of our Board and will depend upon our earnings, our capital requirements, financial condition and other relevant factors. We do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future, and intend to retain future earnings, if any, towards the use in our business and growth strategies.
