BUSINESS 

Overview 

From our California Gold Rush beginnings, we have grown into one of the world's largest brand-name apparel companies. A history of responsible business practices, rooted in our core values, has helped us build our brands and engender consumer trust around the world. Under our Levi's &#174; , Dockers &#174; , Signature by Levi Strauss &#38; Co.&#8482; and Denizen &#174; &#32; brands, we design, market and sell &#8211; directly or through third parties and licensees &#8211; products that include jeans, casual and dress pants, tops, shorts, skirts, jackets, footwear, and related accessories for men, women and children around the world. 

An Authentic American Icon 

Our Levi's &#174; &#32;brand has become one of the most widely recognized brands in the history of the apparel industry. Its broad distribution reflects the brand's appeal across consumers of all ages and lifestyles. Its merchandising and marketing reflect the brand's core attributes: authentic, courageous, confident, effortless, connected and purposeful. 

Our Dockers &#174; &#32;brand offers an alternative to suit dressing in the form of the American staple &#8211; the khaki pant. The Dockers &#174; &#32;brand has evolved around the world as a market leader in the casual pant category, while also providing tops and accessories to complete a head-to-toe offering. 

Our Global Reach 

Our products are sold in more than 110 &#32;countries, grouped into three geographic regions: Americas, Europe and Asia. We support our brands throughout these regions through a global infrastructure, developing, sourcing and marketing our products around the world. Although our brands are recognized as authentically &#8220;American,&#8221; we derive approximately half of our net revenues from outside the United States. A summary of financial information for each geographical region, which comprise our three reporting segments, is found in Note 20 &#32;to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this report. As a global company with sales and operations in foreign countries, we are subject to risks of doing business in foreign countries. See &#8220;Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors&#8221;, specifically &#8220;Risks Relating to Our Industry &#8211; Our business is subject to risks associated with sourcing and manufacturing overseas &#8221; and &#8220;Risks Relating to Our Business &#8211; We are a global company with significant revenues and earnings generated internationally, which exposes us to political and economic risks as well as the impact of foreign currency fluctuations &#8221;. 

Our products are sold in approximately 50,000 &#32;retail locations worldwide, including approximately 2,800 &#32;retail stores, both franchised and company-operated, and shop-in-shops dedicated to our brands. We distribute our Levi's &#174; &#32;and Dockers &#174; &#32;products primarily through chain retailers and department stores in the United States and primarily through department stores, specialty retailers, franchised or other brand-dedicated stores and shop-in-shops outside of the United States. Levi's &#174; &#32;and Dockers &#174; &#32;products are also sold through our brand-dedicated company-operated retail stores and through the ecommerce sites we operate, as well as the ecommerce sites operated by certain of our key wholesale customers and other third parties. We distribute Signature by Levi Strauss &#38; Co.&#8482; and Denizen &#174; &#32;brand products primarily through mass channel retailers in the Americas.

Our Business Strategies 

Our goal is to generate and sustain profitable growth over the long term in order to significantly improve the value of the enterprise. The management team is focused on four key strategies to achieve this goal: 

&#8226; 

Drive the profitable core businesses . Our core businesses represent the greatest value on a brand, geographic, customer or business-segment basis. These include our men's bottoms business for the Levi's &#174; &#32;brand globally and the Dockers &#174; &#32;brand in the United States, including our iconic 501 &#174; &#32;jean and Dockers &#174; &#32;khaki pant. We also consider our key international markets of France, Germany, Mexico and the United Kingdom, as well as key wholesale accounts globally, to be vital elements of our long-term growth strategies. We manage collaborative relationships with these wholesale accounts to focus on customer support, marketing planning, and inventory levels, in order to achieve mutual commercial success. 

&#8226; 

Expand the reach of our brands and build a more balanced portfolio. We believe we have opportunities to grow our two largest brands through new or expanded product categories, consumer segments and geographic markets. We are building upon our iconic brands, including our innovative design and marketing expertise, to deepen our connection with consumers and expand the reach and appeal of our brands globally. For example, we believe we can better serve the female consumer, and that there are significant opportunities in tops, outerwear and accessories. We also believe opportunities remain to expand in emerging and underpenetrated geographic markets, including China, India, Russia and Brazil. 

&#8226; 

Become a world-class omni-channel retailer . We will continue to expand our consumer reach in brand-dedicated stores globally, including making selective investments in additional company-operated stores, dedicated ecommerce sites, franchisee and other dedicated store models. We believe these brand-dedicated stores represent an attractive opportunity to establish incremental distribution and sales, as well as to showcase the full breadth of our product offerings and deliver a consistent brand experience to the consumer. 

&#8226; 

Improve our cost structure to achieve operational excellence . We are focused on operational excellence to improve our long-term profitable growth, including stabilizing the work we have outsourced while delivering the anticipated financial savings, reducing our controllable cost structure and driving efficiencies by streamlining our product development, planning, and go-to-market strategies, implementing efficiencies across retail, supply chain and distribution networks and continuing to pursue practices that result in greater cost efficiencies. We will continue to balance our pursuit of improved organizational agility and marketplace responsiveness with our ongoing cost management efforts to improve the structural economics of the company. 

Our Brands and Products 

We offer a broad range of products, including jeans, casual and dress pants, tops, shorts, skirts, jackets, footwear and related accessories.

Since their inception in 1873, Levi's &#174; &#32;jeans have become one of the most recognizable garments in the world &#8211; reflecting the aspirations and earning the loyalty of people for generations.

The Levi's &#174; &#32;brand continues to evolve to meet the tastes of today's consumers, driven by its distinctive pioneering and innovative spirit. Our range of leading jeanswear and accessories for men, women and children is available in more than 110 &#32;countries, allowing individuals around the world to express their personal style. 

The Levi's &#174; &#32;brand encompasses a range of products.

The line includes the iconic 501 &#174; &#32;jean, the original and best-selling five-pocket jean of all time. The line also incorporates a full range of jeanswear fits and styles designed specifically for women.

Dockers &#174; &#32;Brand 

Founded in 1986, the Dockers &#174; &#32;brand sparked a revolution in the way millions of men dressed around the world, shifting from the standard issue suit to a more casual look. 30 years later, the Dockers &#174; &#32;brand continues to embody the spirit of khakis and define business casual. Since its introduction, the brand has focused on men's khakis and the essential goods to go with them. 

Our Dockers &#174; &#32;brand products accounted for approximately 10%, 11% and 12% of our total net sales in fiscal years 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. Although the substantial majority of these net sales were in the Americas region, Dockers &#174; &#32;brand products are sold in more than 50 countries. 

Signature by Levi Strauss &#38; Co.&#8482; Brand and Denizen &#174; &#32;Brand 

In addition to our Levi's &#174; &#32;and Dockers &#174; &#32;brands, we offer two brands focused on consumers who seek high-quality and fashionable jeanswear at a value price. We offer denim jeans, casual pants, tops and jackets in a variety of fits, fabrics and finishes for men, women and kids under the Signature by Levi Strauss &#38; Co.&#8482; brand through the mass retail channel in the United States and Canada. The Denizen &#174; &#32;brand was introduced in Target stores in the United States starting in 2011, and includes a variety of jeans to complement active lifestyles and to empower consumers to express their aspirations, individuality and attitudes at a value price point. 

Signature by Levi Strauss &#38; Co.&#8482; &#32; brand and Denizen &#174; &#32;brand products accounted for approximately 5% of our total net sales in fiscal year 2015 , and 4% of our total net sales in each of fiscal years 2014 &#32;and 2013 . 

Licensing 

The appeal of our brands across consumer groups and our global reach enable us to license our Levi's &#174; &#32;and Dockers &#174; &#32;trademarks for a variety of product categories in multiple markets in each of our regions, including footwear, belts, wallets and bags, outerwear, sweaters, dress shirts, kidswear, sleepwear and hosiery. We also license our Signature by Levi Strauss &#38; Co.&#8482; and our Denizen &#174; &#32;trademarks in various markets for certain product categories. 

In addition to product category licenses, we enter into regional license agreements with third parties to produce, market and distribute our products in several countries around the world, including various Latin American, Middle Eastern and Asia Pacific countries. Licensing accounted for approximately 2% of our total net revenues in each of fiscal years 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 . 

We enter into licensing agreements with our licensees covering royalty payments, product design and manufacturing standards, marketing and sale of licensed products, and protection of our trademarks. We require our licensees to comply with our code of conduct for contract manufacturing and engage independent monitors to perform regular on-site inspections and assessments of production facilities. 

Sales, Distribution and Customers 

We distribute our products through a wide variety of retail formats around the world, including chain and department stores, franchise stores and shop-in-shops dedicated to our brands, our own company-operated retail network, multi-brand specialty stores, mass channel retailers, and both company-operated and retailer ecommerce sites. 

Multi-brand Retailers 

We seek to make our products available where consumers shop, including offering products and related assortments that are appropriately tailored for our wholesale customers and their retail consumers. Our products are also sold through authorized third-party ecommerce sites. Sales to our top ten wholesale customers accounted for approximately 31% &#32;of our total net revenues in each of fiscal years 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 . No customer represented 10% or more of net revenues in any of these years. The loss of any major wholesale customer could have a material adverse effect on one or more of our segments or on the company as a whole. 

Dedicated Stores 

We believe retail stores dedicated to our brands are important for the growth, visibility, availability and commercial success of our brands, and they are an increasingly important part of our strategy for expanding distribution of our products. Our brand-dedicated stores are either operated by us or by independent third parties such as franchisees. In addition to the dedicated stores, we maintain brand-dedicated ecommerce sites that sell products directly to consumers. 

Company-operated retail stores . Our company-operated ecommerce sites and retail stores, including both mainline and outlet stores, generated approximately 26% , 25% &#32;and 22% of our net revenues in fiscal 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. As of November 29, 2015 , we had 656 &#32;company-operated stores, predominantly Levi's &#174; &#32;stores, located in 31 &#32;countries across our three regions. We had 228 &#32;stores in the Americas, 249 &#32;stores in Europe and 179 &#32;stores in Asia. During 2015 , we added 124 &#32;company-operated stores and closed 33 &#32;stores. 

Franchised and other stores . Franchised, licensed, or other forms of brand-dedicated stores operated by independent third parties sell Levi's &#174; &#32;and Dockers &#174; &#32;products in markets outside the United States. There were approximately 1,200 &#32;of these stores as of November 29, 2015 , and they are a key element of our international distribution. In addition to these stores, we consider our network of dedicated shop-in-shops, which are located within department stores and may be either operated directly by us or third parties, to be an important component of our retail distribution in international markets. Outside of the United States, approximately 400 &#32;dedicated shop-in-shops were operated directly by us and approximately 500 &#32;were operated by third parties as of November 29, 2015 . 

Seasonality of Sales 

We typically achieve our largest quarterly revenues in the fourth quarter, reflecting the &#8220;holiday&#8221; season. In fiscal 2015 , our net revenues in the first, second, third and fourth quarters represented 23%, 23% 25% and 29%, respectively, of our total net revenues for the year. In fiscal 2014, our net revenues in the first, second, third and fourth quarters represented 24%, 23%, 24% and 29%, respectively, of our total net revenues for the year. 

Our fiscal year ends on the last Sunday of November in each year, although the fiscal years of certain foreign subsidiaries end on November 30. Fiscal 2015 &#32;and 2013 &#32;were 52-week years, ending on November 29, 2015 , and November 24, 2013 &#32;respectively. Fiscal 2014 &#32;was a 53-week year ending on November 30, 2014 . Each quarter of fiscal years 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;consisted of 13 weeks, with the exception of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, which consisted of 14 weeks. 

Marketing and Promotion 

Our marketing is rooted in globally consistent brand messages that reflect the unique attributes of our brands, including the Levi's &#174; &#32;brand as the authentic and original jeanswear brand and the Dockers &#174; &#32;brand as the definitive khaki. We support our brands with a diverse mix of marketing initiatives to drive consumer demand, such as through social media and digital and mobile outlets, sponsorships, product placement in leading fashion magazines and with celebrities, television and radio advertisements, personal sponsorships and endorsements, on-the-ground efforts such as street-level events and similar targeted &#8220;viral&#8221; marketing activities. 

We also use our websites, www.levi.com , www.dockers.com , www.levistrausssignature.com , and www.denizen.com , in relevant markets to enhance consumer understanding of our brands and help consumers find and buy our products. 

Sourcing and Logistics 

Organization . Our global sourcing and logistics organizations are responsible for taking a product from the design concept stage through production to delivery to our customers. Our objective is to leverage our global scale to achieve product development and sourcing efficiencies and reduce total product and distribution costs while maintaining our focus on product quality, local service levels and working capital management. 

Product procurement . We source nearly all of our products through independent contract manufacturers. The remainder are sourced from our company-operated manufacturing and finishing plants. See &#8220;Item 2 &#8211; Properties&#8221; for more information about those manufacturing facilities. 

Sources and availability of raw materials . The principal fabrics used in our products include cotton, blends, synthetics and wools. The prices we pay our suppliers for our products are dependent in part on the market price for raw materials used to produce them, primarily cotton. The price and availability of cotton may fluctuate substantially, depending on a variety of factors. The price fluctuations impact the cost of our products in future seasons due to the lead time of our product development cycle. Fluctuations in product costs can cause a decrease in our profitability if product pricing actions taken in response are insufficient or if those actions cause our wholesale customers or retail consumers to reduce the volumes they purchase. 

Sourcing locations . We use numerous independent contract manufacturers located throughout the world for the production and finishing of our garments. We conduct assessments of political, social, economic, trade, labor and intellectual property protection conditions in the countries in which we source our products before placing production in those countries and on an ongoing basis. 

In 2015 , we sourced products from contractors located in approximately 30 countries around the world. We sourced products in North and South Asia, South and Central America (including Mexico and the Caribbean), Europe and Africa. No single country accounted for more than 20% of our sourcing in 2015 . 

Sourcing practices . Our sourcing practices include these elements: 

&#8226; 

We require all third-party contractors and subcontractors who manufacture or finish products for us to comply with our code of conduct relating to supplier working conditions as well as environmental, employment and sourcing practices. We also require our licensees to ensure that their manufacturers comply with our requirements. 

&#8226; 

Our code of conduct covers employment practices such as wages and benefits, working hours, health and safety, working age and discriminatory practices, environmental matters such as wastewater treatment and solid waste disposal, and ethical and legal conduct. 

&#8226; 

We regularly assess manufacturing and finishing facilities through periodic on-site facility inspections and improvement activities, including use of independent monitors to supplement our internal staff. We integrate review and performance results into our sourcing decisions. 

We disclose the names and locations of our contract manufacturers to encourage collaboration among apparel companies in factory monitoring and improvement. We regularly evaluate and refine our code of conduct processes. 

Logistics . We operate dedicated distribution centers in a number of countries. For more information, see &#8220;Item 2 &#8211; Properties.&#8221; Distribution center activities include receiving finished goods from our contractors and plants, inspecting those products, preparing them for retail presentation, and shipping them to our customers and to our own stores. Our distribution centers maintain a combination of replenishment and seasonal inventory. In certain locations around the globe, we have consolidated our distribution centers to service multiple countries. In addition, we outsource some of our logistics activities to third-party logistics providers. 

Competition 

The global apparel industry is highly competitive and fragmented. It is characterized by low barriers to entry, brands targeted at specific consumer segments, many regional and local competitors, and an increasing number of global competitors. Principal competitive factors include: 

&#8226; 

anticipating and responding to changing consumer demands and apparel trends in a timely manner; 

&#8226; 

developing high-quality, innovative products with relevant designs, fits, finishes, fabrics, style and performance features that meet consumer desires; 

&#8226; 

maintaining favorable and strong brand name recognition and appeal through strong and effective best-in-class marketing support and intelligence in diverse market segments; 

&#8226; 

securing desirable retail locations and presenting products effectively at company-operated retail and franchised and other brand-dedicated stores; 

&#8226; 

ensuring product availability at wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels, and at franchised and other brand-dedicated stores; 

&#8226; 

optimizing supply chain cost efficiencies and product development cycle lead times; 

&#8226; 

delivering compelling value for the price of our products in diverse market segments; and 

&#8226; 

generating competitive economics for wholesale customers, including retailers, franchisees, and distributors. 

We face competition from a broad range of competitors at the global, regional and local levels in diverse channels across a wide range of retail price points, and some of our competitors are larger and have more resources than we do in the markets in which we operate. Our primary competitors include vertically integrated specialty stores, jeanswear brands, khakiwear brands, athletic wear companies, retailers' private or exclusive labels, and certain ecommerce sites. For more information on the factors affecting our competitive position, see &#8220;Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors.&#8221; 

Trademarks 

We have more than 5,000 trademark registrations and pending applications in approximately 180 jurisdictions worldwide, and we acquire rights in new trademarks according to business needs. Substantially all of our global trademarks are owned by Levi Strauss &#38; Co., the parent and U.S. operating company. We regard our trademarks as our most valuable assets and believe they have substantial value in the marketing of our products. The Levi's &#174; , Dockers &#174; &#32;and 501 &#174; &#32;trademarks, the Arcuate Stitching Design, the Tab Device, the Two Horse &#174; &#32;Design, the Housemark and the Wings and Anchor Design &#32; are among our core trademarks. 

We protect these trademarks by registering them with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and with governmental agencies in other countries, particularly where our products are manufactured or sold. We work vigorously to enforce and protect our trademark rights by engaging in regular market reviews, helping local law enforcement authorities detect and prosecute counterfeiters, issuing cease-and-desist letters against third parties infringing or denigrating our trademarks, opposing registration of infringing trademarks, and initiating litigation as necessary. We currently are pursuing approximately 400 infringement matters around the world. We also work with trade groups and industry participants seeking to strengthen laws relating to the protection of intellectual property rights in markets around the world. 

Employees 

As of November 29, 2015 , we employed approximately 12,500 people, approximately 5,700 of whom were located in the Americas, 3,700 in Europe, and 3,100 in Asia. Approximately 1,900 of our employees were associated with the manufacturing and procurement of our products, 5,900 worked in retail, including seasonal employees, 1,300 worked in distribution and 3,400 were other non-production employees. 

History and Corporate Citizenship 

Our history and longevity are unique in the apparel industry. Our commitment to quality, innovation and corporate citizenship began with our founder, Levi Strauss, who infused the business with the principle of responsible commercial success that has been embedded in our business practices throughout our more than 160-year history. This mixture of history, quality, innovation and corporate citizenship contributes to the iconic reputations of our brands. 

In 1853, during the California Gold Rush, Mr. Strauss opened a wholesale dry goods business in San Francisco that became known as &#8220;Levi Strauss &#38; Co.&#8221; Seeing a need for work pants that could hold up under rough conditions, he and Jacob Davis, a tailor, created the first jean. In 1873, they received a U.S. patent for &#8220;waist overalls&#8221; with metal rivets at points of strain. The first product line designated by the lot number &#8220;501&#8221; was created in 1890. 

In the 19 th &#32;and early 20 th &#32;centuries, our work pants were worn primarily by cowboys, miners and other working men in the western United States. Then, in 1934, we introduced our first jeans for women, and after World War II, our jeans began to appeal to a wider market. By the 1960s, they had become a symbol of American culture, representing a unique blend of history and youth. We opened our export and international businesses in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1986, we introduced the Dockers &#174; &#32;brand of casual apparel which revolutionized the concept of business casual. 

Throughout this long history, we have upheld our strong belief that we can help shape society through civic engagement and community involvement, responsible labor and workplace practices, philanthropy, ethical conduct, environmental stewardship and transparency. We have engaged in a &#8220;profits through principles&#8221; business approach from the earliest years of the business. Among our milestone initiatives over the years, we integrated our factories two decades prior to the U.S. civil rights movement and federally mandated desegregation, we developed a comprehensive supplier code of conduct requiring safe and healthy working conditions among our suppliers (a first of its kind for a multinational apparel company), and we offered full medical benefits to domestic partners of employees prior to other companies of our size, a practice that is widely accepted today.
