 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 

General 

Portland General Electric Company (PGE or the Company), a vertically integrated electric utility with corporate headquarters located in Portland, Oregon, is engaged in the generation, wholesale purchase, transmission, distribution, and retail sale of electricity in the state of Oregon. The Company operates as a cost-based, regulated electric utility, with revenue requirements and customer prices determined based on the forecasted cost to serve retail customers, and a reasonable rate of return as determined by the Public Utility Commission of Oregon (OPUC). As PGE is a net short utility, its retail load requirement is met with both Company-owned generation and power purchased in the wholesale market. The Company participates in the wholesale market by purchasing and selling electricity and natural gas in an effort to obtain reasonably-priced power for its retail customers. PGE was incorporated in 1930, is publicly-owned, with its common stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and operates as a single segment, with revenues and costs related to its business activities maintained and analyzed on a total electric operations basis. 

PGE&#8217;s state-approved service area allocation of approximately 4,000 &#32;square miles is located entirely within Oregon and includes 52 incorporated cities, of which Portland and Salem are the largest. The Company estimates that at the end of 2015 &#32;its service area population was 1.8 million , comprising approximately 46% &#32;of the population of the state of Oregon. During 2015 , the Company added nearly ten thousand &#32;customers and as of December 31, 2015 , served a total of 852,164 &#32;retail customers. 

PGE had 2,646 &#32;employees as of December 31, 2015 , with 764 &#32;employees covered under one of two separate agreements with Local Union No. 125 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. Such agreements cover 713 &#32;and 51 &#32;employees and expire at the end of February 2016 (the Company is currently in negotiation to renew or extend), and August 2017, respectively.

Information may also be obtained via the SEC website at sec.gov . 

Regulation 

PGE is subject to federal and state of Oregon regulation, both of which can have a significant impact on the operations of the Company. In addition to those agencies and activities discussed below, the Company is subject to regulation by certain environmental agencies, as described in the Environmental Matters section in this Item 1. 

Federal Regulation 

Several federal agencies, including the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the U.S. Department of Transportation&#8217;s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) have regulatory authority over certain of PGE&#8217;s operations and activities. 

FERC Regulation 

PGE is a &#8220;licensee,&#8221; a &#8220;public utility,&#8221; and a &#8220;user, owner, and operator of the bulk power system,&#8221; as defined in the Federal Power Act. As such, the Company is subject to regulation by the FERC in matters related to wholesale energy activities, transmission services, reliability and cyber security standards, natural gas pipelines, hydroelectric projects, accounting policies and practices, short-term debt issuances, and certain other matters. 

Wholesale Energy &#8212;PGE has authority under its FERC Market-Based Rates tariff to charge market-based rates for wholesale energy sales. Re-authorization for continued use of such rates requires the filing of triennial market power studies with the FERC. The Company will file its next updated triennial market power study in 2016. 

PGE also has reporting requirements to the FERC for any change in status that departs from the characteristics that the FERC relied upon in authorizing sales at market-based rates, including increases in net generation capacity. 

Transmission &#8212;PGE offers electricity transmission service pursuant to its Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT), which contains rates and terms and conditions of service, as filed with, and approved by, the FERC. As required by the OATT, PGE provides information regarding its transmission business on its Open Access Same-time Information System, also known as OASIS. For additional information, see the Transmission and Distribution section in this Item 1. and in Item 2.&#8212;&#8220;Properties.&#8221; 

Reliability and Cyber Security Standards &#8212;Pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the FERC has adopted mandatory reliability standards for owners, users, and operators of the bulk power system. Such standards, which are applicable to PGE, were developed by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) and the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC), which have responsibility for compliance and enforcement of these standards. These standards include Critical Infrastructure Protection standards, a set of cyber security standards that provide a framework to identify and protect critical cyber assets used to support reliable operation of the bulk power system. 

Pipeline &#8212;The Natural Gas Act of 1938 and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 provide the FERC authority in matters related to the construction, operation, extension, enlargement, safety, and abandonment of jurisdictional interstate natural gas pipeline facilities, as well as transportation rates and accounting for interstate natural gas commerce. PGE is subject to such authority as the Company has a 79.5% ownership interest in, and is the operator of record of, the Kelso-Beaver Pipeline, a 17-mile interstate pipeline that provides natural gas to the Company&#8217;s natural gas-fired generating plants located near Clatskanie, Oregon: Port Westward Unit 1 (PW1); Port Westward Unit 2 (PW2); and Beaver. As the operator of record of the Kelso-Beaver Pipeline, PGE is subject to the requirements and regulations enacted under the Pipeline Safety Laws administered by the PHMSA, which include safety standards, operator qualification standards, and public awareness requirements. 

Hydroelectric Licensing &#8212;Under the Federal Power Act, PGE&#8217;s hydroelectric generating plants are subject to FERC licensing requirements, which include an extensive public review process that involves the consideration of numerous natural resource issues and environmental conditions. PGE holds FERC licenses for the Company&#8217;s projects on the Deschutes, Clackamas, and Willamette Rivers. For additional information, see the Environmental Matters section in this Item 1. and the Generating Facilities section in Item 2.&#8212;&#8220;Properties.&#8221; 

Accounting Policies and Practices &#8212;Pursuant to applicable provisions of the Federal Power Act, PGE prepares financial statements in accordance with the accounting requirements of the FERC, as set forth in its applicable Uniform System of Accounts and published accounting releases. Such financial statements are included in annual and quarterly reports filed with the FERC. 

Short-term Debt &#8212;Pursuant to applicable provisions of the Federal Power Act and FERC regulations, regulated public utilities are required to obtain FERC approval to issue certain securities. The Company, pursuant to an order issued by the FERC on February 5, 2016, has authorization to issue up to $900 million of short-term debt through February 6, 2018. 

NRC Regulation 

The NRC regulates the licensing and decommissioning of nuclear power plants, including PGE&#8217;s Trojan nuclear power plant (Trojan), which was closed in 1993. The NRC approved the 2003 transfer of spent nuclear fuel from a spent fuel pool to a separately licensed dry cask storage facility that will house the fuel on the former plant site until a United States Department of Energy (USDOE) facility is available. Radiological decommissioning of the plant site was completed in 2004 under an NRC-approved plan, with the plant&#8217;s operating license terminated in 2005. Spent fuel storage activities will continue to be subject to NRC regulation until all nuclear fuel is removed from the site and radiological decommissioning of the storage facility is completed. For additional information on spent nuclear fuel storage activities, see Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.&#8212;&#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#8221; 

State of Oregon Regulation 

PGE is subject to the jurisdiction of the OPUC, which is comprised of three members appointed by the governor of Oregon to serve non-concurrent four-year terms. 

The OPUC reviews and approves the Company&#8217;s retail prices (see &#8220; Economic Regulation &#8221; below) and establishes conditions of utility service. In addition, the OPUC reviews the Company&#8217;s generation and transmission resource acquisition plans, pursuant to a bi-annual integrated resource planning process. The OPUC regulates the issuance of securities and prescribes accounting policies and practices, and reviews applications to: 1) sell utility assets; 2) engage in transactions with affiliated companies; and 3) acquire substantial influence over public utilities. 

Integrated Resource Plan &#8212;Unless the OPUC directs otherwise, PGE is required to file with the OPUC an Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) within two years of its previous IRP acknowledgment order. Based on direction from the OPUC, PGE filed an update to its 2013 IRP in December 2015, and expects to file its next IRP with the OPUC in the latter half of 2016. The IRP guides the utility on a plan to meet future customer demand and describes the Company&#8217;s future energy supply strategy, which reflects new technologies, market conditions, and regulatory requirements. The primary goal of the IRP is to identify an acquisition plan for generation, transmission, demand-side, and energy efficiency resources that, along with the Company&#8217;s existing portfolio, provides the best combination of expected cost and associated risks and uncertainties for PGE and its customers. For additional information on PGE&#8217;s most recent IRP, see &#8220; Future Energy Resource Strategy &#8221; in the Power Supply section in this Item 1. 

Economic Regulation &#8212;Under Oregon law, the OPUC is required to ensure that prices and terms of service are fair, non-discriminatory, and provide regulated companies an opportunity to earn a reasonable return on their investments. Customer prices are determined through formal proceedings that generally include testimony by participating parties, discovery, public hearings, and the issuance of a final order. Participants in such proceedings, which are conducted under established procedural schedules, include PGE, OPUC staff, and intervenors representing PGE customer groups. The following are the more significant regulatory mechanisms and proceedings under which customer prices are determined: 

&#8226; 

General Rate Cases . PGE periodically evaluates the need to change its retail electric price structure to sufficiently cover its operating costs and provide a reasonable rate of return to investors. Such changes are requested pursuant to a comprehensive general rate case process that includes revenue requirements based on a forecasted test year, debt-to-equity capital structure, return on equity, and overall rate of return. PGE&#8217;s most recent general rate case was the 2016 General Rate Case (2016 GRC), for which a final order was received in November 2015. New prices were effective in 2016, with the first price change effective January 1 and an additional price change to be effective when the Carty natural gas-fired generating plant (Carty), a 440 MW baseload resource in Eastern Oregon, located adjacent to the Boardman coal-fired generating plant (Boardman), becomes operational, provided that occurs by July 31, 2016. For additional information, see &#8220; Capital Requirements and Financing &#8221; and &#8220; General Rate Cases &#8221; in the Overview 

section in Item 7.&#8212;&#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221; 

&#8226; 

Power Costs . In addition to price changes resulting from the general rate case process, the OPUC has approved the following mechanisms by which PGE can adjust retail customer prices to cover the Company&#8217;s net variable power costs (NVPC), which consist of the cost of purchased power and fuel used in generation (including related transportation costs) less revenues from wholesale power and fuel sales: 

&#9702; 

Annual Power Cost Update Tariff (AUT). Under this tariff, customer prices are adjusted annually to reflect the latest forecast of NVPC. Such forecast assumes the following for the different types of PGE-owned generating resources: 

&#9642; 

Thermal&#8212;Expected operating conditions; 

&#9642; 

Hydroelectric&#8212;Regional hydro generation based on historical stream flow data and current hydro operating parameters; and 

&#9642; 

Wind&#8212;Generation levels based on a five-year historical rolling average of the wind farm. To the extent historical information is not available for a given year, the projections are based on wind generation studies. 

An initial NVPC forecast, submitted to the OPUC by April 1st each year, is updated during such year and finalized in November. Based upon the final forecast, new prices, as approved by the OPUC, become effective at the beginning of the following calendar year; and 

&#9702; 

Power Cost Adjustment Mechanism (PCAM). Customer prices can also be adjusted to absorb a portion of the difference between each year&#8217;s forecasted NVPC included in customer prices (baseline NVPC) and actual NVPC for the year. Under the PCAM, PGE shares a portion of the business risk or benefit associated with NVPC. The PCAM utilizes an asymmetrical deadband range, $15 million below, to $30 million above, baseline NVPC, within which PGE absorbs cost variances. When the variances fall outside of the deadband, the excess variance is shared, with 90% flowing to customers and 10% absorbed by the Company. Annual results of the PCAM are subject to application of a regulated earnings test, under which a refund will occur only to the extent that it results in PGE&#8217;s actual regulated return on equity (ROE) for that year being no less than 1% above the Company&#8217;s latest authorized ROE. A collection will occur only to the extent that it results in PGE&#8217;s actual regulated ROE for that year being no greater than 1% below the Company&#8217;s authorized ROE. A final determination of any customer refund or collection is made by the OPUC through a public filing and review typically during the second half of the following year. For additional information, see &#8220;Power Operations&#8221; &#32;in the Overview section in Item 7.&#8212;&#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221; During the past three years, the Company has recorded no refunds or collections as a result of the PCAM. 

&#8226; 

Decoupling. The decoupling mechanism, currently authorized through 2016, is intended to provide for recovery of margin lost as a result of a reduction in electricity sales attributable to energy efficiency and conservation efforts by residential and certain commercial customers. The mechanism provides for: 1) collections from customers if weather adjusted energy use per customer is lower than levels included in the Company&#8217;s most recent general rate case or 2) refunds to customers if weather adjusted use per customer exceeds levels included in the most recent general rate case. For additional information, see the &#8220;Customers and Demand&#8221; &#32;in the Overview section in Item 7.&#8212;&#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221; 

&#8226; 

Renewable Energy. &#32;The 2007 Oregon Renewable Energy Act (the Act) established a Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) which required that PGE initially serve at least 5% of its retail load with renewable resources by 2011, with future requirements of 15% by 2015, 20% by 2020, and 25% by 2025. PGE met the 2011 requirement and, expects its 2015 RPS compliance report, to be made in the first half of 2016, to indicate that the 2015 requirement was achieved. &#32; 

The Act also allows renewable energy credits, resulting from energy generated from qualified renewable resources placed in service after January 1, 1995 and certified low impact hydroelectric power resources, to be used to meet the Company&#8217;s RPS compliance obligation. 

The Act provides for the recovery in customer prices of all prudently incurred costs required to comply with the RPS. Under a renewable adjustment clause (RAC) mechanism, PGE can recover the revenue requirement of new renewable resources and associated transmission that is not yet included in prices. Under the RAC, PGE may submit a filing by April 1st of each year for new renewable resources expected to be placed in service in the current year, with prices expected to become effective January 1st of the following year. In addition, the RAC provides for the deferral and subsequent recovery of eligible costs incurred prior to January 1st of the following year. 

The Company submitted a RAC filing to the OPUC in 2014 with the expectation that Tucannon River Wind Farm (Tucannon River) would be placed into service before the end of 2014. In 2015, PGE submitted a RAC filing related to a new 1.2 MW solar facility. For additional information, see &#8220;Legal, Regulatory and Environmental&#8221; in the Overview section in Item 7.&#8212;&#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221; 

As needed, other ratemaking proceedings may occur and can involve charges or credits related to specific costs, programs, or activities, as well as the recovery or refund of deferred amounts recorded pursuant to specific OPUC authorization. Such amounts are generally collected from, or refunded to, retail customers through the use of supplemental tariffs. For additional information, see the &#8220;Legal, Regulatory and Environmental Matters&#8221; &#32;discussion in the Overview section in Item 7.&#8212;&#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221; 

Retail Customer Choice Program &#8212;PGE&#8217;s commercial and industrial customers have access to pricing options other than cost-of-service, including direct access and daily market index-based pricing. All commercial and industrial customers are eligible for direct access, whereby customers purchase their electricity from an Electricity Service Supplier (ESS). Under the program, the Company is paid for delivery of the energy to the ESS customers. Large commercial and industrial customers may elect to be served by PGE on a daily market index-based price. 

Certain large commercial and industrial customers may elect to be removed from cost-of-service pricing for a fixed three-year or a minimum five-year term, to be served either by an ESS, or by the Company under a daily market index-based price. Certain commercial and industrial customers also have an option to be served by an ESS for a one-year period. Participation in the fixed three-year and minimum five-year opt-out programs is capped at 300 average megawatts (MWa) in aggregate. The majority of the energy supplied under PGE&#8217;s Retail Customer Choice program is provided to customers that have elected service from an ESS under the fixed three-year or minimum five-year opt-out program. 

In 2015 , ESSs supplied direct access customers with energy representing 9% of the Company&#8217;s total retail energy deliveries for the year, compared with 9% in 2014 &#32;and 8% in 2013. The maximum retail load allowed to be supplied under the fixed three-year and minimum five-year opt-out programs would represent approximately 14% of the Company&#8217;s total retail energy deliveries for 2015 , 2014 , and 2013. 

The retail customer choice program does not have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition or operating results as revenue changes resulting from increases or decreases in electricity sales to direct access customers are substantially offset by changes in the Company&#8217;s cost of purchased power and fuel. Further, the program provides for &#8220;transition adjustment&#8221; charges or credits to direct access and market based pricing customers that reflect the above- or below-market cost of energy resources owned or purchased by the Company. Such adjustments are designed to ensure that the costs or benefits of the program do not unfairly shift to those customers that continue to purchase their energy requirements from the Company. 

In addition to cost-of-service pricing, residential and small commercial customers can select portfolio options from PGE that include time-of-use and renewable resource pricing. 

Energy Efficiency Funding &#8212;Oregon law provides for a &#8220;public purpose charge&#8221; to fund cost-effective energy efficiency measures, new renewable energy resources, and weatherization measures for low-income housing. This charge, equal to 3% &#32;of retail revenues, is collected from customers and remitted to the Energy Trust of Oregon (ETO) and other agencies for administration of these programs. Approximately, $51 million &#32;was collected from customers for this charge in both 2015 , and in 2014 , and $48 million &#32;in 2013 . 

In addition to the public purpose charge, PGE also remits to the ETO amounts collected under an Energy Efficiency Adjustment tariff to fund additional energy efficiency measures. This charge was approximately 2.4% , 3.2% &#32;and 3.5% &#32;of retail revenues for applicable customers in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. Under the tariff, approximately $42 million , $48 million &#32;and $50 million &#32;was collected from eligible customers in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. 

Siting &#8212;Oregon&#8217;s Energy Facility Siting Council (EFSC) has regulatory and siting responsibility for large electric generating facilities, high voltage transmission lines, intrastate gas pipelines, and radioactive waste disposal sites. The responsibilities of the EFSC also include oversight of the decommissioning of Trojan. The seven volunteer members of the EFSC are appointed to four-year terms by the governor of Oregon, with staff support provided by the Oregon Department of Energy. 

Regulatory Accounting 

PGE is subject to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), and as a regulated public utility, the effects of rate regulation are reflected in its financial statements. These principles provide for the deferral as regulatory assets of certain actual or estimated costs that would otherwise be charged to expense, based on expected recovery from customers in future prices. Likewise, certain actual or anticipated credits that would otherwise reduce expense can be deferred as regulatory liabilities, based on expected future credits or refunds to customers. PGE records regulatory assets or liabilities if it is probable that they will be reflected in future prices, based on regulatory orders or other available evidence. 

The Company periodically assesses the applicability of regulatory accounting to its business, considering both the current and anticipated future regulatory environment and related accounting guidance . &#32;For additional information, see &#8220;Regulatory Assets and Liabilities&#8221; &#32;in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 6, Regulatory Assets and Liabilities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.&#8212;&#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#8221; 

Customers and Revenues 

PGE generates revenue through the sale and delivery of electricity to retail customers. The Company conducts retail electric operations exclusively in Oregon within a service area approved by the OPUC. Within its service territory, the Company competes with: i) the local natural gas distribution company for the energy needs of residential and commercial space heating, water heating, and appliances; and ii) fuel oil suppliers, primarily for residential customers&#8217; space heating needs. Energy efficiency and conservation measures, as well as an increasing trend toward rooftop solar generation in recent years, also influence customer demand. In addition, the Company distributes power to commercial and industrial customers that choose to purchase their energy supply from an ESS. The Company includes such &#8220;direct access&#8221; customers in its customer counts and energy delivered to such customers in its total retail energy deliveries. Retail revenues include only delivery charges and transition adjustments for these customers. 

Retail Revenues 

Retail customers are classified as residential, commercial, or industrial, with no single customer representing more than 6% of PGE&#8217;s total retail revenues or 8% of total retail deliveries. While the twenty largest commercial and industrial customers constituted 12% of total retail revenues in 2015 , they represented eight different groups including high technology, paper manufacturing, governmental agencies, health services, and retailers. 

PGE&#8217;s Retail revenues (dollars in millions), retail energy deliveries (MWh in thousands), and average number of retail customers consist of the following for the years presented:

In accordance with state regulations, PGE&#8217;s retail customer prices are based on the Company&#8217;s cost of service and are determined through general rate case proceedings and various tariff filings with the OPUC. Additionally, the Company offers different pricing options including a daily market price option, various time-of-use options, and several renewable energy options, which are offered to residential and small commercial customers. For additional information on customer options, see &#8220; Retail Customer Choice Program &#8221; within the Regulation section of this Item 1. Additional information on the customer classes follows. 

Residential &#32;customers include single family housing, multiple family housing (such as apartments, duplexes, and town homes), mobile homes, and small farms. Residential demand is sensitive to the effects of weather, with demand historically highest during the winter heating season; although, increased use of air conditioning in PGE&#8217;s service territory has caused the summer peaks to increase in recent years. Economic conditions can also affect residential demand; historical data suggests that high unemployment rates contribute to a decrease in residential deliveries. Residential demand is also impacted by energy efficiency measures; however, the Company&#8217;s decoupling mechanism is intended to mitigate the financial effects of such measures. 

During 2015 , PGE experienced historically warm temperatures during the winter heating season reducing residential energy deliveries. Although this weather effect was partially offset by warm temperatures during the summer cooling season, the overall result was that total residential deliveries decreased 1.8% &#32;compared to 2014 . Total residential deliveries for 2014 &#32;decreased 3.1% &#32;compared to 2013 &#32;as a result of warmer weather during the 2014 &#32;heating season. On a weather adjusted basis, energy deliveries to residential customers increased by 2.2% in 2015 &#32;when compared to 2014 . 

Commercial &#32;customers consist of non-residential customers who accept energy deliveries at voltages equivalent to those delivered to residential customers. This customer class includes most businesses, small industrial companies, and public street and highway lighting accounts. 

The Company&#8217;s commercial customers are somewhat less susceptible to weather conditions than the residential customer, although weather does have an effect on commercial demand. Economic conditions and fluctuations in total employment in the region can also lead to corresponding changes in energy demand from commercial customers. Commercial demand is also impacted by energy efficiency measures, the financial effects of which are partially mitigated by the Company&#8217;s decoupling mechanism. 

In 2015 , the 0.2% &#32;increase in commercial deliveries compared with 2014 &#32;reflected an increase in deliveries to irrigation and service sector customers being mostly offset by lower deliveries to all other commercial sectors. Deliveries to commercial customers increased 0.7% &#32;in 2014 &#32;compared with 2013 , which was primarily due to increased demand from across the majority of commercial sectors, most notably office buildings, government and education, food stores, and the warehousing sectors combined with an increase in the average number of commercial customers. 

Industrial &#32;customers consist of non-residential customers who accept delivery at higher voltages than commercial customers, with pricing based on the amount of electricity delivered on the applicable tariff. Demand from industrial customers is primarily driven by economic conditions, with weather having little impact on this customer class. 

The Company&#8217;s industrial energy deliveries increased 5.5% &#32;in 2015 &#32;from 2014 &#32;due to increased demand from high technology manufacturing and paper manufacturing customers. The 0.8% &#32;increase in 2014 &#32;from 2013 &#32;was due to increased demand in the high tech industry, partially offset by a decline in demand from a paper production customer. In late 2015, a large paper manufacturing customer, to which PGE has delivered approximately 450 thousand MWhs annually, with corresponding revenues of approximately $20 million, ceased operations. Although the majority of power this customer purchased was under the Company&#8217;s daily market index-based price option, a portion was at cost of service prices. 

Other accrued (deferred) revenues, net include items that are not currently in customer prices, but are expected to be in prices in a future period. Such amounts include deferrals recorded under the RAC and the decoupling mechanism. For further information on these items, see &#8220; State of Oregon Regulation &#8221; in the Regulation section of this Item 1. 

Wholesale Revenues 

PGE participates in the wholesale electricity marketplace in order to balance its supply of power to meet the needs of its retail customers. Interconnected transmission systems in the western United States serve utilities with diverse load requirements and allow the Company to purchase and sell electricity within the region depending upon the relative price and availability of power, hydro conditions, and daily and seasonal retail demand. Wholesale revenues represented 5% of total revenues in both 2015 &#32;and 2014 , and 4% in 2013 . 

The majority of PGE&#8217;s wholesale electricity sales is to utilities and power marketers and is predominantly short-term. The Company may choose to net purchases and sales with the same counterparty rather than simultaneously receiving and delivering physical power; in such cases, only the net amount of those purchases or sales required to meet retail and wholesale obligations will be physically settled. 

Other Operating Revenues 

Other operating revenues consist primarily of gains and losses on the sale of natural gas volumes purchased that exceeded what was needed to fuel the Company&#8217;s generating facilities, as well as revenues from transmission services, excess transmission capacity resales, excess fuel oil sales, pole contact rentals, and other electric services provided to customers. Other operating revenues represented 2% of total revenues in 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 . 

Seasonality 

Demand for electricity by PGE&#8217;s residential and, to a lesser extent, commercial customers, is affected by seasonal weather conditions. The Company uses heating and cooling degree-days to determine the effect of weather on the demand for electricity. Heating and cooling degree-days provide cumulative variances in the average daily temperature from a baseline of 65 degrees, over a period of time, to indicate the extent to which customers are likely to use, or have used, electricity for heating or air conditioning. The higher the number of degree-days, the greater the expected demand for heating or cooling. 

The following table presents the heating and cooling degree-days for the most recent three-year period, along with 15-year averages for the most recent year provided by the National Weather Service, as measured at Portland International Airport:

The Company tracks and evaluates both load growth and peak load requirements for purposes of long-term load forecasting, integrated resource planning, and preparing general rate case assumptions. Behavior patterns, conservation, energy efficiency initiatives and measures, weather effects, economic conditions, and demographic changes all play a role in determining expected future customer demand and the resulting resources the Company will need to adequately meet those loads and maintain adequate capacity reserves. 

Power Supply 

PGE relies upon its generating resources, as well as wholesale power purchases from third parties to meet its customers&#8217; energy requirements. The volume of electricity the Company generates is dependent upon, among other factors, the capacity and availability of its generating resources and the price and availability of wholesale power and natural gas. As part of its power supply operations, the Company enters into short- and long-term power and fuel purchase agreements. PGE executes economic dispatch decisions concerning its own generation, and participates in the wholesale market in an effort to obtain reasonably-priced power for its retail customers, manage risk, and administer its current long-term wholesale contracts. The Company also promotes energy efficiency measures to meet its energy requirements. 

PGE&#8217;s generating resources consist of six thermal plants (natural gas- and coal-fired), two wind farms, and seven hydroelectric facilities. Capacity of the thermal plants represents the MW the plant is capable of generating under normal operating conditions, which is affected by ambient temperatures, net of electricity used in the operation of the plant. Capacity of both hydro and wind generating resources represent the nameplate MW, which varies from actual energy expected to be received as these types of generating resources are highly dependent upon river flows and wind conditions, respectively. Availability represents the percentage of the year the plant was available for operations, which reflects the impact of planned and forced outages. For a complete listing of these facilities, see &#8220; Generating Facilities &#8221; in Item 2.&#8212;&#8220;Properties.&#8221; 

PGE&#8217;s resource capacity (in MW) was as follows:

For information regarding actual generating output and purchases for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , see the Results of Operations section of Item 7.&#8212;&#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221; 

Generation 

The portion of PGE&#8217;s retail load requirements generated by its plants varies from year to year and is determined by various factors, including planned and unplanned outages, availability and price of coal and natural gas, precipitation and snow-pack levels, the market price of electricity, and wind variability. In December 2014, PGE completed construction of PW2, a new flexible capacity resource, and Tucannon River, a new renewable resource, both discussed below. As of December 31, 2015, the Company has the Carty Generating Station (Carty) under construction, which is targeted to be placed in service in &#32; July 2016. These additional resources resulted from the competitive bidding process completed in 2013 consistent with the Company&#8217;s 2009 IRP. For additional information on Carty, see &#8220; Capital Requirements and Financing &#8221; in the Overview section in Item 7.&#8212;&#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221; 

Thermal 

The Company has four natural gas-fired generating facilities: PW1, PW2, Beaver, and Coyote Springs Unit 1 (Coyote Springs). These natural gas-fired generating plants provided approximately 25% &#32;of PGE&#8217;s total retail load requirement in 2015 &#32;and 18% &#32;in both 2014 &#32;and 2013 . 

PGE increased its ownership interest in the Boardman coal-fired generating plant (Boardman) through the acquisition of the 10% interest of a co-owner, increasing the Company&#8217;s ownership share to 90% from 

80% on December 31, 2014. For additional information, see Note 17, Jointly-owned Plant, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.&#8212;&#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#8221; 

The Company operates Boardman and has a 20% ownership interest in Colstrip Units 3 and 4 coal-fired generating plant (Colstrip), which is operated by a third party. These two coal-fired generating facilities provided approximately 22% &#32;of the Company&#8217;s total retail load requirement in 2015 , compared with 24% &#32;in 2014 &#32;and 22% &#32;in 2013 . 

&#160; 

The thermal plants provide reliable power and capacity reserves for PGE&#8217;s customers. These resources have a combined capacity of 2,185 &#32;MW, representing approximately 64% &#32;of the net capacity of PGE&#8217;s generating portfolio. Thermal plant availability, excluding Colstrip, was 89% &#32;in both 2015 &#32;and 2014 , and 84% &#32;in 2013 , while Colstrip availability was 93% &#32;in 2015 , compared with 83% &#32;in 2014 &#32;and 66% &#32;in 2013 . Thermal plant availability percentages for 2015 and 2014 were higher than 2013 due to unplanned outages at three plants during 2013. For additional information on the unplanned plant outages, see &#8220; Power Operations &#8221; in the Overview section in Item 7.&#8212;&#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221; 

Wind 

PGE owns and operates two wind farms, Biglow Canyon Wind Farm (Biglow Canyon) and Tucannon River. Biglow Canyon, located in Sherman County, Oregon, is PGE&#8217;s largest renewable energy resource consisting of 217 wind turbines with a total nameplate capacity of approximately 450 &#32;MW. Tucannon River, placed in service in December 2014, is located in southeastern Washington and consists of 116 wind turbines with a total nameplate capacity of 267 &#32;MW. 

The energy from wind resources provided 9% &#32;of the Company&#8217;s total retail load requirement in 2015 &#32;and 6% in both 2014 &#32;and 2013 . Availability for these resources was 97% &#32;in 2015 , compared with 94% &#32;in 2014 &#32;and 98% in 2013 . The expected energy from wind resources differs from the nameplate capacity and is expected to range from 135 MWa to 180 MWa for Biglow Canyon and from 80 MWa to 110 MWa for Tucannon River, dependent upon wind conditions. 

Hydro 

The Company&#8217;s FERC-licensed hydroelectric projects consist of Pelton/Round Butte on the Deschutes River near Madras, Oregon (discussed below), four plants on the Clackamas River, and one on the Willamette River. The licenses for these projects expire at various dates ranging from 2035 to 2055. Although these plants have a combined capacity of 495 &#32;MW, actual energy received is dependent upon river flows. Energy from these resources provided 8% &#32;of the Company&#8217;s total retail load requirement in 2015 , and 9% &#32; in 2014 &#32;and in 2013 , with availability of 99% &#32;in 2015 , and 100% &#32;in 2014 &#32;and in 2013 . Northwest hydro conditions have a significant impact on the region&#8217;s power supply, with water conditions significantly impacting PGE&#8217;s cost of power and its ability to economically displace more expensive thermal generation and spot market power purchases. 

PGE has a 66.67% ownership interest in the 455 MW Pelton/Round Butte hydroelectric project on the Deschutes River, with the remaining interest held by the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon (Tribes). A 50-year joint license for the project, which is operated by PGE, was issued by the FERC in 2005. The Tribes have an option to purchase an additional undivided 16.66% interest in Pelton/Round Butte at its discretion on or after December 31, 2021. The Tribes have a second option to purchase an undivided 0.02% interest in Pelton/Round Butte at its discretion on or after April 1, 2041. If both options are exercised by the Tribes, the Tribes&#8217; ownership percentage would exceed 50%. 

Dispatchable Standby Generation &#32; (DSG) &#8212;PGE has a DSG program under which the Company can start, operate, and monitor customer-owned diesel-fueled standby generators when needed to support specific capacity needs. The program also helps provide NERC-required operating reserves. As of December 31, 2015 , there were 54 sites with a total capacity of 107 MW. Additional DSG projects are being pursued with goals of a total of 118 MW online by the end of 2016 and 140 MW by the end of 2018. 

Fuel Supply &#8212;PGE contracts for natural gas and coal supplies required to fuel the Company&#8217;s thermal generating plants, with certain plants also able to operate on fuel oil if needed. In addition, the Company uses forward, future, swap, and option contracts to manage its exposure to volatility in natural gas prices. 

Natural Gas 

Physical supplies of natural gas are generally purchased up to twelve months in advance of delivery and based on anticipated operation of the plants. PGE attempts to manage the price risk of natural gas supply through the use of financial contracts up to 60 months in advance of expected need of energy. 

PGE owns 79.5%, and is the operator of record, of the Kelso-Beaver Pipeline, which directly connects PW1, PW2, and Beaver to Northwest Pipeline, an interstate natural gas pipeline operating between British Columbia and New Mexico. Currently, PGE transports natural gas on the Kelso-Beaver Pipeline for its own use under a firm transportation service agreement, with capacity offered to others on an interruptible basis to the extent not utilized by the Company. PGE has access to 103,305 Dth per day of firm natural gas transportation capacity to serve the three plants. 

PGE also has contractual access to natural gas storage in Mist, Oregon from which it can draw in the event that natural gas supplies are interrupted or if economic factors require its use. The storage facility is owned and operated by a local natural gas company and may be utilized to provide fuel to PW1, PW2, and Beaver. In addition, PGE is in ongoing discussions with this company concerning a new long-term natural gas storage arrangement to potentially expand their natural gas storage facilities. &#32; PGE believes that sufficient market supplies of natural gas are available to meet anticipated operations of these plants for the foreseeable future. 

Beaver has the capability to operate on No. 2 diesel fuel oil when it is economical or if the plant&#8217;s natural gas supply is interrupted. PGE had an approximate six day supply of ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel oil at the plant site as of December 31, 2015 . The current operating permit for Beaver limits the number of gallons of fuel oil that can be burned daily, which effectively limits the daily hours of operation of Beaver on fuel oil. 

To serve Coyote Springs, PGE has access to 41,000 Dth per day of firm natural gas transportation capacity on three pipeline systems accessing gas fields in Alberta, Canada. PGE believes that sufficient market supplies of natural gas are available for Coyote Springs for the foreseeable future, based on anticipated operation of the plant. Although Coyote Springs was designed to also operate on fuel oil, such capability has been deactivated in order to optimize natural gas operations. 

Coal 

PGE has fixed-price purchase agreements that will provide coal for approximately half of the anticipated needs for Boardman during 2016. The coal is obtained from surface mining operations in Wyoming and Montana and is delivered by rail under two separate transportation contracts which extend through 2020. 

PGE expects to secure the balance of the needs for 2016, and beyond, by layering purchases throughout the coming year. The terms of contracts and the quality of coal are expected to be staged in alignment with required emissions limits. PGE believes that sufficient market supplies of coal are available to meet anticipated operations of Boardman through 2020. 

The Colstrip co-owners currently obtain coal to fuel the plant via conveyor belt from a mine that lies adjacent to the facility. The current contract for coal supply extends through 2019 and the Colstrip co-owners are in the process of negotiating an extension to the contract. 

Purchased Power 

PGE supplements its own generation with power purchased in the wholesale market to meet its retail load requirements. The Company utilizes short- and long-term wholesale power purchase contracts in an effort to provide the most favorable economic mix on a variable cost basis. Such contracts have original terms ranging from one month to 53 years and expire at varying dates through 2055. 

PGE&#8217;s medium term power cost strategy helps mitigate the effect of price volatility on its customers due to changing energy market conditions. The strategy allows the Company to take positions in power and fuel markets up to five years in advance of physical delivery. By purchasing a portion of anticipated energy needs for future years over an extended period, PGE mitigates a portion of the potential future volatility in the average cost of purchased power and fuel. 

The Company&#8217;s major power purchase contracts consist of the following (also see the preceding table which summarizes the average resource capabilities related to these contracts): 

Capacity/exchange &#8212;PGE has three contracts that provide PGE with firm capacity to help meet the Company&#8217;s peak loads. One contract represents 150 MW of capacity and expires in December 2016. The other two contracts represent two power purchase agreements for up to 100 MW of seasonal peaking capacity, one agreement covers winter from December 2014 to February 2019 and the second agreement covers summer from July 2014 to September 2018. 

Hydro &#8212;During 2015, the Company had five contracts that provided for the purchase of power generated from hydroelectric projects with an aggregate capacity of 117 MW. One contract, which provided 58 MW, expired December 31, 2015. The remaining contracts expire between 2017 and 2033. In addition, PGE has the following: 

&#8226; 

Mid-Columbia hydro &#8212;PGE has long-term power purchase contracts with certain public utility districts in the state of Washington for a portion of the output of three hydroelectric projects on the mid-Columbia River. One contract representing 150 &#32;MW of capacity expires in 2018 &#32;and a contract representing 163 &#32;MW of capacity expires in 2052 . Although the projects currently provide a total of 313 &#32;MW of capacity, actual energy received is dependent upon river flows. 

&#8226; 

Confederated Tribes &#8212;PGE has a long-term agreement under which the Company purchases, at market prices, the Tribes&#8217; interest in the output of the Pelton/Round Butte hydroelectric project. Although the agreement provides 162 MW of capacity, actual energy received is dependent upon river flows. The term of the agreement coincides with the term of the FERC license for this project, which expires in 2055. During 2014, PGE entered into an agreement with the Tribes, whereby the Tribes have agreed to sell their share of the energy generated from the Pelton/Round Butte hydroelectric project exclusively to the Company through 2024. 

Wind &#8212;PGE has three contracts that provide for the purchase of renewable wind-generated electricity and which extend to various dates between 2028 and 2035. The expected energy from these wind contracts differs from the nameplate capacity and is expected to approximate 39 MWa, dependent upon wind conditions. 

Solar &#8212;PGE has three agreements that expire during 2036 and 2037 to purchase power generated from photovoltaic solar projects, which have a combined generating capacity of 7 MW. In addition, the Company operates, and purchases power from three solar projects with an aggregate of approximately 6 MW of capacity. The expected energy from these solar resources will vary from the nameplate capacity due to varying solar conditions. 

Other &#8212;These primarily consist of long-term contracts to purchase power from various counterparties, including other Pacific Northwest utilities, over terms extending into 2031. 

Short-term contracts &#8212;These contracts are for delivery periods of one month up to one year in length. They are entered into with various counterparties to provide additional firm energy to help meet the Company&#8217;s load requirements. 

PGE also utilizes spot purchases of power in the open market to secure the energy required to serve its retail customers. Such purchases are made under contracts that range in duration from 15 minutes to less than one month. For additional information regarding PGE&#8217;s power purchase contracts, see Note 15, Commitments and Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.&#8212;&#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#8221; 

Future Energy Resource Strategy 

In March 2014, PGE filed with the OPUC the 2013 IRP, which outlines the Company&#8217;s expectations for resource needs and resource portfolio performance over the next 20 years and includes an &#8220;Action Plan,&#8221; which covers the Company&#8217;s proposed actions through 2017. Over that time period, PGE projects energy requirements and the energy available through its generation resources and long-term power purchase agreements to be in approximate balance. In December 2014, the OPUC acknowledged PGE&#8217;s 2013 IRP with minor modifications, and the preparation and submittal of additional studies. 

The Action Plan includes the following, among other items, to be undertaken through 2017: 

&#8226; 

Seek renewal, or partial renewal, of expiring power purchase agreements for energy generated from hydroelectric projects, if available and cost-effective for customers; 

&#8226; 

Acquire a total of 114 MWa of energy efficiency through continuation of Energy Trust of Oregon programs, with a target increase of 124 MWa, if legislation and regulation allow; 

&#8226; 

Acquire an additional 25 MW of demand response and 23 MW of dispatchable standby generation from customers to help manage peak load conditions and other supply contingencies; and 

&#8226; 

Perform various research and studies related to load forecast and energy efficiency projections, distributed generation resources within PGE&#8217;s service territory, the viability of large-scale biomass operations, fuel supply, operational flexibility requirements and analytical tools, cost-benefit analysis of Energy Imbalance Market (EIM) participation, RPS compliance strategies, and potential impacts of compliance with United States Environmental Protection Agency&#8217;s (EPA&#8217;s) Clean Power Plan rules concerning reductions in carbon dioxide emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired power plants in preparation for the next IRP. 

The 2013 IRP, as updated in December 2015, also incorporates PW2 and Tucannon River, both of which were placed into service in December 2014, and Carty, which is currently being constructed and targeted to be placed in service &#32; in July 2016. For additional information on Carty, see &#8220; Capital Requirements &#8221; in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section in Item 7.&#8212;&#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221; 

In accordance with the Action Plan, PGE has evaluated its participation in an EIM. In September 2015, the Company announced plans to explore participation in t he western EIM, which was launched in 2014 by the California Independent System Operator. The western EIM is a real-time energy wholesale market that automatically dispatches the lowest-cost electricity resources available to mee t utility customer needs, while optimizing use of renewable energy over a large geographic area. PGE has signed an agreement, which was approved by the FERC in January 2016, to join the western EIM. The agreement outlines a schedule of activities and milestones over the next two years with the Company&#8217;s participation in the EIM targeted to begin in the fall of 2017. 

Beyond 2017, PGE may need additional resources in order to meet the 2020 and 2025 RPS requirements and to replace energy from Boardman, which is scheduled to cease coal-fired operations at the end of 2020. Additional actions beyond 2017 may also be needed to offset expiring power purchase agreements and to integrate variable energy resources, such as wind or solar generation facilities. These actions are expected to be identified in PGE&#8217;s next IRP filing with the OPUC in the latter half of 2016. 

Transmission and Distribution 

Transmission systems deliver energy from generating facilities to distribution systems for final delivery to customers. PGE schedules energy deliveries over its transmission system in accordance with FERC requirements and operates one balancing authority area (an electric system bounded by interchange metering) in its service territory. In 2015, PGE delivered approximately 22 million &#32;megawatt hours (MWh) in its balancing authority area through 1,239 circuit miles of transmission lines operating at or above 115 kV. 

PGE&#8217;s transmission system is part of the Western Interconnection, the regional grid in the western United States. The Western Interconnection includes the interconnected transmission systems of 11 western states, two Canadian provinces and parts of Mexico, and is subject to the reliability rules of the WECC and the NERC. PGE relies on transmission contracts with BPA to transmit a significant amount of the Company&#8217;s generation to serve its distribution system. PGE&#8217;s transmission system, together with contractual rights on other transmission systems, enables the Company to integrate and access generation resources to meet its customers&#8217; energy requirements. PGE&#8217;s generation is managed on a coordinated basis to obtain maximum load-carrying capability and efficiency. 

The Company&#8217;s transmission and distribution systems are generally located as follows: 

&#8226; 

On property owned or leased by PGE; 

&#8226; 

Under or over streets, alleys, highways and other public places, the public domain and national forests, and federal and state lands primarily under franchises, easements or other rights that are generally subject to termination; 

&#8226; 

Under or over private property primarily pursuant to easements obtained from the record holder of title at the time of grant; and 

&#8226; 

Under or over Native American reservations under grant of easement by the Secretary of the Interior or lease or easement by Native American tribes. 

The Company&#8217;s wholesale transmission activities are regulated by the FERC and are offered on a non-discriminatory basis, with all potential customers provided equal access to PGE&#8217;s transmission system through PGE&#8217;s OATT. In accordance with its OATT, PGE offers several transmission services to wholesale customers: 

&#8226; 

Network integration transmission service, a service that integrates generating resources to serve retail loads; 

&#8226; 

Short- and long-term firm point-to-point transmission service, a service with fixed delivery and receipt points; and 

&#8226; 

Non-firm point-to-point service, an &#8220;as available&#8221; service with fixed delivery and receipt points. 

PGE is subject to state regulatory requirements related to the quality and reliability of its distribution system. Such requirements are reflected in specific indices that measure outage duration, outage frequency, and momentary power interruptions. The Company is required to include performance results related to service quality measures in annual reports filed with the OPUC. Specific monetary penalties can be assessed for failure to attain required performance levels, with amounts dependent upon the extent to which actual results fail to meet such requirements. 

For additional information regarding the Company&#8217;s transmission and distribution facilities, see &#8220; Transmission and Distribution &#8221; in Item 2.&#8212;&#8220;Properties.&#8221; 

Environmental Matters 

PGE&#8217;s operations are subject to a wide range of environmental protection laws and regulations, which pertain to air and water quality, endangered species and wildlife protection, and hazardous material. Various state and federal agencies regulate environmental matters that relate to the siting, construction, and operation of generation, transmission, and substation facilities and the handling, accumulation, cleanup, and disposal of toxic and hazardous 

substances. In addition, certain of the Company&#8217;s hydroelectric projects and transmission facilities are located on property under the jurisdiction of federal and state agencies, and/or tribal entities that have authority in environmental protection matters. The following discussion provides further information on certain regulations that affect the Company&#8217;s operations and facilities. 

Air Quality 

Clean Air Act &#8212;PGE&#8217;s operations, primarily its thermal generating plants, are subject to regulation under the federal Clean Air Act (CAA), which addresses, among other things, particulate matter, hazardous air pollutants, and greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). Oregon and Montana, the states in which PGE&#8217;s thermal facilities are located, also implement and administer certain portions of the CAA and have set standards that are at least equal to federal standards. 

The EPA issued a rule in 2011 aimed at the reduction of toxic air emissions from power plants. Specifically, these mercury and air toxics standards (MATS), which became effective on April 16, 2012, for power plants are intended to reduce emissions from new and existing coal- and oil-fired electric utility steam generating units. With the installation of emissions controls, which included a Dry Sorbent Injection system, at Boardman completed in 2013, the Company believes the Boardman plant meets the MATS requirements without additional capital investment. Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) rules provide for coal-fired operation at Boardman to cease no later than December 31, 2020. Emissions controls in place at Colstrip allow operation within the standards necessary to meet the MATS requirements. The Company does not anticipate further capital investment to meet the requirements currently in place. 

Although regulation of mercury emissions is contemplated under MATS, the states of Oregon and Montana have previously adopted regulations concerning mercury emissions, with which the Company complies. 

PGE manages its air emissions by the use of low sulfur fuel, emissions and combustion controls and monitoring, and sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) allowances awarded under the CAA. The current and expected future SO 2 &#32;allowances, along with the recent installation of emissions controls and the continued use of low sulfur fuel, are anticipated to be sufficient to permit the Company to meet these compliance requirements. 

Climate Change &#8212; The EPA has taken the lead role on climate change policy utilizing existing authority under the CAA to develop regulations. On August 3, 2015, the EPA released a final rule, which it calls the &#8220;Clean Power Plan.&#8221; Under the final rule, each state would have to reduce the carbon intensity of its power sector on a state-wide basis by an amount specified by the EPA. The rule establishes state-specific goals in terms of pounds of carbon dioxide emitted per MWh of energy produced. The rule is intended to result in a reduction of carbon emissions from existing power plants across all states to approximately 32% below 2005 levels by 2030. 

The target amount was determined based on the EPA&#8217;s view of the options for each state, including: i) making efficiency upgrades at fossil fuel-fired power plants; ii) shifting generation from coal-fired plants to natural gas-fired plants; and iii) expanding use of zero- and low-carbon emitting generation (such as renewable energy and nuclear energy). The final goal would need to be met by 2030 and interim goals for each state would need to be met from 2022 to 2029. Under the rule, states have flexibility in designing programs to meet their emission reduction targets, including the three approaches noted above and any other measures the states choose to adopt (such as carbon tax and cap-and-trade) that would result in verified emission reductions. 

States have until September 6, 2016 to submit plans to implement the rule (subject to extension). PGE cannot predict how the states in which the Company&#8217;s generation facilities are located (Oregon and Montana) will implement the rule or how the rule may impact the Company&#8217;s operations. The Company continues to monitor the developments around the implementation of the rule and efforts by state regulators to develop state plans. On February 9, 2016, the United States Supreme Court granted a stay, halting implementation and enforcement of the Clean Power Plan pending the resolution of legal challenges to the rule. The Company cannot predict the impact of 

the stay, the ultimate outcome of the legal challenges, or whether Oregon will continue to develop the state&#8217;s implementation plan for the rule&#8217;s previously required September 6, 2016 deadline. 

The state of Oregon established a non-binding policy guideline that sets a goal to reduce GHG emissions to 10% below 1990 levels by 2020 and at least 75% below 1990 levels by 2050. Although the guideline does not mandate reductions by any specific entity, nor include penalties for failure to meet the goal, the Company is required to report to the DEQ the amount of GHG emissions produced along with the total amount of energy produced or purchased by PGE for consumption in Oregon. 

Any laws that would impose emissions taxes or mandatory reductions in GHG emissions may have a material impact on PGE&#8217;s operations, as the Company utilizes fossil fuels in its own power generation and other companies use such fuels to generate power that PGE purchases in the wholesale market. PGE&#8217;s natural gas-fired facilities, Beaver, Coyote Springs, PW1, and PW2, and the Company&#8217;s ownership interest in coal-fired facilities, Boardman and Colstrip, provided, in total, approximately 64% of the Company&#8217;s net generating capacity during 2015. If PGE were to incur incremental costs as a result of changes in the regulations regarding GHGs, the Company would seek recovery in customer prices. 

Water Quality 

The federal Clean Water Act requires that any federal license or permit to conduct an activity that may result in a discharge to waters of the United States must first receive a water quality certification from the state in which the activity will occur. In Oregon, Montana, and Washington, the Departments of Environmental Quality are responsible for reviewing proposed projects under this requirement to ensure that federally approved activities will meet water quality standards and policies established by the respective state. PGE has obtained permits where required, and has certificates of compliance for its hydroelectric operations under the FERC licenses. 

Threatened and Endangered Species and Wildlife 

Fish Protection &#8212;The federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) has granted protection to many populations of migratory fish species in the Pacific Northwest that have declined significantly over the last several decades. Long-term recovery plans for these species have caused major operational changes to many of the region&#8217;s hydroelectric projects. PGE purchases power in the wholesale market to serve its retail load requirements and has contracts to purchase power generated at some of the affected facilities on the mid-Columbia River in central Washington. 

PGE continues to implement fish protection measures at its hydroelectric projects on the Clackamas, Deschutes, and Willamette rivers that were prescribed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service under their authority granted in the ESA and the Federal Power Act. As a result of measures contained in their operating licenses, the Deschutes River and Willamette River projects have been certified as low impact hydro, with 50 MWa of their output included as part of the Company&#8217;s renewable energy portfolio used to meet the requirements of the Oregon RPS. Conditions required with the operating licenses are expected to result in a minor reduction in power production and increase capital spending to modify the facilities to enhance fish passage and survival. 

Avian Protection &#8212;Various statutes, including the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, have established civil, criminal, and administrative penalties for the unauthorized take of migratory birds. Because PGE operates facilities that can pose risks to a variety of such birds, the Company developed an avian protection plan to help address and reduce risks to bird species that may be affected by Company operations. PGE has implemented such a plan for its transmission, distribution, and thermal generation facilities and continues to finalize similar plans, referred to as Bird and Bat Conservation Strategies, for its wind generation facilities. In April 2015, PGE submitted an application, along with a draft Eagle Conservation Plan, to the USFWS, pertaining to Biglow Canyon that would address the incidental take of eagles, and expects to submit a similar application for Tucannon River in 2016. 

Hazardous Waste 

PGE has a comprehensive program to comply with requirements of both federal and state regulations related to hazardous waste storage, handling, and disposal. The handling and disposal of hazardous waste from Company facilities is subject to regulation under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). In addition, the use, disposal, and clean-up of polychlorinated biphenyls, contained in certain electrical equipment, are regulated under the federal Toxic Substances Control Act. 

The generation of electricity at Boardman and Colstrip produce a by-product known as coal combustion residuals (CCR), which have historically not been considered hazardous waste under the RCRA. In December 2014, the EPA signed a final rule, which became effective as of October 19, 2015, to regulate CCRs under the RCRA. Boardman produces dry CCRs that have historically been disposed at an on-site landfill, which is permitted and regulated by the state of Oregon under requirements similar to the new EPA rule. PGE has determined that it will continue use of the on-site landfill in compliance with the new rule, and the Company believes the new EPA rule will not have a material effect on operations at Boardman. PGE has been informed by the operator of Colstrip, however, that this rule will have an effect on operations at Colstrip, which produces wet CCRs. For further information, see &#8220;Asset Retirement Obligations&#8221; &#32;in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

PGE is also subject to regulation under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), commonly referred to as Superfund. The CERCLA provides authority to the EPA to assert joint and several liability for investigation and remediation costs for designated Superfund sites. 

A 1997 investigation by the EPA, of a segment of the Willamette River in Oregon known as Portland Harbor, revealed significant contamination of river sediments and prompted the EPA to subsequently include Portland Harbor on the federal National Priority List as a Superfund site pursuant to CERCLA. The EPA has listed PGE among the more than one hundred Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs), as PGE has historically owned or operated property near the river. 

For additional information on this EPA action, see Note 18, Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.&#8212;&#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#8221; 

Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the USDOE is responsible for the permanent storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel. PGE has contracted with the USDOE for permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel from Trojan that is stored in the Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation (ISFSI), an NRC-licensed interim dry storage facility that houses the fuel at the former plant site. The spent nuclear fuel is expected to remain in the ISFSI until permanent off-site storage is available. Shipment of the spent nuclear fuel from the ISFSI to off-site storage is not expected to be completed prior to 2033. For additional information regarding this matter, see &#8220; Trojan decommissioning activities &#8221; in Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.&#8212;&#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#8221;
