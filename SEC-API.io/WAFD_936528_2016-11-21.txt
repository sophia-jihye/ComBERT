Lending Programs and Policies. &#32;The Bank's lending activities include the commercial and consumer loans, including the following loan categories. 

Single-family residential loans . The Bank primarily originates 30 year fixed-rate mortgage loans secured by single-family residences. Moreover, it is the Bank's general policy to include in the documentation evidencing its conventional mortgage loans a due-on-sale clause, which facilitates adjustment of interest rates on such loans when the property securing the loan is sold or transferred. 

All of the Bank's mortgage lending is subject to written, nondiscriminatory underwriting standards, loan origination procedures and lending policies approved by the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board"). Property valuations are required on all real estate loans. Appraisals are prepared by independent appraisers, reviewed by staff of the Bank, and approved by the Bank's management. Property evaluations are sometimes utilized in lieu of appraisals on single-family real estate loans of $250,000 or less and are reviewed by the Bank's staff. Detailed loan applications are obtained to determine the borrower's ability to repay and the more significant items on these applications are verified through the use of credit reports, financial statements or written confirmations. 

Depending on the size of the loan involved, a varying number of officers of the Bank must approve the loan application before the loan can be granted. Federal guidelines limit the amount of a real estate loan made to a specified percentage of the value of the property securing the loan, as determined by an evaluation at the time the loan is originated. This is referred to as the loan-to-value ratio. The Board sets the maximum loan-to-value ratios for each type of real estate loan offered by the Bank. 

When establishing general reserves for loans with loan-to-value ratios exceeding 80% that are not insured by private mortgage insurance, the Bank considers the additional risk inherent in these products, as well as their relative loan loss experience, and provides reserves when deemed appropriate. The total balance for loans with loan-to-value ratios exceeding 80% at origination as of September 30, 2016 , was $477 million, with allocated reserves of $9.8 million. 

Construction loans . The Bank originates construction loans to finance construction of single-family and multi-family residences as well as commercial properties. Loans made to builders are generally tied to an interest rate index and normally have maturities of two years or less. Loans made to individuals for construction of their home generally are 30 year fixed rate loans. The Bank's policies provide that for residential construction loans, loans may be made for 85% or less of the appraised value of the property upon completion. As a result of activity over the past four decades, the Bank believes that builders of single-family residences in its primary market areas consider it to be a construction lender of choice. Because of this history, the Bank has developed a staff with in-depth land development and construction experience and working relationships with selected builders based on their operating histories and financial stability. 

Construction lending involves a higher level of risk than single-family residential lending due to the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers and the effects of general economic conditions in the homebuilding industry. Moreover, a construction loan can involve additional risks because of the inherent difficulty in estimating both the estimated cost (including interest) of the project and the property's value at completion of the project. 

Land loans . The Bank's land development loans are of a short-term nature and are generally made for 75% or less of the appraised value of the unimproved property. Funds are disbursed periodically at various stages of completion as authorized by the Company's personnel. The interest rate on these loans generally adjusts daily in accordance with a designated index. 

Land development loans involve a higher degree of credit risk than long-term financing on owner-occupied real estate. Mitigation of risk of loss on a land development loan is dependent largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property's value at completion of development compared to the estimated cost (including interest) of development and the financial strength of the borrower. 

The Bank's permanent land loans (also called consumer lot loans) are generally made on improved land, with the intent of building a primary or secondary residence. These loans are limited to 80% or less of the appraised value of the property, up to a maximum loan amount of $350,000. The interest rate on permanent land loans is generally fixed for 20 years. 

Multi-family residential loans . Multi-family residential (five or more dwelling units) loans generally are secured by multi-family rental properties, such as apartment buildings. In underwriting multi-family residential loans, the Bank considers a number of factors, which include the projected net cash flow to the loan's debt service requirement, the age and condition of the collateral, the financial resources and income level of the borrower and the borrower's experience in owning or managing similar properties. Multi-family residential loans are originated in amounts up to 80% of the appraised value of the property securing the loan. 

Loans secured by multi-family residential real estate generally involve a greater degree of credit risk than single-family residential loans and carry larger loan balances. This increased credit risk is a result of several factors, including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers, the effects of general economic conditions on income-producing properties, and the increased difficulty of evaluating and monitoring these types of loans. Furthermore, the repayment of loans secured by multi-family mortgages typically depends upon the successful operation of the related real estate property. If the cash flow from the project is reduced, the borrower's ability to repay the loan may be impaired. The Bank seeks to minimize these risks through its underwriting policies, which require such loans to be qualified at origination on the basis of the property's income and debt service ratio. 

It is the Bank's policy to obtain title insurance ensuring that it has a valid first lien on the mortgaged real estate serving as collateral for the loan. Borrowers must also obtain hazard insurance prior to closing and, when required by regulation, flood insurance. Borrowers may be required to advance funds on a monthly basis, together with each payment of principal and interest, to a mortgage escrow account from which the Bank makes disbursements for items such as real estate taxes, hazard insurance premiums and private mortgage insurance premiums when due. 

Commercial and industrial loans . The Bank makes various types of business loans to customers in its market area for working capital, acquiring real estate, equipment or other business purposes, such as acquisitions. The terms of these loans generally range from less than one year to a maximum of ten years. The loans are either negotiated on a fixed-rate basis or carry adjustable interest rates indexed to the LIBOR rate, prime rate or another market rate. 

&#160; 

Commercial loans are made based upon assessment of the borrower's ability and willingness to repay along with an evaluation of secondary repayment sources such as the value and marketability of collateral. Most such loans are extended to closely held businesses and the personal guaranty of the principals is usually obtained. Commercial loans have a relatively high risk of default compared to residential real estate loans. Pricing of commercial loans is based on the credit risk of the borrower with consideration given to the overall relationship of the borrower, including deposits. The acquisition of business deposits is an important focus of this business line. The Bank provides a full line of treasury management products to support the depository needs of its clients. 

Consumer loans . The Bank's non-mortgage consumer loan portfolio consists of approximately $118.4 million prime quality student loans acquired from an independent financial investment firm that retains 1% of each loan, plus various other non-mortgage consumer loans obtained through acquisitions. 

Home equity loans . The Bank extends revolving lines of credit to consumers that are secured by a first or second mortgage on a single family residence. The interest rate on these loans adjusts monthly indexed to prime. Total loan-to-value ratios when combined with any underlying first liens are limited to 80% or less. Loan terms are a ten year draw period followed by a fifteen year amortization period. 

Origination and Purchase of Loans. &#32;The Bank has general authority to lend anywhere in the United States; however, its primary lending areas are within the states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Arizona, Utah, Nevada, New Mexico and Texas. Loan originations come from a variety of sources. Residential loan originations result from referrals from real estate brokers, walk-in customers, purchasers of property in connection with builder projects that are financed by the Bank, mortgage brokers and refinancings for existing customers. Business purpose loans are obtained primarily by direct solicitation of borrowers and ongoing relationships. 

The Bank also purchases loans and mortgage-backed securities when lending rates and mortgage volume for new loan originations in its market area do not fulfill its needs. Over the past few years, single-family residential loan originations were lower than historical levels due to the low interest rate environment and excessive government participation in the mortgage market.

Interest Rates, Loan Fees and Service Charges. &#32;Interest rates charged by the Bank on mortgage loans are primarily determined by the competitive loan rates offered in its lending areas and in the secondary market. Mortgage loan rates reflect factors such as general interest rates, the supply of money available to the industry and the demand for such loans. General economic conditions, the regulatory programs and policies of federal and state agencies, including the FRB&#8217;s monetary policies, changes in tax laws and governmental budgetary programs influence these factors. 

The Bank receives fees for originating loans in addition to various fees and charges related to existing loans, including prepayment charges, late charges and assumption fees. In making one-to-four- family home mortgage loans, the Bank normally charges an origination fee and as part of the loan application, the borrower pays the Bank for out-of-pocket costs, such as the appraisal fee, whether or not the borrower closes the loan. The interest rate charged is normally the prevailing rate at the time the loan application is approved and accepted. In the case of construction loans, the Bank normally charges an origination fee. Loan origination fees and other terms of multi-family residential loans are individually negotiated. 

Non-Performing Assets. &#32;When a borrower violates a condition of a loan, the Bank attempts to cure the default by contacting the borrower. In most cases, defaults are cured promptly. If the default is not cured within an appropriate time frame, typically 90 days, the Bank may institute appropriate action to collect the loan, such as making demand for payment or initiating foreclosure proceedings on the collateral. If foreclosure occurs, the collateral will typically be sold at public auction and may be purchased by the Bank. 

Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when, in the judgment of management, the probability of collecting interest or principal is deemed to be insufficient to warrant further accrual. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, previously accrued but unpaid interest is deducted from interest income. The Bank does not accrue interest on loans 90 days past due or more. See Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 hereof for additional information. 

The Bank will consider modifying the interest rate and terms of a loan if it determines that a modification is deemed to be the best option available for collection in full or to minimize the loss to the Bank. Most loans restructured in troubled debt restructurings ("TDRs") are accruing and performing loans where the borrower has proactively approached the Bank about a modification due to temporary financial difficulties. Each request is individually evaluated for merit and likelihood of success. The modification of these loans is typically a payment reduction through a rate reduction of from 100 to 200 bps for a specific term, usually six to twelve months. Interest-only payments may also be approved during the modification period. Principal forgiveness generally is not an available option for restructured loans. As of September 30, 2016 , single-family residential loans comprised 87.2% &#32;of restructured loans. The Bank reserves for restructured loans within its allowance for loan loss methodology by taking into account the following performance indicators: 1) time since modification, 2) current payment status and 3) geographic market conditions. 

Real estate acquired by foreclosure or deed-in-lieu thereof (&#8220;REO&#8221; or &#8220;Real Estate Owned&#8221;) is classified as real estate held for sale. When property is acquired, it is recorded at the fair market value less estimated selling costs at the date of acquisition. Interest accrual ceases on the date of acquisition and all costs incurred in maintaining the property from that date forward are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred for the improvement or development of such property is capitalized. See Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 hereof for additional information. 

The following table sets forth information regarding the Company's restructured and non-accrual loans and REO.

For the year ended September 30, 2016 , the Company recognized $5,434,000 &#32;in interest income on cash payments received from borrowers on non-accrual loans. The Company would have recognized interest income of $2,348,000 &#32;for the same period had these loans performed according to their original contract terms. The recognized interest income may include more than twelve months of interest for some of the non-accrual loans that were brought current or paid off. In addition to the non-accrual loans reflected in the above table, the Company had $117,536,000 &#32;of loans that were less than 90 days delinquent at September 30, 2016 &#32;but were classified as substandard for one or more reasons. If these loans were deemed non-performing, the Company's ratio of total non-performing assets and performing restructured loans as a percent of total assets would have increased to 2.96% &#32;at September 30, 2016 . For a discussion of the Company's policy for placing loans on nonaccrual status, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 hereof. 

Allowance for Loan Losses. &#32;The Company maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The amount of this allowance is based on ongoing, quarterly assessments of the probable and estimable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The Bank&#8217;s method for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance is to apply a loss percentage factor to the different loan types. The loss percentage factor is made up of two parts - the historical loss factor (&#8220;HLF&#8221;) and the qualitative loss factor (&#8220;QLF&#8221;). The HLF takes into account historical charge-offs by loan type. The Company uses an average of historical loss rates for each loan category multiplied by an estimated loss emergence period. The QLFs are based on management's continuing evaluation of the pertinent factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio, including changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio, actual loan loss experience, current economic conditions, collateral values, geographic concentrations, seasoning of the loan portfolio, specific industry conditions, and the duration of the current business cycle. These factors are considered by loan type. Specific allowances are established in cases where management has identified conditions or circumstances related to a loan that management believes indicate the probability that a loss has been incurred. The Company has also established a reserve for unfunded commitments. 

As part of the process for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, management reviews the loan portfolio for specific weaknesses and considers the factors noted above. The recovery of the carrying value of loans is susceptible to future market conditions 

beyond the Bank's control, which may result in losses or recoveries differing from those provided. In those cases, a portion of the allowance is then allocated to reflect the estimated loss exposure. 

The following table provides detail regarding the Company's allowance for loan losses.

Sources of Funds 

General. &#32;Deposits are the primary source of the Bank&#8217;s funds for use in lending and other general business purposes. In addition to deposits, the Bank derives funds from loan repayments, advances from the FHLB, other borrowings, and from investment repayments and sales. Loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows are influenced by general interest rates, money market conditions, the availability of FDIC insurance and the market perception of the Company&#8217;s financial stability. Borrowings may be used on a short-term basis to compensate for reductions in normal sources of funds, such as deposit inflows at lower than projected levels. Borrowings may also be used on a longer-term basis to support expanded activities and to manage interest rate risk. 

Deposits. &#32;The Bank relies on a mix of deposit types, including business and personal checking accounts, term certificates of deposit, and other savings deposit alternatives that have no fixed term, such as money market accounts and passbook savings accounts The Bank offers several consumer checking account products, both interest bearing and non-interest bearing and three business checking accounts, two of which target small businesses with relatively simple and straightforward banking needs and one for larger, more complex business depositors with an account that prices monthly based on the volume and type of activity. Savings and money market accounts are offered to both businesses and consumers, with interest paid after certain threshold amounts are exceeded. 

Certificates of deposit with a maturity of one year or less have penalties for premature withdrawal equal to 90 days of interest. When the maturity is greater than one year but less than four years, the penalty is 180 days of interest. When the maturity is greater than four years, the penalty is 365 days interest. Early withdrawal penalty fee income for the year ended 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;amounted to $450,000 , $546,000 &#32;and $552,000 , respectively. 

The Bank&#8217;s deposits are obtained primarily from residents of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Arizona, Utah, Nevada, New Mexico and Texas. The Bank does not advertise for deposits outside of these states. 

The following table sets forth certain information relating to the Company&#8217;s deposits.

Historically, a significant number of certificate of deposit holders roll over their balances into new certificates of the same term at the Bank&#8217;s then current rate. To ensure a continuity of this trend, the Bank expects to continue to offer market rates of interest. Its ability to retain maturing deposits in certificate accounts is difficult to project; however, the Bank believes that by competitively pricing these certificates, levels deemed appropriate by management can be achieved on a continuing basis. 

At September 30, 2016 , the Bank had $442,510,000 &#32;of certificates of deposit in amounts of $250,000 or more outstanding, maturing as follows: $88,667,000 &#32;within 3 months; $89,305,000 &#32;over 3 months through 6 months; $97,485,000 &#32;over 6 months through 12 months; and $167,053,000 &#32;thereafter. 

Borrowings. &#32;The Bank has a credit line with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines ("FHLB") equal to 49.0% &#32;of total assets. The Bank obtains advances from the FHLB upon the security of the FHLB capital stock it owns and certain of its loans, provided certain standards related to credit worthiness have been met. See &#8220;Regulation-Washington Federal-Federal Home Loan Bank System&#8221; below. Such advances are made pursuant to several different credit programs. Each credit program has its own interest rate and range of maturities, and the FHLB prescribes acceptable uses to which the advances pursuant to each program may be put, as well as limitations on the size of such advances. Depending on the program, such limitations are based either on a fixed percentage of assets or the Company's credit worthiness. The FHLB is required to review its credit limitations and standards at least every two years. FHLB advances have, from time to time, been available to meet seasonal and other withdrawals of savings accounts and to expand the Bank's lending program. The Bank had $2,080,000,000 &#32;of FHLB advances outstanding at September 30, 2016 . 

The Bank may need to borrow funds for short periods of time to meet day-to-day financing needs. In these instances, funds are borrowed from other financial institutions or the Federal Reserve, for periods generally ranging from one to seven days at the then current borrowing rate. At September 30, 2016 , the Bank had no such short-term borrowings. 

&#160; 

The Bank also offers two forms of repurchase agreements to its customers. One form has an interest rate that floats like that of a money market deposit account. The other form has a fixed rate and is offered in a minimum denomination of $100,000. Both forms are fully collateralized by securities. These obligations are not insured by the FDIC and are classified as borrowings for regulatory purposes. The Bank had $48,920,000 &#32;of such agreements outstanding at September 30, 2016 .

Interest Rate Risk 

The primary source of income for the Company is net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income generated by interest-earning assets and the interest expense incurred for interest-bearing liabilities. The level of net interest income is a function of the average balance of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the difference between the yield on earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Both the pricing and mix of the Company's interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities influence these factors. All else being equal, if the interest rates on the Company's interest-bearing liabilities increase at a faster pace than the interest rates on its interest-earning assets, the result would be a reduction in net interest income and with it, a reduction in net earnings. 

The net interest margin is measured using the interest income and expense over the average assets and liabilities for the period. The net interest margin increased to 3.11% &#32;for the year ended September 30, 2016 &#32;from 3.08% &#32;for the year ended September 30, 2015 . The yield on earning assets increased 2 basis points to 3.97% &#32;and the cost of interest bearing liabilities declined by 1 basis point to 0.93% . The higher yield on earning assets is the result of changes in the asset mix as the average balance of mortgage-backed securities and other investment securities decreased while the average balance of loans receivable increased. The decrease in interest cost was due to changes in the mix of customer deposits and FHLB advances. 

Interest rate risk arises in part due to the Bank's significant holdings of fixed-rate single-family home loans, which are longer-term than customer accounts that constitute its primary liabilities. Accordingly, assets do not usually respond as quickly to changes in interest rates as liabilities. In the absence of management action, net interest income can be expected to decline when interest rates rise and to expand when interest rates fall. Shortening the maturity or repricing of the investment portfolio is one action that management can take. The composition of the investment portfolio was 39.7% &#32;variable rate and 60.3% &#32;fixed rate as of September 30, 2016 &#32;to provide some protection against rising rates. In addition, the Bank is producing more short term or variable rate loans and has increased less rate sensitive transaction accounts to 56.7% &#32;of the deposit portfolio. 

The Company's balance sheet strategy, in conjunction with low operating costs, has allowed the Company to manage interest rate risk, within guidelines established by the Board, through all interest rate cycles. It is management's objective to grow the dollar amount of net interest income, through the rate cycles, acknowledging that there will be some periods of time when that will not be feasible. 

The chart below shows the volatility of the Company's period end net interest spread (dotted line which is measured against the right axis) compared to the relatively consistent growth in net interest income (solid line which is measured against the left axis). As noted above, this consistency is accomplished by managing the size and composition of the balance sheet through different rate cycles. 

The following table shows the estimated repricing periods for earning assets and paying liabilities.

(1) Asset repricing period includes estimated prepayments based on historical activity 

At September 30, 2016 , the Company had approximately $1,503,542,000 &#32;more in liabilities subject to maturity or repricing in the next year than assets, which resulted in a one-year repricing gap of (10.1)% &#32;of total assets. This compares to the (13.4)% &#32;gap as of September 30, 2015 . A negative repricing gap implies that funding costs will change more rapidly than interest income on earning assets with movements in interest rates. A negative repricing gap typically results in lower margins when interest rates rise and higher margins when interest rates decline. The interest rate gap analysis provides management with a high-level indication of interest rate risk, but it is 

considered less reliable than more detailed modeling. Cash and cash equivalents of $450,368,000 &#32;and stockholders' equity of $1,975,731,000 &#32;provide management with additional flexibility in managing interest rate risk going forward. If management were to take steps to change the size and/or mix of the balance sheet or slow the repricing of deposit rates upward, rising rates might not cause a decrease in net interest income. 

The following table shows the potential impact of rising interest rates on net income for one year. The Company's focus is primarily on the impact of rising rates, given the negative gap position which implies that generally when rates fall income should increase and when rates increase income is at risk to decrease (assuming no change in the size or composition of the balance sheet). 

It is important to note that this is not a forecast or prediction of future events, but is used as a tool for measuring potential risk. This analysis assumes zero balance sheet growth and a constant percentage composition of assets and liabilities.

Actual results will differ from the assumptions used in this model, as management monitors and adjusts both the size and the composition of the balance sheet in order to respond to changing interest rates. In a rising interest rate environment, it is likely that the Company will grow its balance sheet to offset margin compression that may occur. Improvement in the net income sensitivity during the year is the result of changing the loan and deposit mix toward shorter term and/or floating rate instruments. 

&#32;Another method used to quantify interest rate risk is the net portfolio value (&#8220;NPV&#8221;) analysis. This analysis calculates the difference between the present value of interest-bearing liabilities and the present value of expected cash flows from interest-earning assets and off-balance-sheet contracts. The following tables set forth an analysis of the Company&#8217;s interest rate risk as measured by the estimated changes in NPV resulting from instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in the yield curve (measured in 100-basis-point increments).

Washington Federal is a bank holding company that conducts its primary business through its only directly-owned subsidiary, the Bank. The Bank has a national bank charter with the OCC. The Bank has three active wholly owned subsidiaries, discussed further below. 

WAFD Insurance Group, Inc. is incorporated under the laws of the state of Washington and is an insurance agency that offers a full line of individual and business insurance policies to customers of the Bank, as well as to the general public. As of September 30, 2016 &#32;and September 30, 2015 , WAFD Insurance Group, Inc. had total assets of $12,206,000 &#32;and $10,436,000 , respectively. 

Statewide Mortgage Services Company is incorporated under the laws of the state of Washington. As of September 30, 2016 &#32;and September 30, 2015 , Statewide Mortgage Services Company had total assets of $1,376,000 &#32;and $14,182,000 , respectively.

Regulation 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;Set forth below is a brief description of certain laws and regulations that relate to the regulation of the Company and the Bank. The description of these laws and regulations, and descriptions of laws and regulations contained elsewhere herein, do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to applicable laws and regulations. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) amended certain federal banking laws. 

The Company 

General. &#32;The Company is registered as a bank holding company and is subject to regulation, examination, supervision and reporting requirements of the Federal Reserve. 

Restrictions on Activities and Acquisitions. &#32;Bank holding companies are subject to a variety of restrictions on their activities and the acquisitions they can make. Generally, the activities or acquisition of a bank holding company that is not a financial holding company are limited to those that constitute banking or managing or controlling banks or which are closely related to banking. In addition, without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve, bank holding companies are generally prohibited from acquiring more than 5% of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding company, taking any action that causes a bank to become a subsidiary of the bank holding company, acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of a bank, or merging with another bank holding company. 

Control of Company or Bank. Pursuant to the Change in Bank Control Act, (the &#8220;CIBC Act&#8221;) individuals, corporations or other entities acquiring Company equity interests may, alone or together with other investors, be deemed to control a holding company or a bank. If an acquisition is deemed to constitute control of the holding company or bank and is not subject to approval under the Bank Holding Company Act or certain other statutes, such person or group will be required to file a notice under the CIBC Act. Generally, ownership of, or power to vote, more than 25% of any class of voting securities constitutes control. In the case of a bank or bank holding company the securities of which are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), ownership of or power to vote more than 10% of any class of voting securities creates a presumption of control. 

Source of Strength. Under long-standing Federal Reserve policy, a bank holding company is expected to serve as a source of financial and management strength to its subsidiary bank. Under this policy, a bank holding company is expected to stand ready to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary bank during periods of financial adversity and to maintain financial flexibility and capital raising capacity to assist its subsidiary bank. The Dodd-Frank Act codified the source of strength doctrine by adopting 

a statutory provision requiring, among other things, that bank holding companies serve as a source of financial strength to their subsidiary banks. 

Restrictions on Company Dividends. &#32;&#32;The Company&#8217;s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is affected by several factors. Since the Company is a separate legal entity from the Bank and its subsidiaries and does not have significant operations of its own, the Company may not be able to pay dividends to its shareholders if the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the Company. The Bank&#8217;s ability to pay dividends is subject to various regulatory restrictions. 

See &#8220;Washington Federal, National Association, wholly owned subsidiary (Bank) - Restrictions on Dividends.&#8221; In addition, the Company&#8217;s ability to pay dividends is subject to rules and policies of the Federal Reserve. It is the policy of the Federal Reserve that bank holding companies should pay cash dividends only out of income available over the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the company&#8217;s expected future needs and financial condition. New capital rules adopted by the Federal Reserve, effective in January 2015, may limit the Company&#8217;s ability to pay dividends if the Company fails to meet certain requirements under the rules. 

See &#8220;Washington Federal, National Association, wholly owned operating subsidiary (Bank) - Restrictions on Dividends.&#8221; 

Since the Company is a Washington state corporation, it is also subject to restrictions under Washington corporate law relating to dividends. Generally under Washington law, a corporation may not pay a dividend if, after giving effect to the dividend, the corporation would be unable to pay its liabilities as they become due in the ordinary course of business or the corporation&#8217;s total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus (with some exceptions) the amount that would be needed, if the corporation were to be dissolved at the time of the dividend payment, to satisfy the dissolution preferences of senior equity securities. 

Washington Federal, National Association, wholly-owned operating subsidiary (Bank) 

General. &#32;The Bank is a federally-chartered national bank and certain deposits of the bank are federally insured and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government. Accordingly, the Bank is subject to broad federal regulation and oversight by its primary regulator, the OCC, extending to all aspects of its operations. The Bank is a member of the FDIC and its deposits are insured up to applicable limits of the Depository Insurance Fund (&#8220;DIF&#8221;), which is administered by the FDIC. As a result, the FDIC has certain regulatory and examination authority over the Bank. 

As a national bank, the Bank is required to be a member of the Federal Reserve. As a member, it is required to purchase and maintain stock in the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (&#8220;FRBSF&#8221;) in an amount equal to 3.00% of the paid-up capital stock and surplus of the Bank and have available another 3.00% in reserves. At September 30, 2016 , the Bank had $24.0 million in FRBSF stock, which was in compliance with this requirement. 

Federal Institution Regulations. On July 17, 2013, the Bank completed its conversion from a federally chartered savings association to a national bank charter with the OCC. In addition, the Company became a bank holding company registered with the Federal Reserve. The OCC has extensive authority over the operations of national banks. As part of this authority, national banks are required to file periodic reports with the OCC and are subject to periodic examinations by the OCC. Federal laws and regulations prescribe the investment and lending authority of the Bank, and the Bank is prohibited from engaging in any activities not permitted by such laws and regulations. While the Bank has broad authority to engage in all types of lending activities, a variety of restrictions apply to certain other investments by the Bank. 

Financial Modernization. &#32;On July 21, 2010 the Dodd-Frank Act became effective. This law has broadly affected the financial services industry by implementing changes to the financial regulatory landscape aimed at strengthening the sound operation of the financial services industry, and will continue to significantly change the current bank regulatory structure and affect the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies, including the Company and the Bank. Some of the changes that are significant to the Company and the Bank include: 

The establishment of the CFPB, which on July 21, 2011 took over responsibility for the principal federal consumer protection laws, such as the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and the Truth in Saving Act, among others. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority in this area, and also has primary supervisory and examination authority on these issues over institutions such as the Bank with assets of $10 billion or more. The Dodd-Frank Act also gives the CFPB expanded data collecting powers for fair lending purposes for both small business and mortgage loans, as well as expanded authority to prevent unfair, deceptive and abusive practices. 

On October 9, 2013, the CFPB entered a Consent Order against the Bank that required the Bank to pay a civil money penalty of $34,000, and to adopt an enhanced compliance program related to reporting Home Mortgage Disclosure Act ("HMDA") data. The Bank has adopted an enhanced HMDA program, which continues to be subject to review by the CFPB. The Bank believes it continues to be in compliance with all material terms of the Order. 

As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve adopted a rule that restricted interchange fees applicable to debit card transactions. Effective October 1, 2011, interchange fees on debit card transactions are limited to a maximum of 21 cents per transaction plus 5 basis points of the transaction amount. A debit card issuer may recover an additional one cent per transaction for fraud prevention purposes if the issuer complies with certain fraud-related requirements prescribed by the Federal Reserve. 

Interstate Banking . Subject to certain limitations and restrictions, a bank holding company, with prior approval of the Federal Reserve, may acquire an out-of-state bank; banks in states that do not prohibit out-of-state mergers may merge with the approval of the appropriate federal banking agency, and a bank may establish a de novo branch out of state if such branching is permitted by the other state for state banks chartered by such other state. 

Insurance of Deposit Accounts. &#32;Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the maximum amount of federal deposit insurance coverage was permanently increased from $100,000 to $250,000 per depositor, per institution. Due to the significant number of bank failures and the current balance of the DIF, the Company anticipates continued elevated FDIC premiums for the industry going forward. Continued credit quality improvements have lessened this increase for the Company. The Dodd-Frank Act also broadened the base for FDIC insurance assessments. Assessments are now based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act raised the minimum designated reserve ratio, which the FDIC is required to set each year for the DIF, to 1.35% and requires that the DIF meet that minimum ratio by September 30, 2020. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds. The FDIC has established a higher reserve ratio of 2% as a long-term goal beyond what is required by statute. 

All insured institutions are also required to pay quarterly assessments to the FDIC in order to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation ("FICO"), a federal agency that was established to recapitalize a predecessor to the DIF. These assessments will continue until the FICO bonds mature, which will be between 2017 and 2019. The FICO assessment rate is subject to quarterly adjustment. The current rate is 0.0056% of average consolidated total assets minus tangible equity. 

&#160; 

Transactions with Affiliates; Insider Loans. Under current federal law, all transactions between and among a national bank and its affiliates, including holding companies, are subject to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W promulgated thereunder. Generally, these requirements limit extensions of credit and certain other such transactions by the bank to affiliates to a percentage of the institution's capital and generally such transactions must be collateralized. Generally, all affiliate transactions must be on terms at least as favorable to the bank as transactions with non-affiliates. In addition, a bank may not lend to any affiliate engaged in non-banking activities that are not permissible for a bank holding company or acquire shares of any affiliate that is not a subsidiary. The OCC is authorized to impose additional restrictions on transactions with affiliates if necessary to protect the safety and soundness of a national bank. 

Extensions of credit by a national bank to executive officers, directors and principal shareholders are subject to Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act, which, among other things, generally prohibits loans to any such individual where the aggregate amount exceeds an amount equal to 15% of an institution's unimpaired capital and surplus plus an additional 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus in the case of loans that are fully secured by readily marketable collateral. Section 22(h) permits loans to directors, executive officers and principal stockholders made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to employees of a subject bank provided that no preference is given to any officer, director or principal stockholder, or related interest thereto, over any other employee. In addition, the aggregate amount of extensions of credit by a bank to all insiders cannot exceed the institution's unimpaired capital and surplus. Furthermore, Section 22(g) places additional restrictions on loans to executive officers. 

Effective on July 21, 2012, the affiliate transaction rules in Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act were expanded to broaden the definition of affiliate and to apply these rules to securities lending, repurchase agreements and derivatives. These revisions also strengthened collateral requirements and limited Federal Reserve exemptive authority. Further, the definition of &#8220;extension of credit&#8221; for transactions with executive officers, directors and principal shareholders was expanded to include credit exposure arising from a derivative transaction, a repurchase or reverse repurchase agreement or a securities lending or borrowing transaction. These provisions have not had a material effect on the Company or the Bank. 

Restrictions on Dividends. OCC regulations govern dividends by a national bank. A national bank must file an application for approval of a dividend if: 

&#8226; the total dividends for the applicable calendar year exceed the sum of the institution's net income for that year to date plus the institution's retained net income for the preceding two years; 

&#8226; the institution would not be at least adequately capitalized following the dividend; 

&#8226; the dividend would violate any applicable statute, regulation, agreement or OCC imposed condition; or 

&#8226; the dividend is paid in property other than cash or stock of the bank. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Other capital distributions, such as stock repurchases, generally require the approval of the OCC. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements may place certain restrictions on the payment of dividends and stock repurchases. &#160; 

Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") of Des Moines, which is one of 11 regional FHLBs that provide funding to their members for making home mortgage loans, as well as loans for affordable housing and community development. Each FHLB serves members within its assigned region and is funded primarily through proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB system. Loans are made to members in accordance with the policies and procedures established by the Board of Directors of the FHLB. At September 30, 2016 , FHLB advances to the Company amounted to $2,080,000,000 . As a member, the Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB of Des Moines. At September 30, 2016 , the Company had $93.2 million in FHLB of Des Moines stock, which was in compliance with this requirement. 

Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws. National banks have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act ("CRA") and related regulations of the OCC to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act (together, the "Fair Lending Laws") prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. An institution's failure to comply with the provisions of the CRA could, at a minimum, result in regulatory restrictions on its activities. Failure to comply with the Fair Lending Laws could result in enforcement actions by the OCC, the CFPB, and other federal regulatory agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice. 

USA Patriot Act of 2001. &#32;The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 ("Patriot Act") substantially broadened the scope of United States anti money-laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial scope of United States jurisdiction. The United States Treasury Department has issued a number of regulations under the Patriot Act that apply to financial institutions such as the Bank. These regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply satisfactorily with all relevant Patriot Act requirements, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution. 

Regulatory Capital Requirements. Bank holding companies and federally insured banks are required to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital. The Federal Reserve establishes capital standards applicable to all bank holding companies, and the OCC establishes capital standards applicable to all national banks. The Federal Reserve and the OCC implemented new capital rules, effective January 1, 2015, that substantially amend the existing capital rules for bank holding companies and banks. These new rules reflect, in part, certain standards initially adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2010 (which standards are commonly referred to as &#8220;Basel III&#8221;) as well as requirements contemplated by the Dodd-Frank Act. 

The recent rules implemented a new capital ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk based assets. Common equity Tier 1 capital generally consists of retained earnings and common stock instruments (subject to certain adjustments) as well as accumulated other comprehensive income (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;) except to the extent that the Company and the Bank exercise a one-time irrevocable option to exclude certain components of AOCI, which the Company and the Bank have done. Tier 1 capital also includes non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and limited amounts of minority interests. Regulatory deductions from capital include goodwill and intangible assets. The new rules modify the manner in which certain capital elements are determined, including but not limited to, requiring certain deductions related to mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets. Total capital consists of Tier 1 capital and supplementary capital. Supplementary capital consists of certain capital instruments that do not qualify as core capital as well as general valuation loan and lease loss allowances up to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets. Supplementary capital may be used to satisfy the risk-based requirement only in an amount equal to the amount of Tier 1 capital. 

In determining the required amount of risk-based capital, total assets, including certain off-balance-sheet items, are multiplied by a risk-weight factor based on the risks inherent in the type of assets held by an institution. The risk categories range from 0% for low-risk assets such as U.S. Treasury securities and GNMA securities to 1,250% for various types of loans and other assets 

deemed to be of higher risk. Single-family residential loans having loan-to-value ratios not exceeding 80% and meeting certain additional criteria, as well as certain multi-family residential loans, qualify for a 50% risk-weight treatment. The book value of each asset is multiplied by the risk factor applicable to the asset category, and the sum of the products of this calculation equals total risk-weighted assets. The new rules make changes in the methods of calculating certain risk-based assets, which in turn affects the calculation of risk-based ratios. Higher or more sensitive risk weights are assigned to various categories of assets, among which are commercial real estate, credit facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property, certain exposures or credit that are 90 days past due or are nonaccrual, foreign exposures, certain corporate exposures, securitization exposures, equity exposures and in certain cases mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets. 

Both the Company and the Bank are required to have a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%. In addition, both the Company and the Bank are required to have a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based ratio of 6.0% and a total risk-based ratio of 8.0%. Both the Company and the Bank are required to establish a &#8220;conservation buffer,&#8221; consisting of common equity Tier 1 capital, equal to 2.5%. The capital conservation buffer is designed to ensure that banks build up capital buffers outside periods of stress, which can be drawn down as losses are incurred. An institution that does not meet the conservation buffer will be subject to restrictions on certain activities including payment of dividends, stock repurchases and discretionary bonuses to executive officers. The conservation buffer is phased in beginning in 2016 and will take full effect on January 1, 2019. Certain calculations under the rules will also have phase-in periods. 

The Federal Reserve and the OCC are also authorized to impose capital requirements in excess of these standards on individual institutions on a case-by-case basis. Management believes that the current capital levels of the Company and the Bank are sufficient to be in compliance with the fully phased-in standards under the new rules. 

Any bank holding company or national bank that fails the capital requirements is subject to possible enforcement actions. Such actions could include a capital directive, a cease and desist order, civil money penalties, restrictions on an institution's operations and/or the appointment of a conservator or receiver. Federal Reserve and OCC capital regulations provide that such supervisory actions, through enforcement proceedings or otherwise, could require one or more of a variety of corrective actions. 

For information regarding compliance with each of these capital requirements by the Company and the Bank as of September 30, 2016 , see Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 hereof. 

Prompt Corrective Action. Federal statutes establish a supervisory framework based on five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. An institution&#8217;s category depends upon its capital levels in relation to relevant capital measures, which include a risk-based capital measure, a leverage ratio capital measure and certain other factors. The federal banking agencies have adopted regulations that implement this statutory framework. 

The prompt corrective action rules, which apply to the Bank but not the Company, are modified to include a common equity Tier 1 risk-based ratio and to increase certain other capital requirements for the various thresholds. For example, the requirements for the Bank to be considered well-capitalized under the rules are a 5.0% Tier 1 leverage ratio, a 6.5% common equity Tier 1 risk-based ratio, an 8.0% Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and a 10.0% total risk-based capital ratio. To be adequately capitalized, those ratios are 4.0%, 4.5%. 6.0% and 8.0%, respectively. 

An institution that is not well capitalized is subject to certain restrictions on brokered deposits, including restrictions on the rates it can offer on its deposits, generally. Any institution that is neither well capitalized nor adequately capitalized is considered undercapitalized. Federal law authorizes the OCC to reclassify a well-capitalized institution as adequately capitalized and may require an adequately capitalized institution or an undercapitalized institution to comply with supervisory actions as if it were in the next lower category. The OCC may not reclassify a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized. As of September 30, 2016 , the Bank exceeded the requirements of a well capitalized institution. 

Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests ("DFAST"). The Federal Reserve and the OCC have issued final rules establishing company-run annual stress tests for bank holding companies and national banks, respectively, with assets between $10 and $50 billion. 

Management has conducted stress tests to quantify the impact of changing economic conditions on asset quality, net income, and capital. These stress tests are used to assist in the determination of whether capital is sufficient to absorb losses that could result from adverse economic conditions. It also assists management in thinking critically about the external environment by focusing on changing markets and discussing future trends, and it enables management to form contingency plans in the event of downside scenarios. The nine-quarter stress test results as of December 31, 2015 for the Company and the Bank were submitted to the Federal Reserve and the OCC by the July 31, 2016 deadline, and the severe adverse results were filed in an 8-K on October 27, 2016. 

&#160; 

Taxation 

Federal Taxation. &#32;For federal and state income tax purposes, the Company reports its income and expenses on the accrual basis method of accounting and files its federal and state income tax returns on a September 30, fiscal year basis. The Company files consolidated federal and state income tax returns with its subsidiaries. 

The Company has been examined by the Internal Revenue Service through the year ended September 30, 2012. There were no material changes made to the Company&#8217;s originally reported taxable income as a result of their most recent examination. 

State Taxation. &#32;The states of Washington and Nevada do not have state income taxes. A business and occupation tax based on a percentage of gross receipts is assessed against businesses in Washington; however, interest received on loans secured by mortgages or deeds of trust on residential properties is not subject to this tax. 

&#8226; 

The state of Idaho has a corporate income tax with a statutory rate of 7.4% of apportionable income. 

&#8226; 

The state of Oregon has a corporate excise tax with a statutory rate of 6.6% on the first $1 million of apportionable income and then 7.6% over $1 million of apportionable income. 

&#8226; 

The state of Utah has a corporate franchise tax with a statutory rate of 5.0% of apportionable income. 

&#8226; 

The state of Arizona has a corporate income tax with a statutory rate of 5.5% for the 2016 tax year; and 4.9% for tax years beginning after 2016 of apportionable income. 

&#8226; 

The state of Texas has a corporate franchise tax with a statutory rate of 0.75% for tax years beginning in 2016 of marginal apportionable income. 

&#8226; 

The state of New Mexico has a corporate income tax with statutory rates ranging from 4.8% to 6.9% of apportionable income over $1 million.
