Business.

&#160; 

The Company 

&#160; 

Mercantile Bank Corporation is a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the &#8220;Bank Holding Company Act&#8221;). Unless the text clearly suggests otherwise, references to &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; or &#8220;the company&#8221; include Mercantile Bank Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. As a bank holding company, we are subject to regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;Federal Reserve Board&#8221;). We were organized on July 15, 1997, under the laws of the State of Michigan, primarily for the purpose of holding all of the stock of Mercantile Bank of Michigan (&#8220;our bank&#8221;), and of such other subsidiaries as we may acquire or establish. Our bank commenced business on December 15, 1997. During the third quarter of 2013, we filed an election to become a financial holding company, which election became effective April 14, 2014. 

&#160; 

Mercantile Insurance Center, Inc. (&#8220;our insurance company&#8221;), a subsidiary of our bank, commenced operations during 2002 to offer insurance products. Mercantile Bank Real Estate Co., L.L.C., (&#8220;our real estate company&#8221;), a subsidiary of our bank, was organized on July 21, 2003, principally to develop, construct and own our facility in downtown Grand Rapids which serves as our bank&#8217;s main office and Mercantile Bank Corporation&#8217;s headquarters. 

&#160; 

Our expenses have generally been paid using cash dividends from our bank. Our principal source of future operating funds is expected to be dividends from our bank. 

&#160; 

Firstbank Corporation Merger 

&#160; 

We completed our merger with Firstbank Corporation (&#8220;Firstbank&#8221;), a Michigan corporation with approximately $1.5 billion in total assets and 46 branch locations, into Mercantile Bank Corporation as of June 1, 2014 (&#8220;Merger Date&#8221;). The merger was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, with Mercantile treated as the acquirer for accounting purposes. The results of operations due to the Firstbank transaction have been included in Mercantile&#8217;s financial results since the Merger Date. All of Firstbank&#8217;s common stock was converted into the right to receive one share of Mercantile common stock for each share of Firstbank common stock. The conversion of Firstbank&#8217;s common stock into Mercantile&#8217;s common stock resulted in Mercantile issuing 8,087,272 shares of common stock. As of the Merger Date, former Firstbank shareholders owned approximately 48% of the combined company. The merger substantially expanded our geographic footprint and increased the size of our balance sheet. 

&#160; 

In conjunction with the completion of the merger, Mercantile assumed the obligations of Firstbank Capital Trust I, Firstbank Capital Trust II, Firstbank Capital Trust III and Firstbank Capital Trust IV, all of which are business trust subsidiaries formed to issue trust preferred securities. At the Merger Date, Firstbank had two Michigan-chartered bank subsidiaries that were consolidated into Mercantile Bank of Michigan effective June 30, 2014. 

&#160; 

Our Bank 

&#160; 

Our bank is a state banking company that operates under the laws of the State of Michigan, pursuant to a charter issued by the Michigan Office of Financial and Insurance Regulation. Our bank&#8217;s deposits are insured to the maximum extent permitted by law by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;). Our bank, through its 48 office locations, provides commercial banking services primarily to small- to medium-sized businesses and retail banking services in and around the West and Central portions of Michigan. Our bank&#8217;s main office is located in Grand Rapids, with branch office locations in Alma, Belding, Cadillac, Canadian Lakes, Clare, Comstock Park, DeWitt, Fairview, Grand Rapids, Hale, Hastings, Holland, Howard City, Ionia, Ithaca, Kalamazoo, Kentwood, Lakeview, Lansing, Lowell, Merrill, Mt. Pleasant, Paw Paw, Portage, Remus, Rose City, Shepherd, St. Charles, St. Helen, St. Johns, Vestaburg, West Branch, and Wyoming. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

2.

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

Our bank makes secured and unsecured commercial, construction, mortgage and consumer loans, and accepts checking, savings and time deposits. Our bank owns 48 automated teller machines ("ATM") located at certain of our office locations and at one off-site location that participate in the ACCEL/EXCHANGE and PLUS regional network systems, as well as other ATM networks throughout the country. Our bank also enables customers to conduct certain loan and deposit transactions by personal computer and through mobile applications. Courier service is provided to certain commercial customers, and safe deposit facilities are available at a vast majority of our office locations. Our bank does not have trust powers. 

&#160; 

Our Insurance Company 

&#160; 

Our insurance company acquired an existing shelf insurance agency effective April 15, 2002. An Agency and Institution Agreement was entered into among our insurance company, our bank and Hub International for the purpose of providing programs of mass marketed personal lines of insurance. Insurance product offerings include private passenger automobile, homeowners, personal inland marine, boat owners, recreational vehicle, dwelling fire, umbrella policies, small business and life insurance products, all of which are provided by and written through companies that have appointed Hub International as their agent. 

&#160; 

Our Real Estate Company 

&#160; 

Our real estate company was organized on July 21, 2003, principally to develop, construct and own our facility in downtown Grand Rapids that serves as our bank&#8217;s main office and Mercantile Bank Corporation&#8217;s headquarters. This facility was placed into service during the second quarter of 2005. Our real estate company is 99% owned by our bank and 1% owned by our insurance company. 

&#160; 

Our Trusts 

&#160; 

We have five business trusts that are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Mercantile, four of which were assumed by Mercantile in conjunction with the merger with Firstbank. Each of the trusts was formed to issue Preferred Securities that were sold in private sales, as well as selling Common Securities to Mercantile. The proceeds from the Preferred and Common Securities sales were used by the trusts to purchase Floating Rate Notes issued by Mercantile. The rates of interest, interest payment dates, call features and maturity dates of each Floating Rate Note are identical to its respective Preferred Securities. The net proceeds from the issuance of the Floating Rate Notes were used for a variety of purposes, including contributions to our bank as capital to provide support for asset growth and the funding of stock repurchase programs and certain acquisitions. 

&#160; 

The only significant assets of our trusts are the Floating Rate Notes, and the only significant liabilities of our trusts are the Preferred Securities. The Floating Rate Notes are categorized on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as subordinated debentures, and the interest expense is recorded on our Consolidated Statements of Income under interest expense on other borrowings. 

&#160; 

Effect of Government Monetary Policies 

&#160; 

Our earnings are affected by domestic economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States Government, its agencies, and the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s monetary policies have had, and will likely continue to have, an important impact on the operating results of commercial banks through its power to implement national monetary policy in order to, among other things, curb inflation, maintain or encourage employment, and mitigate economic recessions. The policies of the Federal Reserve Board have a major effect upon the levels of bank loans, investments and deposits through its open market operations in United States Government securities, and through its regulation of, among other things, the discount rate on borrowings of member banks and the reserve requirements against member bank deposits. Our bank maintains reserves directly with the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago to the extent required by law. It is not possible to predict the nature and impact of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

3.

&#160;

&#160; 

Regulation and Supervision 

&#160; 

As a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act, we are required to file an annual report with the Federal Reserve Board and such additional information as the Federal Reserve Board may require. We are also subject to examination by the Federal Reserve Board. 

&#160; 

The Bank Holding Company Act limits the activities of bank holding companies to banking and the management of banking organizations, and to certain non-banking activities. The permitted non-banking activities include those limited activities that the Federal Reserve Board found, by order or regulation as of the day prior to enactment of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to banking. These permitted non-banking activities include, among other things: operating a mortgage company, finance company, or factoring company; performing certain data processing operations; providing certain investment and financial advice; acting as an insurance agent for certain types of credit-related insurance; leasing property on a full-payout, nonoperating basis; and providing discount securities brokerage services for customers. Neither we nor any of our subsidiaries engage in any of the non-banking activities listed above. 

&#160; 

On April 14, 2014, our election to become a financial holding company, as permitted by the Bank Holding Company Act, as amended by Title I of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, was accepted by the Federal Reserve Board. In order to continue as a financial holding company, we and our bank must satisfy statutory requirements regarding capitalization, management and compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. As a financial holding company, we are permitted to engage in a broader range of activities under the Bank Holding Company Act than are permitted to bank holding companies. Those expanded activities include any activity which the Federal Reserve Board (in certain instances in consultation with the Department of the Treasury) determines, by order or by regulation, to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity, or to be complementary to a financial activity, and not to pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions of the financial system generally. Such expanded activities include, among others: insuring, guaranteeing, or indemnifying against loss, harm, damage, illness, disability or death, or issuing annuities, and acting as principal, agent or broker for such purposes; providing financial, investment or economic advisory services, including advising a mutual fund; and underwriting, dealing in, or making a market in securities. While our insurance company is permitted to engage in the insurance agency activities described above by virtue of our financial holding company status, neither we nor any of our subsidiaries currently engage in the expanded activities. 

&#160; 

Our bank is subject to restrictions imposed by federal law and regulation. Among other things, these restrictions apply to any extension of credit to us or to our other subsidiaries, to securities borrowing or lending, derivatives, and repurchase transactions with us or our other subsidiaries, to investments in stock or other securities that we issue, to the taking of such stock or securities as collateral for loans to any borrower, and to acquisitions of assets or services from, and sales of certain types of assets to, us or our other subsidiaries. Federal law restricts our ability to borrow from our bank by limiting the aggregate amount we may borrow and by requiring that all loans to us be secured in designated amounts by specified forms of collateral. 

&#160; 

With respect to the acquisition of banking organizations, we are generally required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board before we can acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank, or acquire ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank or bank holding company, if, after the acquisition, we would own or control more than 5% of the voting shares of the bank or bank holding company. Acquisitions of banking organizations across state lines are subject to restrictions imposed by federal and state laws and regulations. 

&#160; 

The scope of existing regulation and supervision of various aspects of our business has expanded, and continues to expand, as a result of the adoption in July, 2010 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;), and of implementing regulations that are being adopted by federal regulators. For additional information on this legislation and its potential impact, refer to the Risk Factor entitled &#8220;The effect of financial services legislation and regulations remains uncertain&#8221; in Item 1A- Risk Factors in this Annual Report.

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we employed 558 full-time and 143 part-time persons. Management believes that relations with employees are good. 

&#160; 

Lending Policy 

&#160; 

As a routine part of our business, we make loans to businesses and individuals located within our market areas. Our lending policy states that the function of the lending operation is twofold: to provide a means for the investment of funds at a profitable rate of return with an acceptable degree of risk, and to meet the credit needs of the creditworthy businesses and individuals who are our customers. We recognize that in the normal business of lending, some losses on loans will be inevitable and should be considered a part of the normal cost of doing business. 

&#160; 

Our lending policy anticipates that priorities in extending loans will be modified from time to time as interest rates, market conditions and competitive factors change. The policy sets forth guidelines on a nondiscriminatory basis for lending in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. The policy describes various criteria for granting loans, including the ability to pay; the character of the customer; evidence of financial responsibility; purpose of the loan; knowledge of collateral and its value; terms of repayment; source of repayment; payment history; and economic conditions. 

&#160; 

The lending policy further limits the amount of funds that may be loaned against specified types of real estate collateral. For certain loans secured by real estate, the policy requires an appraisal of the property offered as collateral by a state certified independent appraiser. The policy also provides general guidelines for loan to value for other types of collateral, such as accounts receivable and machinery and equipment. In addition, the policy provides general guidelines as to environmental analysis, loans to employees, executive officers and directors, problem loan identification, maintenance of an allowance for loan losses, loan review and grading, mortgage and consumer lending, and other matters relating to our lending practices. 

&#160; 

The Board of Directors has delegated significant lending authority to officers of our bank. The Board of Directors believes this empowerment, supported by our strong credit culture and the significant experience of our commercial lending staff, enables us to be responsive to our customers. The loan policy specifies lending authority for our lending officers with amounts based on the experience level and ability of each lender. Our loan officers and loan managers are able to approve loans up to $1.0 million and $2.5 million, respectively. We have established higher approval limits for our bank&#8217;s Senior Lender, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman of the Board ranging from $4.0 million up to $10.0 million. These lending authorities, however, are typically used only in rare circumstances where timing is of the essence. Generally, loan requests exceeding $2.5 million require approval by the Officers Loan Committee, and loan requests exceeding $7.5 million, up to the legal lending limit of approximately $80.2 million, require approval by the bank&#8217;s Board of Directors. We apply an in-house lending limit that is significantly less than our bank&#8217;s legal lending limit. 

&#160; 

Provisions of recent legislation, including the Dodd-Frank Act, when fully implemented by regulations to be adopted by federal agencies, may have a significant impact on our lending policy, especially in the areas of single-family residential real estate and other consumer lending. For additional information on this legislation and its potential impact, refer to the Risk Factors entitled &#8220;The effect of financial services legislation and regulations remains uncertain&#8221; and &#8220;Our single-family real estate lending business faces significant change&#8221; in Item 1A- Risk Factors in this Annual Report. 

&#160; 

Lending Activity 

&#160; 

Commercial Loans. Our commercial lending group originates commercial loans primarily in our market areas. Our commercial lenders have extensive commercial lending experience, with most having at least ten years&#8217; experience. Loans are originated for general business purposes, including working capital, accounts receivable financing, machinery and equipment acquisition, and commercial real estate financing, including new construction and land development. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

5.

&#160;

&#160; 

Working capital loans are often structured as a line of credit and are reviewed periodically in connection with the borrower&#8217;s year-end financial reporting. These loans are generally secured by substantially all of the assets of the borrower and have a floating interest rate tied to the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate or 30-day Libor Rate. Loans for machinery and equipment purposes typically have a maturity of three to five years and are fully amortizing, while commercial real estate loans are usually written with a five-year maturity and amortize over a 10- to 20-year period. Commercial loans typically have an interest rate that is fixed to maturity or is tied to the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate or 30-day Libor Rate. 

&#160; 

We evaluate many aspects of a commercial loan transaction in order to minimize credit and interest rate risk. Underwriting includes an assessment of the management, products, markets, cash flow, capital, income and collateral of the borrowing entity. This analysis includes a review of the borrower&#8217;s historical and projected financial results. Appraisals are generally required to be performed by certified independent appraisers where real estate is the primary collateral, and in some cases, where equipment is the primary collateral. In certain situations, for creditworthy customers, we may accept title reports instead of requiring lenders&#8217; policies of title insurance. 

&#160; 

Commercial real estate lending involves more risk than residential lending because loan balances are typically greater and repayment is dependent upon the borrower&#8217;s business operations. We attempt to minimize the risks associated with these transactions by generally limiting our commercial real estate lending to owner-operated properties and to owners of non-owner occupied properties who have an established profitable history and satisfactory tenant structure. In many cases, risk is further reduced by requiring personal guarantees, limiting the amount of credit to any one borrower to an amount considerably less than our legal lending limit and avoiding certain types of commercial real estate financings. 

&#160; 

We have no material foreign loans, and only limited exposure to companies engaged in energy producing and agricultural-related activities. 

&#160; 

Single-Family Residential Real Estate Loans. We originate single-family residential real estate loans in our market areas, generally according to secondary market underwriting standards. Loans not conforming to those standards are made in certain circumstances. Single-family residential real estate loans provide borrowers with a fixed or adjustable interest rate with terms up to 30 years and are generally sold to certain investors. 

&#160; 

Our bank has a home equity line of credit program. Home equity lines of credit are generally secured by either a first or second mortgage on the borrower&#8217;s primary residence. The program provides revolving credit at a rate tied to the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate. 

&#160; 

Consumer Loans. We originate consumer loans for a variety of personal financial needs, including new and used automobiles, boats, credit cards and overdraft protection for our checking account customers. Consumer loans generally have shorter terms and higher interest rates and usually involve more credit risk than single-family residential real estate loans because of the type and nature of the collateral. 

&#160; 

We believe our consumer loans are underwritten carefully, with a strong emphasis on the amount of the down payment, credit quality, employment stability and monthly income of the borrower. These loans are generally repaid on a monthly repayment schedule with the source of repayment tied to the borrower&#8217;s periodic income. In addition, consumer lending collections are dependent on the borrower&#8217;s continuing financial stability, and are thus likely to be adversely affected by job loss, illness and personal bankruptcy. In many cases, repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan will not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance because of depreciation of the underlying collateral. 

&#160; 

We believe that the generally higher yields earned on consumer loans compensate for the increased credit risk associated with such loans, and that consumer loans are important to our efforts to serve the credit needs of the communities and customers that we serve. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

6.

&#160;

&#160; 

Loan Portfolio Quality 

&#160; 

We utilize a comprehensive grading system for our commercial loans, whereby all commercial loans are graded on a ten grade rating system. The rating system utilizes standardized grade paradigms that analyze several critical factors such as cash flow, operating performance, financial condition, collateral, industry condition and management. All commercial loans are graded at inception and reviewed at various intervals. 

&#160; 

Our independent loan review program is primarily responsible for the administration of the grading system and ensuring adherence to established lending policies and procedures. The loan review program is an integral part of maintaining our strong asset quality culture. The loan review function works closely with senior management, although it functionally reports to the Board of Directors. Using a risk-based approach to selecting credits for review, our loan review program covers approximately 40% of total loans outstanding each year. Our watch list credits are reviewed monthly by our Board of Directors and our Watch List Committee, the latter of which is comprised of senior level officers from the administration, lending and loan review functions. 

&#160; 

Loans are placed in a nonaccrual status when, in our opinion, uncertainty exists as to the ultimate collection of all principal and interest. As of December 31, 2015, loans placed in nonaccrual status totaled $5.4 million, or 0.2% of total loans, compared to $29.4 million, or 1.4% of total loans, at December 31, 2014. Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest at year-end 2015 and 2014 totaled less than $0.1 million. 

&#160; 

Additional detail and information relative to the loan portfolio is incorporated by reference to Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (&#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis&#8221;) and Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report. 

&#160; 

Allowance for Loan Losses 

&#160; 

In each accounting period, we adjust the allowance to the amount we believe is necessary to maintain the allowance at an adequate level. Through the loan review and credit departments, we establish specific portions of the allowance based on specifically identifiable problem loans. The evaluation of the allowance is further based on, but not limited to, consideration of the internally prepared Allowance Analysis, loan loss migration analysis, composition of the loan portfolio, third party analysis of the loan administration processes and portfolio, and general economic conditions. 

&#160; 

The Allowance Analysis applies reserve allocation factors to non-impaired outstanding loan balances, the result of which is combined with specific reserves to calculate an overall allowance dollar amount. For non-impaired commercial loans, reserve allocation factors are based on the loan ratings as determined by our standardized grade paradigms and by loan purpose. Our commercial loan portfolio is segregated into five classes: 1) commercial and industrial loans; 2) vacant land, land development and residential construction loans; 3) owner occupied real estate loans; 4) non-owner occupied real estate loans; and 5) multi-family and residential rental property loans. The reserve allocation factors are primarily based on the historical trends of net loan charge-offs through a migration analysis whereby net loan losses are tracked via assigned grades over various time periods, with adjustments made for environmental factors reflecting the current status of, or recent changes in, items such as: lending policies and procedures; economic conditions; nature and volume of the loan portfolio; experience, ability and depth of management and lending staff; volume and severity of past due, nonaccrual and adversely classified loans; effectiveness of the loan review program; value of underlying collateral; lending concentrations; and other external factors, including competition and regulatory environment. Adjustments for specific lending relationships, particularly impaired loans, are made on a case-by-case basis. Non-impaired retail loan reserve allocations are determined in a similar fashion as those for non-impaired commercial loans, except that retail loans are segmented by type of credit and not a grading system. We regularly review the Allowance Analysis and make adjustments periodically based upon identifiable trends and experience. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

7.

&#160;

&#160; 

A migration analysis is completed quarterly to assist us in determining appropriate reserve allocation factors for non-impaired commercial loans. Our migration takes into account various time periods, with most weight placed on the twenty-quarter time frame. At year-end 2014 and for several years leading up to that date, we had been placing most weight on the twelve-quarter time frame. During 2015, we made the change to reflect our belief that the twenty-quarter period represents an appropriate range of economic conditions, and that it provides for an appropriate basis in determining reserve allocation factors given current economic conditions and the general market consensus of economic conditions in the near future. 

&#160; 

Although the migration analysis provides an accurate historical accounting of our net loan losses, it is not able to fully account for environmental factors that will also very likely impact the collectability of our commercial loans as of any quarter-end date. Therefore, we incorporate the environmental factors as adjustments to the historical data. Environmental factors include both internal and external items. We believe the most significant internal environmental factor is our credit culture and the relative aggressiveness in assigning and revising commercial loan risk ratings, with the most significant external environmental factor being the assessment of the current economic environment and the resulting implications on our commercial loan portfolio. 

&#160; 

The primary risk elements with respect to commercial loans are the financial condition of the borrower, the sufficiency of collateral, and the timeliness of scheduled payments. We have a policy of requesting and reviewing periodic financial statements from commercial loan customers, and we have a disciplined and formalized review of the existence of collateral and its value. The primary risk element with respect to each residential real estate loan and consumer loan is the timeliness of scheduled payments. We have a reporting system that monitors past due loans and have adopted policies to pursue creditor&#8217;s rights in order to preserve our collateral position. 

&#160; 

Additional detail regarding the allowance is incorporated by reference to Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis and Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report. 

&#160; 

Investments 

&#160; 

Bank Holding Company Investments . The principal investments of our bank holding company are the investments in the common stock of our bank and the common securities of our trusts. Other funds of our bank holding company may be invested from time to time in various debt instruments. 

&#160; 

Subject to the limitations of the Bank Holding Company Act and the &#8220;Volcker Rule&#8221;, we are also permitted to make portfolio investments in equity securities and to make equity investments in subsidiaries engaged in a variety of non-banking activities, which include real estate-related activities such as community development, real estate appraisals, arranging equity financing for commercial real estate, and owning and operating real estate used substantially by our bank or acquired for its future use. Our bank holding company has no plans at this time to make directly any of these equity investments at the bank holding company level. Our Board of Directors may, however, alter the investment policy at any time without shareholder approval. 

&#160; 

Our Bank&#8217;s Investments . Our bank may invest its funds in a wide variety of debt instruments and may participate in the federal funds market with other depository institutions. Subject to certain exceptions, our bank is prohibited from investing in equity securities. Among the equity investments permitted for our bank under various conditions and subject in some instances to amount limitations, are shares of a subsidiary insurance agency, mortgage company, real estate company, or Michigan business and industrial development company, such as our insurance company and our real estate company. Under another such exception, in certain circumstances and with prior notice to or approval of the FDIC, our bank could invest up to 10% of its total assets in the equity securities of a subsidiary corporation engaged in the acquisition and development of real property for sale, or the improvement of real property by construction or rehabilitation of residential or commercial units for sale or lease. Our bank has no present plans to make such an investment. Real estate acquired by our bank in satisfaction of or foreclosure upon loans may be held by our bank for specified periods. Our bank is also permitted to invest in such real estate as is necessary for the convenient transaction of its business. Our bank&#8217;s Board of Directors may alter the bank&#8217;s investment policy without shareholder approval at any time.

Additional detail and information relative to the securities portfolio is incorporated by reference to Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We face substantial competition in all phases of our operations from a variety of different competitors. We compete for deposits, loans and other financial services with numerous Michigan-based and national and regional banks, savings banks, thrifts, credit unions and other financial institutions as well as from other entities that provide financial services. Some of the financial institutions and financial service organizations with which we compete are not subject to the same degree of regulation as we are. Many of our primary competitors have been in business for many years, have established customer bases, are larger, have substantially higher lending limits than we do, and offer larger branch networks and other services which we do not. Most of these same entities have greater capital resources than we do, which, among other things, may allow them to price their services at levels more favorable to the customer and to provide larger credit facilities than we do. Under specified circumstances (that have been modified by the Dodd-Frank Act), securities firms and insurance companies that elect to become financial holding companies under the Bank Holding Company Act may acquire banks and other financial institutions. Federal banking law affects the competitive environment in which we conduct our business. The financial services industry is also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services.
