BUSINESS 

Description of Business 

Tredegar Corporation (&#8220;Tredegar&#8221;), a Virginia corporation incorporated in 1988, is engaged, through its subsidiaries, in the manufacture of polyethylene (&#8220;PE&#8221;) plastic films, polyester (&#8220;PET&#8221;) films and aluminum extrusions. The financial information related to Tredegar&#8217;s PE films, PET films and aluminum extrusions segments and related geographical areas included in Note 5 of the Notes to Financial Statements &#32;is incorporated herein by reference. Unless the context requires otherwise, all references herein to &#8220;Tredegar,&#8221; &#8220;the Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221; are to Tredegar Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. 

Tredegar has historically reported two business segments: Film Products and Aluminum Extrusions. In the third quarter of 2015, the Company divided Film Products into two separate reportable segments: PE Films and Flexible Packaging Films. As part of its transition to a new executive leadership team, the Company&#8217;s management decided to discontinue its efforts to integrate Terphane Holdings, LLC (&#8220;Terphane&#8221;) with its PE film products operations. In separating PE Films and Flexible Packaging Films, the Company&#8217;s management believes that it will be able to more effectively manage the distinct opportunities and challenges that each of these businesses face. Therefore, the Company's reportable business segments are now PE Films, Flexible Packaging Films and Aluminum Extrusions. 

PE Films

Raw Materials . The primary raw materials used by Aluminum Extrusions consist of aluminum ingot, aluminum scrap and various alloys, which are purchased from domestic and foreign producers in open-market purchases and under short-term contracts. Aluminum Extrusions believes that it has adequate long-term supply agreements for aluminum and other required raw materials and supplies in the foreseeable future. 

General 

Intellectual Property . Tredegar considers patents, licenses and trademarks to be significant to PE Films. As of December 31, 2015 , PE Films held 280 &#32;issued patents ( 81 &#32;of which are issued in the U.S.) and 107 &#32;trademarks ( 10 &#32;of which are issued in the 

U.S.). Flexible Packaging Films held 1 patent, which is issued in the U.S. and 14 trademarks (2 of which are issued in the U.S.). Aluminum Extrusions held no U.S. patents and three &#32;U.S. trademark registrations. These patents have remaining terms ranging from 1 to 20 years. Tredegar also has licenses under patents owned by third parties. 

Research and Development . Tredegar&#8217;s spending for research and development (&#8220;R&#38;D&#8221;) activities in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;was primarily related to PE Films. PE Films has technical centers in Durham, North Carolina; Richmond, Virginia; and Terre Haute, Indiana. Flexible Packaging has a technical center in Bloomfield, New York. R&#38;D spending by the Company was approximately $16.2 million , $12.1 million &#32;and $12.7 million &#32;in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. 

Backlog . Backlogs are not material to the operations in PE Films or Flexible Packaging Films. Overall backlog for continuing operations in Aluminum Extrusions was approximately 11.8 &#32;million pounds at December 31, 2015 &#32;compared to approximately 17.0 &#32;million pounds at December 31, 2014 , a decrease of 5.2 &#32;million pounds, or approximately 30%. Volume for Aluminum Extrusions, which it believes is cyclical in nature, was 170.0 million &#32;pounds in 2015 , 153.8 million &#32;pounds in 2014 &#32;and 143.7 million &#32;pounds in 2013 . 

Government Regulation . &#32;U.S. laws concerning the environment to which the Company&#8217;s domestic operations are or may be subject include, among others, the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (&#8220;CERCLA&#8221;), all as amended, regulations promulgated under these acts, and any other federal, state or local laws or regulations governing environmental matters. Compliance with these laws is an important consideration because Tredegar uses hazardous materials in some of its operations, is a generator of hazardous waste, and wastewater from the Company&#8217;s operations is discharged to various types of wastewater management systems. Under CERCLA and other laws, Tredegar may be subject to financial exposure for costs associated with waste management and disposal, even if the Company fully complies with applicable environmental laws. 

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has adopted regulations under the Clean Air Act relating to emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (&#8220;GHG&#8221;), including mandatory reporting and permitting requirements. Additional regulations are anticipated. Several of the Company&#8217;s manufacturing operations result in emissions or GHG and are subject to the current GHG regulations. The Company&#8217;s compliance with these regulations has yet to require significant expenditures. The cost of compliance with any future GHG legislation or regulations is not presently determinable, but Tredegar does not anticipate compliance to have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows based on information currently available. 

Tredegar is also subject to the governmental regulations in the countries where it conducts business. 

At December 31, 2015 , the Company believes that it was in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental laws, regulations and permits in the U.S. and other countries where it conducts business. Environmental standards tend to become more stringent over time. In order to maintain substantial compliance with such standards, the Company may be required to incur additional expenditures, the amounts and timing of which are not presently determinable but which could be significant, in constructing new facilities or in modifying existing facilities. Furthermore, failure to comply with current or future laws and regulations could subject Tredegar to substantial penalties, fines, costs and expenses. 

Employees . Tredegar employed approximately 2,800 &#32;people at December 31, 2015 .
