 Item 1. Business

Overview 

We engage in the discovery and clinical development of innovative medicines for patients suffering from severe, rare diseases using our knowledge of Physiocrine biology, a newly discovered set of physiological modulators. We have discovered approximately 300 Physiocrines ( physio for life and crine for specific activity), a class of naturally occurring proteins that we believe promote homeostasis, a fundamental process of restoring stressed or diseased tissue to a healthier state. Physiocrines are extracellular signaling regions of tRNA synthetases, an ancient family of enzymes that catalyze a key step in protein synthesis. We believe that Physiocrines have evolved over time to modulate important cellular pathways by interacting with various types of cells, including immune and stem cells. Approximately 100 of these proteins interact with the immune system, which we believe presents a significant therapeutic opportunity to restore affected tissues to a healthier state through natural immuno-modulation mechanisms. We successfully completed a Phase 1 clinical trial of Resolaris, our first development candidate from our discovery engine, and three cohorts of a multi-national exploratory Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of Resolaris in adult patients with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, or FSHD, a severe, rare genetic myopathy with an immune component, for which there are currently no approved treatments. We are currently conducting three open label trials in patients with early onset FSHD, in adult patients with FSHD or limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 2B, (LGMD2B; dysferlinopathies), and a long term extension study in adult patients with FSHD. By leveraging our discovery engine and our knowledge of rare diseases, we aim to build a proprietary pipeline of novel product candidates with the potential to treat severe, rare diseases characterized by immune dysregulation. We plan to independently commercialize our Physiocrine-based therapeutics.

Our scientists were the first to identify the Resokine pathway ( reso for restoring skeletal muscle health and kine for activity related to cytokines), an extracellular pathway in human skeletal muscle tissue associated with activities arising from various Physiocrine regions of the histidine aminoacyl tRNA synthetase, or HARS. We believe that the Resokine pathway, among its various activities, modulates the immune system to promote tissue homeostasis. We believe the Resokine pathway may play an important role in muscle and lung health. Certain patients with antisynthetase syndrome, a rare auto-immune disease, have antibodies, known as Jo-1 antibodies, to HARS. These Jo-1 antibody patients often develop two significant clinical manifestations, inflammatory skeletal myopathy and interstitial lung disease, or ILD. We believe that the binding of Jo-1 antibodies, particularly to the immuno-modulatory domain of HARS, or iMod domain, blocks HARS immuno-modulatory functions and results in the muscle and lung diseases observed in these Jo-1 antibody patients.

We are harnessing the Resokine pathway and its association in skeletal muscle with homeostasis to develop Resolaris as a potentially first-in-class therapeutic for patients with severe, rare myopathies with an immune component, or RMICs, for which there are limited or no approved treatments. A myopathy is a disease of skeletal muscle tissue, characterized by muscle fiber deterioration, muscle weakness and often an immune response in the affected muscle tissue. In contrast to most current immunology drugs, which are engineered antagonists of immunological pathways, Resolaris is derived from a naturally occurring protein, HARS, which we believe has the potential to reset the immune system in diseased tissue to a more normal state while maintaining the immune system&#8217;s activity against exogenous, pathogen-based insults. We observed that stimulation of the Resokine pathway through the introduction of Resolaris and its derivatives in rodent models of both severe inflammation and myopathy led to immuno-modulatory effects. We have shown that stimulation of the Resokine pathway by Resolaris alters immune responses and the expression or release of immune-related proteins from cells in response to inflammation. HARS, which contains the immuno-modulatory domain, is also released from human skeletal muscle. In addition to its immuno-modulatory properties, we believe the Resokine pathway may act on other physiological processes, including processes associated with stem cells, fibrosis and endothelial cells.

Since the identification of the Resokine pathway, we have successfully advanced Resolaris through preclinical development, current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, manufacturing, an initial Phase 1 clinical trial and three cohorts of first exploratory Phase 1b/2 trial in adult FSHD patients. In the first quarter of 2014, we completed a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1 clinical trial of Resolaris, in which we assessed its safety and tolerability in 32 healthy subjects. Resolaris was shown to be well tolerated at all doses tested, and no serious adverse events were reported. Based on the favorable clinical safety, pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity profile of Resolaris in this trial, we decided to advance Resolaris into clinical trials of RMIC patients.

We recently announced results from our multi-national exploratory Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of Resolaris in adult patients with FSHD in the United States and European Union. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and exploratory pharmacodynamics markers and clinical assessments of multiple intravenous doses of Resolaris in adults with FSHD. We completed three dose escalation cohorts of 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg. We believe the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and activity profile of Resolaris as demonstrated in this study warrants advancing our program in adult FSHD patients and potentially other rare diseases.

Our initial therapeutic efforts target severe, rare disease indications in which patients suffer from the immune-related cons equences of their genetic disease. We have identified over 20 distinct, molecularly definable RMIC indications, including FSHD and LGMD 2B , in which we believe Resolaris has the potential to target the immune component of these genetic diseases. In 2015, we made progress in our therapeutic efforts by initiating new clinical studies in patients to further investigate Resolaris. We initiated three additional trials, including a long term safety extension study, a study in adult patients with FSHD or a second rare genetic myopathy, LGMD2B, and a study in patients with early onset FSHD . 

During 2015, we made advancements in our pre-clinical research through protein engineering, generating and testing the exposures in animals of multiple configurations of the iMod domain of the Resokine pathway, an immuno-modulatory Physiocrine domain. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we announced the selection of an investigational new drug (IND) candidate based on this iMod domain fused to the Fc region of a human antibody, iMod.Fc. We have selected this iMod.Fc molecule as our second product development candidate and it represents an expansion of our new class of Physiocrine-based therapeutics. With the selection of this iMod.Fc molecule, we are harnessing the Resokine pathway and plan to test its potential role in lung disease, and to develop iMod.Fc as a potential therapeutic for patients with rare pulmonary diseases with an immune component, or RPICs. 

We also believe our proprietary inventory of Physiocrines and their diverse functions have potential therapeutic application in a variety of diseases characterized by tissue dysfunction, including severe diseases of the lung, gut, skin, brain and liver. We intend to leverage our unique understanding of Physiocrines and our broad intellectual property portfolio, which we believe covers this entire class of potential protein therapeutics, to build a pipeline of product candidates that we expect to develop and commercialize independently for the treatment of various rare diseases.

We were founded in 2005 by Paul Schimmel, Ph.D. and Xiang-Lei Yang, Ph.D., two leading aminoacyl tRNA synthetase scientists at The Scripps Research Institute in San Diego, California. Our Chief Executive Officer, John D. Mendlein, Ph.D., was formerly the Chief Executive Officer of Adnexus Therapeutics, Inc. (acquired by Bristol-Myers Squibb Company) and Affinium Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. (acquired by Debiopharm Group), and held various roles at Aurora Biosciences Corporation (acquired by Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated). We have assembled an executive team with broad experience in the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative therapeutics, including transformative therapies for rare genetic diseases such as Kalydeco, marketed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis. We are advised by a Therapeutic Advisory Board and a Scientific Advisory Board, both comprised of leaders in the field of biology for medical applications, including our special advisor in immunology, Bruce Beutler, M.D., recipient of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work in immunology. 

Our Strategy 

We aim to capitalize on Physiocrine biology, a new and important area of human biology, to develop first-in-class medicines to treat patients with severe diseases characterized by an immune component. Key elements of our strategy include the following:

&#160;

&#183; 

Leverage our leadership position in Physiocrine biology to develop and commercialize novel, first-in-class medicines for patients affected by severe, rare diseases with significant unmet need. We focus on patients with severe, rare genetic diseases because we believe that the stimulation of Physiocrine pathways in these patients can restore diseased tissue to a more normal phenotype. Our strategy is to focus initially on indications where current treatment options are limited and our product candidates have the potential to provide transformative therapeutic benefit to patients given the severity of the diseases. We believe our initial focus on rare diseases will allow us to more effectively deploy investor capital for the independent development and commercialization of medicines for the benefit of patients and our stakeholders. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Rapidly and prudently pursue the development, regulatory approval and commercialization of Resolaris and iMod.Fc to treat patients across multiple severe disease indications . We intend to expeditiously pursue the development and regulatory approval of Resolaris in multiple RMICs. We are currently evaluating Resolaris in two Phase 1b/2 clinical trials and a Phase 1b/2 long term safety extension trial. These studies include adult FSHD and LGMD2B patients, as well as a study in early onset FSHD patients. We recently reported results from our first clinical trial in adult patients with FSHD in which data showed the Resolaris safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics and activity profile warrants advancing our program in adult FSHD patients and potentially other rare diseases. We also intend to develop iMod.Fc, our second product candidate based on the Resokine pathway, for RPIC indications. To bolster our clinical understanding of Resolaris, we may additionally evaluate Resolaris in other diseases with an immune component including those that are more common. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Leverage our discovery engine to build a pipeline of first-in-class Physiocrine medicines to address severe conditions characterized by immune pathway dysfunction or fibrosis . Based on our understanding of the biology of Physiocrines, we beli eve that this class of naturally occurring proteins has the potential to produce therapeutic benefits across a broad range of disease indications associated with an inappropriately amplified immune response, or where fibrosis contributes to disease associa ted with specific organs. We plan to leverage our discovery engine to identify other Physiocrine pathways of interest and select additional potential product candidates for preclinical and clinical investigation in a variety of disease settings on a tissue -by-tissue basis, which may include severe, currently inadequately treated diseases of the lung and liver. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Retain exclusive worldwide commercial rights to our product candidates to pursue autonomous commercialization . We intend to build a pipeline of product candidates, the rights to which we solely own or exclusively license, that we can commercialize independently through a relatively small, dedicated commercial organization focused on patient needs and directed at a limited number of physicians who specialize in the treatment of our target patient populations. While we do not expect to require pharmaceutical partners for commercialization of our product candidates, we may consider partnering for strategic purposes, including enhancing our pipeline efforts. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Expand our knowledge and intellectual property position in Physiocrine biology by emphasizing continuous scientific and business improvements . We will continue to aggressively pursue new scientific and therapeutic insights into Physiocrine biology through internally developed in vivo and in vitro screening systems in conjunction with genetic analysis and disease associations of Physiocrines, as well as in partnership with academic institutions and disease societies. We intend to leverage our leadership position in this field to broaden our intellectual property positions both in our most advanced programs and for additional therapeutic applications of Physiocrines. We will continue to vigorously prosecute and defend our patent portfolio, as well as exploit our proprietary position to strategically advance our business. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Build a world class organization oriented to patients and focused on rigorous scientific, clinical and industrial advancements . We have assembled a world class team with industry-recognized expertise in biology, medicine and the commercialization of innovative and important therapeutics. We intend to continue to build on our leadership position in Physiocrine and immunology-based therapeutics and to grow an organization and culture dedicated to the development and commercialization of medicines with the potential to positively transform the lives of patients with severe, rare diseases. We intend to maintain and expand our relationships with key opinion leaders, patient advocacy groups and other business partners, and to solicit input from payors and others in the healthcare industry, to identify and develop our product opportunities and to design our development programs in order to maximize the availability of our product candidates to patients. 

Product Development Programs 

Our Pipeline&#8212;A New Set of Treatment Mechanisms for Patients

We believe that, as the first and only company engaged in the clinical development of therapeutics based on Physiocrine biology, we are positioned to develop and commercialize a pipeline based on a novel class of protein therapeutics, protected by intellectual property rights that we own or exclusively license, that modulate important physiological processes. Below are summaries of our product development pipeline and discovery engine process: 

Our research suggests that Physiocrines act through basic mechanisms of innate and adaptive immunity, as well as other pathways, in a way that is distinct from existing classes of protein therapeutics. We believe Physiocrines have evolved, among other things, to balance the immune system, resolving inflammation naturally, in contrast to currently available immuno-modulatory therapeutics, which are engineered inhibitors of pro-inflammatory pathways. We intend to harness these mechanisms of Physiocrines to benefit patients with severe diseases in ways that we believe have advantages over traditional antibody and small molecule approaches.

Physiocrines: Harnessing a Newly Discovered Source of Innovative Therapeutics

The Promise of Physiocrine-Based Medicines in Promoting Homeostasis

Homeostasis, or the coordinated regulation of tissues within the body, is fundamental to the maintenance of the overall health of an organism and a key feature of multicellular life. Lack of homeostasis can lead to disease and death. The process of homeostasis was first described in 1865 by the French physiologist Claude Bernard and Walter Cannon later coined the term. In the 150 years since this discovery, many proteins associated with homeostatic pathways have been discovered, ranging from insulin to erythropoietin, or EPO.

Using our knowledge of bioinformatics, sequencing, proteomics and structural biology, we identified Physiocrines, a novel class of proteins that are present as biologically active signaling regions of the tRNA synthetases, an ancient protein family. We believe that Physiocrines are involved in orchestrating homeostatic activities to help the body restore diseased or damaged tissue to a healthier state. We have observed that certain Physiocrines exhibit previously undescribed extracellular activities that are involved in restoring and regulating tissues to promote health. We believe that physiological perturbations, such as stress or changes in physiological state, alter or induce the release of Physiocrines from cells or platelets in the human body. Physiocrines have been observed to be released from a wide variety of cells, including in response to such stimuli as starvation-induced apoptotic stress or the introduction of certain cellular ligands, including tumor necrosis factor alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor.

Physiocrine Biology Overview 

The Discovery of Physiocrines

In 1999, our founder, Dr. Paul Schimmel, published in Science a structural and functional description of extracellular signaling regions of a specific aminoacyl tRNA synthetase. tRNA synthetases are an ancient family of enzymes that were generally thought to only be involved in protein synthesis. Since Dr. Schimmel&#8217;s discovery, numerous papers have been published on the alternative activities of tRNA synthetases. We refer to the extracellular signaling regions of tRNA synthetases illustrated in the figure below, along with other later-discovered or splice variant regions of tRNA synthetases, as Physiocrines. A splice variant is a variation of a gene transcript.

&#160;

There are 20 known human cytosolic tRNA synthetases, each coding for one of the 20 amino acids. Amino acids, when bonded together, form full-length functional proteins. There are about 15 potential Physiocrines on average per tRNA synthetase, including Physiocrine regions in a full length tRNA synthetase protein, splice variants from a tRNA synthetase gene, or proteolytic fragments from a full length protein. We believe Physiocrines interact with various proteins important in extracellular activities, including G protein-coupled receptors, cytokine receptors, tyrosine kinase receptors and extracellular matrix proteins.

Our founding mandate was to focus on the systematic interrogation of the tRNA synthetase gene family through bioinformatics and structural analysis. Our research, along with that of The Scripps Research Institute, revealed that although the genetic sequence of each of the 20 tRNA synthetase genes changed at multiple times over four billion years by the genetic mutation of tRNA synthetases, including the insertion of DNA sequences, protein synthesis, however, as characterized by tRNA synthetase activity, remained relatively unchanged over that peri od of time. As illustrated in the figure below, the structural diversity of proteins resulting from the inserted genetic material increased as living organisms became more complex and as fundamental physiological systems, including immunological, stem cell , muscular, circulatory, respiratory and neural systems, developed. 

&#160;

The results of this research suggested to us that tRNA synthetases retained a core function in protein synthesis over four billion years, while developing other important and diverse physiological functions associated with Physiocrines. We believe these functions could serve as a source of therapeutics directed at stimulating pathways involved in the restoration of homeostasis.

The Function of Physiocrines in Fundamental Pathways of Life 

Based on the research suggesting that Physiocrines are potentially important modulators of cellular pathways, we hypothesized that Physiocrines may play roles in such fundamental processes as immunology, stem cell biology, neurology, vascular biology, skeletal muscle biology, hepatic (liver) biology and metabolic biology. To test this, we expressed and purified over 200 Physiocrine regions across the family of 20 tRNA synthetase genes and evaluated these purified Physiocrines in numerous cell-based assays to determine their activity in several important human physiological pathways. Some of the data were published in July 2014 in Science , with the data categorized according to important areas of biology. The table below describes several key areas of biology in which Physiocrines may present therapeutic opportunities:

Our current research includes efforts to understand the relationship of various Physiocrine pathways to health and disease and the potential for a particular Physiocrine pathway to provide a valuable therapeutic intervention point. In addition, various independent research sites across the world are conducting genetic analysis of DNA from patients with rare phenotypes and mutations to tRNA synthetases. Laboratories are also investigating the connection between tRNA synthetases and various cancers and auto-immune diseases.

Physiocrine Pathways as Therapeutic Intervention Points

Our Initial Focus on Immuno-Modulation

Many important therapeutics act in connection with physiological pathways, including growth factor and differentiation pathway agonists, such as insulin and erythropoietin, or EPO; growth factor pathway antagonists, such as vascular endothelial growth factor antagonists; immune pathway antagonists, such as tumor necrosis factor antagonists; immune pathway agonists, such as interferon; and metabolic pathway modulators, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). We are initially focused on the application of Physiocrines to immuno-modulation in rare diseases. We selected immuno-modulation as our initial area of focus for the following reasons:

&#160;

&#183; 

We believe immunology plays a significant role in most diseases, including genetic diseases; 

&#160;

&#183; 

A number of Physiocrines have been shown to be differentially expressed in immune cells; 

&#160;

&#183; 

A large number of Physiocrine pathways appear to relate to immunology, as at least seven different tRNA synthetase proteins are associated with certain immune-driven diseases; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

Approximately 100 Physiocrines have demonstrated activity in various cell-based assays related to immunological pathways. 

Additionally, we focus on modulators of immune and fibrotic processes for indications that represent severe, rare diseases, particularly genetically based diseases, because:

&#160;

&#183; 

Our scientific understanding of Physiocrines as potential immuno-modulators and modulators of fibrotic processes that intersected with multiple rare diseases; 

&#160;

&#183; 

We believe patients with rare genetic diseases often face challenges related to the responses of their immune and remodeling fibrotic systems to changes in tissues that are caused by their genetic mutations; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

We believe the pathological immuno-phenotypes in rare diseases present an opportunity for us to therapeutically intervene with greater impact. 

Advantages of Physiocrine-Based Therapeutics 

Most current immunological based drugs are engineered antagonists of immunological pathways, typically acting to lower elevated immune responses resulting from disease, as in the case of monoclonal antibodies acting against circulating signaling molecules, such as cytokines. Although these signaling molecules may be up-regulated in disease, their natural levels and fluctuations have evolved to include non-disease functions of the immune system, mediating a wide range of physiological activities, as opposed to evolving to cause or contribute to disease. Our discovery and development efforts focus on therapeutics derived from naturally occurring proteins. We believe that Physiocrines have naturally evolved to reset the immune system to control or reduce tissue damage while maintaining the immune system&#8217;s activity against exogenous pathogen based insults, and may possess the following advantages over engineered antagonists of immunological pathways:

&#160;

&#183; 

As proteins designed by nature to reset the immune system, Physiocrines may provide a unique mechanism to improve patient outcomes through their activity in either a single or multiple pathways; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Physiocrines have the potential to reset the immune system across multiple pathways at the level of an immune cell, rather than lowering the levels of a single immune protein like most engineered antagonists; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Physiocrines may potentially act as agonists at the level of the immune cell to reduce pro-inflammatory effects and induce resolution of immune activity or inflammation; 

&#160;

&#183; 

The therapeutic effects of Physiocrines may persist even after the Physiocrines have been cleared from circulation; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

Physiocrines present the potential for fewer, if any, immuno-suppressive effects, as compared to engineered antagonistic immuno-modulators. 

The Resokine Pathway and Resolaris, Our First Clinical Product Candidate

Identification of the Resokine Pathway through In Vivo Screening Approaches

Our scientists discovered the Resokine pathway in human skeletal muscle using our in vivo screening systems in models of severe inflammation, combined with our knowledge of the effects of antibody binding to a specific tRNA synthetase in a population of patients with a particular rare myopathy. The Resokine pathway encompasses physiological activities, including potential immuno-modulatory and other muscle health activities, arising from various Physiocrine regions of the histidine aminoacyl tRNA synthetase, or HARS. Animal studies and human pathophysiological data have shown that antibody-based blockade of the Resokine pathway may lead to muscle tissue deterioration and immune cell invasion.

First Demonstration of a Region of HARS as an Immuno-modulator 

We conducted in vivo screening activities of a splice variant from HARS that we identified in our deep sequencing studies, which we refer to as the immuno-modulatory domain, or iMod domain, of HARS. The figure below depicts the iMod domain and other forms of HARS:

&#160;

For our studies of the iMod domain, we selected a rodent model of severe immune cell activity or inflammation induced by the administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid, or TNBS, in which the inflammation is thought to be driven by excessive T-cell involvement in the gut, leading to the death of the study an imals. Animals administered the iMod domain survived longer than those given either the vehicle control phosphate buffer solution, or PBS, or an approved drug control (Budesonide) (p&#60;0.01), demonstrating the potential activity of the iMod domain as an immu no-modulator of excessive T-cell involvement. The results of this study are summarized in the graph below: 

&#160;

Additionally, we have demonstrated in the same rodent model of inflammation in the gut that at least two other related molecules, Resolaris and iMod.Fc, both of which are derived from HARS and contain the iMod domain, are active in models of excessive T-cell involvement. Based on these observations, we believe that blockade of the activity of the iMod domain may contribute to excessive or inappropriate T-cell involvement in immune-driven diseases.

Evidence of the Role of the Resokine Pathway in Rare Muscle and Lung Diseases

In 1983, Matthews and Bernstein published in Nature the observation that patients with a rare myopathy possessed antibodies to a single tRNA synthetase, HARS. Since then, it has been observed that patients with auto-antibodies to HARS (but not antibodies to the other 19 tRNA synthetases in the same patients) can develop both a debilitating myopathy characterized by weakness and skeletal muscle loss, and interstitial lung disease, or ILD, both of which are characterized by T-cell invasion. Numerous research laboratories have verified the existence of anti-HARS antibodies, or Jo-1 antibodies, as one of the manifestations of the auto-immune disease, anti-synthetase syndrome.

Based on these observations, we chose to study the potential link between HARS antibodies and muscle disease in anti-synthetase syndrome patients with Jo-1 antibodies. Our scientists obtained serum samples from 18 of these patients to determine whether the Jo-1 antibodies specifically bound to the iMod domain. We determined that in each of the 18 Jo-1 antibody positive patients studied, a significant portion of Jo-1 antibody binding was to the iMod domain, compared to binding to other regions of HARS. We believe that in these patients, the binding of Jo-1 antibodies to the iMod domain blocked the immuno-modulatory properties of the iMod domain, therefore contributing to their myopathy and ILD. Independent laboratorie s have also observed in unrelated studies that the iMod domain is the primary antibody binding region in Jo-1 antibody patients with anti-synthetase syndrome. 

Additional Confirmatory Studies of the Blockade of the Resokine Pathway in Animals

We have conducted studies that suggest that antibody blockade of the Resokine pathway contributes to immune cell invasion in skeletal muscle and lung tissue. Recently published animal studies by a third party laboratory are consistent with our findings. In particular, in 2014, Sciorati et al . published on the effect in rat skeletal muscle of antibodies to the iMod domain produced by vaccination, generating additional evidence that the Resokine pathway plays a role in skeletal muscle health and the immune system. The Sciorati study demonstrated: (1) antibody generation to the iMod domain of HARS; (2) levels of creatine kinase, or CK, a biomarker of muscle destruction, increased in relation to antibody levels; (3) antibodies to the iMod domain correlated with an increase in muscle inflammation, as observed by magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI; and (4) the MRI signal corresponded to muscle destruction, as judged by histology. The data generated by Sciorati et al . are consistent with our conclusions that the Resokine pathway was reduced or blocked in Jo-1 antibody patients as a result of antibodies against the iMod domain.

Altering Excessive T-cell Invasion in Preclinical Studies of Resolaris in Skeletal Muscle

We also tested Resolaris in a rodent model in which statins, which are known to induce myopathies in humans and rodents, were administered to induce a severe, aggressive myopathy. In the study, rats were administered statins for two weeks, and at Day 8, treatment with Resolaris was started. After a week of daily treatment with Resolaris, we observed a dose dependent change in the histologic phenotype of the treated animals, from excessive immune cell invasion to nearly normal histology and immune cell levels, as compared to animals in the control group, as shown in the figure below:

&#160;

Resolaris Mechanism of Action: T-cell Modulation and Other Potential Pathways

Our in vivo studies suggest that stimulation of the Resokine pathway through or with Resolaris combats pathophysiological changes in three established animal models of excessive T-cell involvement in which approved drugs have been tested. Our in vitro studies of Resolaris suggest that at least one of the activities of Resolaris includes a direct action on T-cells to reduce, but not completely block, cytokine release. This reduction also lasts for at least 24 hours after Resolaris has been removed from the T-cells. This suggests that the pharmacodynamic effect of Resolaris in vivo could be longer than the pharmacokinetics of the protein. It also suggests that there is at least one T-cell associated receptor for Resolaris, such as a cytokine or chemokine receptor. We observed Resolaris&#8217; effect on human T-cells by monitoring IL-2 levels over time.

Additional cell-based assays show that specific regions of Resolaris may harbor additional activities similar to Physiocrine regions from the HARS protein, including stem cel l/remodeling and endothelia pathways . 

Additionally, we have looked for direct antagonist activities of Resolaris on certain cytokines. Resolaris does not appear to act as a direct ligand antagonist, but rather appears to act more globally at the level of immune cells and potentially other cell types. HARS is also released directly from human skeletal muscle in vitro , and blocking HARS with antibodies after stimulated release by insulin-like growth factor, or IGF-1, reduces the effect of IGF-1 in muscle differentiation.

Resolaris for the Treatment of Multiple Rare Myopathies with an Immune Component (RMICs)

Overview

We are developing Resolaris as a potentially first-in-class intravenous protein therapeutic for the treatment of rare myopathies with an immune component, or RMICs. We have identified over 20 distinct, molecularly definable RMIC indications that we believe Resolaris has the potential to treat. In each of these indications, skeletal muscle tissue exhibits dysfunction and becomes subject to immune cell invasion, which contributes to the loss of function and deterioration of the muscle tissue. RMIC patients generally present with three common characteristics:

&#160;

&#183; 

expression of aberrant protein (in the case of genetically based RMIC indications); 

&#160;

&#183; 

immune cell invasion; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

muscle cell damage and deterioration. 

In normal muscle, muscle mass and function require a balance between muscle cell stress and damage and muscle cell regeneration and growth. The immune system helps maintain this balance by &#8220;cleaning up&#8221; damaged muscle cells after muscle damage and during the healing process. In RMIC diseases, the balance is tipped to favor chronic pathophysiological muscle deterioration and persistent immune cell invasion. In genetically based RMIC diseases, aberrant protein expression often occurs, as in the case of FSHD patients with inappropriate expression of a protein not normally expressed in muscle. As discussed above, in vivo rodent models of skeletal muscle deterioration and immune cell invasion have shown that Resolaris can combat immune cell invasion into the muscle and muscle deterioration. Conversely, experiments in rodents have shown that antibody blockade of the Resokine pathway can lead to immune cell invasion and muscle tissue deterioration.

We intend to harness the body&#8217;s power to restore skeletal muscle after stress or damage in the development of Resolaris for RMIC patients who have limited or no approved treatment options. We believe Resolaris can offer a potential multi-pharmacologic therapeutic, synergistically modulating multiple pathways important to muscle health. Our proprietary position for Resolaris includes an issued U.S. patent covering the composition of matter of Resolaris, as well as various patent applications relating to specific methods of use of Resolaris and related proteins.

Resolaris: Potential Specific Therapeutic Applications in RMICs 

We believe Resolaris will provide therapeutic benefit to patients in RMIC indications characterized by excessive immune cell involvement, particularly a type of T-cell known as CD8 T-cells and macrophages. Dysregulated immune cell invasion can cause and exacerbate muscle damage and stress. For example, CD8 T-cells have been observed to contribute to muscle damage by the release of proteins that destroy or damage skeletal muscle cells. The table below describes RMIC indications in which the relationship between diseased muscle and the immune system has been observed by others, which we believe may be addressed by the proposed mechanism of action of Resolaris.

In preclinical models in vivo , Resolaris reduces (i) the infiltration and accumulation of CD8 T-cells; (ii) the expression of cytokines, including MCP-1, IL-6 and others; and (iii) biomarkers, such as MMP9.

&#160;

In vitro studies using Resolaris also demonstrate reduction of a variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IFN gamma and IL-17A, as well as the activity of pro-inflammatory macrophages.

Resolaris: Our Clinical Development Program

We are discovering and developing protein based therapeutics leveraging the novel extra-cellular functions of tRNA synthetases to restore and maintain tissue homeostasis. The initial Physiocrine-based therapeutic from our discovery pipeline, Resolaris, entered clinical development in 2013. We are pursuing a clinical development strategy that not only will inform the therapeutic potential of Resolaris in RMIC indications but will also inform the therapeutic potential of Physiocrine-based therapeutics as a class. The strategy has as its foundation the extensive evaluation of the safety and tolerability of the administration of Physiocrine-based therapeutics to human subjects.

We successfully completed a single ascending dose Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy subjects of Resolaris, our first development candidate from our discovery engine for therapeutic applications of Physiocrines. We recently announced results from our multi-national Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of Resolaris in adult patients with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, or FSHD, a severe, rare genetic myopathy in which immune cells invade diseased skeletal muscle, for which there are currently no approved treatments. The data from this study showed the Resolaris safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and activity profile warrant advancing our program in adult FSHD patients and potentially other rare diseases. In 2015, we initiated three additional trials, including a long term safety extension study, a study in adult patients with FSHD or LGMD2B, a second rare genetic myopathy, and a study in patients with early onset of FSHD. 

Phase 1 Clinical Trial in Healthy Subjects 

In the first quarter of 2014, we completed a single ascending dose Phase 1 clinical trial of Resolaris to assess its safety and tolerability in healthy subjects. The planning and design of the trial were guided by the principles that this trial would be the first time that a Physiocrine has been administered to a human subject, and that the therapeutic use of immuno-modulatory drugs are often characterized by poor tolerability and common safety concerns. In particular, we designed this trial as a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in order to rigorously assess safety and tolerability, such as injection site reactions or systemic reactions, and to assess the pharmacokinetics, or PK, immunogenicity and biological activity of single doses of Resolaris in humans. In this trial, 32 healthy adult subjects were randomized to receive a 30 minute intravenous infusion of either placebo or a single dose of 0.1 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg, or 3.0 mg/kg of Resolaris. Participants were randomly assigned to receive Resolaris or placebo on a 3:1 basis so that within each of the four cohorts, six subjects received Resolaris and two subjects received placebo, and overall, 24 healthy subjects were dosed with Resolaris and eight healthy subjects were dosed with placebo.

Resolaris was found to be well tolerated in all dose cohorts in our Phase 1 clinical trial. There were no serious adverse events or deaths, and the incidence of individual treatment emergent adverse events, or TEAEs, among all groups was low, with no relationship to Resolaris dose level. All TEAEs observed in the trial were mild in intensity and transient, and resolved without treatment-related pathological effects. TEAEs that were considered possibly related to Resolaris were predominantly nervous system symptoms, including single cases of dizziness, headache, and drowsiness. No local tolerability issues related to Resolaris were observed.

We observed no significant changes from normal in over 30 cytokine and other immune-related protein assays after administration of 0.1 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg, and 3.0 mg/kg of Resolaris in these healthy individuals. These results are consistent with the observed role of the Resokine pathway in resolving inflammation. Systemic exposure and C max were dose proportional, mean total systemic clearance was low and the volume of distribution was small, resulting in a terminal half-life in plasma of approximately three to six hours across all dose levels. Low titer anti-drug antibodies were observed in five subjects out of 24 after administration of Resolaris. One subject out of 24 had similar low titer anti-drug antibodies prior to the administration of Resolaris. The PK of Resolaris was not altered in these subjects. Based on the favorable PK, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity profile of Resolaris in our Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy subjects, we advanced Resolaris into clinical development in RMIC patients.

Resolaris in Facioscapulohumoral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD) 

The process of selecting the first RMIC indication for our Resolaris program involved several steps. First, both genetic and autoimmune forms of RMIC were considered. Then, diseases with high unmet need (no treatment options), severe progressive disease manifestations and clear evidence in scientific literature of an immune component were selected for further exploration. Those in which the muscle tissue itself and the blood clearly reflect the immune dysregulation were prioritized, with those whose immune pathogenesis overlapped with Resolaris activity were further prioritized. These prioritized diseases included several distinct genetic myopathies.

Based on the indication selection process described above, we elected to first pursue FSHD, a rare genetic myopathy in which immune cells invade diseased skeletal muscle and for which there are no approved treatments. The primary clinical phenotype of FSHD is debilitating skeletal muscle deterioration and weakness. The symptoms of FSHD develop in an asymmetric pattern, starting with the face and upper body to the lower body and progressing in a &#8220;muscle by muscle&#8221; fashion. This is in contrast to other genetic myopathies such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy that usually affect groups of muscles concurrently and symmetrically. These symptoms include musculoskeletal abnormalities such as abnormal protrusion of the shoulder blades or exaggerated bend of the lower spine and, often as the disease progresses, difficulty standing upright, lifting objects, reaching above shoulder level or using the shoulders to support various activities of daily life. Patients also suffer pelvic girdle and lower limb weakness, resulting in progressive difficulty arising from a seated position. Importantly, most patients eventually develop profound weakness in the lower leg and cannot manage to lift the foot of the affected side appropriately. This condition results in frequent falls and related injuries. In addition to debilitating muscle weakness, FSHD patients often experience severe fatigue, muscle deterioration and pain. While FSHD can manifest at any age, the onset of symptoms in many patients occurs before the age of 18. We refer to this patient population as early onset FSHD. We have selected those patients with onset of symptoms before the age of 10 for our current clinical trial. Within the early onset population are individuals with symptom onset at less than five years of age, with progression in disease prior to age ten. These individuals have the most severe muscle symptoms and significant extra-muscular manifestations such as auditory deficits and retinal complications that may result in vision loss. This sub-group of early onset patients are often referred to as having &#8220;infantile onset&#8221; FSHD.

While estimates of FSHD prevalence vary, studies exploring the topic have identified average prevalence rates of approximately one in 17,000. Applying this rate to the U.S. population, as of November 1, 2014, yields a domestic FSHD population of approximately 19,000, including a domestic &#8220;infantile onset&#8221; FSHD population of approximately 1,000. FSHD is typically diagnosed by the presence of a characteristic pattern of muscle weakness and other clinical symptoms, as well as through genetic testing of the number of repeats of a specific DNA sequence at the end of Chromosome 4. In normal, unaffected individuals this chromosomal region has from 11 to 100 repeats of the applicable DNA sequence. The term FSHD1 is used to delineate patients in which the genetic basis relates to the deletion of these repeats at the end of Chromosome 4. Patients with FSHD typically have only one to ten of these repeats. The most severe form of FSHD, &#8220;infantile onset&#8221;, is associated with three or fewer repeats. Another form of the disease, FSHD2, occurs in approximately 5% of FSHD patients, and is caused by mutations in the gene SCHMD1 located on Chromosome 18 of the applicable DNA sequence. In both FSHD1 and FSHD2, the genetic abnormality results in the expression of genes that are normally silent or inactive in skeletal muscle. Consequently, an unusual profile of proteins is produced, which has been linked to FSHD skeletal muscle pathology.

The FSHD immuno-pathology includes an infiltrative inflammatory process (usually dominated by CD8 T-cells and macrophages) that can also be observed by MRI in individual skeletal muscles that are in the early stages of disease. Longitudinal MRI studies in FSHD have recently shown that these muscle by muscle inflammatory changes directly precede the fatty infiltration that characterizes individual muscles that have been affected for a longer period of time. Once this fatty infiltration has progressed to a certain stage in the affected muscle, however, the level of inflammation as detected by MRI decreases. The degree of fatty infiltration measured by MRI correlates with a commonly used measure of functional status, the FSHD clinical severity score.

The inflammatory immune response in FSHD is reflected in individuals with FSHD through activated immune cells and elevated levels of immune and skeletal muscle proteins present in the circulation. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from individuals with evidence of muscle inflammation via MRI also show evidence of activation in cell culture by spontaneously releasing high amounts of immune proteins into the culture medium compared to controls.

There are currently no approved treatments for FSHD. The standard of care in management of the disease includes physical therapy and, in the presence of severe muscle weakness, orthotic devices or surgical interventions may be needed to maintain musculoskeletal stability.

In the first quarter of 2015, the European Commission granted orphan medicinal product designation for Resolaris (ATYR1940) for the treatment of FSHD following a positive opinion by the EMA&#8217;s Committee of Orphan Medicinal Products. In the second quarter of 2015, the FDA granted orphan drug designation for Resolaris (ATYR1940) in the United States for the treatment of FSHD.

Resolaris in Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy (LGMD) 2B ( D ysferlinopathies) 

In addition to clinical trials in FSHD, we are addressing other genetic diseases in which immune cells invade diseased muscle. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we expanded our scope of our studies by initiating a clinical trial of Resolaris in a form of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD), a group of uniformly progressive muscular dystrophies characterized predominantly by proximal weakness affecting the pelvic and shoulder girdles and usually sparing the face . This group of disorders, recently re-classified based on the genetic underpinnings of diseases, are categorized by inheritance pattern: dominantly inherited forms (i.e., LGMD1) and those with recessively-inherited forms (i.e., LGMD2). Within these categories, the diseases are further characterized by the causative genetic defect. Currently, LGMD is a collection of approximately 30 genetic muscle diseases caused by mutations at more than 50 genetic loci. The mutations typically create abnormal, malfunctioning proteins that eventually contribute to muscle weakness.

The age of onset, severity, and features of LGMD vary among the subtypes. Overall, LGMD affects men and women equally. LGMD patients typically suffer from:

&#160;

&#183; 

skeletal muscle weakness or compromised function in identifiable, specific muscles; 

&#160;

&#183; 

skeletal muscle immune cell invasion in identifiable, specific muscles; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

skeletal muscle deterioration in identifiable, specific muscles with insufficient muscle regeneration. 

We are now investigating Resolaris in patients with LGMD2B, a recessively inherited LGMD, often termed dysferlinopathy, given that the causative mutations reside within the dysferlin gene ( DYSF ). LGMD2B is characterized mainly by two distinct clinical phenotypes: LGMD syndrome, with early weakness and atrophy of the pelvic and shoulder girdle muscles in adolescence or young adulthood and with slow progression, and Miyoshi myopathy, with muscle weakness and atrophy in young adults, most marked in the distal parts of the legs, especially the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles. Over a period of years, the weakness and atrophy spread to the upper leg muscles. The forearms may become mildly atrophic, with decrease in grip strength, but the small muscles of the hands are spared.

There are multiple lines of evidence supporting a prominent role of inflammation in the pathophysiology of LGMD2B. The genetic mutations in dysferlin appear to create a defect in muscle membrane repair. Alterations in this process may create a pathophysiological environment in muscle that triggers an immune response. LGMD2B has been demonstrated to have a predominant immune cell-mediated pathology. Patients with LGMD2B possess a dysregulated immune response, including immune cell infiltration into affected muscle, increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and altered cellular responses. Analysis of muscle biopsies from LGMD2B patients (including Myoshi myopathy and LGMD syndrome), has revealed that the most prominent cellular immunophenotype in LGMD muscle is infiltration with T-cells (CD4 and CD8 positive, with CD4 predominating) and macrophages. Cytokine patterns that reflect the inflammatory state, include interleukin (IL)-1, interferon-, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). The muscle in patients with dysferlinopathy is characterized by massive immune cell infiltrates. 

Because of the heterogeneity of LGMD and the lack of diagnostic specificity, there are few reports on the prevalence of LGMD; however, it is estimated to range from 1:14,500 to 1:123,000, depending on the genetically defined form. Based on a prevalence rate of 1:20,000, w e estimate that LGMD affects an estimated 16,000 patients in the U.S., approximately 3,000 of whom have LGMD2B. The age of onset of certain forms of LGMD is usually between ten and 30, with both genders affected equally. The disease inevitably gets worse over time, although progression is more rapid in some patients. The disease commonly leads to dependence on a wheelchair within 20 to 30 years of symptom onset, but there is high inter-patient variability, with some patients maintaining mobility. LGMD may eventually weaken the respiratory muscles, leading to illness or early death due to complications from this secondary manifestation. Individuals with cardiac involvement may succumb to heart failure.

No definitive treatments exist for LGMD2B or any of the over 30 forms of LGMD. Clinical management is directed to prolong survival and improve quality of life, including avoiding obesity, promoting physical therapy and stretching exercises, using mechanical aids to help ambulation and mobility, surgical intervention for orthopedic complications, using respiratory aids when indicated, monitoring for cardiomyopathy in LGMD types with cardiac involvement, and social and emotional support and stimulation.

The predominant role of the immune system in LGMD2B suggests that focusing on the inflammatory status of muscles in patients a priori in a clinical study could increase the likelihood of seeing an impact of non-corticosteroid immunomodulator.

We plan to apply for orphan designation for Resolaris in LGMD in the United States and Europe.

002 Study: Phase 1b/2 Clinical Trial &#8211; Adult Patients with FSHD

We recently completed three cohorts of a multi-national Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of Resolaris in adult patients with FSHD in the European Union and the United States. As with our Phase 1 clinical trial, the planning and design of this trial were guided by principles related to safety and tolerability. In particular, we designed this trial as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of multiple intravenous doses of Resolaris in adults 18 to 65 years of age with FSHD. In addition, the study also evaluated the utility of exploratory pharmacodynamic (PD) markers (including MRI measurements to quantitate areas of potential muscle inflammation) and clinical assessments (including patient reported outcomes). 

&#160;

Resolaris was studied in three dose escalation cohorts (0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg) across four sites and 20 patients. In each cohort, patients were randomized at a ratio of 3:1 to receive Resolaris or placebo. Patients in the first two cohorts were dosed weekly over a period of one month, and patients in the third cohort were dosed weekly over a period of three months. As planned, we enrolled a total of four patients in the first cohort and eight patients in each of the second and third cohorts. For the second and third cohorts, inclusion criteria included the presence of at least one skeletal muscle in the legs identified by a non-quantitative MRI technique, which is thought to indicate inflammation. We recently announced results from the first three dose cohorts. The analysis was based on data available through early March 2016. 

&#160;

A number of exploratory PD markers and clinical assessments were conducted to better understand their utility in FSHD. The study was not powered to demonstrate statistically significant evidence of therapeutic utility or a specific activity endpoint. As part of clinical assessments, a validated patient reported outcome measure designed specifically for neuromuscular diseases, the individualized neuromuscular quality of life (INQoL) questionnaire, was utilized in the study. We believe that data from this patient reported outcome measure suggest potential improvement at three months of weekly dosing at 3.0 mg/kg in this relatively small clinical trial of FSHD patients.

Manual muscle testing (MMT), which measures muscle strength, was performed across 15 selected muscle groups. The composite MMT score showed approximately 0.5% improvement with Resolaris compared to a 1% decline in the placebo treated patients, indicating no reportable disease progression by this technique in either placebo and test article groups after three months of weekly treatment. An exploratory MRI technique, to quantitate inflammation in a targeted lower limb muscle, did not record differences between placebo and test article groups after three months of weekly treatment. No substantial differences between the placebo and test article groups were observed after three months of weekly treatment in certain exploratory circulating PD markers, however only 2/20 patients had elevated levels above the normal range at screening.

&#160;

Across all dose groups (0.3 , 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg), we believe the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and PK profile of Resolaris supports advancement of Resolaris in FSHD and potentially other rare diseases. No serious adverse events were reported by study investigators. Mild to moderate adverse events were observed in both the test article and placebo treated patients. One moderate adverse event in a test article treated patient (a reversible generalized infusion related reaction (IRR) in the third cohort), which was reported by a study investigator, was reclassified to a serious adverse event by aTyr. This patient was discontinued from dosing at week 11 of the 12 weeks of treatment, but completed the study visits. The PK of Resolaris was generally well behaved across all dose cohorts and throughout the study. Anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) were confirmed in approximately 40% of the dosed patients, including the patient that experienced the generalized IRR. ADAs were of low titer and had no significant effect on PK.

Our protocol for this trial includes the option to initiate up to two additional cohorts. We are currently in the planning process for our next trial in FSHD which could include these two cohorts or a separate trial.

003 Study: Phase 1b/2 Clinical Trial &#8211;Patients with Early Onset FSHD 

In the fourth quarter of 2015, we initiated a multinational, multi-center Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of Resolaris in patients with early onset FSHD. This international Phase 1b/2 clinical trial is an open-label, intra-patient dose escalation study designed to assess the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and biological activity of Resolaris at weekly doses of 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg to patients with early onset FSHD. We also intend to explore PD markers and clinical assessments to evaluate Resolaris in these patients, based on changes in inflammatory immune state in peripheral blood, muscle strength, upper and lower extremity muscle function, muscle disease burden based on MRI, and patient-reported quality of life measures, such as INQoL. 

Up to 16 patients are planned to be enrolled in the study at up to eight centers in the United States and Europe. Patients will receive a single placebo infusion followed by administration of Resolaris as an intravenous infusion once a week for a total of 12 weeks, starting at a dose level of 0.3 mg/kg with the potential for dose escalation to 3.0 mg/kg over the dosing period. Enrollment into the study will be conducted in two stages. In Stage 1, up to eight patients between the ages of 16 and 25 years old with early onset FSHD who meet the study criteria will be enrolled. Inclusion criteria includes a genetically confirmed diagnosis of FSHD and the onset of symptoms prior to the age of 10. Stage 2 of enrollment, which will include up to eight patients between the ages of 12 and 15 years old with early onset FSHD who meet the study criteria, will only be initiated following an amendment to our trial protocol. The amendment will be based on consideration of safety data of Resolaris gathered in Stage 1, along with additional clinical safety data obtained in adults with FSHD. 

We recently dosed our first patient in this trial. Enrollment of patients has been slower than anticipated and we believe enrollment will continue to be slow. 

004 Study: Phase 1b/2 Clinical Trial &#8211;Adult Patients with Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy 2B or FSHD 

In the fourth quarter of 2015, we initiated a multinational, multi-center Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of Resolaris in adult patients with LGMD2B or FSHD. This international Phase 1b/2 clinical trial is an open-label, intra-patient dose escalation study designed to assess the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and biological activity of weekly and twice weekly intravenous infusions of Resolaris in adults with either LGMD2B or FSHD. We also intend to explore PD markers and clinical assessments to evaluate Resolaris in these patients, based on changes in serum-based muscle biomarkers, inflammatory immune state in peripheral blood, muscle disease burden based on MRI, skeletal muscle strength, upper and lower extremity muscle function and quality of life measures, such as INQoL. 

Patients will be assigned to one of two treatment groups, which differ based on the maximum dose level of Resolaris to be administered. Group A will include up to four patients with FSHD. Group B will include up to four patients with FSHD and up to eight patients with LGMD2B. Enrollment into Groups A and B will be initiated concurrently; however, enrollment of FSHD patients into Group A must be completed before any patients with FSHD may be enrolled into Group B. Patients assigned to Group A will receive a single placebo infusion followed by administration of Resolaris as an intravenous infusion once a week for eight weeks, then twice weekly for four weeks, for a total of 12 weeks, starting at a dose level of 0.3 mg/kg with the potential for dose escalation to 1.0 mg/kg and up to 1.0 mg/kg twice a week over the dosing period. Patients assigned to Group B will receive a single placebo infusion followed by the administration of Resolaris as an intravenous infusion once a week for eight weeks, then twice weekly for four weeks, for a total of 12 weeks, starting at a dose level of 0.3 mg/kg with the potential for dose escalation to 3.0 mg/kg and up to 3.0 mg/kg twice a week over the dosing period. Inclusion criteria for FSHD patients includes a genetically confirmed diagnosis of FSHD and the presence of at least one skeletal muscle in the legs identified by MRI as STIR positive, which is thought to indicate an immune component. Inclusion criteria for LGMD2B patients includes a genetically confirmed diagnosis of LGMD2B and the presence of at least one skeletal muscle in the muscle in the legs identified by MRI as STIR positive or meeting certain circulating biomarker criteria. 

005 Study: Phase 1b/2 Clinical Trial &#8211;Long-Term Safety Extension Study in Adult Patients with FSHD

&#160;

In the third quarter of 2015, we initiated a long-term extension study for patients from our 002 Study. This multinational, multi-center, open-label extension study is designed to assess the long-term safety, effects on muscle, PD and systemic exposure of Resolaris in adult FSHD patients from our 002 Study. Eligible patients in jurisdictions where this trial is approved have the opportunity to receive weekly doses of 3.0 mg/kg until Resolaris receives regulatory approval or the program is discontinued. To date, a total of eight patients have enrolled in this 005 Study. Two patients from this 005 Study experienced mild to moderate reversible generalized infusion related reactions (IRRs) and discontinued dosing. Of these patients, one had elevated ADA signals at the time of dosing and one developed elevated ADA signals following the occurrence of the IRR. Current data suggests that the generalized IRRs we have observed are not acute allergic reactions. We have established procedural measures for our ongoing trials, including a decreased concentration and intravenous delivery rate of Resolaris, in an effort to minimize the occurrence of reversible generalized IRRs and the formation of ADAs. Although no other patients have experienced a reversible generalized IRR since these measures were put in place, we cannot assure that these measures will be effective in minimizing the occurrence of generalized IRRs or the formation of ADAs or result in the retention of patients in our trials.

Our Preclinical Immuno-Modulatory Domain Program from the Resokine Pathway: iMod.Fc &#160; 

We established a discovery program to leverage our knowledge of the Resokine pathway to vary exposure and activity of the iMod domain through protein engineering. The goal of the program was to develop a potential therapeutic that we refer to as iMod.Fc, which would possess only the N-terminal immuno-modulatory and fibro-modulatory activities of Resokine. We conducted a series of experiments to understand how various product form modifications enhance exposure of the iMod domain. Fc fusion proteins have been successfully commercialized previously by others to enhance exposure while enabling biological activity. We explored this approach by fusing the immunoglobin Fc with one iMod domain, which can form a dimer. Enbrel and Zaltrap are commercialized examples of immunoglobulin Fc fusion proteins.

Our Fc fusion experiments have begun to delineate how to enhance the exposure of the iMod domain of Resokine while maintaining activity and provide insights into this domain harboring immuno-modulatory activity. Initial experiments have indicated that Fc fusion proteins can increase exposure and maintain iMod domain activity. Our efforts in this discovery program have led to the selection of our second product candidate. 

In the fourth quarter of 2015, we announced the selection of a particular iMod.Fc molecule as an investigational new drug (IND) candidate. We have selected this iMod.Fc molecule as our second product development candidate and it represents an expansion of our new class of Physiocrine-based therapeutics. In preclinical studies, the selected iMod.Fc molecule showed promising results in a well-established mouse model of lung inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis, induced by a chemotherapeutic agent known as bleomycin. When given in two therapeutic doses over 21 days, iMod.Fc was comparable to, or outperformed approved drugs with daily dosing in reducing lung inflammation and fibrosis in the bleomycin model. With the selection of this iMod.Fc, molecule we are harnessing the Resokine pathway and plan to test its potential role in lung disease, and to develop iMod.Fc as a potential therapeutic for patients with rare pulmonary diseases with an immune component, or RPICs.

Currently we are producing our iMod.Fc molecules in E. coli by expression in inclusion bodies and refolding to recreate the native structure. This is in contrast to most other marketed Fc fusion therapeutics that are manufactured in CHO cells. We are in the process of initiating GMP process development with a third party manufacturer.

Non-Muscle Indication Set: Rare Pulmonary Diseases with an Immune Component (RPICs) 

The Resokine pathway may play an important role in lung health. We believe the Resokine pathway plays a role in the regulation of tissue homeostasis with respect to immune cell invasion and residence. Jo-1 antibody patients often develop ILD, a pathophysiologic state that involves inflammation and fibrosis of the alveoli, distal airways and septal interstitium of the lungs, includes various patterns of lung pathology and is associated with markedly impaired lung function. We have observed that Jo-1 antibodies isolated from these patients bind to a region of HARS (Resokine) that we believe harbors immuno-modulatory activity with various immune cells.

ILD develops in approximately 85% of anti-synthetase patients with Jo-1 antibodies to Resokine. It can include the presence of focal immune cell infiltrates and an acinar pattern of involvement on chest computed tomography (CT) scan, lymphocytic predominance on broncho-alveolar lavage and lymphocytic invasion of alveolar and interstitial lung tissues on biopsy, and can advance to fibrosis. The pathological patterns in Jo-1 antibody ILD include cellular and fibrotic forms of non-specific interstitial pneumonitis, usual interstitial pneumonitis and diffuse alveolar damage. The development of ILD in Jo-1 antibody patients, particularly the acute severe forms of the disease, portends high morbidity and mortality. Elevations in a number of circulating immune proteins are observed in Jo-1 antibody associated ILD including interferon (IFN)-inducible chemokines CXCL9, or MIG, and CXCL10 or IP-10, IL-8 and IL-6.

ILD occurs in other settings such as rare genetic disorders, environmental exposures, as a side effect of certain therapeutics and as a manifestation of certain connective tissue disorders. Among these forms of ILD, we have identified several that result in severe and progressive lung disease and share immune-pathophysiology features that overlap with our demonstrated Resolaris activities. We have classified these disorders as rare pulmonary diseases with an immune component, or RPIC. Examples of RPICs include idiopathic non-specific interstitial pneumonias, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia, bleomycin (the chemotherapeutic agent)-induced pulmonary fibrosis, and ILD in the setting of systemic sclerosis, or scleroderma, and sarcoidosis. A number of circulating immune proteins are observed in these diseases that overlap with Resolaris activity. These include IP-10, MCP1, IL-8 and IL-6.

To test our hypothesis that augmenting the Resokine path way has therapeutic potential in ILD, we have generated data in a mouse model of lung inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis. The mouse equivalent of Resolaris has shown promising therapeutic activity in this bleomycin-induced model which has been used previo usly in the development of therapeutics for different forms of ILD, including the drug pirfenidone, or Esbriet, which was approved by the FDA in October 2014 for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. We noted that Resolaris administration attenua ted the radiographic and histological manifestations of pathophysiology in this model when it was dosed therapeutically. These mouse Resolaris pharmacology data, along with data discussed above delineating our immuno-modulatory activity in other settings, provide pre-clinical evidence supporting our hypothesis that augmenting the Resokine pathway has therapeutic potential in ILD. 

Our Discovery Engine for Therapeutic Applications of Physiocrines: Lung and Liver Focused

We plan to leverage our discovery engine to identify other Physiocrine pathways of interest and select additional potential product candidates for preclinical and clinical investigation in a variety of disease settings. The engine that drives our discovery efforts is based on our scientific investigation of Physiocrine pathways and their proteins, coupled with a process of identifying disease indications that may benefit from a Physiocrine therapeutic. Through a combination of deep sequencing and bioinformatics panning, augmented by proteomic analysis, we identified over 300 naturally occurring Physiocrines. We then expressed and purified over 200 of these Physiocrines. Our strategy for identifying function and potential indications begins with developing a series of phenotypic assays for in vitro evaluations of function. Many of our purified Physiocrines were evaluated in numerous cell-based phenotypic assays that encompassed 14 distinct human cell types. In July 2014, a publication in Science described a portion of the results from our research, along with the research of our collaborators at Scripps La Jolla, Scripps Florida, Stanford University and the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

A key step in the discovery engine requires mining data from rare disease patients and linking this to the data generated in our phenotypic profiling experiments either in vitro or in vivo . For example, with HARS we studied published reports regarding Jo-1 antibody patients, also known as anti-synthetase patients. These clinical phenotypes led us to consider additional roles that extracellular HARS plays in muscle and lung. Thus, Resolaris, a HARS derivative, was evaluated in a number of in vivo pharmacology models that portray immune-driven inflammatory processes, including myopathy. The ability to restore homeostasis in multiple pharmacology models prompted us to catalog a number of rare myopathies that are immune driven as indications for therapeutic intervention with Resolaris.

We believe our strategy of understanding Physiocrine function by using in vivo experiments early and often while using patient data to focus this in vivo exploration has been validated by Resolaris. Additionally, we believe our discovery engine can be applied to other members of the Physiocrine class to help identify additional indications that may benefit from therapeutic intervention with Physiocrines.

We believe the biology of Physiocrines presents a novel protein therapeutic development opportunity based on the modulation of important physiological processes applicable to multiple diseases. This &#8220;pathway&#8221; approach or &#8220;physiology first&#8221; paradigm as we call it, which leverages the understanding of a basic physiological process, has been used successfully to create some of the most important therapeutics in such diverse areas as oncology and ophthalmology. Given the breadth of our discoveries, we currently focus on Physiocrine pathways related to immune and regeneration responses to explore for product candidates with rare disease applications.

Discovery Programs in Lung and Liver

In addition, we believe some Physiocrine pathways may relate to fibrosis. Fibrosis is the formation of excess fibrous connective tissue in an organ or tissue in a reparative or reactive physiological process. Immune cells and their secreted molecules have been shown to play a critical role in the fibrotic process in a number of human tissues, including liver and lung. Persistent or unregulated inflammation is a hallmark of many chronic diseases, and is implicated in the development of fibrosis. Extracellular factors such as cytokines and chemokines act in the development of fibrosis by activating and recruiting inflammatory cells to developing fibrotic lesions.

As described previously, Resolaris had shown activity in in vivo pharmacology models of lung inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis. We are using this same model to evaluate other Physiocrine molecules in our pipeline. This coupled with ongoing functional knockout studies will be used to prioritize active Physiocrines and novel pathways for further studies.

Immune-mediated processes are also thought to be a driver in various forms of liver fibrosis. A connection between Physiocrines and fibrosis has also been demonstrated in functional knockout studies. In these experiments, conducted at aTyr, antibodies to individual mouse Physiocrines were induced in mice and the phenotypes related to the absence of the Physiocrine or blockade of its pathway were observed. Mice with antibodies to specific Physiocrines developed liver fibrosis and impaired liver function, as measured by decreased glycogen content, decreased albumin:globulin ratio and other functional features.

These experiments demonstrate that the blockade of Physiocrine pathways in rodents resulted in an in vivo phenotype characterized by immune cell infiltration or fibrotic disease in the lung or the liver. These data support the concept that Physiocrines may have the potential to inhibit, limit or otherwise regulate immune cell activity in both the lung and the liver, as well as the subsequent development of fibrosis in these tissues. Accordingly, we are continuing to investigate certain Physiocrines for potential therapeutic applications in both lung and liver indications. 

Other Potential Discovery Programs 

We have applied our discovery engine to identify a variety of medical conditions that we believe may be due to altered Physiocrine function, and are associated with mutations of members of the tRNA synthetase gene family, as set forth in the table below:

Sales and Marketing 

We currently intend to build the commercial infrastructure in the United States and Europe necessary to effectively support the commercialization of all of our product candidates, if and when we believe a regulatory approval of the first of such product candidates in a particular geographic market appears imminent. The commercial infrastructure for products directed at rare disease indications typically consists of a targeted, specialty sales force that calls on a limited and focused group of physicians supported by sales management, medical liaisons, internal sales support, an internal marketing group, and distribution support. One challenge unique to commercializing therapies for rare diseases is the difficulty in identifying eligible patients due to the very small and sometimes heterogeneous disease populations. 

Additional capabilities important to the marketing of therapeutics for rare diseases include the management of key accounts such as managed care organizations, group-purchasing organizations, specialty pharmacies, and government accounts. To develop the appropriate commercial infrastructure, we will have to invest significant amounts of financial and management resources, some of which will be committed prior to any confirmation that any of our product candidates will be approved.

Although we currently intend to commercialize Resolaris and any other product candidates that we may develop on our own, we may elect in the future to utilize strategic partners, distributors, or contract sales forces to assist in the commercialization of our products in selected geographic locations or for particular indications.

Manufacturing

We currently contract with third parties for the manufacturing and testing of our product candidates for preclinical studies and clinical trials and intend to do so in the future. We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical quantities of our product candidates. We currently have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. The use of contracted manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, and reliance on collaboration partners is relatively cost-efficient and has eliminated the need for our direct investment in manufacturing facilities and additional staff early in development. Although we rely on contract manufacturers, we have personnel with extensive manufacturing experience to oversee our contract manufacturers.

Resolaris is produced in recombinant bacteria, purified, filled and packaged for clinical use. The drug substance for Resolaris is currently manufactured in India by Syngene International Limited, or Syngene, pursuant to a Master Services Agreement and a Quality Agreement executed in November 2012. We have a non-exclusive license to the host cell line used to produce drug substance for Resolaris at Syngene. All other raw materials for Resolaris are commercially available. We intend to continue to work with Syngene for the production of Resolaris for preclinical studies and clinical testing. We contract with other third parties to conduct fill and finish and labeling, as well as for the storage and distribution of Resolaris to clinical sites and plan to do so for other product candidates that we may develop.

To date, our third-party manufacturers have met our manufacturing requirements for clinical development, and we expect that our current third-party manufacturers are capable of providing sufficient quantities of our product candidates to meet anticipated clinical development needs through to the start of the pivotal clinical trials.

To meet our projected needs for clinical trials and larger scale commercial manufacturing, we are currently working with Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies USA, Inc., or Fujifilm, to complete the develop ment of the manufacturing process for , and for the production of, drug substance for Resolaris , pursuant to a Master Services Agreement, or MSA, executed in June 2015 . Pursuant to the MSA, Fujifilm will provide drug substance for Resolaris to support future clinical trials, includ ing potential pivotal trials. Under the initial scope of work executed pursuant to the MSA, Fujifilm will conduct process optimization, scale-up and demonstration, and cGMP manufacturing of the drug substance of Resolaris. We have a non- exclusive license to the host cell line used to produce the drug substance for Resolaris at Fujifilm. The drug substance will be filled as drug product at a third party contract research organization , or CRO , and we are currently in the process of scaling-up the drug product batch production. 

Additionally, we are negotiating with additional storage and labelling CROs to enable the commercial storage and supply of Resolaris. We believe that manufacturing at these CMOs/CROs can satisfy our clinical, regulatory and commercial requirements for Resolaris. We cannot be certain, however, that the transfer and commercial scale up of the manufacturing process for Resolaris will not result in significant delay or add material additional costs. 

Patents and Proprietary Rights 

We strive to protect the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patent protection intended to cover the composition of matter of our product candidates, their methods of use, related technology and other inventions that are important to our business. As of March 23, 2016, we own, or have exclusive licenses to, 67 issued U.S. and foreign patents, 7 allowed U.S. and foreign patent applications, and over 240 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications, with predicted expiration dates ranging from 2026 to 2034. In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secrets and careful monitoring of our proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.

Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in the field of Physiocrine therapeutics.

A third party may hold intellectual property, including patent rights, which is important or necessary to the development of our products. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of third parties to commercialize our products, in which case we would be required to obtain a license from these third parties on commercially reasonable terms, or our business could be harmed, possibly materially.

We plan to continue to expand our intellectual property estate by filing patent applications directed to new methods of treatment, therapeutics and additional new product forms thereof with new therapeutic or pharmacokinetic properties. Specifically, we seek patent protection in the United States and internationally for novel compositions of matter covering our protein therapeutics, next generation product forms and the use of these compositions in a variety of therapies.

The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance. Consequently, we do not know whether any of our product candidates will be protectable or remain protected by enforceable patents. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties.

Because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, or a foreign patent office to determine priority of invention or in post-grant challenge proceedings, such as oppositions, that challenge priority of invention or other features of patentability. Such proceedings could result in us incurring substantial costs, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us.

The patent portfolios for our most advanced programs are summarized below. 

Resolaris . Our Resolaris patent portfolio is comprised of a number of patent families and includes U.S. Patent No. 8,835,387 covering Resolaris, which issued on September 16, 2014 and is predicted to expire in 2033; and U.S. Patent No. 9,273,302, which issued on March 1, 2016 and is predicted to expire in 2033 . This patent family is jointly owned by us and Pangu Biopharma. Patent applications in the same family as U.S. Patent No. 8,835,387 are pending in a variety of worldwide jurisdictions, including the United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia and South Africa. The Resolaris patent portfolio also encompasses additional issued patents and pending patent applications that cover Resolaris and related proteins; these patents and patent applications are wholly owned by us. This second patent family includes U.S. Patent No. 9,127,268, which issued on September 8, 2015; European Patent No. 2509625, which granted on January 28, 2015; Japanese Patent No. 5819314, which granted on October 9, 2015; and Australian Patent No. 2010327926, which issued August 21, 2014, and related applications that are pending in the United States, Australia, Canada, Europe, China, Japan, and Hong Kong. Patents that issue from these applications, if any, are expected to expire in 2030 plus any patent term extension. Also included with the Resolaris patent portfolio are pending patent applications to specific methods of use of Resolaris and related proteins, and disease polymorphisms of HARS. These applications have been filed in the United States as U.S. provisional applications and in some cases under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT. U.S. provisional applications may be used to establish non-provisional U.S. applications, PCT applications and other national filings worldwide. PCT applications are eligible for filing in most worldwide jurisdictions, including the United States. If issued, these patents are predicted to expire between 2033 and 2034. 

iMod.Fc . Our iMod.Fc patent portfolio, which covers derivatives of Resokine, including the iMod domain, related splice variants, and next-generation product forms with modified therapeutic activity or pharmacokinetic characteristics, is comprised of a number of patent families and includes U.S. Patent No. 8,404,242, and U.S. Patent No 8,753,638, which issued on March 26, 2013 and June 17, 2014, respectively, and are expected to expire in 2031 and 2030. Also included in this patent family are Japanese Patent No. 5756751, which granted on June 5, 2015; and Australian Patent No. 2010226726, which issued on October 16, 2014. This patent family is jointly owned by us and Pangu Biopharma, and includes pending applications in United States, Australia, Canada, Europe, China, Japan, and Hong Kong. Patents that issue from these applications, if any, are expected to expire in 2030, plus any patent term extension. The iMod.Fc patent family also includes patent applications filed on related splice variants of HARS. This patent family includes applications that are pending in the United States, Australia, Canada, Europe, China, India, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Russia and Hong Kong. This patent family is jointly owned by us, and our subsidiary Pangu Biopharma. Also included within the iMod.Fc patent portfolio are pending applications to specific product forms of iMod.Fc, Resolaris and other HARS splice variants which include patent families to Fc fusion proteins, pegylated forms and variants with substituted D amino acids. These applications have been filed in the United States as U.S. provisional applications and in some cases under the PCT. If issued, these patents are predicted to expire between 2033 and 2034. 

Our pipeline of Physiocrines is covered by a series of 21 patent families, which covers all 20 human cytosolic tRNA synthetases. At least 19 Physiocrine patents are issued in the United States, and applications are pending to the corresponding Physiocrine polynucleotide sequences. These cases are jointly owned by us and Pangu Biopharma, and include pending applications in the United States, Australia, Canada, India, Europe, China and Japan. Patents that issue from these applications, if any, would be expected to expire in 2031. Additional patent applications have also been separately filed on GARS (Glycyl-tRNA synthetase), DARS (Aspartyl-tRNA synthetase), YARS (tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase), and other tRNA synthetases, and any patents issuing from these patent applications would be expected to expire between 2026 and 2030. We have also exclusively in-licensed from TSRI, patents and patent applications related to YARS and specific monomeric forms of tRNA synthetases.

The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest date of filing the non-provisional patent application from which the patent issued.

In the United States, the patent term of a patent that covers a drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other non-United States jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our pharmaceutical products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We intend to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available, however there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions.

We also rely on t rade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independentl y develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employee s, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential informa tion concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual&#8217;s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the ca se of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual, and which are related to our current or planned business or research and development or made during normal working hours, on our premises or using our equipment or pro prietary information, are our exclusive property.

Pangu Biopharma 

In October 2007, we formed our Hong Kong subsidiary, Pangu BioPharma Limited, or Pangu BioPharma, a company registered in Hong Kong, to collaborate with the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, or HKUST, on the discovery and development of aminoacyl tRNA synthetase protein therapeutics. We hold 98% of the outstanding shares of Pangu BioPharma, and a subsidiary of HKUST holds the remaining outstanding shares. Beginning in July 2008, Pangu BioPharma, in collaboration with HKUST, entered into a series of three research grant agreements with the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to carry out research in the discovery and development of Physiocrines. In December 2015, Pangu BioPharma renewed its annual joint research agreement with a subsidiary of HKUST, under which Pangu BioPharma agrees to fund research to be performed in 2016 under the agreement by the subsidiary of HKUST with respect to development of aminoacyl tRNA synthetase protein therapeutics. Pangu BioPharma is the sole beneficial owner of all resulting intellectual property rights from the research performed under these agreements, subject to the right of HKUST&#8217;s subsidiary to use certain background intellectual property of HKUST in conducting the research and, in the event Pangu BioPharma applies for individual funding of any work under the research programs, compliance with the terms and conditions of any written agreement covering ownership of such funded works. Pangu BioPharma funds the annual research on a quarterly basis. Either party may terminate the agreement during the annual period upon an uncured breach of the agreement by the other party. We are also party to a license agreement with Pangu BioPharma, pursuant to which Pangu BioPharma has granted us an exclusive, royalty-bearing license (with a right to sublicense) in and to certain of Pangu BioPharma&#8217;s solely and jointly owned patent rights and know-how to research, develop, manufacture, use, import, export, distribute, offer for sale, sell and have sold products incorporating such patent rights and know-how for any therapeutic, prognostic or diagnostic use throughout the world.

Competition 

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive. We will face competition with respect to Resolaris and any other protein therapeutics we may develop or commercialize in the future from pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and universities and other research institutions. Our competitors may have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, such as larger research and development staff and experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations. Additional mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. Competition may increase further as a result of advances in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these industries. Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing on an exclusive basis drug products that are more effective or less costly than any product candidate that we may develop.

Although we believe we are the only company engaged in the discovery and development of therapeutics based on Physiocrine pathways, we are aware of other companies that are developing products that could compete as treatments for our targeted indications, as described below.

In the area of RMICs, we expect to face competition from a number of companies, academic institutions and other organizations, including Akashi Therapeutics, Inc., BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc., Catabasis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., FibroGen Inc., F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG, Milo Biotechnology, LLC., Nobelpharma Co.Ltd., Novartis AG, Pfizer, Inc., PTC Therapeutics, Inc., Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. and Ultragenyx Pharmaceuticals, that are engaged in the clinical development of therapeutics to address muscle loss and muscle weakness in a variety of indications. More specifically, while there are currently no approved products for the treatment of FSHD, Acceleron Pharma Inc. is developing a clinical candidate, ACE-083, a locally acting protein therapeutic designed to increase muscle mass and strength in patients with neuromuscular disorders and other diseases characterized by a loss of muscle function, including FSHD. In addition, Facio Therapies recently announced its plans to screen chemical libraries to identify chemical compounds that will boost the expression of proteins known to repress one of the causal genes responsible for FSHD. In the area of LGMD, we are aware of a number of academic institutions engaged in the clinical development of therapeutics, including Genethon, a not-for-profit research laboratory created by the Association Fran&#231;aise contre les Myopathies, or French Muscular Dystrophy Association, which has completed an experimental Phase 1 clinical trial in LGMD2C using gene therapy; Nationwide Children&#8217;s Hospital, which is currently conducting a Phase 1/2a clinical trial of an AAV vector to transport the alpha-sarcoglycan gene into muscles in in LGMD2D; and NeuroGen Brain and Spine Institute in India, which is currently conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial in an unspecified form of LGMD using stem cell therapy.

In the area of RPICs, including ILD, we expect to face competition from pirfenidone, which is marketed by several companies worldwide, including InterMune Inc. (acquired by F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG Roche), Shionogi Ltd. and GNI Group Ltd., as well as nintedanib, a small molecule tyrosine-kinase inhibitor marketed by Boehringer Ingelheim, both of which were approved by the FDA in October 2014. We are also aware of a number of companies engaged in the clinical development of therapeutics for lung diseases, including Astra Zeneca plc., Biogen Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb, FibroGen Inc., Gilead Sciences Inc., Promedior, Inc. and Sanofi S. A.

Government Regulation 

Government authorities in the United States, including federal, state, and local authorities, and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the manufacturing, research and clinical development, marketing, labeling and packaging, storage, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, advertising and promotion, pricing, and export and import of pharmaceutical and biological products, such as those we are developing. Pricing of such products is also subject to regulation in many countries. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.

U.S. Government Regulation 

In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations, and biologics under the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and its implementing regulations. FDA approval is required before any new unapproved drug or biologic or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States. Drugs and biologics are also subject to other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time during the product development process, clinical testing, the approval process or after approval, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA&#8217;s refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, untitled or warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any FDA enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.

The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

&#160;

&#183; 

completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests and preclinical animal studies, all performed in accordance with the Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, regulations; 

&#160;

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually; 

&#160;

&#183; 

approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated; 

&#160;

&#183; 

performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication; 

&#160;

&#183; 

preparation of and submission to the FDA of a biologics license application, or BLA, or a new drug application, or NDA, after completion of all pivotal clinical trials; 

&#160;

&#183; 

potential review of the product application by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate and if applicable; 

&#160;

&#183; 

a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA or NDA to file the application for review; 

&#160;

&#183; 

satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities where the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

FDA review and approval of a BLA or NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the product in the United States. 

The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.

An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans in clinical trials. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human trials. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational new drug. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to the proposed clinical trials. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before clinical trials can begin. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. The FDA may impose a clinical hold at any time during clinical trials and may impose a partial clinical hold that would limit trials, for example, to certain doses or for a certain length of time.

Clinical Trials 

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Additionally, approval must also be obtained from each clinical trial site&#8217;s IRB before the trials may be initiated, and the IRB must monitor the trial until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries.

The clinical investigation of a drug is generally divided into three phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined.

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the investigational new drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase 2. The drug is administered to a limited patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks, and preliminarily evaluate efficacy. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase 3. The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites to generate enough data to evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational new drug product, and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. 

In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of a BLA or NDA for a product candidate on the sponsor&#8217;s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials after approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical trials after approval to gain more information about the drug. Such post-approval studies are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials.

A pivotal trial is a clinical trial that adequately meets regulatory agency requirements for the evaluation of a drug candidate&#8217;s efficacy and safety such that it can be used to justify the approval of the product. Generally, pivotal trials are Phase 3 trials, but the FDA may accept results from Phase 2 clinical trials if the trial design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in situations where there is an unmet medical need and the results are sufficiently robust.

Sponsors must also report to the FDA, within certain timeframes, serious and unexpected adverse reactions, any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator&#8217;s brochure, or any findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the product candidate. The FDA, the IRB, or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives or competitive climate.

The clinical trial process can take three to ten years or more to complete, and there can be no assurance that the data collected will support FDA approval or licensure of the product. Results from one trial are not necessarily predictive of results from later trials.

Submission of a BLA or NDA to the FDA

Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed investigational new drug product information is submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA or NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most BLAs and NDAs is subject to an application user fee. For fiscal year 2016, the application user fee exceeds $2.3 million, and the sponsor of an approved BLA or NDA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees, set at $114,450 per product and $585,200 per establishment. These fees are typically increased annually. Applications for orphan drug products are exempted from the BLA and NDA user fees and may be exempted from product and establishment user fees, unless the application includes an indication for other than a rare disease or condition.

A BLA or NDA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical studies and clinical trials, inc luding negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product&#8217;s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical tri als intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including trials initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to e stablish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational new drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA. 

Once a BLA or NDA has been submitted, the FDA&#8217;s goal is to review the application within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. The review process is often significantly extended by the FDA&#8217;s requests for additional information or clarification.

Before approving a BLA or NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA or NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP.

The FDA is required to refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.

The FDA&#8217;s Decision on a BLA or NDA

The FDA evaluates a BLA to determine whether the data demonstrate that the biologic is safe, pure, and potent, or effective, and an NDA to determine whether the drug is safe and effective. After the FDA evaluates the BLA or NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the product will be produced, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA or NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval and issue a denial. The FDA could also approve the BLA or NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical trials. Such post-market testing may include Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product&#8217;s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA&#8217;s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.

Expedited Review and Accelerated Approval Programs

A sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to accelerate FDA&#8217;s review and approval of BLAs and NDAs. For example, Fast Track Designation may be granted to a drug intended for treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition that has potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. The key benefits of fast track designation are more frequent interactions with the FDA during development and testing, the eligibility for priority review, and rolling review, which is submission of portions of an application before the complete marketing application is submitted. Based on results of the Phase 3 clinical trial(s) submitted in a BLA or NDA, upon the request of an applicant, the FDA may grant the BLA or NDA a priority review designation, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review is granted where there is evidence that the proposed product would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious condition. If criteria are not met for priority review, the application is subject to the standard FDA review period of ten months after FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.

Under the accelerated appro val program, the FDA may approve a BLA or NDA on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reason ably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Post-marketing trials or com pletion of ongoing trials after marketing approval are generally required to verify the drug&#8217;s clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit. In addition, the Food and Drug Administra tion Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, which was enacted and signed into law in 2012, established the new Breakthrough Therapy designation. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of its product candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the drug is intended, a lone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinic ally significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. If so designated, the FDA shall act to expedite the development and review of the product&#8217;s marketing application, including by meeting with the spons or throughout the product&#8217;s development, providing timely advice to the sponsor to ensure that the development program to gather pre-clinical and clinical data is as efficient as practicable, involving senior managers and experienced review staff in a cros s-disciplinary review, and assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor. 

Post-Approval Requirements

Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.

Drug manufacturers are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.

We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical quantities of our product candidates, and expect to rely in the future on third parties for the production of commercial quantities. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA or NDA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA&#8217;s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.

The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

&#160;

&#183; 

restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 

&#160;

&#183; 

fines, untitled or warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; 

&#160;

&#183; 

refusal of the FDA to approve pending BLAs or NDAs or supplements to approved BLAs or NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; 

&#160;

&#183; 

product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 

&#160;

&#183; 

injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications a nd in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subj ect to significant liability. 

Orphan Designation and Exclusivity

The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States.

Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages, and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product is the first to receive FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity.

Pediatric Trials and Exclusivity

Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, BLAs and NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of an investigational new drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric populations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. A sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration must submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within sixty days of an end-of-phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and the FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults or full or partial waivers if certain criteria are met. The FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from pre-clinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs. The requirements for pediatric data do not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.

Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the five-year and three-year non-patent and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if a BLA or NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA&#8217;s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of FDA-requested pediatric trials are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection covering the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot accept or approve another application relying on the BLA or NDA sponsor&#8217;s data.

Patent Term Restoration

Depending upon the timing, duration, and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product&#8217;s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA or NDA, plus the time bet ween the submission date and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent and within 60 days of the product&#8217;s approval. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA or NDA.

Biosimilars and Exclusivity 

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or Affordable Care Act, signed into law on March 23, 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCI Act, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be similar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product. This amendment to the PHSA attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.

A reference biologic is granted twelve years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product. The first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against other biologics submitting under the abbreviated approval pathway for the lesser of (i) one year after the first commercial marketing, (ii) eighteen months after approval if there is no legal challenge, (iii) eighteen months after the resolution in the applicant&#8217;s favor of a lawsuit challenging the biologics&#8217; patents if an application has been submitted, or (iv) 42 months after the application has been approved if a lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period.

Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs

In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, Congress authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are the same as drugs previously approved by the FDA under the NDA provisions of the statute. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency. In support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference listed drug, or RLD.

Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is &#8220;bioequivalent&#8221; to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to an RLD if &#8220;the rate and extent of absorption of the [generic] drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug. . . .&#8221;

Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates that the generic product is &#8220;therapeutically equivalent&#8221; to the RLD and it assigns a therapeutic equivalence rating to the approved generic drug in its publication &#8220;Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,&#8221; also referred to as the &#8220;Orange Book.&#8221; Physicians and pharmacists consider an &#8220;AB&#8221; therapeutic equivalence rating to mean that a generic drug is fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA&#8217;s designation of an &#8220;AB&#8221; rating often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient.

The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. In cases where such exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval. The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication.

Hatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30-Month Stay

Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant&#8217;s product or a method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an ANDA applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval.

Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:

&#160;

&#183; 

the required patent information has not been filed; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the listed patent has expired; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and ap proval is sought after patent expiration; or 

&#160;

&#183; 

the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product. 

A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product&#8217;s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.

If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.

European Union/Rest of World Government Regulation

In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. The cost of establishing a regulatory compliance system for numerous varying jurisdictions can be very significant. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of the European Union and in other jurisdictions, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.

Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, for example, a clinical trial application, or CTA, must be submitted for each clinical protocol to each country&#8217;s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is accepted in accordance with a country&#8217;s requirements, the clinical trial may proceed.

The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, the applicable regulatory requirements, and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.

To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational medicinal product under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The content of the BLA or NDA filed in the United States is similar to that required in the European Union, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements.

For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing product licensing, pricing, and reimbursement vary from country to country.

Countries that are part of the European Union, as well as countries outside of the European Union, have their own governing bodies, requirements, and processes with respect to the approval of pharmaceutical and biologic products. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.

Authorization Procedures in the European Union 

Medicines can be authorized in the European Union by using either the centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures.

&#160;

&#183; 

Centralized procedure . The EMA implemented the centralized procedure for the approval of human medicines to facilitate marketing authorizations that are valid throughout the European Economic Area, or EEA, which is comprised of the 28 member states of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland, and Lichtenstein. This procedure results in a single marketing authorization issued by the EMA that is valid across the EEA. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines that are: derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, and officially designated orphan medicines. 

&#160;

&#183; 

For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the European Commission following a favorable opinion by the EMA, as long as the medicine concerned is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health. 

&#160;

&#183; 

National authorization procedures . There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several European Union countries, which are available for investigational medicinal products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Decentralized procedure . Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one European Union country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any European Union country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Mutual recognition procedure . In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one European Union Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other European Union countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization. 

In some cases, a Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, or a request for waiver or deferral, is required for submission prior to submitting a marketing authorization application. A PIP describes, among other things, proposed pediatric trials and their timing relative to clinical trials in adults.

New Chemical Entity Exclusivity

In the European Union, new chemical entities, sometimes referred to as new active substances, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator&#8217;s data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application for eight years, after which a generic application can be submitted, and the innovator&#8217;s data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.

Orphan Designation and Exclusivity

In the European Union, the European Commission, after reviewing the opinion of the EMA&#8217;s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, or COMP, grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions that affect not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the European Union Community, or when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of such products in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the products. Additionally, orphan drug designation is only available where no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of the condition has been authorized (or the product would be a significant benefit to those affected).

In the European Union, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following medicinal product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Market exclusivity would not prevent the approval of a similar drug that is shown to be safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior.

Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.

Exceptional Circumstances/Conditional Approval 

Orphan drugs or drugs with unmet medical needs may be eligible for European Union approval under exceptional circumstances or with conditional approval. Approval under exceptional circumstances may be applicable to orphan products and is used when an applicant is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use because the indication for which the product is intended is encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive evidence, when the present state of scientific knowledge does not allow comprehensive information to be provided, or when it is medically unethical to collect such information. Conditional marketing authorization may be applicable to orphan medicinal products, medicinal products for seriously debilitating or life-threatening diseases, or medicinal products to be used in emergency situations in response to recognized public threats. Conditional marketing authorization can be granted on the basis of less complete data than is normally required in order to meet unmet medical needs and in the interest of public health, provided the risk-benefit balance is positive, it is likely that the applicant will be able to provide the comprehensive clinical data, and unmet medical needs will be fulfilled. Conditional marketing authorization is subject to certain specific obligations to be reviewed annually.

Accelerated Review

Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the EMA&#8217;s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP). Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. In this circumstance, EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days, excluding clock stops.

Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement

Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Moreover, a payor&#8217;s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third- party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.

Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit.

The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. By way of example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively, the Affordable Care Act, contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, increased rebates for drugs sold to Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies&#8217; share of sales to federal health care programs. Adoption of government controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals.

In the European Community, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed to by the government. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.

The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government an d third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States and other countries has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharma ceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage polic ies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 

Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements

If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we may be subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing and education programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:

&#160;

&#183; 

the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; 

&#160;

&#183; 

federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the federal transparency laws, inc luding the provision of the Affordable Care Act referred to as the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, that requires drug and biologics manufacturers to disclose payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals; 

&#160;

&#183; 

HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

The Affordable Care Act broadened the reach of the fraud and abuse laws by, among other things, amending the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the applicable criminal healthcare fraud statutes contained within 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1320a-7b. Pursuant to the statutory amendment, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act or the civil monetary penalties statute. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.

We are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which prohibits improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Safeguards we implement to discourage improper payments or offers of payments by our employees, consultants, and others may be ineffective, and violations of the FCPA and similar laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, or other liabilities or proceedings against us, any of which would likely harm our reputation, business, financial condition and result of operations.

If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid and imprisonment, damages, fines and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
