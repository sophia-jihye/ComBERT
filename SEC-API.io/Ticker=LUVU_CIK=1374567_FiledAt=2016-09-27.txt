Making products that people love, bringing manufacturing back to the USA, sustainable manufacturing practices, and decreasing the overall impact on the environment are core to the Company&#8217;s operating principles.

Corporate History 

&#160;

The Company was incorporated in the State of Florida on February 25, 1999, under the name of WES Consulting, Inc. to provide consulting and commercial property management services. On October 19, 2009, the Company entered into a Merger and Recapitalization Agreement (the &#8220;Merger Agreement&#8221;) with Liberator, Inc. (f/k/a Remark Enterprises Inc.), a Nevada corporation (&#8220;Old Liberator&#8221;). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Old Liberator merged with and into the Company, with the Company surviving as the sole remaining entity (the &#8220;Merger&#8221;). On February 28, 2011, the Company name was changed from WES Consulting, Inc. to Liberator, Inc.

&#160;

Effective November 5, 2015, the Company changed its corporate name from Liberator, Inc. to Luvu Brands, Inc. to reflect its broader offering of wellness and lifestyle products designed for mass market channels.

Overview of our Facilities and Operations 

&#160; 

Since inception we have used a vertically integrated business model, with manufacturing, distribution, product development and marketing performed in-house. We believe this allows us to create new products with reduced lead times at a lower cost while enabling us to quickly respond to market and customer demands for our existing products. For our wholesale accounts, being able to fulfill large orders with shorter turnaround times allows us to capture business during December and February when wholesale customers make just-in-time holiday purchases.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Our 140,000 square foot facility on eight acres is located in a suburb of metro Atlanta, Georgia and includes manufacturing and distribution, sales and marketing, product development, customer service and administrative staff. All of the Liberator, Jaxx and Avana branded products are designed, produced and marketed from our facility in Atlanta, Georgia where we currently employ over 150 people. As of the date of this report, the Company employs 116 people in Production and Distribution, 3 people in Product Development, 15 people in Sales and Marketing, and 18 people in Administration. The Company&#8217;s employment levels may change seasonal based on current and anticipated order levels.

&#160;

&#160;

Our manufacturing operation has CAD controlled fabric cutting and foam contouring equipment and two state-of-the-art conveyor unit production sewing systems. Our in-house manufacturing capabilities have enabled us to achieve greater efficiencies and cost savings, as well as strict control over the entire manufacturing cycle including raw material procurement, finished goods production and logistics optimization. In addition to providing us with greater production flexibility, our in-house manufacturing provides us with the opportunity to improve fulfillment response time, reduces the risk of out-of-stock situations, limits finished goods obsolescence and improves overall operating margins.

&#160;

In 2008, we implemented a state-of-the-art conveyor-based sewing system to manufacture sewn products at the lowest possible cost in the United States. Because all cutting, sewing, foam contouring, assembly and packaging are performed in-house, we believe we can exercise greater control over product quality and respond faster to changing customer demands, which gives us a competitive advantage over companies that utilize out-sourced sewing services. We can source raw materials from multiple domestic suppliers and we have supply contracts in place to produce our specialty fabrics under specific quality control and performance standards with just-in-time deliveries.

&#160;

During fiscal 2015, we installed new equipment which increased the capacity of our foam repurposing operation. During fiscal 2016, we installed new equipment to increase our fabric cutting capabilities and our bead filling capabilities. All of these actions resulted in increased throughput and lower production costs in these operations.

&#160;

All business activity of the Company is done through our wholly-owned subsidiary, OneUp Innovations, Inc. (&#8220;OneUp&#8221;). OneUp was organized in 2000 and began operations in 2002.

&#160;

Business Strategy 

&#160;

Our goals are to achieve long-term growth and profitability and diversify our sales base. We plan to achieve these goals using the following strategies:

&#160;

&#183; Delivering value to our customers . Our primary goal is to deliver the highest value to every customer, before, during and after they purchase a product from us. This means designing relevant products with the most utility and benefit, creating an informative and efficient buying experience, and delivering on our promises. We believe that serving the customer is the center of everything we do, and by doing so we create value for our customers and wealth for our owners. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; Manufacturing . To improve our business results, we constantly look for ways to manage the impact of rising raw material costs by improving the productivity of our manufacturing processes. We recently implemented modest price increases for certain products, but are unable to predict if we will be able to successfully pass on recent raw material cost increases to our wholesale and retail customers. &#160;

&#183; Wholesale Operations. Our goal is to increase consumer demand through advertising and public relations while our wholesale operations expand our offering to distributors, retailers and e-tailers across every channel of adult, mass market, drug and specialty accounts. For wholesalers thinking about adding Sexual Wellness products to their retail or online store, our Liberator product line is typically one of the first &#8220;safer&#8221; products presented, as it can be promoted as an assistive aid to sexual positioning. As the mainstream demand for Sexual Wellness products grows, our sales staff is training and educating new resellers on how to get started in this category. For retail display, we offer mainstream packaging in a variety of sizes and price points to meet their customers particular demographic. For e-tailers, we maintain brand continuity by providing rich product content, photography and instructional videos for use on their websites. We also provide fulfillment services and can drop-ship orders directly to their customer, typically the same day the order is received. &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; Eco-Packaging. In fiscal 2013, we developed vacuum compressed packaging to reduce our carbon foot print, make our products more convenient for the consumer and easier to display for the retailer, and reduce our outbound shipping costs. During fiscal 2014, we expanded the number of products that used Eco-Packaging to include all shapes. In fiscal 2015, we further vacuum compressed our products to even smaller sizes while adding more product marketing information to our retail consumer packages. &#160;

&#183; Liberator Concept Store . Our 2,500 square foot Liberator exhibition store is the retail extension of our Liberator.com website. Located at our Atlanta factory, it is a gallery-like setting for sensual and erotic discovery, offering a presentation of products that celebrate intimacy and romantic imagination. In our opinion, Liberator and luxury pleasure objects are meant to go together. Our concept store is a destination where customers can learn about, touch and purchase the Liberator products. In addition to Liberator branded shapes, furniture and accessories, the store features a range of better brands from around the globe including: designer sex toys, masks, cuffs and intimate accessories. Also included are limited edition hand-made items in glass and leather. We are dedicated to bringing our customers a compelling in-store experience through knowledgeable associates, interactive media displays and a high level of service, quality and innovation. The store also serves as a laboratory to listen and observe consumer reaction to new products and evaluate price points and merchandising techniques. Our concept store has demonstrated the strength of the Liberator brand as customers, both singles and couples, want to feel and experience our products and, although we are located in an industrial park, they are willing to travel to the store, return repeatedly and refer friends. We believe that a Liberator branded retail concept is ready to be expanded beyond our single location to large metropolitan areas, providing an upscale experience in-sync with the overall mainstreaming of sexual wellness. &#160; &#160;

&#160; 

Products, Principal Markets and Methods of Distribution 

&#160;

Liberator Products 

&#160;

We developed a product category which we call &#8220; Liberator Bedroom Adventure Gear &#8221;. These positioning props elevate, rock and create surfaces and textures that expand the sexual repertoire and make the act of love more exciting. Liberator Bedroom Adventure Gear combines functional design with sensuous textures that transform ordinary bedrooms into supportive landscapes for intimacy. Liberator products present angles, elevations, curves and motion that help people of all sizes, including those with back injuries and other medical conditions, find comfortable ways to connect intimately while assisting their stamina and performance.

&#160;

Liberator foam-based products (called &#8220;Liberator Shapes&#8221;) are manufactured in a variety of heights and widths to accommodate variations in the human body. They consist of differently shaped cushions and props that are available in an assortment of fabric colors and prints to add to the visual excitement. Each of the product profiles of the Liberator Shapes is unique, designed to introduce positions to the sexual experience that were previously difficult to achieve or impossible to achieve with standard pillows or cushions. Liberator Shapes are manufactured from structured polyurethane foam, cut at various angles, platforms and profiles. The foam base is encased in a tight, fluid resistant polyester shell, helping the cushions to maintain their shape. The original offering of the Liberator Wedge&#174; and Ramp&#174;, sold as a set, continue to be our best-selling items. All of the Liberator Shapes are also available in our Black Label Series which includes blindfolds and snap-on Velcro cuffs.

&#160;

We have also developed larger profile designs that are commonly referred to as &#8220;sex furniture&#8221;. Three of the sex furniture pieces are made from contoured urethane foam and covered in a variety of fabrics and colors. These items are marketed as the Esse&#174;, Esse Stage&#174;, and the Equus&#174;. Other larger designs include products based on shredded polyurethane foam encased in a wide range of fabric types and colors and sold under our Zeppelin&#174; product offering. The Liberator larger profile designs can also be used as seating when not being used for relaxed interaction and creative intimacy.

&#160;

We conduct our wholesale business for Liberator sexual wellness products through four primary channels: (1) adult and female friendly retailers, flash sites and specialty boutiques, (2) e-tailers who sell our products through adult, mass market, drug and other sites offering sexual wellness products, (3) mail order catalogers, and (4) wholesale distributors of adult / sexual wellness products. These wholesale accounts have approximately 950 retail locations and/or websites in the United States and Canada. We have a growing number of retailers who have added a dedicated Liberator exhibition concept to their merchandising space. We also sell our products in Europe through a Netherlands-based third-party fulfillment service.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

All products sold under the Liberator brand provided 48% and 46% of our revenues for our fiscal years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

&#160; 

Resale Products 

&#160;

Beginning in 2006, we began importing high-quality pleasure objects from around the world. These resale products (including Tenga products) provided 29% and 34% of our revenues in each of our fiscal years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

&#160;

Under OneUp, we also function as an exclusive resale distributor of the Tenga brand in North America. Tenga products are sold through the same wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels as branded Liberator products. Sales of Tenga products accounted for approximately 19% and 22% of net sales in the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and approximately 15% of the total gross profit in the year ended June 30, 2016 and 17% of the total gross profit in the year ended June 30, 2015.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Jaxx Casual Seating and Avana Comfort Products 

&#160;

The Company sells a line of contemporary casual seating under the Jaxx brand. Jaxx is an offshoot from Liberator manufacturing as it provides additional revenue from repurposing our polyurethane foam trim into shredded beanbag fill. The Jaxx product line and accessory products are sold through the following four wholesale channels: (1) beanbag e-tailers, (2) mass marketers, (3) mail order catalogers, and (4) retail furniture stores. The Avana product line is a unique collection of comfort products that aid in sleep, meditation, and massage. The Avana product line is sold through e-merchants, mail order catalogers and through our website under the URL www.avanacomfort.com. The Company also owns and manages a website under the URL www.JaxxLiving.com for direct to consumer sales of Jaxx products. Our Jaxx and Avana products (combined) provided 18% of our revenues in our fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 and 15% in our fiscal year ended June 30, 2015.

&#160;

The contemporary seating business is highly competitive. We believe we can compete effectively on the basis of product quality, design, customer service and price. We believe that our primary competitive advantages are consumer recognition of the Jaxx brand, as well as distribution through the multiple sales channels where consumers prefer to purchase.

&#160;

Sales and Distribution 

&#160;

Our sales personnel are organized by geographic market and by customer type. In North America, we have sales personnel who routinely visit sexual wellness retailers to assist in product training, merchandising and stocking of selling areas. Through our in-house wholesale sales organization, we engage retailers directly and then either ship to them on a wholesale basis or provide fulfillment services by drop-shipping directly to their customers.

&#160;

In fiscal 2014, the Company adopted a new international sales strategy. In the European Union, the Company has shifted from a licensee model to a direct sales model with the addition of a US-based salesperson. This salesperson is responsible for wholesale sales, marketing operations and customer service in the European Union and other international markets. Total international sales represented approximately 2% of our total net sales in each of the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.

&#160;

As is customary in the sexual wellness and casual furniture industry, sales to customers are generally made pursuant to purchase orders, and we do not have long-term or exclusive contracts with any of our retail customers or wholesale distributors. We believe that our continuing relationships with our customers are based upon our ability to provide a wide selection and reliable source of sexual wellness and casual furniture products, combined with our expertise in marketing and new product introduction.

&#160;

Internet Websites 

&#160;

Since 2002, our Liberator website located at www.Liberator.com has allowed our customers to purchase our Liberator merchandise over the Internet. We design and operate our websites using an in-house technical and creative staff.

&#160;

Our www.Liberator.com website is intended to be an entertainment and educational venue where consumers can watch product demonstration videos, videos on sexual wellness topics and humorous videos on the many facets of human sexuality.

&#160;

Our www.JaxxLiving.com website offers contemporary indoor and outdoor seating to the young adult and children&#8217;s market.

&#160;

Our www.AvanaComfort.com website blends rest, relaxation and health products in an offering that appeals to a broad range of consumers.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Our corporate website is www.luvubrands.com. There we make available copies of Luvu Brands documents, news releases and our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the &#8220;SEC&#8221;, including financial statements. 

&#160;

Unless specifically set forth to the contrary, the information that appears on our websites is not part of this annual report.

&#160;

&#160; Research and Development 

&#160;

As a consumer-driven innovation company, we use consumer and market research to better understand consumer needs. This research guides our product development and marketing teams in the design and delivery of our products and customer experience. Our product development expenses were $169,360 in the year ended June 30, 2016, and $124,674 in the year ended June 30, 2015.

&#160;

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials 

&#160; 

We obtain all of the raw materials and components used to produce our products from outside sources. A number of components, including certain fabrics and zippers, are sourced from suppliers who currently serve as our sole or primary source of supply for these components. We believe we can obtain these raw materials and components from other sources of supply, although we could experience some short-term disruption in our ability to fulfill orders in the event of an unexpected loss of supply from one of the primary suppliers. We utilize dual sourcing on targeted components when effective.

&#160;

Major Customers 

&#160;

Our ten largest customers (excluding our own e-commerce sites and retail store) accounted for approximately 37% of net sales for the year ended June 30, 2016 and 39% of net sales for the year ended June 30, 2015. Sales to (and through) Amazon accounted for 28% of our net sales during the year ended June 30, 2016 and 26% of our sales for the year ended June 30, 2015. The loss of, or a significant adverse change in our relationship with, any of our largest customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. &#160; 

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

We compete with other manufacturers, distributors and marketers of wellness, lifestyle and casual seating, both within and outside the U.S. The sexual wellness and furniture industries are highly fragmented and competition for the sale of such products comes from many sources. These products are sold primarily through retailers (independent retailers, drug store chains, and mass market retailers), distributors, and direct sales channels (internet marketing and mail order companies).

&#160;

For Liberator products, we believe that our primary competitive advantage is consumer recognition of our brand. Due to the strength of our brand, we have no direct competition for the majority of our Liberator branded products. In fact, many e-commerce websites refer to Liberator as a product category and not as a discrete product. And since we sell through multiple sales channels, we provide consumers with the ability to shop for Liberator intimacy products in an environment or website that they are most comfortable in. We also believe that we differentiate ourselves from conventional sex toys based on our utility of design and overall customer satisfaction as it relates to enhanced intimacy.

&#160;

For our Resale products, competition among retailers of adult products and web based marketers is high. Although we compete with retail, catalog, and internet businesses and now mass and drug retailers that sell sexual wellness products including vibrators, pleasure objects, accessories and similar merchandise, we believe that this opens new channels of distribution for our Liberator products and that we are able to compete favorably as our Liberator products are unique, are couple-centric, and are assistive devices for couples with sexual limitations and issues.

&#160;

For the Liberator e-commerce website, other competitive factors include the effectiveness of our electronic customer mailing lists, maintaining natural search listing, advertising response rates, website design and functionality. The broad range of designs, color choice, fabrics and accessories that we offer helps to differentiate us and allows us to compete favorably against many other adult or sexual wellness websites. Liberator.com also competes against numerous mainstream websites, many of which have a greater volume of web traffic, greater financial strength and marketing resources.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

We believe competition in our industries is based on, among other things, the ability to deliver the right product at the right time, product quality and safety, innovation, customer service and price. We believe we compete favorably with other companies because of our ability to provide a broad product offering for customers, our vertically-integrated manufacturing operation which allows us to quickly respond to customer demand, our commitment to quality and safety, and our commitment to minimizing our environmental impact.

&#160;

Our future competitive position will likely depend on, but not be limited to, the following:

&#160;

the continued acceptance of our products by our customers and consumers; &#160;

our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our patent and trademarks and the continued validity of such intellectual property; &#160;

our ability to successfully expand our product offerings; &#160;

our ability to maintain adequate inventory levels to meet our customers&#8217; demands; &#160;

our ability to expand; &#160;

our ability to continue to manufacture high quality products at competitive prices; &#160;

our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; &#160;

the effect of any future governmental regulations on our products and business; &#160;

the continued growth of the global sexual wellness industry; and &#160;

our ability to respond to changes within the industry and consumer demand, financially and otherwise. &#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

We are subject to customs, truth-in-advertising and other laws, including consumer protection regulations that regulate the promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of warehouse facilities. We monitor changes in these laws and believe that we are in material compliance with applicable laws.

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

The Liberator trademark is registered with the United States Patent and Trademark office and with the registries of many foreign countries. In addition we were issued approximately 20 other product name trademarks and trade names including: &#8220;Bedroom Adventure Gear&#8221;&#174;, &#8220;Explore More&#8221;&#174;, Ramp&#174;, Wedge&#174;, Stage&#174;, Esse&#174;, Zeppelin&#174;, Hipster&#174;, Wing&#174;, Equus&#174;, Jaxx&#174; and Bonbon&#174;. In August 2005, we were issued utility patent number US 6,925,669 &#8220;Support Cushion and System of Cushions.&#8221; We believe our trademarks and patent have significant value and we intend to continue to vigorously protect them against infringement.

&#160; 

Employees and Labor Relations 

&#160; 

As of September 19, 2016, we had 150 employees (116 in production and warehouse operations, and 36 in sales, marketing and administrative operations). Additional staffing is typically required to support the peak holiday period through Valentine&#8217;s Day. None of our employees are represented by a union. We have had no labor-related work stoppages, and we believe our relationships with our employees are good.

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

Our business is seasonal and, as a result, revenues will vary from quarter to quarter. During the past three years, we have realized an average of approximately 28% of our annual revenues in our second quarter, which includes Christmas, and an average of approximately 27% of our revenues in the third quarter, which includes Valentine&#8217;s Day.

&#160; 

Financial Information about Our Business Segments and Geographic Areas 

&#160; 

We conduct our business through two primary sales channels: Direct (consisting of our Internet websites and our Atlanta store) and Wholesale (consisting of our stocking reseller, drop-ship, contract manufacturing and distributor accounts).

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Liberator - Liberator products consist of items that are manufactured by us and are intended for sale in the sexual health and wellness market. Liberator products are sold to retailers and distributors as well as directly through our three e-commerce sites and single retail store. Net sales of Liberator products increased 13% during the year ended June 30, 2016, from the comparable year earlier period. This increase is primarily related to the ongoing success of our eco-compression packaging and higher sales of Liberator products to (and through) Amazon.com.

&#160;

Jaxx and Avana - Jaxx products are contemporary seating products manufactured by us and sold under the Jaxx brand. Jaxx products are sold to e-merchants and retailers as well as directly through our e-commerce site. The Avana product line is a unique collection of comfort products that aid in sleep, meditation, and massage. The Avana product line is sold through e-merchants, mail order catalogers and through our e-commerce site. Net sales of Jaxx and Avana products (combined) increased 31% during the year ended June 30, 2016, compared to the prior year. This increase is primarily due to greater sales of Jaxx and Avana products to (and through) Amazon and other e-merchants.

&#160;

Resale - Resale products are non-Liberator branded products (including Tenga) that we purchase from others at wholesale or distributor prices and resell through our sales channels to retailers, distributors, or through one of our e-commerce sites and single retail store. Sales of Resale products decreased 7% during the year ended June 30, 2016 from the prior year. The decrease is primarily the result of increased competition in the marketplace for those products and the resulting downward pricing pressure.

&#160;

Other - Other products include sales from contract manufacturing and fulfillment services. Net sales during the year ended June 30, 2016 increased 7% compared to the prior year. This increase is due to an increase in the number of contract manufacturing projects during fiscal year 2016 from the prior fiscal year.
