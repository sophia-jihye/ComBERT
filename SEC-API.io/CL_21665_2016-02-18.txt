Sales of Oral, Personal and Home Care products accounted for 47% , 20% &#32;and 19% , respectively, of the Company&#8217;s total worldwide Net sales in 2015 . Geographically, Oral Care is a significant part of the Company&#8217;s business in Asia, &#160; comprising approximately 86% &#32;of Net sales in that region for 2015 . 

&#32;1

For additional information regarding market share data, see &#8220; Market Share Information &#8221; &#32;in Part II, Item 7 of this report. 

Research and Development 

Strong research and development capabilities and alliances enable Colgate to support its many brands with technologically sophisticated products to meet consumers&#8217; oral, personal and home care and pet nutrition needs. The Company&#8217;s spending related to research and development activities was $274 million &#32;in 2015 , $277 million &#32;in 2014 &#32;and $267 million &#32;in 2013 . 

Distribution; Raw Materials; Competition; Trademarks and Patents 

The Company&#8217;s products are marketed by a direct sales force at individual operating subsidiaries or business units and by distributors or brokers. Oral, Personal and Home Care sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates represent approximately 11% &#32;of the Company&#8217;s Net sales in 2015. No other customer represents more than 10% of the Company&#8217;s Net sales. 

The majority of raw and packaging materials used in the Company&#8217;s products are purchased from other companies and are available from several sources. No single raw or packaging material represents, and no single supplier provides, a significant portion of the Company&#8217;s total material requirements. For certain materials, however, new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry, governmental and Colgate standards, which can require additional investment and take some period of time. Raw and packaging material commodities such as resins, pulp, essential oils, tropical oils, tallow, poultry, corn and soybeans &#32;are subject to market price variations. 

The Company&#8217;s products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which has experienced increased trade concentration and the growing presence of large-format retailers and discounters. Products similar to those produced and sold by the Company are available from multinational and local competitors in the U.S. and overseas. Certain of the Company&#8217;s competitors are larger and have greater resources than the Company. In certain geographies, particularly in the emerging markets, the Company also faces strong local competitors, who may be more agile and have better local consumer insights than the Company. In addition, private label brands sold by retail trade chains are a source of competition for certain of the Company&#8217;s product lines. Product quality, innovation, brand recognition, marketing capability and acceptance of new products largely determine success in the Company&#8217;s operating segments. 

Trademarks are considered to be of material importance to the Company&#8217;s business. The Company follows a practice of seeking trademark protection in the U.S. and throughout the world where the Company&#8217;s products are sold. Principal global and regional trademarks include Colgate, Palmolive, Speed Stick, Lady Speed Stick, Softsoap, Irish Spring, Protex, Sorriso, Kolynos, elmex, Tom&#8217;s of Maine, Sanex, Ajax, Axion, Fabuloso, Soupline and Suavitel, as well as Hill&#8217;s Science Diet, Hill&#8217;s Prescription Diet and Hill &#8217; s Ideal Balance. The Company&#8217;s rights in these trademarks endure for as long as they are used and/or registered. Although the Company actively develops and maintains a portfolio of patents, no single patent is considered significant to the business as a whole. 

&#32;2 

Environmental Matters 

The Company has programs that are designed to ensure that its operations and facilities meet or exceed standards established by applicable environmental rules and regulations. Capital expenditures for environmental control facilities totaled $43 million for 2015 . For future years, expenditures are currently expected to moderately increase from historical levels due to spending in connection with Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certifications at manufacturing facilities and continued progress on the Company&#8217;s goal to increase energy efficiencies in the manufacturing of the Company&#8217;s products. For additional information regarding environmental matters refer to Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
