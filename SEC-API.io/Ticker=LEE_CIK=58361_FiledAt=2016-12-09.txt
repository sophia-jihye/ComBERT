 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Lee Enterprises, Incorporated is a leading provider of local news and information, and a major platform for print and digital advertising, in the markets we serve, which are located primarily in the Midwest, Mountain West and West regions of the United States. With the exception of St. Louis, Missouri, our 49 markets (including TNI Partners ("TNI") and Madison Newspapers ("MNI")), across 21 states, are principally midsize or small. Through our paid and unpaid print and digital platforms, we reach an overwhelming majority of adults in our markets. 

Our products include: 

&#8226; 

46 daily and 34 Sunday newspapers with print and digital subscribers totaling 0.8 million &#32;and 1.2 million , respectively, for the 13 weeks ended September 25, 2016 . We estimate that more than three million people read our printed daily newspapers each day. 

&#8226; 

Nearly 300 weekly newspapers and classified and niche publications. 

Our markets have established retail bases, and most are regional shopping hubs. We are located in four state capitals. Six of our top ten markets by revenue include major universities, and seven are home to major corporate headquarters. Community newspapers and their associated digital media are a valuable source of local news and information attracting readers and providing an effective means for local advertisers to reach their customers. We believe our audiences across these communities tend to be loyal readers that actively seek our content and serve as an attractive target for our advertisers. 

We do not face significant competition from other local daily newspapers in most of our markets, although there is significant competition for audience in those markets from other media. In our top ten markets by revenue, only two have significant local daily print competition. 

Lee Enterprises, Incorporated was founded in 1890, incorporated in 1950, and listed on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") in 1978. We have acquired and divested a number of businesses since inception. 

In 2014, we completed a comprehensive refinancing of our debt (the "2014 Refinancing"). Final maturities of our debt have been extended to dates from March 2019 through December 2022. As a result, we believe refinancing risk has been substantially reduced for the next several years. 

We experienced significant net losses since 2007 &#32; primarily due to non-cash charges for impairment of intangible and other assets in 2013, 2011, 2009 and 2008 and reorganization costs in 2012. Our ability to operate as a going concern is dependent on our ability to remain in compliance with debt covenants and to repay, refinance or amend our debt agreements as they become due, or earlier if available liquidity is consumed. We are in compliance with our debt covenants at September 25, 2016 . The information included herein should be evaluated in that context. See Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221;, and Notes 3 and 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included herein, for additional information. 

STRATEGIC INITIATIVES 

We are focused on several strategic initiatives: 

Comprehensive Local News That Drives Frequency And Engagement 

We drive frequency and engagement with our products by delivering valuable, intensely local, original news and information that, in many cases, we believe our audiences cannot otherwise readily obtain. Our large and talented news and editorial staff provide constant, real-time local news with significant breadth, depth and reliability. Our full access platforms provide our subscribers with in-depth and breaking news and information through continuous updates to our stories digitally on websites, mobile devices and tablets. 

We believe the strength of our local brands is the result of the quality and size of our news gathering staff, which allow us to provide the most comprehensive coverage of local news in our markets. In most of our markets, we are the leading source of print and digital news and information. As the digital consumption of news has expanded, we have moved quickly to develop applications that address audience and digital advertising demands for mobile and tablet advertising platforms. As new digital technologies emerge, we expect to move rapidly to make our content available through them and monitize the audience. 

We are focused on continually improving the functionality and the look and feel of all our news platforms, providing greater depth of coverage and reader engagement. We are arming our journalists with new tools to give them real-time information about audience engagement on our digital platforms, helping inform their decisions on both presentation and coverage. 

We believe our journalists are at the forefront for information about the local community. We are engaging our readers by providing information that we believe stirs public awareness, advances ideas, inspires vision, creates debate and provokes action. Through our news leadership we strive to contribute to community betterment, promote education, foster commerce and help improve the quality of life in our markets. 

Accelerate And Expand Digital Revenue Growth 

Our &#32; digital &#32; businesses have experienced rapid growth since &#32; 2010 . D igital &#32; advertising grew &#32; 5.6% &#32; and reached &#32; 25.3% &#32; of total advertising and marketing services revenue in the 13 weeks and year ended &#32; September 25, 2016 . &#32; We are growing revenue by offering an expansive array of digital products, including video, digital couponing, behavioral targeting, audience retargeting, banner ads and social networking. 

We provide digital marketing services to small and midsized businesses ("SMBs"), including search engine marketing ("SEM"), social media, audience extension, business profiles and website hosting and design. Lee Local offers small business solutions including search engine optimization (&#8220;SEO&#8221;), local online marketing, social media marketing, video advertising and web site design. Lee Local seeks to help small businesses maximize the return on marketing dollars 

by increasing audiences, expanding brands, and enhancing their web presence. We believe that these innovative solutions will continue to drive meaningful new opportunities for us to grow our digital marketing revenue. 

Digital national revenue grew 20.4% &#32;in 2016, driven by our sweeps program and improved inventory management and pricing. Mobile advertising increased 19.6% &#32;and digital retail advertising that represents 60.5% &#32;of total digital advertising increased 9.6% &#32;in 2016. 

INN Partners, L.C. ("TownNews.com"), of which we own 82.5%, provides digital infrastructure and digital publishing services for nearly 1,600 daily and weekly newspapers, along with universities, television stations and niche publications, as well as for us. We believe TownNews.com represents a powerful opportunity for us to drive additional digital revenue. In 2016, digital services revenue, which is primarily TownNews,com, increased to more than $14 million , or 13.7% &#32;over 2015. 

We are also a member of the Local Media Consortium (the &#8220;Consortium&#8221;). The Consortium partners with companies like Google, Yahoo! and other technology companies and service providers to increase the potential share of new revenue and audience-building programs available to consortium members, as well as the quality of information and advertising services available from, Consortium members. The Consortium currently includes more than 1,600 local newspapers and hundreds of local broadcast outlets in the United States. 

Our sales force is larger than any local competitor, and we believe they are the most highly trained and proficient sales force in our markets. We also continue to expand our array of digital products to address advertisers evolving needs, while seeking to increase our share of advertising and marketing services spending from existing customers and react to competition. 

In 2016, no single advertiser accounted for more than 2% of advertising revenue and our top 10 advertisers represented 8.9% of advertising revenue. 

Our local sales forces are one of our core strengths. We have strong relationships with businesses in our markets and offer a wide array of products to deliver the advertisers' message. In fact eighty percent of our advertising revenue now comes from local and regional businesses, and our sales executives pitch the power of our audiences directly to these local decision makers. 

To address the evolving needs of local advertisers we are changing the way we sell local advertising to maximize our opportunities with small and medium-sized businesses. Local, controllable advertising accounts, in which our local sales teams have direct contact with the advertising decision makers are the core of our business. To address the needs of and better serve these local advertisers we developed the "Edison Project" which is directly aimed at these local advertisers. 

With Edison, we are completely restructuring local sales teams and simplifying advertising packages to offer bigger ads and more frequency across our digital and print products. 

In our test markets, results from the Edison Project have been very promising and we're expanding Edison into all Lee markets beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, with full implementation expected by the end of the second fiscal quarter. 

In addition, our successful Big Pitch initiative targets larger, local accounts such as the big local hardware store or regional hospital group. We pair creative advertising campaigns with our broad suite of products, both digital and print. Because of the success of this program we've added creative resources and accelerated the number of pitches developed providing greater creativity, faster speed to market, and more pitches closed. 

Grow Audience Revenue And Engagement 

Based on independent audience research conducted on our behalf, for the period January to June 2016, we reached 74% &#32;of all adults over the course of a seven-day period in 11 selected markets, which include most of our largest strategic business units. Half of the adults in these markets read our newspapers in print, with 19% &#32;being both newspaper readers and visitors to our newspaper digital platforms. Another 17% &#32;were exclusive digital users. The remaining 12% &#32;primarily used our newspapers to obtain advertising and other information. 

Our audiences strength spans across all age groups. Among the 18-29 age group, 15% &#32;read our printed newspapers, 

while 23% &#32;accessed our publications by web, mobile or tablet. Another 11% &#32;primarily used our newspapers to obtain advertising and other information. 

As media access and delivery vehicles continue to evolve, it is clear that our audiences are evolving and increasingly moving from one delivery platform to another throughout the day and accessing our content in print, on desktops and laptops, and on mobile devices. We seek to grow our audience and engagement on whatever platform they choose by, among other things, continually improving content and presentation to maximize the unique and evolving capabilities of each platform. Our digital audiences are massive. Unique visitors to our digital sites totaled 26.0 million &#32;in September 2016, while page views totaled 218.1 million &#32;in September 2016. 

To serve our readers across all delivery platforms, in 2014, we began to phase in a new subscription model, which is now in place in substantially all of our markets. This model, known as full access, provides subscribers complete access to our print and digital products available in their market for a single subscription rate. 

Transforming Our Business And Managing Our Costs 

We are transforming our business model and reducing our costs to maintain our margins and cash flows. We have regionalized many staff functions; consolidated and/or selectively outsourced printing and ad production; discontinued unprofitable publications; reduced newsprint volume significantly; and continually seek to improve the efficiencies of our operation and reduce costs. We have reduced personnel while protecting our strengths in news, sales and digital products. In 2016, we reduced cash costs (1) &#32;excluding unusual matters 4.8% . We continue our focus on cost efficiencies while investing in revenue drivers. 

Generate Strong Adjusted EBITDA (1) &#32;With A Commitment To Reduce Our Debt 

Throughout the last economic downturn and subsequent recovery, and during a time of unprecedented transition for our industry, we have posted strong adjusted EBITDA. We require modest capital expenditures and pension contributions, and we continue to make significant debt reductions each year. Since 2009, we have dedicated substantially all of our free cash flow to debt repayment, and we intend to continue to use all our available cash to continue to reduce debt. 

The principal amount of debt was reduced by $108.7 million &#32;in 2016 and totaled $617.2 million &#32;as of September 25, 2016 . Since 2005, we have reduced debt by over $1 billion and we expect to continue to significantly reduce our debt in 2017. As a result of our debt reductions, interest expense was reduced by $8.2 million &#32;in 2016 compared to 2015, providing additional free cash flow for debt service. 

In 2016, we received $30,646,000 due to an insurance settlement. The settlement represents our share of a subrogation recovery arising from the settlement of claims for damages suffered as a result of a 2009 loss at one of our production facilities. The proceeds were used to make voluntary payments on our 1st Lien Term Loan and repurchase Notes (each as defined below) at a substantial discount. 

(1) See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures: in Item 7, included herein, for additional information. 

PULITZER 

&#160; 

In 2005, we acquired Pulitzer Inc. (&#8220;Pulitzer&#8221;). We currently publish 9 daily newspapers that were acquired from Pulitzer and more than 60 weekly newspapers and specialty publications. Pulitzer also owned a 50% interest in TNI, as discussed more fully below. The acquisition was financed primarily with debt and our second lien term loan lenders have a first lien of the Pulitzer assets. 

Pulitzer newspaper operations include Bloomington, IL and St. Louis, Missouri, where its subsidiary, St. Louis Post-Dispatch LLC (&#8220;PD LLC&#8221;), publishes the &#32;St. Louis Post-Dispatch, &#32;the only major daily newspaper serving the greater St. Louis metropolitan area, a variety of specialty publications, and supports its related digital products. St. Louis newspaper operations also include the Suburban Journals of Greater St. Louis, a group of weekly newspapers and niche publications that focus on separate communities within the metropolitan area. 

&#160; 

On August 28, 2016 we sold substantially all of the assets of our Provo, Utah newspaper operations, a former Pulitzer newspaper. 

TNI Partners 

&#160; 

As a result of the acquisition of Pulitzer, we own a 50% interest in TNI, the Tucson, Arizona newspaper partnership. TNI, acting as agent for our subsidiary, Star Publishing Company (&#8220;Star Publishing&#8221;) and Citizen Publishing Company (&#8220;Citizen&#8221;), the owner of the remaining 50%, a subsidiary of Gannett Co., Inc., (&#8220;Gannett&#8221;). TNI is responsible for printing, delivery, advertising and subscription activities of the Arizona Daily Star and, until May &#32; 2009, the &#32; Tucson Citizen, &#32; as well as their related &#32; digital &#32; products and specialty publications. In May 2009, Citizen d iscontinued print publication of the Tucson Citizen and in 2014 stopped publishing its digital product. 

TNI collects all receipts and income and pays substantially all operating expenses incident to the partnership's operations and publication of the newspaper and other media. Under the amended and restated operating agreement between Star Publishing and Citizen, the Arizona Daily Star remains the separate property of Star Publishing. Results of TNI are accounted for using the equity method. Income or loss of TNI (before income taxes) is allocated equally to Star Publishing and Citizen. TNI makes weekly distributions to Star Publishing and Citizen of all available cash. 

&#160; 

The TNI agency agreement (&#8220;Agency Agreement&#8221;), has governed the operation since 1940 . Both the Company and Citizen incur certain administrative costs and capital expenditures that are reported by their individual companies. The Agency Agreement expires in 2040, but contains an option, which may be exercised by either party, to renew the agreement for successive periods of 25 years each. Star Publishing and Citizen also have a reciprocal right of first refusal to acquire the 50% interest in TNI owned by Citizen and Star Publishing, respectively, under certain circumstances. 

&#160; 

MADISON NEWSPAPERS 

&#160; 

We own 50% of the capital stock of MNI and 8.7% of the common stock of The Capital Times Company (&#8220;TCT&#8221;). TCT owns the remaining 50% of the capital stock of MNI. MNI publishes daily and Sunday newspapers, and other publications in Madison, Wisconsin, and other Wisconsin locations, and supports their related digital products. MNI conducts business under the trade name Capital Newspapers. We have a contract to furnish the editorial and news content for the Wisconsin State Journal, which is published by MNI, and periodically provide other services to MNI. Results of MNI are accounted for using the equity method. Net income or loss of MNI (after income taxes) is allocated equally to the Company and TCT. MNI makes quarter dividend payments to the Company and TCT. 

&#160; 

ADVERTISING AND MARKETING SERVICES 

&#160; 

Approximately 61% &#32;of our &#32; 2016 reve nue was derived from advertising and marketing services. 

&#160; 

The following broadly define major categories of advertising and marketing services revenue: 

&#160; 

Retail advertising is print or digital revenue earned from sales of display advertising space in the publication, or for preprinted advertising inserted in the publication, to local accounts or regional and national businesses with local retail operations. 

Classified advertising, which includes employment, automotive, real estate for sale or rent, legal, obituaries and other categories, is revenue earned from sales of advertising space in these categories or from publications consisting primarily of such advertising. Classified publications offer advertisers a cost-effective local advertising vehicle and are particularly effective in larger markets with higher media fragmentation. 

&#160; 

National advertising is revenue earned from print or digital display advertising space, or for preprinted advertising inserted in the publication for national accounts that do not have a local retailer representing the account in the market. 

&#160; 

Digital &#32;advertising consists of display, banner, behavioral targeting, search, rich media, directories, classified or other advertising on websites or mobile devices associated and integrated with our print publications, other digital applications, or on third party websites accessed through the extended audience network. Digital advertising is reported in combination with print advertising in the retail, classified and national categories. 

Niche publications &#32;are specialty publications, such as lifestyle, business, health or home improvement publications that contain significant amounts of advertising. 

Marketing services &#32;includes a robust suite of custom digital marketing services that include: SEO, SEM, web and mobile production, social media services and reputation monitoring and management. Our services also include media buying in audience extension networks (outside of those owned and operated by us) such as Centro DSP, Google Ad Exchange and Facebook. 

&#160; 

The advertising environment is influenced by the state of the overall economy, including retail sales, unemployment rates, inflation, energy prices and consumer interest rates. Our enterprises are primarily located in midsize and small markets. Historically these markets have been more stable than major metropolitan markets because our focus is on local, rather than national, advertising. More than eighty percent of our advertising revenue is derived from local and regional businesses. We believe that local advertising tends to be less sensitive to economic cycles than national advertising because local businesses generally have fewer effective advertising channels through which they may reach their customers. 

Several of our businesses operate in geographic groups of publications, or &#8220;clusters,&#8221; which provide operational efficiencies, extend sales penetration and provide broader audiences for advertisers. Operational efficiencies are obtained through consolidation of sales forces, back office operations such as finance, human resources, management and/or production of the publications. A table under the caption &#8220;Daily Newspapers and Markets&#8221; in Item 1, included herein, identifies those groups of our newspapers operating in clusters. 

&#160; 

Our newspapers, classified and specialty publications, and digital products compete with newspapers having national or regional circulation, magazines, radio, network, cable and satellite television, other advertising media such as outdoor, mobile, and movie theater promotions, other classified and specialty publications, direct mail, directories, as well as national, regional and local advertising websites and content providers. Competition for advertising is based on audience size and composition, subscription levels, readership demographics, distribution and display mechanisms, price and advertiser results. In addition, several of our daily and Sunday newspapers compete with other local daily or weekly newspapers. We believe we capture a substantial share of the total advertising dollars spent in each of our markets. 

The number of competitors in any given market varies. However, all of the forms of competition noted above exist to some degree in our markets, including those listed in the table under the caption &#8220;Daily Newspapers and Markets&#8221; in Item 1, included herein. 

&#160; 

SUBSCRIPTION 

Approximately 32% &#32;of our 2016 revenue was derived from subscriptions to our printed and digital products. 

Subscription revenue is derived from the delivery of our leading local news, information and advertising content in print and digitally, via desktop and mobile devices. In 2014, we began the rollout of our full access subscription model, which is now in place in substantially all of our markets. This model provides subscribers access to both the print and digital editions of our newspapers for one price. Digital only options are also available to subscribers. 

AUDIENCES 

&#160; 

Based on independent research, we estimate that, in an average week, our newspapers and digital products reach approximately 74% &#32;of adults in our larger markets. We also measure use of our daily newspapers for advertising, sports scores and entertainment listings ("print users"). 

&#160;

After advertising, subscriptions and single copy sales are our largest source of revenue. For the 13 weeks end ed September 2016, our &#32;daily circulation units, which include TNI and MNI, as measured by the Alliance for Audited Media ("AAM") were 0.8 million &#32;and Sunday circulation units were 1.2 million . 

&#160; 

Growth in audiences can, over time, also positively impact advertising revenue. Our strategies to grow audiences include continuous improvement of content and promotional efforts to expand our audience. Content can include focus on local news, features, scope of coverage, accuracy, presentation, writing style, tone and type style. Promotional efforts include advertising, contests and other initiatives to increase awareness of our products. Customer service can also influence subscriptions. The introduction in 2010, and continued improvement since, of mobile and tablet applications has positively impacted our digital audiences. 

&#160; 

We have historically experienced higher retention of customers using credit cards or bank account withdrawals, ("easy pay"). Accordingly we focus on our enterprises on increasing the number of easy pay subscribers. Other initiatives vary from location to location and are determined principally by our centralized consumer sales and marketing group in collaboration with local management. Competition for subscriptions is generally based on the content, journalistic quality and price of the publication. 

&#160; 

Audience competition exists in all markets, from unpaid print and digital products, but is most significant in markets with competing local daily newspapers. These markets tend to be near major metropolitan areas, where the size of the population may be sufficient to support more than one daily newspaper. 

Our subscription sales channels continue to evolve through an emphasis on targeted telemarketing, direct mail and email to acquire new subscribers and retain current subscribers.

NEWSPRINT 

&#160; 

The basic raw material of newspapers, and our other print publications, is newsprint. We purchase newsprint from U.S. and Canadian producers. We believe we will continue to receive a supply of newsprint adequate for our needs and consider our relationships with newsprint producers to be good. Newsprint purchase prices can be volatile and fluctuate based upon factors that include foreign currency exchange rates and both foreign and domestic production capacity and consumption. Price fluctuations can have a significant effect on our results of operations. We have not entered into derivative contracts for newsprint. For the quantitative impacts of these fluctuations, see Item 7A, &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk&#8221;, included herein.
