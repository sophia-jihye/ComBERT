 Item 1. Business 

&#160;

Superior Uniform Group, Inc. was organized in 1920 and was incorporated in 1922 as a New York company under the name Superior Surgical Mfg. Co., Inc. In 1998, the Company changed its name to Superior Uniform Group, Inc. (&#8220;Superior&#8221;) and its state of incorporation to Florida. &#160; &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

On July 1, 2013, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of HPI Direct, Inc. (&#8220;HPI&#8221;), a company specializing in the design, manufacture and distribution of uniforms to major domestic retailers, foodservice chains, transportation and other service industries throughout the United States. The purchase price for the asset acquisition consisted of approximately $32.5 million in cash, subject to adjustment and inclusive of the real estate purchase described below, the issuance of approximately 418,000 restricted shares of Superior&#8217;s common stock, the potential future payment of up to $7.2 million in additional contingent consideration through 2017, and the assumption of certain liabilities of HPI. The transaction also included the acquisition of the corporate offices and warehouse distribution facility from an entity related to HPI. 

&#160; 

Superior is comprised of two reportable business segments: (1) Uniforms and Related Products, and (2) Remote Staffing Solutions. Superior&#8217;s Uniforms and Related Products segment, through its signature marketing brands&#8212;Fashion Seal Healthcare &#174; , HPI Direct &#174; , Superior I.D.&#8482;, Worklon &#174; , UniVogue &#174; and BlueFusion &#174; ,&#8212; manufactures and sells a wide range of uniforms, corporate identity apparel, career apparel and accessories for the hospital and healthcare fields; hotels; fast food and other restaurants; transportation, and the private security, industrial and commercial markets. In excess of 95% of Superior&#8217;s Uniforms and Related Products segment&#8217;s net sales are from the sale of uniforms and service apparel and directly-related products. 

&#160; 

Superior services its Remote Staffing Solutions segment through multiple The Office Gurus entities, including its direct and indirect subsidiaries in El Salvador, Belize, and the United States, (collectively, &#8220;TOG&#8221;). TOG is a near-shore premium provider of cost effective multilingual telemarketing and total office support solutions. 

&#160;

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; directly related to uniforms and service apparel specified above (e.g. boots and sheets); and &#160; &#9679; 

for use by linen suppliers and industrial launderers, to whom a substantial portion of Superior&#39;s uniforms and service apparel are sold; such products being primarily industrial laundry bags. 

&#160; 

Uniforms and service apparel and related products account for in excess of 95% of net sales; no other single class of product listed above accounts for more than 10% of net sales. 

&#160; 

Services 

&#160; 

Through the recruitment and employment of highly qualified English-speaking agents, we provide our customers with extended office support from a versatile call and contact center environment in our Remote Staffing Solutions segment. 

&#160;

Competition 

&#160; 

Superior competes in its Uniforms and Related Products segment with more than three dozen firms, including divisions of larger corporations. Superior competes with national and regional manufacturers , such as Cintas Corporation, Unifirst Corporation , G&#38;K Services and ARAMARK&#8212;a division of privately held ARAMARK Corporation. Superior also competes with local firms in most major metropolitan areas. The nature and degree of competition varies with the customer and the market. Industry statistics are not available, but we believe Superior is one of the leading suppliers of garments to hospitals, industrial clean rooms, hotels, motels, and food service establishments, and uniforms to linen suppliers. Superior experiences competition primarily in the areas of product development, styling and pricing. We believe that the strength of our brands and marketing, coupled with the quality of our products, allow us to compete effectively. &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

The market in which TOG operates has evolved into a global multi-billion dollar marketplace that is highly competitive and fragmented. TOG&#8217;s competitors in the Remote Staffing Solutions segment range in size from very small firms offering specialized services or short-term project completion to very large independent firms, and include the in-house operations of many customers and potential customers. We compete directly and indirectly with various companies that provide contact center and other business process outsourcing solutions on an outsourced basis. These companies include, but are certainly not limited to, global providers such as APAC Customer Services, Convergys, Sitel, Atento, Sykes, Harte Hanks, and Teleperformance. TOG also competes with local entities in other offshore geographies. The list of potential competitors includes both publicly traded and privately held companies. 

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160; 

Superior has a substantial number of customers, the largest of which accounted for approximately 6.0% of its 2015 net sales. 

&#160; 

Backlog 

&#160; 

Although Superior at all times has a substantial backlog of orders, we do not consider this significant since our backlog of orders at any time consists primarily of recurring firm orders being processed and filled. 

&#160; 

Superior normally completes shipments of orders from stock within one week after the receipt of the order. As of February 22, 2016, the backlog of all orders that we believe to be firm was approximately $9,300,000, compared to approximately $7,200,000 as of February 23, 2015. 

&#160; 

Raw Materials and Inventory 

&#160; 

The principal fabrics used in our business are made from cotton, polyester, wool, silk, synthetic and cotton-synthetic blends. The majority of our fabrics are sourced in the Far East. The raw materials used in the fabrics we source from our suppliers are primarily cotton, polyester yarn, dyestuffs and chemical components of synthetic fabrics. 

&#160; 

Superior markets itself to its customers as a "stock house." Therefore, Superior at all times carries substantial inventories of raw materials (principally piece goods) and finished garments, which requires substantial working capital. Superior&#39;s principal raw materials are textile products. In 2015 and 2014, approximately 22% and 22%, respectively, of our products were obtained from suppliers located in Central America. Superior does not believe that it is dependent upon any of its suppliers, despite the concentration of its purchasing from a few sources, as other suppliers of the same or similar products are readily available. However, if Superior is unable to continue to obtain its products from Central America, it could significantly disrupt Superior&#8217;s business. Because the Company manufactures and sources products in Central America, the Company is affected by economic conditions in those countries, including increased duties, possible employee turnover, labor and other unrest and lack of developed infrastructure. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

Superior owns and uses several trademarks and service marks relating to its brands that have significant value and are instrumental to its ability to market its products. Superior&#8217;s most significant trademark is its mark "Fashion Seal Healthcare " (presently registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office until August 6, 2017). The Fashion Seal Healthcare trademark is critically important to the marketing and operation of Superior&#8217;s business, as more than 25% of Superior&#39;s products are sold under that name. 

&#160; 

Environmental Matters 

&#160; 

In view of the nature of our business, compliance with federal, state, and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, has had no material effect upon our operations or earnings, and we do not expect it to have a material impact in the future. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

Superior employed 1,278 persons, of which 1,268 were full-time employees, as of December 31, 2015.
