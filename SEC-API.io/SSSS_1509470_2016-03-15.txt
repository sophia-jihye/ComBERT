 Item 1. Business GSV Capital GSV Capital Corp. (the &#147;Company,&#148; &#147;we,&#148; &#147;our&#148; or &#147;GSV Capital&#148;) is an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end management investment company that has elected to be treated as a business development company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the &#147;1940 Act&#148;). Our investment objective is to maximize our portfolio&#146;s total return, principally by seeking capital gains on our equity and equity-related investments. We invest principally in the equity securities of what we believe to be rapidly growing venture-capital-backed emerging companies. We acquire our investments through direct investments with prospective portfolio companies, secondary marketplaces for private companies and negotiations with selling stockholders. We may also invest on an opportunistic basis in select publicly traded equity securities or certain non-U.S. companies that otherwise meet our investment criteria. Our investment activities are managed by our investment adviser, GSV Asset Management, LLC (&#147;GSV Asset Management&#148;), and our administrator, GSV Capital Service Company, LLC (&#147;GSV Capital Service Company&#148;), provides the administrative services necessary for us to operate. 

Our investment philosophy is based on a disciplined approach of identifying potentially high-growth emerging companies across several key industry themes which may include, among others, social mobile, cloud computing and big data, internet commerce, sustainability and education technology. GSV Asset Management&#146;s investment decisions are based on a disciplined analysis of available information regarding each potential portfolio company&#146;s business operations, focusing on the company&#146;s growth potential, the quality of recurring revenues and cash flow and cost structures, as well as an understanding of key market fundamentals. Venture capital funds or other financial or strategic sponsors have invested in the vast majority of the companies that GSV Asset Management evaluates. 

We seek to deploy capital primarily in the form of non-controlling equity and equity-related investments, including common stock, warrants, preferred stock and similar forms of senior equity, which may or may not be convertible into a portfolio company&#146;s common equity, and convertible debt securities with a significant equity component. Typically, our preferred stock investments are non-income producing, have different voting rights and are generally convertible into common stock at our discretion. 

We seek to create a low-turnover portfolio that includes investments in companies representing a broad range of investment themes. 

Our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol &#147;GSVC&#148;. The net asset value per share of our common stock on December 31, 2015 was $12.08. On March 14, 2016, the last reported sale price of a share of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market was $6.04. 

About GSV Asset Management Our investment activities are managed by GSV Asset Management, an investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the &#147;Advisers Act&#148;). GSV Asset Management is led by Michael T. Moe, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors. Mr. Moe is assisted by William Tanona, our Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Corporate Secretary, and Mark Flynn, our President, to all of whom, along with Luben Pampoulov and Matthew Hanson, partners of GSV Asset Management, we refer collectively as GSV Asset Management&#146;s senior investment professionals. Mr. Moe co-founded and previously served as Chairman and Chief Executive officer of ThinkEquity Partners, an asset management and investment banking firm focusing on venture capital, entrepreneurial and emerging private companies. Prior to founding ThinkEquity, Mr. Moe served as Head of Global Growth Research at Merrill Lynch and before that served as Head of Growth Research and Strategy at Montgomery Securities. 

We believe we benefit from the ability of GSV Asset Management&#146;s senior investment professionals to identify attractive investment opportunities, conduct diligence on and value prospective investments, negotiate terms, and manage and monitor a portfolio of those investments. GSV Asset Management&#146;s senior investment professionals have broad investment backgrounds, with prior experience at investment banks, commercial banks, unregistered investment funds and other financial services companies, and have collectively developed a broad network of contacts that provides us with an important source of investment opportunities. 

&#160;

&#160;

We pay GSV Asset Management a fee for its services under the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement (the &#147;Investment Advisory Agreement&#148;) consisting of two components &#151; a base management fee and an incentive fee. See &#147;&#151; Investment Advisory Agreement.&#148; 

Investment Opportunity We believe that society is experiencing a convergence of numerous disruptive trends, producing new high-growth markets. For example, the growth of both social networking and connected mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, has opened up new channels for communication and real-time collaboration. The number of devices and people that regularly connect to the Internet has increased dramatically in recent years, generating significant demand for always accessible, personalized and localized content and real-time online interactivity. Similarly, the advent of education technology, and insights with respect to how, and what, people learn, are also disrupting the traditional educational sector. These factors are creating opportunities for new market participants and significant growth for established companies with leading positions capitalizing on these trends. 

At the same time, we believe that the initial public offering (&#147;IPO&#148;) markets have experienced substantial structural changes which have made it significantly more challenging for private companies to go public. Volatile equity markets, a lack of investment research coverage for private and smaller companies and investor demand for a longer history of revenue and earnings growth have resulted in companies staying private significantly longer than in the past. In addition, increased public company compliance obligations such as those imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the &#147;Sarbanes-Oxley Act&#148;) and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#147;Dodd-Frank Act&#148;) have made it costlier and less attractive to become a public company. As a result, there are significantly fewer IPOs today than there were during the 1990s, with prospective public companies taking longer to come to market. 

Investment Strategy We seek to maintain our portfolio of potentially high-growth emerging private companies via a repeatable and disciplined investment approach, as well as to provide investors with access to such companies through our publicly traded common stock. 

Our investment objective is to maximize our portfolio&#146;s total return, principally by seeking capital gains on our equity and equity-related investments. We have adopted the following business strategies to achieve our investment objective:

&#149; Identify high quality growth companies. Based on our extensive experience in analyzing technology trends and markets, we have identified the technology sub-sectors of social mobile, cloud computing and big data, internet commerce, sustainability and education technology, as opportunities where we believe companies are capable of producing substantial growth. We rely on our collective industry knowledge as well as an understanding of where leading venture capitalists are investing. We leverage a combination of our relationships throughout Silicon Valley and our independent research to identify leaders in our targeted sub-sectors that we believe are differentiated and best positioned for sustained growth. Our evaluation process is based on what we refer to as &#147;the four Ps&#148;:

&#149; People &#151; Organizations led by strong management teams with in-depth operational focus &#149; Product &#151; Differentiated and disruptive products with leading market positioning &#149; Potential &#151; Large addressable markets &#149; Predictability &#151; Ability to forecast and drive predictable and sustainable growth 

&#160;

&#160;

We consider these to be the core elements for identifying rapidly growing emerging companies.

&#149; Acquire positions in targeted investments. We seek to add to our portfolio by sourcing investments at an acceptable price through our disciplined investing strategy. To this end, we utilize multiple methods to acquire equity stakes in private companies that are not available to many individual investors. Direct equity investments. We also seek direct investments in private companies. There is a large market among emerging private companies for equity capital investments. Many of these companies, particularly within the technology sector, lack the necessary cash flows to sustain substantial amounts of debt, and therefore have viewed equity capital as a more attractive long-term financing tool. We seek to be a source of such equity capital as a means of investing in these companies and look for opportunities to invest alongside other venture capital and private equity investors with whom we have established relationships. 

Private secondary marketplaces and direct share purchases. We also utilize private secondary marketplaces as a means to acquire equity and equity-related interests in privately held companies that meet our investment criteria and that we believe are attractive candidates for investment. We believe that such markets offer new channels for access to equity investments in private companies and provide a potential source of liquidity should we decide to exit an investment. In addition, we also purchase shares directly from stockholders, including current or former employees. As certain companies grow and experience significant increased value while remaining private, employees and other stockholders may seek liquidity by selling shares directly to a third party or to a third party via a secondary marketplace. Sales of shares in private companies are typically restricted by contractual transfer restrictions and may be further restricted by provisions in company charter documents, investor rights of first refusal and co-sale and company employment and trading policies, which may impose strict limits on transfer. We believe that the reputation of GSV Asset Management&#146;s investment professionals within the industry and history of investing affords us a favorable position when seeking approval for a purchase of shares subject to such limitations.

&#149; Create access to a diverse investment portfolio. We seek to hold a varied portfolio of non-controlling equity investments, which we believe will minimize the impact on our portfolio of a negative downturn at any one specific company. We believe that our relatively diversified portfolio will provide a convenient means for accredited and non-accredited individual investors to obtain access to an asset class that has generally been limited to venture capital, private equity and similar large institutional investors. Competitive Advantages We believe that we benefit from the following competitive advantages in executing our investment strategy:

&#149; Experienced team of investment professionals. GSV Asset Management&#146;s senior investment professionals and our board of directors have significant experience researching and investing in the types of potentially rapidly growing venture-capital-backed emerging companies we are targeting for investment. Through our proprietary company-evaluation process, including our identification of technology trends and themes and company research, we believe we have developed important insight into identifying and valuing emerging private companies. &#149; Disciplined and repeatable investment process. We have established a disciplined and repeatable process to locate and acquire available shares at attractive valuations by utilizing multiple sources. In contrast to industry &#147;aggregators&#148; that accumulate stock at market prices, we conduct valuation analyses and make acquisitions only when we can invest at valuations that we believe are attractive to our investors. &#149; Deep relationships with significant credibility to source and complete transactions. GSV Asset Management and its senior investment professionals are strategically located in the heart of Silicon Valley in Woodside, California. During the course of over two decades of researching and investing in emerging private companies, GSV Asset Management&#146;s senior investment professionals have 

&#160;

&#160;

developed strong reputations within the investing community, particularly within technology-related sectors. GSV Asset Management&#146;s senior investment professionals and our board of directors have also developed strong relationships in the financial, investing and technology-related sectors. &#149; Source of permanent investing capital. As a publicly traded corporation, we have access to a source of permanent equity capital which we can use to invest in portfolio companies. This permanent equity capital is a significant differentiator from other potential investors that may be required to return capital to stockholders on a defined schedule. We believe that our ability to invest on a long-term time horizon makes us attractive to companies looking for strong, stable owners of their equity. &#149; Early mover advantage. We believe we are one of the few publicly traded business development companies with a specific focus on investing in potentially rapidly growing venture-capital-backed emerging companies. Moreover, we believe we are the only one to focus on acquiring shares in secondary transactions as a key component of our strategy. Despite our limited track record, the transactions that we have executed to date since our IPO have helped to establish our reputation with the types of secondary sellers and emerging companies that we target for investment. We have leveraged a number of relationships and channels to acquire the equity of private companies. As we continue to grow our portfolio with attractive investments, we believe that our reputation as a committed partner will be further enhanced, allowing us to source and close investments that would otherwise be unavailable. We believe that these factors collectively differentiate us from other potential investors in private company securities and will potentially enable us to complete equity transactions in desirable private companies at attractive valuations. Operating and Regulatory Structure We were formed as a Maryland corporation and an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end management investment company. We completed our IPO in May 2011 and have elected to be treated as a business development company under the 1940 Act. As a business development company, we are required to meet regulatory tests, including the requirement to invest at least 70% of our gross assets in &#147;qualifying assets.&#148; Qualifying assets generally include, among other things, securities of &#147;eligible portfolio companies.&#148; &#147;Eligible portfolio companies&#148; generally include U.S. companies that are not investment companies and that do not have securities listed on a national exchange. If at any time less than 70% of our gross assets are comprised of qualifying assets, including as a result of an increase in the value of any non-qualifying assets or decrease in the value of any qualifying assets, we would generally not be permitted to acquire any additional non-qualifying assets until such time as 70% of our then current gross assets were comprised of qualifying assets. We would not be required, however, to dispose of any non-qualifying assets in such circumstances. See &#147;&#151; Regulation as a Business Development Company.&#148; 

We have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company (&#147;RIC&#148;) under subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;) for the 2014 taxable year, have qualified to be treated as a RIC for the 2015 taxable year, and expect to continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. See &#147;&#151; Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations&#148; and &#147;Note 1 &#151; Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies &#151; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#151; U.S. Federal and State Income Taxes&#148; and &#147;Note 8 &#151; Income Taxes&#148; to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 for more information. 

Our investment activities are managed by GSV Asset Management and supervised by our board of directors. GSV Asset Management is an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, we have agreed to pay GSV Asset Management an annual base management fee based on our gross assets as well as an incentive fee based on our performance. See &#147;&#151; Investment Advisory Agreement.&#148; We have also entered into an administration agreement under which we have agreed to reimburse GSV Capital Service Company for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred (the &#147;Administration Agreement&#148;). 

&#160;

&#160;

Investment Process Concentrated Technology-related Focus During the course of over two decades of researching and investing in non-public companies, we have identified five areas from which we expect to see significant numbers of high-growth companies emerge: new media, communication, alternative energy, education technology, and the consumerization of information technology. These broad markets have the potential to produce disruptive technologies, reach a large addressable market and provide significant commercial opportunities. Within these areas we have identified broad trends that could create significant positive effects on growth such as globalization, consolidation, branding, convergence and network effects. From within these broad technology themes, we have selected five sub-segments in which we target companies for investment: social mobile, cloud computing and big data, internet commerce, sustainability and education technology. We remain focused on selecting market leaders within the sub-segments we have identified, while continuing to review our pipeline to ensure we are tracking the next phase of leaders. 

Investment Targeting and Screening We identify prospective portfolio companies through an extensive network of relationships developed by GSV Asset Management&#146;s senior investment professionals, supplemented by the knowledge and relationships of our board of directors. Investment opportunities that fall within our identified themes are validated against the observed behavior of leading venture capitalists and through our own internal and external research. We evaluate potential portfolio companies across a spectrum of criteria, including &#147;the four Ps&#148;, industry positioning and leadership, stage of growth, and several other factors that collectively characterize our proprietary investment process. We typically seek to invest approximately 90% of our portfolio in well-established, late stage companies and the remaining approximately 10% in emerging companies that fit within our targeted areas, where we see the potential for higher returns from early investment. Based on our initial screening, we identify a select set of companies which we evaluate in greater depth. 

Research and Due Diligence Process Once we identify those companies that we believe warrant more in-depth analysis, we focus on their revenue growth, revenue quality and sustainability and earnings growth, as well as other metrics that may be strongly correlated with higher valuations. We also focus on the company&#146;s management team and any significant financial sponsor, the current business model, competitive positioning, regulatory and legal issues, the quality of any intellectual property and other investment-specific due diligence. Each prospective portfolio company that passes our initial due diligence review is given a qualitative ranking to allow us to evaluate it against others in our pipeline, and we review and update these companies on a regular basis. 

Our due diligence process will vary depending on whether we are investing through a private secondary transaction on a marketplace or with a selling stockholder or by direct equity investment. We access information on our potential investments through a variety of sources, including information made available on secondary marketplaces, publications by private company research firms, industry publications, commissioned analysis by third-party research firms, and, to a limited extent, directly from the company or financial sponsor. We utilize a combination of each of these sources to help us set a target value for the companies we ultimately select for investment. 

Portfolio Construction and Sourcing Upon completion of our research and due diligence process, we select investments for inclusion in our portfolio based on their relative qualitative ranking, fundamentals and valuation. We seek to create a relatively varied portfolio that we expect will include investments in companies representing a broad range of investment themes. We generally choose to pursue specific investments based on the availability of shares and valuation expectations. We utilize a combination of secondary marketplaces, direct purchases from stockholders and direct equity investments in order to make investments in our portfolio companies. Once we have established an initial position in a portfolio company, we may choose to increase our stake through subsequent purchases. Maintaining a balanced portfolio is a key to our success, and as a result we constantly evaluate the composition of our investments and our pipeline to ensure we are exposed to a diverse set of companies within our target segments. 

&#160;

&#160;

Transaction Execution We enter into purchase agreements for each of our private company portfolio investments. Private company securities are typically subject to contractual transfer limitations, which may, among other things, give the issuer, its assignees and/or its stockholders a particular period of time, often 30 days or more, in which to exercise a veto right, or a right of first refusal over, the sale of such securities. Accordingly, the purchase agreements we enter into for secondary transactions typically require the lapse or satisfaction of these rights as a condition to closing. Under these circumstances, we are may be required to deposit the purchase price into escrow upon signing with the funds released to the seller at closing or returned to us if the closing conditions are not met. 

Risk Management and Monitoring We monitor the financial trends of each portfolio company to assess our exposure to individual companies as well as to evaluate overall portfolio quality. We establish valuation targets at the portfolio level and for gross and net exposures with respect to specific companies and industries within our overall portfolio. In cases where we make a direct investment in a portfolio company, we may also obtain board positions, board observation rights and/or information rights from that portfolio company in connection with our equity investment. We regularly monitor our portfolio for compliance with the diversification requirements for purposes of maintaining our status as a 1940 Act business development company and a RIC for tax purposes. 

Portfolio Overview The following table shows the fair value of our portfolio of investments by asset class as of December 31, 2015, and 2014, excluding United States Treasury Bills.

Managerial Assistance As a business development company, we are required to offer, and in some cases may provide and be paid for, significant managerial assistance to portfolio companies. This assistance typically involves monitoring the operations of portfolio companies, participating in their board and management meetings, consulting with and advising their officers and providing other organizational and financial guidance. GSV Asset Management will provide such managerial assistance on our behalf to portfolio companies that request assistance. We may receive fees for these services and will reimburse GSV Asset Management for its allocated costs in providing such assistance, subject to review by our board of directors, including our independent directors. 

Competition Our primary competitors include specialty finance companies including late stage venture capital funds, private equity funds, other crossover funds, public funds investing in private companies and business development companies. Many of these entities have greater financial and managerial resources than we will have. For additional information concerning the competitive risks we face, see &#147;Risk Factors &#151; Risks Related to Our Business and Structure.&#148; 

&#160;

&#160;

Employees While we have executive officers, they receive no direct compensation from us, and we have no direct employees. Our day-to-day investment operations are managed by GSV Asset Management. In addition, we reimburse GSV Capital Service Company for an allocable portion of expenses incurred by it in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including a portion of the rent and the compensation of our President, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Compliance Officer and other staff providing administration services. Carl Rizzo, our Chief Compliance Officer, is a director of Alaric Compliance Services LLC and performs his functions as our Chief Compliance Officer under the terms of an agreement between GSV Capital Service Company and Alaric Compliance Services LLC. GSV Capital Service Company has retained Mr. Rizzo and Alaric Compliance Services LLC pursuant to its obligations under the Administration Agreement. See &#147;&#151; Administration Agreement.&#148; 

Determination of Net Asset Value We determine the net asset value of our investment portfolio after the conclusion of each fiscal quarter in connection with the preparation of our annual and quarterly reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;), or more frequently if required under the 1940 Act. 

Securities that are publicly traded are generally valued at the close price on the valuation date; however, if they remain subject to lock-up restrictions they are discounted accordingly. Securities that are not publicly traded or for which there are no readily available market quotations, including securities that trade on secondary markets for private securities, are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors. In connection with that determination, members of GSV Asset Management&#146;s portfolio management team will prepare portfolio company valuations using, when available, the most recent portfolio company financial statements and forecasts. We also engage an independent valuation firm to perform independent valuations of our investments that are not publicly traded or for which there are no readily available market quotations. We may also engage an independent valuation firm to perform independent valuations of any securities that trade on private secondary markets, but are not otherwise publicly traded, where there is a lack of appreciable trading or a wide disparity in recently reported trades. 

For those securities that are not publicly traded or for which there are no readily available market quotations, our board of directors, with the assistance of its valuation committee (the &#147;Valuation Committee&#148;), will use the recommended valuations as prepared by management and the independent valuation firm, respectively, as a component of the foundation for its final fair value determination. Due to the uncertainty inherent in the valuation process, such estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the values that would have resulted had others made the determination using the same or different procedures or had a readily available market for the securities existed, and the differences could be material. Additionally, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the gains or losses implied by the valuation currently assigned to such investments. For those investments that are publicly traded, we generally record unrealized appreciation or depreciation based on changes in the market value of the securities as of the valuation date. Publicly traded securities that remain subject to lock-up restrictions are discounted accordingly. For those investments that are not publicly traded and for which there are no readily available market quotations, we record unrealized depreciation on such investments when we believe that an investment has become impaired and will record unrealized appreciation if we believe that the underlying portfolio company has appreciated in value and our equity security has also appreciated in value. Changes in fair value are recorded in the statement of operations as the net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation. 

We generally determine the fair value of our investments by considering a number of factors. The following represent factors that, among others, could impact our fair value determinations: 

1. Public trading of our portfolio securities, taking into consideration lock-up requirements and liquidity; 2. Active trading of our portfolio securities on a private secondary market, where we have determined that there is meaningful volume and the transactions are considered arm&#146;s length by sophisticated investors; 

&#160;

&#160;

3. Qualified funding rounds in the companies in which we are invested, where there is meaningful and reputable information available on size, valuation and investors; and 4. Additional investments by us in current portfolio companies, where the price of the new investment differs materially from prior investments. 5. Market transactions in our portfolio companies that we can observe and from which we can obtain information. There is inherent subjectivity in determining the fair value of our investments. In addition, we will accrue as a liability, each time we calculate net asset value, the amount which we may owe GSV Asset Management for the income incentive fee and capital gains incentive fee, the latter of which is based on the amount of unrealized and realized capital appreciation. We expect that most of our portfolio investments, other than those for which market quotations are readily available and that may be sold without restriction, will be valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors, with the assistance of our Valuation Committee. Furthermore, when calculating net asset value, we also consider our recognition of a deferred tax liability for unrealized gains on investments for those investments held in our taxable subsidiaries. Refer to &#147;Note 1 &#151; Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies&#148; to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 for a list of our taxable subsidiaries. 

Investment Advisory Agreement Management Services GSV Asset Management serves as our investment adviser. GSV Asset Management is registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. Subject to the overall supervision of our board of directors, GSV Asset Management manages our day-to-day operations and provides us with investment advisory services. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, GSV Asset Management:

&#149; determines the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes; &#149; determines what securities we will purchase, retain or sell; &#149; performs due diligence on prospective portfolio companies; &#149; identifies, evaluates and negotiates the structure of the investments we make; &#149; closes, monitors and services the investments we make; and &#149; provides us with such other investment advisory, research and related services as we, from time to time, reasonably require for the investment of our funds. GSV Asset Management&#146;s services under the Investment Advisory Agreement are not exclusive, and it is free to furnish similar services to other entities so long as its services to us are not impaired. GSV Asset Management also manages for GSV X Fund (&#147;GSV X Fund&#148;), a global long/short absolute return fund, Coursera@GSV Fund, LP and Coursera@GSV-EDBI Fund, LP (collectively, the &#147;Coursera Funds&#148;), special purpose vehicles each comprised of an underlying investment in Coursera stock, and serves as sub-adviser for GSV Ventures I LLC, GSV Ventures II LLC, and GSV Ventures III LLC (collectively, the &#147;GSV Ventures Funds&#148;), each a venture capital and growth equity fund. We have no equity ownership in any of the GSV X Fund, the Coursera Funds or the GSV Ventures Funds. GSV Asset Management does not anticipate that it will ordinarily identify investment opportunities that are appropriate for both us and the other funds that are currently or in the future may be managed by GSV Asset Management. However, to the extent it does identify such opportunities, GSV Asset Management will allocate such opportunities between us and such other funds pursuant to an established procedure that is designed to ensure that such allocation is fair and equitable. 

&#160;

&#160;

Management Fees We pay GSV Asset Management a fee for its services under the Investment Advisory Agreement consisting of two components &#151; a base management fee and an incentive fee. The cost of both the base management fee payable to GSV Asset Management, and any incentive fees earned by GSV Asset Management, are ultimately borne by our common stockholders. In aggregate, we paid GSV Asset Management $21,033,774 under the Investment Advisory Agreement during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. 

The base management fee (the &#147;Base Fee&#148;) is calculated at an annual rate of 2.00% of our gross assets, which is our total assets as reflected on our balance sheet (with no deduction for liabilities) reduced by any non-portfolio investments. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, the Base Fee was payable monthly in arrears, and was calculated based on the average value of our gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, and appropriately adjusted for any equity or debt capital raises, repurchases or redemptions during the current calendar quarter. The Base Fee for any partial month or quarter was appropriately pro-rated. 

The incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date), and is equal to the lesser of:

&#149; 20% of our realized capital gains during such calendar year, if any, calculated on an investment-by-investment basis, subject to a non-compounded preferred return, or &#147;hurdle,&#148; and a &#147;catch-up&#148; feature, and &#149; 20% of our realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid incentive fees. Our realized capital gains from each investment, expressed as a non-compounded annual rate of return on the cost of such investment since we initially acquired it, will be compared to a hurdle rate of 8.00% per year. We will only pay an incentive fee on any realized capital gains from an investment that exceeds the hurdle rate. We will pay GSV Asset Management an incentive fee with respect to our realized capital gains from each investment as follows:

&#149; No incentive fee is payable on the amount of any realized capital gains from an investment that, when expressed as a non-compounded annual rate of return on the cost of such investment since we initially acquired it, does not exceed the hurdle rate of 8.00% per year. &#149; We pay as an incentive fee 100% of the amount of any realized capital gains from an investment that, when expressed as a non-compounded annual rate of return on the cost of such investment since we initially acquired it, exceeds the hurdle rate of 8.00% per year but is less than a rate of 10.00% per year. We refer to this portion of our realized capital gains from each investment (which exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 10.00%) as the &#147;catch-up.&#148; The &#147;catch-up&#148; is meant to provide GSV Asset Management with 20% of the amount of our realized capital gains from an investment that, when expressed as a non-compounded annual rate of return on the cost of such investment since we initially acquired it, exceeds a rate of 10.00% per year. &#149; We pay as an incentive fee 20% of the amount of any realized capital gains from an investment that, when expressed as a non-compounded annual rate of return on the cost of such investment since we initially acquired it, exceeds a rate of 10.00% per year. In no event, however, will we pay an incentive fee for any calendar year that exceeds 20% of our realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of such calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid incentive fees. Refer to &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#151; Related-Party Transactions&#148; for detail of incentive fees paid and accrued. 

&#160;

&#160;

The following is a graphical representation of the calculation of our incentive fee with respect to a single investment: 

For accounting purposes, in order to reflect the theoretical capital gains incentive fee that would be payable for a given period as if all unrealized gains were realized, we are required to accrue a capital gains incentive fee based upon realized capital gains and losses during the current calendar year through the end of the period, plus any unrealized capital appreciation and depreciation as of the end of the period. It should be noted that a fee so calculated and accrued would not necessarily be payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement, and may never be paid based upon the computation of capital gains incentive fees in subsequent periods. Amounts paid under the Investment Advisory Agreement will be consistent with the formula reflected in the Investment Advisory Agreement. 

We seek to deploy capital primarily in the form of non-controlling investments in our portfolio companies. Although we primarily invest through private secondary markets, to the extent we make a direct minority investment in a portfolio company, neither we, nor our investment adviser, GSV Asset Management, may have the ability to control the timing of when we realize capital gains or losses with respect to such investment. We expect the timing of such realization events to be determined by our portfolio companies in such cases. To the extent we have non-minority investments, or the securities we hold are traded on a private secondary market or public securities exchange, GSV Asset Management will have greater control over the timing of a realization event. In such cases, our board of directors will monitor such investments in connection with their general oversight of the investment management services provided by GSV Asset Management. In addition, as of the end of each fiscal quarter, we will evaluate whether the cumulative aggregate unrealized appreciation on our portfolio would be sufficient to require us to pay an incentive fee to GSV Asset Management if such unrealized appreciation were actually realized as of the end of such quarter, and if so, we will accrue an expense equal to the amount of such incentive fee. Any such accrual of incentive fees will be reflected in the calculation of our net asset value. 

Payment of our Expenses Our primary operating expenses are the payment of a base management fee and any incentive fees under the Investment Advisory Agreement and the allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by GSV Capital Service Company in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement. Our investment management fee compensates GSV Asset Management for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, executing and servicing our investments. We bear all other expenses of our operations and transactions, including (without limitation) fees and expenses relating to: expenses of offering our debt and equity securities; the investigation and monitoring of our investments, including expenses and travel fees incurred in connection with on-site visits; the cost of calculating our net asset value; the cost of effecting sales and repurchases of shares of our common stock and other securities; management and incentive fees payable pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement; fees payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making investments and valuing investments (including third-party valuation firms); transfer agent, trustee and custodial fees; interest payments and other costs related to our borrowings; fees and expenses associated with our website, public relations and marketing efforts (including attendance at industry and investor conferences and similar events); federal and state registration fees; any exchange listing fees; federal, state and local taxes; independent directors&#146; fees and expenses, including travel expenses, and other costs of board of directors&#146; meetings; brokerage commissions; costs of preparing and mailing proxy statements, stockholders&#146; reports and 

&#160;

&#160;

notices; costs of preparing government filings, including periodic and current reports with the SEC; out fidelity bond, directors&#146; and officers&#146;/errors and omissions liability insurance and other insurance premiums; and direct costs such as printing, mailing, long distance telephone, staff, independent audits and outside legal costs and all other expenses incurred by either GSV Capital Service Company or us in connection with administering our business, including payments under the Administration Agreement that will be based upon our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by GSV Capital Service Company in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including a portion of the rent and the compensation of our President, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Compliance Officer and other administrative support personnel. All of these expenses are ultimately borne by our common stockholders. 

All personnel of GSV Asset Management, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory services, and the compensation and expenses of such personnel allocable to such services, are provided and paid for by GSV Asset Management. 

Duration and Termination The Investment Advisory Agreement was initially approved by our board of directors on March 28, 2011 and was most recently reapproved on March 2, 2016. Unless earlier terminated as described below, the Investment Advisory Agreement will remain in effect from year to year if approved annually by our board of directors or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, including, in either case, approval by a majority of our directors who are not interested persons of any such party, as such term is defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act. The Investment Advisory Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of its assignment. The Investment Advisory Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon not more than 60 days&#146; written notice to the other. The Investment Advisory Agreement may also be terminated, without penalty, upon the vote of a majority of our outstanding voting securities. 

Indemnification The Investment Advisory Agreement provides that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of its duties and obligations, GSV Asset Management and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with it are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys&#146; fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of GSV Asset Management&#146;s services under the Investment Advisory Agreement or otherwise as our investment adviser. 

Organization of the Investment Adviser GSV Asset Management is a Delaware limited liability company. The principal executive offices of GSV Asset Management are located at 2925 Woodside Road, Woodside, CA 94062. 

Board Approval of the Investment Advisory Agreement Our board of directors determined at a meeting held on March 2, 2016 to reapprove the Investment Advisory Agreement. In its consideration of the reapproval of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the board of directors focused on information it had received relating to, among other things:

&#149; the nature, quality and extent of the advisory and other services to be provided to us by GSV Asset Management over the term of the Investment Advisory Agreement, including our performance relative to other business development companies during the prior year; &#149; comparative data with respect to advisory fees or similar expenses paid by other business development companies with similar investment objectives; &#149; our historical and projected operating expenses and expense ratio compared to business development companies with similar investment objectives, including expenses related to investment due diligence, travel and investigating and monitoring investments; &#149; any existing and potential sources of indirect income to GSV Asset Management or GSV Capital Service Company from their relationships with us and the profitability of those relationships, including the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#149; information about the services to be performed and the personnel performing such services under the Investment Advisory Agreement; &#149; the organizational capability and financial condition of GSV Asset Management and its affiliates; &#149; GSV Asset Management&#146;s practices regarding the selection and compensation of brokers that may execute our portfolio transactions and the brokers&#146; provision of brokerage and research services to GSV Asset Management; and &#149; the possibility of obtaining similar services from other third-party service providers or through an internally managed structure. Based on the information reviewed and related discussions, the board of directors concluded that fees payable to GSV Asset Management pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement were reasonable in relation to the services to be provided. The board of directors did not assign relative weights to the above factors or the other factors considered by it. In addition, the board of directors did not reach any specific conclusion on each factor considered, but conducted an overall analysis of these factors. Individual members of the board of directors may have given different weights to different factors. 

Administration Agreement Pursuant to a separate Administration Agreement, GSV Capital Service Company, a Delaware limited liability company, furnishes us with office facilities, together with equipment and clerical, bookkeeping and record-keeping services at such facilities. The principal executive offices of GSV Capital Service Company are located at 2925 Woodside Road, Woodside, CA 94062. Under the Administration Agreement, GSV Capital Service Company also performs, or oversees the performance of, our required administrative services, which includes being responsible for the financial records which we are required to maintain and preparing reports to our stockholders and reports filed with the SEC. In addition, GSV Capital Service Company assists us in determining and publishing our net asset value, overseeing the preparation and filing of our tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to our stockholders, and generally overseeing the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. Payments under the Administration Agreement are based upon our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by GSV Capital Service Company in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including a portion of the rent and the compensation of our President, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Compliance Officer and other staff providing administrative services. In accordance with the terms of the Administration Agreement, overhead and other administrative expenses are generally allocated between us and GSV Asset Management by reference to the relative time spent by personnel in performing administrative and similar functions on our behalf as compared to performing investment advisory or administrative functions on behalf of GSV Asset Management. To the extent personnel retained by GSV Service Company perform administrative tasks for GSV Asset Management, the fees incurred with respect to the actual time dedicated to such tasks will be reimbursed by GSV Asset Management. While there is no limit on the total amount of expenses we may be required to reimburse to GSV Capital Service Company, our administrator will only charge us for the actual expenses it incurs on our behalf, or our allocable portion thereof, without any profit to GSV Capital Service Company. Pursuant to its obligations under the Administration Agreement, GSV Capital Service Company has retained Carl Rizzo of Alaric Compliance Services LLC to serve as our Chief Compliance Officer. The Administration Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days&#146; written notice to the other party, and upon a vote of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, or by the vote of our board of directors or by GSV Capital Service Company. 

The Administration Agreement provides that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of their respective duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of their respective duties and obligations, GSV Capital Service Company and its officers, manager, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with it are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys&#146; fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of GSV Capital Service Company&#146;s services under the Administration Agreement or otherwise as our administrator. 

&#160;

&#160;

GSV Capital Service Company also provides administrative services to our investment adviser, GSV Asset Management. As a result, GSV Asset Management also reimburses GSV Capital Service Company for its allocable portion of GSV Capital Service Company&#146;s overhead, including rent, the fees and expenses associated with performing compliance functions for GSV Asset Management, and its allocable portion of the compensation of any administrative support staff. 

License Agreement We have entered into a license agreement with GSV Asset Management pursuant to which GSV Asset Management has agreed to grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name &#147;GSV.&#148; Under this agreement, we have a right to use the GSV name for so long as the Investment Advisory Agreement with GSV Asset Management is in effect. Other than with respect to this limited license, we will have no legal right to the &#147;GSV&#148; name. 

Regulation as a Business Development Company General A business development company is regulated by the 1940 Act. A business development company must be organized in the United States for the purpose of investing in or lending to primarily private companies and making significant managerial assistance available to them. A business development company may use capital provided by public stockholders and from other sources to make long-term, private investments in businesses. A business development company provides stockholders the ability to retain the liquidity of a publicly traded stock while sharing in the possible benefits, if any, of investing in primarily privately owned companies. 

We may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or withdraw our election as, a business development company unless authorized by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities, as required by the 1940 Act. A majority of the outstanding voting securities of a company is defined under the 1940 Act as the lesser of: (a) 67% or more of such company&#146;s voting securities present at a meeting if more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company are present or represented by proxy, or (b) more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company. We do not anticipate any substantial change in the nature of our business. 

As with other companies regulated by the 1940 Act, a business development company must adhere to certain substantive regulatory requirements. A majority of our directors must be persons who are not interested persons, as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. Additionally, we are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect the business development company. Furthermore, as a business development company, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person&#146;s office. 

As a business development company, we are generally required to meet an asset coverage ratio, defined under the 1940 Act as the ratio of our gross assets (less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities) to our outstanding senior securities, of at least 200% after each issuance of senior securities. We may also be prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC. 

We are generally not able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. See &#147;Risk Factors &#151; Risks Related to Our Business and Structure &#151; Regulations governing our operation as a business development company affect our ability to, and the way in which we, raise additional capital, which may expose us to risks, including the typical risks associated with leverage.&#148; We may, however, sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then-current net asset value of our common stock if our board of directors determines that such sale is in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders, and our stockholders approve such sale. In addition, we may generally issue new shares of our common stock at a price below net asset value in rights offerings to existing stockholders, in payment of dividends and in certain other limited circumstances. 

&#160;

&#160;

As a business development company, we are generally limited in our ability to invest in any portfolio company in which our investment adviser, GSV Asset Management, or any of its affiliates currently has an investment or to make any co-investments with GSV Asset Management or its affiliates without an exemptive order from the SEC, subject to certain exceptions. 

We are subject to periodic examination by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act. 

As a business development company, we are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. See &#147;Risk Factors &#151; Risks Related to Our Business and Structure.&#148; 

Qualifying Assets Under the 1940 Act, a business development company may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the business development company&#146;s gross assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are the following: 

1. Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer which: a. is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States; b. is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by the business development company) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and c. satisfies any of the following: i. does not have any class of securities that is traded on a national securities exchange; ii. has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange, but has an aggregate market value of outstanding voting and non-voting common equity of less than $250 million; iii. is controlled by a business development company or a group of companies including a business development company and the business development company has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company; iv. is a small and solvent company having gross assets of not more than $4.0 million and capital and surplus of not less than $2.0 million; or v. meets such other criteria as may be established by the SEC. 2. Securities of any eligible portfolio company which we control. 3. Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities, was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements. 4. Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company. 5. Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described in 1 through 4 above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities. 6. Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment. 

&#160;

&#160;

If at any time less than 70% of our gross assets are comprised of qualifying assets, including as a result of an increase in the value of any non-qualifying assets or decrease in the value of any qualifying assets, we would generally not be permitted to acquire any additional non-qualifying assets, other than office furniture and equipment, interests in real estate and leasehold improvements and facilities maintained to conduct the business operations of the business development company, deferred organization and operating expenses, and other noninvestment assets necessary and appropriate to its operations as a business development company, until such time as 70% of our then current gross assets were comprised of qualifying assets. We would not be required, however, to dispose of any non-qualifying assets in such circumstances. 

Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies In addition, a business development company must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described above in Qualifying Assets. Further, business development companies generally must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities significant managerial assistance, except in circumstances where either (i) the business development company controls such issuer of securities or (ii) the business development company purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together and one of the other persons in the group makes available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the business development company, through its directors, officers or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company. 

Temporary Investments Pending investment in other types of &#147;qualifying assets,&#148; as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets. Typically, we will invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, provided that such agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price which is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25% of our gross assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would not meet the diversification tests in order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. GSV Asset Management will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions. 

Warrants and Options Under the 1940 Act, a business development company is subject to restrictions on the amount of warrants, options, restricted stock or rights to purchase shares of capital stock that it may have outstanding at any time. Under the 1940 Act, we may generally only offer warrants provided that (i) the warrants expire by their terms within ten years, (ii) the exercise or conversion price is not less than the current market value at the date of issuance, (iii) our stockholders authorize the proposal to issue such warrants, and our board of directors approves such issuance on the basis that the issuance is in the best interests of us and our stockholders and (iv) if the warrants are accompanied by other securities, the warrants are not separately transferable unless no class of such warrants and the securities accompanying them has been publicly distributed. The 1940 Act also provides that the amount of our voting securities that would result from the exercise of all outstanding warrants, as well as options and rights, at the time of issuance may not exceed 25% of our outstanding voting securities. In particular, the amount of capital stock that would result from the conversion or exercise of all outstanding warrants, options or rights to purchase capital stock cannot exceed 25% of the business development company&#146;s total outstanding shares of capital stock. 

&#160;

&#160;

Senior Securities We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 200% immediately after each such issuance. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our gross assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see &#147;Risk Factors &#151; Risks Related to Our Business and Structure &#151; Borrowings, such as the Convertible Senior Notes or the Credit Facility, can magnify the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and may increase the risk of investing in us.&#148; 

Code of Ethics We and GSV Asset Management have adopted a joint code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act. This code establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to the code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts so long as such investments are made in accordance with the code&#146;s requirements. You may read and copy our code of ethics and our code of business conduct and ethics at the SEC&#146;s Public Reference Room located at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549. You may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. In addition, our code of ethics and code of business conduct and ethics are available on the EDGAR Database on the SEC&#146;s Internet site at http://www.sec.gov and is available on our corporate governance webpage at http://investors.gsvcap.com/governance . 

Compliance Policies and Procedures We and GSV Asset Management have adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to detect and prevent violation of the federal securities laws and are required to review these compliance policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation and designate a chief compliance officer to be responsible for administering the policies and procedures. Carl Rizzo currently serves as our Chief Compliance Officer. 

Compliance with Corporate Governance Regulations The Sarbanes-Oxley Act imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly held companies and their insiders. Many of these requirements affect us. For example:

&#149; pursuant to Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer must certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports; &#149; pursuant to Item 307 of Regulation S-K, our periodic reports must disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures; &#149; pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, our management must prepare an annual report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and must obtain an audit of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting performed by our independent registered public accounting firm; and &#149; pursuant to Item 308 of Regulation S-K and Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, our periodic reports must disclose whether there were significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to review our current policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. We will continue to monitor our compliance with all regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and will take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith. 

&#160;

&#160;

In addition, The Nasdaq Capital Market has adopted various corporate governance requirements as part of its listing standards. We believe we are in compliance with such corporate governance listing standards. We will continue to monitor our compliance with all future listing standards and will take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith. 

Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to GSV Asset Management. The Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures of GSV Asset Management are set forth below. The guidelines will be reviewed periodically by GSV Asset Management and our non-interested directors, and, accordingly, are subject to change. For purposes of these Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures described below, &#147;we,&#148; &#147;our&#148; and &#147;us&#148; refers to GSV Asset Management. 

Introduction An investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act has a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests of its clients. As part of this duty, we recognize that we must vote client securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in the best interests of our clients. 

These policies and procedures for voting proxies for our investment advisory clients are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act. 

Proxy Policies We will vote proxies relating to our portfolio securities in what we perceive to be the best interest of our clients&#146; stockholders. We will review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a stockholder vote to determine its impact on the portfolio securities held by our clients. Although we will generally vote against proposals that may have a negative impact on our clients&#146; portfolio securities, we may vote for such a proposal if there exist compelling long-term reasons to do so. 

Our proxy voting decisions will be made by the senior officers who are responsible for monitoring each of our clients&#146; investments. To ensure that our vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, we will require that: (1) anyone involved in the decision-making process disclose to our Chief Compliance Officer any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (2) employees involved in the decision-making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how we intend to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties. 

Proxy Voting Records You may obtain information about how we voted proxies by making a written request for proxy voting information to: Chief Compliance Officer, GSV Asset Management, 2925 Woodside Road, Woodside, CA 94062. 

Privacy Principles We are committed to maintaining the privacy of our stockholders and to safeguarding their non-public personal information. The following information is provided to help you understand what personal information we collect, how we protect that information and why, in certain cases, we may share information with select other parties. 

Generally, we do not receive any non-public personal information relating to our stockholders, although certain non-public personal information of our stockholders may become available to us. We do not disclose any non-public personal information about our stockholders or former stockholders to anyone, except as permitted by law or as is necessary in order to service stockholder accounts (for example, to a transfer agent or third-party administrator). 

We restrict access to non-public personal information about our stockholders to employees of GSV Asset Management and its affiliates with a legitimate business need for the information. We will maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect the non-public personal information of our stockholders.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations The following discussion is a general summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to our qualification and taxation as a RIC under subchapter M of the Code, and the acquisition, ownership and disposition of our common stock. This summary does not purport to be a complete description of the income tax considerations applicable to such an investment. For example, we have not described all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to certain types of holders subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, including stockholders subject to the alternative minimum tax, tax-exempt organizations, insurance companies, dealers in securities, traders in securities that elect to use a mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities holdings, pension plans and trusts, and financial institutions. This summary is limited to beneficial owners of our common stock that will hold such common stock as capital assets (within the meaning of the Code). The discussion is based upon the Code, Treasury regulations, and administrative and judicial interpretations, each as of the date of this annual report on Form 10-K and all of which are subject to change, possibly retroactively, which could affect the continuing validity of this discussion. This summary does not discuss any aspects of U.S. estate or gift tax or foreign, state or local tax. It does not discuss the special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws that could result if we invested in tax-exempt securities or certain other investment assets. 

Tax matters are complicated and the tax consequences to an investor of an investment in our common stock will depend on the facts of his, her or its particular situation. We encourage investors to consult their own tax advisers regarding the specific consequences of such an investment, including tax reporting requirements, the applicability of federal, state, local and foreign tax laws, eligibility for the benefits of any applicable tax treaty and the effect of any possible changes in the tax laws. 

If a partnership (including an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds the shares of our common stock, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner, the activities of the partnership and certain determinations made at the partner level. Investors treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or investors that are partners in such a partnership), are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisers with respect to the tax consequences relating to the acquisition, ownership and disposition of our common stock. 

A &#147;U.S. stockholder&#148; generally is a beneficial owner of common stock who is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:

&#149; a citizen or individual resident of the United States; &#149; a corporation or other entity treated as a corporation, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any State thereof or the District of Columbia (and an entity organized outside of the United States that is treated as a U.S. corporation under specialized sections of the Code); 

&#160;

&#160;

&#149; a trust, if a court within the United States has primary supervision over its administration and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all of its substantive decisions, or if the trust has a valid election in effect under the applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person); or &#149; an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source. As used herein, the term &#147;Non-U.S. stockholder&#148; means a beneficial owner of common stock that is not a U.S. stockholder or a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A &#147;Non-U.S. stockholder&#148; does not include an individual present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of disposition of the common stock. Such a stockholder is encouraged to consult his or her own tax adviser regarding U.S. federal income tax consequences of the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of the common stock. 

Election to be Taxed as a RIC We have elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code for the 2014 taxable year, have qualified to be treated as a RIC for the 2015 taxable year and expect to continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. So long as we qualify and maintain our status as a RIC, we generally will not pay corporate-level U.S. federal and state income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute at least annually to our stockholders as dividends. Rather, any tax liability related to income earned by us as a RIC will represent obligations of our investors and will not be reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Included in our consolidated financial statements, the following wholly-owned subsidiaries are taxable subsidiaries (collectively, the &#147;GSVC Holdings&#148;), regardless of whether we are a RIC: GSVC AE Holdings, Inc., GSVC AV Holdings, Inc., GSVC NG Holdings, Inc., GSVC SW Holdings, Inc., GSVC WS Holdings, Inc., SPNPM Holdings LLC, and GSVC SVDS Holdings, Inc. These taxable subsidiaries are not consolidated for income tax purposes and may generate income tax expenses as a result of their ownership of the portfolio companies. Such income tax expenses and deferred taxes, if any, will be reflected in our consolidated financial statements. 

For the fiscal year ended 2012, however, we failed to satisfy certain tests required for us to qualify as a RIC under the Code, and were therefore subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax. In September 2014, we filed our 2013 tax return as a RIC and sought to be granted RIC status for our 2013 taxable year; however, we determined we would not be eligible to elect to be treated as a RIC for the 2013 taxable year unless we were certified by the SEC as &#147;principally engaged in the furnishing of capital to other corporations which are principally engaged in the development or exploitation of inventions, technological improvements, new processes, or products not previously generally available&#148; for the 2013 taxable year (such certification, an &#147;SEC Certification&#148;). We have not received such SEC Certification for our 2013 taxable year; however, in September 2015, we determined it was in the best interests of our stockholders to file the 2013 tax return as a C corporation. 

We evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing our consolidated financial statements to determine whether the tax positions are &#147;more-likely-than-not&#148; of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. We recognize the tax benefits of uncertain tax positions only when the position has met the &#147;more-likely-than-not&#148; threshold. We classify penalties and interest associated with income taxes, if any, as income tax expense. Conclusions regarding tax positions are subject to review and may be adjusted at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, ongoing analyses of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. We have identified our major tax jurisdictions as U.S. federal and California. 

Taxation as a Regulated Investment Company If we:

&#149; qualify as a RIC; and &#149; satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, then the following rules will apply to us. We will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our income we distribute (or are deemed to distribute) to stockholders. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any income, including capital gains not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our stockholders. 

&#160;

&#160;

We will be subject to a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless we distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our net ordinary income for each calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gains in excess of capital losses for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any ordinary income and net capital gains for preceding years that were not distributed during such preceding years (the &#147;Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement&#148;). We generally will endeavor in each year to make sufficient distributions to our stockholders to avoid any U.S. federal excise tax on our earnings. 

In order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things:

&#149; have in effect an election to be treated as a business development company under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year; &#149; derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to loans of certain securities, gains from the sale of stock or other securities or foreign currencies, net income from certain &#147;qualified publicly traded partnerships,&#148; or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities (the &#147;90% Income Test&#148;); and &#149; diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year: &#149; at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and &#149; no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer, of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable Code rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses, or of certain &#147;qualified publicly traded partnerships&#148; (the &#147;Diversification Tests&#148;). Provided that we satisfy the Diversification Tests as of the close of any quarter, we will not fail the Diversification Tests as of the close of a subsequent quarter as a consequence of a discrepancy between the value of our assets and the requirements of the Diversification Tests that is attributable solely to fluctuations in the value of our assets. Rather, we will fail the Diversification Tests as of the end of a subsequent quarter only if such a discrepancy existed immediately after our acquisition of any asset and such discrepancy is wholly or partly the result of that acquisition. In addition, if we fail the Diversification Tests as of the end of any quarter, we will not lose our status as a RIC if we eliminate the discrepancy within thirty days of the end of such quarter and, if we eliminate the discrepancy within that thirty-day period, we will be treated as having satisfied the Diversification Tests as of the end of such quarter for purposes of applying the rule described in the preceding sentence, assuming that it is not the first quarter of RIC qualification. 

An alternative 50% Diversification Test applies to certain RICs that obtain SEC Certification for the applicable taxable year. Such SEC Certification may not be received earlier than 60 days prior to the close of the taxable year to which it applies. If a RIC has received this certification, then, for purposes of the 50% Diversification Test, securities of an issuer will be treated as good investments as long as the RIC&#146;s basis in the securities of such issuer did not exceed 5% of the RIC&#146;s total assets when acquired whether or not the RIC owns more than 10% of the voting securities of such issuer. This alternative test does not apply to the securities of any issuer if the RIC has continuously held securities of the issuer for 10 or more years preceding the applicable quarter end. The 25% Diversification Test is not affected by this alternative 50% Diversification Test. 

&#160;

&#160;

As a result of converting from a C corporation to a RIC, we are required to pay a corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on the net amount of the net built-in gains, if any, in our assets ( i.e. , the amount by which the net fair market value of our assets exceeds our net adjusted basis in our assets) as of the date of conversion ( i.e. , January 1, 2014) to the extent that such gains are recognized by us during the applicable recognition period, which is the five-year period (or shorter applicable period) beginning on the date of conversion. 

Any corporate-level built-in gain tax is payable at the time the built-in gains are recognized (which generally will be the years in which the built-in gain assets are sold in a taxable transaction). The amount of this tax will vary depending on the assets that are actually sold by us in the applicable period, the amount of realized gain (loss), the actual amount of net built-in gain or loss present in those assets as of the date of conversion, and the effective tax rates at such times. The payment of any such corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on built-in gain will be an expense that will reduce the amount available for distribution to our stockholders. The built-in gain tax is calculated by determining a RIC&#146;s net unrealized built-in gains, if any, by which the fair market value of the assets of the RIC at the beginning of the first RIC-year exceeds the aggregate adjusted basis of such assets at that time. 

We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (which may arise if we receive warrants in connection with the origination of a loan or possibly in other circumstances), we must include in income each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. We may also have to include in income other amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as contractual payment-in-kind, or PIK, interest (which represents contractual interest added to the loan balance and due at the end of the loan term) or dividends and deferred loan origination fees that are paid after origination of the loan or are paid in non-cash compensation such as warrants or stock. Because any original issue discount or other amounts accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount. 

We will be subject to certain asset coverage ratio requirements under the 1940 Act and financial covenants under loan and credit agreements that could, under certain circumstances, restrict us from making distributions necessary to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement. See &#147;&#151; Regulation as a Business Development Company &#151; Senior Securities.&#148; Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet our distribution requirements may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our status as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous. 

Certain of our investment practices may be subject to special and complex U.S. federal income tax provisions that may, among other things: (i) disallow, suspend or otherwise limit the allowance of certain losses or deductions; (ii) convert lower taxed long-term capital gain into higher taxed short-term capital gain or ordinary income; (iii) convert an ordinary loss or a deduction into a capital loss (the deductibility of which is more limited); (iv) cause us to recognize income or gain without a corresponding receipt of cash; (v) adversely affect the time as to when a purchase or sale of securities is deemed to occur; (vi) adversely alter the characterization of certain complex financial transactions; and (vii) produce income that will not be qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test described above. We will monitor our transactions and may make certain tax elections in order to mitigate the potential adverse effect of these provisions. 

Gain or loss realized by us from the sale or exchange of warrants acquired by us as well as any loss attributable to the lapse of such warrants generally will be treated as capital gain or loss. The treatment of such gain or loss as long-term or short-term will depend on how long we held a particular warrant. Upon the exercise of a warrant acquired by us, our tax basis in the stock purchased under the warrant will equal the sum of the amount paid for the warrant plus the strike price paid on the exercise of the warrant. 

&#160;

&#160;

Failure to Maintain our Qualification as a RIC If we fail to satisfy the 90% Income Test or the Diversification Tests for any taxable year, we may nevertheless continue to qualify as a RIC for such year if certain relief provisions are applicable (which may, among other things, require us to pay certain corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes or to dispose of certain assets). 

If we were unable to qualify for treatment as a RIC and the foregoing relief provisions are not applicable, we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates, regardless of whether we make any distributions to our stockholders. Distributions would not be required, and any distributions would be taxable to our stockholders as ordinary dividend income that, subject to certain limitations, may be eligible for the 20% maximum rate to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits provided certain holding period and other requirements were met. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate distributees would be eligible for the dividends-received deduction. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder&#146;s tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. To requalify as a RIC in a subsequent taxable year, we would be required to satisfy the RIC qualification requirements for that year and dispose of any earnings and profits from any year in which we failed to qualify as a RIC. Subject to a limited exception applicable to RICs that qualified as such under Subchapter M of the Code for at least one year prior to disqualification and that requalify as a RIC no later than the second year following the nonqualifying year, we could be subject to tax on any unrealized net built-in gains in the assets held by us during the period in which we failed to qualify as a RIC that are recognized within the subsequent five years (or shorter applicable period), unless we made a special election to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on such built-in gain at the time of our requalification as a RIC.
