The Company 

&#160; 

Aqua America, Inc. (referred to as &#8220;Aqua America&#8221;, the &#8220;Company&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221; , or &#8220;our&#8221; ) , &#160; a Pennsylvania corporation, is the holding company for regulated utilities providing water or wastewater services to what we estimate to be almost three million people in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas, Illinois, North Carolina, New Jersey, Indiana, and Virginia. Our largest operating subsidiary is Aqua Pennsylvania, Inc., which accounted for approximately 52 % of our operating revenues and approximately 76 % of our Regulated segment&#8217;s income from continuing operations for 201 5 . &#160; A s of December 31, 201 5 , Aqua Pennsylvania provided water or wastewater services to approximately one-half of the total number of people we serve . Aqua Pennsylvania &#8217;s service territory &#160; is located in the suburban areas in counties north and west of the City of Philadelphia and in 27 &#160; other counties in Pennsylvania. Our other regulated utility subsidiaries provide similar services in seven other states. In addition, the Company&#8217;s market-based activities &#160; are conducted through Aqua Resources Inc . and Aqua Infrastructure, LLC. Aqua Resources provides water and wastewater service through operating and maintenance contracts with municipal authorities and other parties in close proximity to our utility companies&#8217; service territories ; offers , &#160; through a third party, water and wastewater line repair service and protection solutions to households ; inspects, cleans and repairs storm and sanitary wastewater lines ; installs and tests devices that prevent the contamination of potable water ; designs and builds water and wastewater systems ; and provides other market-based water and wastewater services . In addition, Aqua Resources provides liquid waste hauling and disposal services in a business unit that the Company has decided to sell , which as of December 31, 2015 &#160; is reported as assets held for sale in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets . Aqua Infrastructure &#160; provides non-utility raw water supply services for firms in the natural gas drilling industry. 

&#160; 

Aqua America, which prior to its name change in 2004 was known as Philadelphia Suburban Corporation, was formed in 1968 as a holding company for its primary subsidiary, Aqua Pennsylvania, formerly known as Philadelphia Suburban Water Company. In the early 1990s , we embarked on a growth through acquisition strategy focused on water and wastewater operations. Our most significant transactions to date have been the merger with Consumers Water Company in 1999, the acquisition of the regulated water and wastewater operations of AquaSource, Inc. in 2003, the acquisition of Heater Utilities, Inc. in 2004, and the acquisition of American Water Works Company, Inc.&#8217;s regulated water and wastewater operations in Ohio in 2012. Since the early 1990s, our business strategy has been primarily directed toward the regulated water and wastewater utility industry , where we have more than quadrupled the number of regulated customers we serve, and have extended our regulated operations from southeastern Pennsylvania to include our current regulated utility operations throughout Pennsylvania and in seven &#160; other states. During 2010 through 2013, we sold our utility operations in six states, pursuant to a portfolio rationalization strategy to focus our operations in areas where we have critical mass and economic growth potential. 

&#160;

&#160; 

In December 2014, we completed the sale of our water utility system in southwest Allen County, Indiana to the City of Fort Wayne, Indiana. T he completion of this sale settled the dispute concerning the February 2008 acquisition, by eminent domain, by the City of Fort Wayne, of the northern portion of our water and wastewater utility systems.

Our utility customer base is diversified among residential water, commercial water, fire protection, industrial water, other water, wastewater customers , and other utility customers (consisting of operating contracts that are closely associated with the utility operations). Residential water and wastewater customers make up the largest component of our utility customer base, with these customers representing approximately 70 % of our water and wastewater revenues. Substantially all of our water customers are metered, which allows us to measure and bill for our customers&#8217; water consumption. Water consumption per customer is affected by local weather conditions during the year, especially during late spring , summer , and early fall . In general, during these seasons, an extended period of dry weather increases consumption, while above average rainfall decreases consumption. Also, an increase in the average temperature generally causes an increase in water consumption. On occasion, abnormally dry weather in our service areas can result in governmental authorities declaring drought warnings and imposing water use restrictions in the affected areas, which could reduce water consumption. See Water Utility Supplies, and &#160; Facilities and Wastewater Utility Facilities for a discussion of water use restrictions that may impact water consumption during abnormally dry weather. The geographic diversity of our utility customer base reduces the effect of our exposure to extreme or unusual weather conditions in any one area of our service territory. Water usage is also affected by changing consumption patterns by our customers, resulting from such causes as increased water conservation and the installation of water saving devices and appliances that can result in decreased water usage. It is estimated that in the event we experience a &#160; 0.50 % decrease in residential water consumption it would result in a decrease in annual residential water revenue of approximately $ 2,000,000 , and would likely be partially offset by a reduction in incremental water production expenses such as chemicals and power . 

&#160;

Our growth in revenues over the past five years is primarily a result of increases in water and wastewater rates and customer growth through our acquisition strategy. See Economic Regulation for a discussion of water and wastewater rates. The majority of the increase in our utility customer base has been due to custom ers added through acquisitions and other growth ventures (excluding dispositions) &#160; as shown below: &#160; &#160;

In 2015 , our customer count increased by 17,747 customers, primarily due to utility systems that we acquired and natural growth. Overall, for the five-year period of 2011 &#160; through 2015 , our utility customer base , &#160; adjusted to exclude customers associated with utility system dispositions, increased at an annual compound rate of 2.4 %. During the five-year period ended December 31, 2015, our utility customer base including customers associated with utility system acquisitions and dispositions decreased from 966,136 at December 31, 2011 to 957,866 at December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

Acquisitions and Other Growth Ventures 

&#160; 

According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;), approximately 85% of the U.S. population obtains its water from community water systems, and 15% of the U.S. population obtains its water from private wells. With approximately 53,000 community water systems in the U.S. (82% of which serve less than 3,300 customers), the water industry is the most fragmented of the major utility industries (telephone, natural gas, electric, water and wastewater). The majority of these community water systems are government-owned, and the balance of the systems are privately-owned (or investor-owned). The nation&#8217;s water systems range in size from large government-owned systems, such as the New York City water system which serves approximately 8.5 &#160; million people, to small systems, where a few customers share a common well. In the states where we operate regulated utilities , we believe there are approximately 14,500 community water systems of widely-varying size, with the majority of the population being served by government-owned water systems. 

&#160; 

Although not as fragmented as the water industry, the wastewater industry in the U.S. also presents opportunities for consolidation. According to the EPA&#8217;s most recent survey of wastewater treatment facilities (which includes both government-owned and privately-owned facilities) in 2012 , there are approximately 15,000 such facilities in the nation serving approximately 76 % of the U.S. population. The remaining population represents individual homeowners with their own treatment facilities; for example, community on-lot disposal systems and septic tank systems. The vast majority of wastewater facilities are government-owned rather than privately-owned. The EPA&#8217;s survey also indicated that there are approximately 4,000 waste water facilities in operation in the states where we operate &#160; regulated utilities . &#160; 

&#160; 

Because of the fragmented nature of the water and wastewater utility industries, we believe there are many potential water and wastewater system acquisition candidates throughout the U.S. We believe the factors driving consolidation of these systems are: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

the benefits of economies of scale; 

&#183; 

the increasing cost and complexity of environmental regulations; 

&#183; 

the need for substantial capital investment; 

&#183; 

the need for technological and managerial expertise; 

&#183; 

the desire to improve water quality and service; 

&#183; 

limited access to cost-effective financing; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the monetizing of public assets to support , in some cases, the declining financial condition of municipalities ; and 

&#183; 

the use of system sale proceeds by a municipality to accomplish other public purposes . 

&#160; 

We are actively exploring opportunities to expand our utility operations through acquisitions or other growth ventures. During the five-year period ended December 31, 2015 , we expanded our utility operations by completing 75 &#160; acquisitions or other growth ventures. 

&#160; 

We believe that acquisitions will continue to be an important source of customer growth for us. We intend to continue to pursue acquisitions of government-owned and privately-owned water and wastewater systems that provide services in areas near our existing service territories or in new service areas. We engage in continuing activities with respect to potential acquisitions, including calling on prospective sellers, performing analyses and investigations of acquisition candidates, making preliminary acquisition proposals , and negotiating the terms of potential acquisitions. Further, we are also seeking other potential business opportunities, including but not limited to partnering with public and private utilities to invest in infrastructure improvements, and growing our market-based activities by acquiring business es that provide water and wastewater management services , and investing in infrastructure projects . 

&#160; 

Water Utility Supplies and Facilities and Wastewater Utility Facilities 

&#160; 

Our water utility operations obtain their water supplies from surface water sources, underground aquifers, and water purchased from other water suppliers. Our water supplies are primarily self- supplied and processed at twenty surface water treatment plants located in four states, and numerous well stations located in all of the states in which we conduct business. Approximately 8 % of our water supplies are provided through water purchased from other water suppliers. It is our policy to obtain and maintain the permits necessary to obtain the water we distribute. 

&#160; 

We believe that the capacities of our sources of supply, and our water treatment, pumping and distribution facilities, are generally sufficient to meet the present requirements of our customers under normal conditions. We plan system improvements and additions to capacity in response to normal replacement and renewal needs, changing regulatory standards, changing patterns of consumption, and increased demand from customer growth. The various state utility commissions have gener ally recognized the operating and capital costs associated with these improvements in setting water and wastewater rates. 

&#160; 

On occasion, drought warnings and water use restrictions are issued by governmental authorities for portions of our service territories in response to extended periods of dry weather conditions. The timing and duration of the warnings and restrictions can have an impact on our water revenues and net income. In general, water consumption in the summer months is more affected by drought warnings and restrictions because discretionary and recreational use of water is at its highest during the summer months. At other times of the year, warnings and restrictions generally have less of an effect on water consumption. 

&#160; 

We believe that our wastewater treatment facilities are generally adequate to meet the present requirements of our customers under normal conditions . &#160; Additionally , we own several wastewater collection systems that convey the wastewater to a municipally-owned facility for treatment . Changes in regulatory requirements can be reflected in revised permit limits and conditions when permits are renewed, typically on a five-year cycle, or when treatment capacity is expanded. Capital improvements are planned and budgeted to meet normal replacement and renewal needs, anticipated changes in regulat ions, needs for increased capacity related to projected growth, and to reduce inflow and infiltration to collection systems. The various state utility &#160; commissions have generally recognized the operating and capital costs associated with these improvements in setting wastewater rates for current and new customers . It is our policy to obtain and maintain the permits necessary for the treatment of the wastewater that we return to the environment. 

&#160;

Economic Regulation 

&#160; 

Most of our water and wastewater utility operations are subject to regulation by their respective state utility commissions, which have broad administrative power and authority to regulate billing rates, determine franchise areas and conditions of service, approve acquisitions and authorize the issuance of securities. The utility commissions also establish uniform systems of accounts and approve the terms of contracts with affiliates and customers, business combinations with other utility systems, and loans and other financings. The policies of the utility commissions often differ from state to state, and may change over time. A small number of our operations are subject to rate regulation by county or city governments. The profitability of our utility operations is influenced to a great extent by the timeliness and adequacy of rate allowances we are granted by the respective utility commissions or authorities in the various states in which we operate. 

&#160; 

Accordingly, we maintain a rate case management capability, the objective of which is to provide that the tariffs of our utility operations reflect, to the extent practicable, the timely recovery of increases in costs of operations, capital expenditures, interest expense, taxes, energy, materials, and compliance with environmental regulations. We file rate increase requests to recover and earn a fair return on the infrastructure investments that we make in improving or replacing our facilities and to recover expenses. In the states in which we operate, we are primarily subject to economic regulation by the following state utility commissions: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

State 

Utility Commission 

&#160; 

Pennsylvania 

Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission 

&#160; 

Ohio 

The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio 

&#160; 

Texas 

Texas Public Utility Commission 

&#160; 

Illinois 

Illinois Commerce Commission 

&#160; 

North Carolina 

North Carolina Utilities Commission 

&#160; 

New Jersey 

New Jersey Board of Public Utilities 

&#160; 

Indiana 

Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission 

&#160; 

Virginia 

Virginia State Corporation Commission 

&#160; 

Our water and wastewater operations are comprised of 52 &#160; rate divisions, each of which requires a separate rate filing for the evaluation of the cost of service, including the recovery of investments, in connection with the establishment of rates for that rate division. When feasible and beneficial to our utility customers, we will seek approval from the applicable state regulatory commission to consolidate rate divisions to achieve a more even distribution of costs over a larger customer base. All &#160; of the states in which we operate permit us to file a revenue requirement for some form of consolidated rates for the rate divisions in that state. 

&#160; 

In some regulatory jurisdictions, we may seek authorization to bill our utility customers in accordance with a rate filing that is pending before the respective regulatory commission. &#160; Furthermore, some utility &#160; commissions authorize the use of expense deferrals and amortization in order to provide for an impact on our operating income by an amount that approximates the requested amount in a rate request. &#160; In these states t he additional revenue billed and collected prior to the final regulatory commission ruling is subject to refund to customers based on the outcome of the ruling. &#160; The revenue recognized and the expenses deferred by us reflect an estimate as to the final outcome of the ruling. &#160; If the request is denied completely or in part, we could be required to refund to customers some or all of the revenue billed to date, and write-off some or all of the deferred expenses. 

&#160; 

Six &#160; states in which we operate water utilities , and five &#160; states in which we operate wastewater utilities, permit us to add a surcharge to water or wastewater bills to offset the additional depreciation and capital costs associated with capital expenditures related to replacing and rehabilitating infrastructure systems. &#160; Without &#160; this surcharge , a water and wastewater utility absorbs all of the depreciation and capital costs of these projects between base rate increases. &#160; The gap between the time that a capital project is completed and the recovery of its costs in rates is known as regulatory lag. &#160; This &#160; surcharge is intended to substantially reduce regulatory lag , which often acted as a disincentive to water and wastewater utilities to rehabilitate their infrastructure. &#160; In 

&#160;

addition, our subsidiaries in some &#160; states use a surcharge or credit on their bill s to reflect changes in costs , such as changes in state tax rates, other taxes and purchased water costs, until such time as the new cost levels &#160; are incorporated in to base rates. 

&#160; 

Currently, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, Indiana , New Jersey , and North Carolina &#160; allow for the use of an infrastructure rehabilitation &#160; surcharge . On December 22, 2014, the North Carolina Utilities Commission granted the first infrastructure rehabilitation surcharge for Aqua North Carolina. The Attorney General filed an appeal to the State Supreme Court challenging the approval and on August 21, 2015, the State Supreme Court upheld the Commission&#8217;s decision granting this surcharge . &#160; &#160; The infrastructure rehabilitation &#160; surcharge &#160; typically adjust s periodically &#160; based on additional qualified capital expenditures completed or anticipated in a future period , and is capped at a percentage of base rates, generally at 5% to 12.75 % , &#160; and is reset to zero when new base rates that reflect the costs of those additions become effective &#160; or when a utility&#8217;s earnings exceed a regulatory benchmark . &#160; &#160; This s urcharge provided revenues of $ 3,261,000 in 2015, $ 4,598,000 in 2014, and $ 3,205,000 in 2013. 

&#160; 

In December 2012, Aqua Pennsylvania adopted an &#160; income tax accounting change , &#160; implemented on Aqua America&#8217;s 2012 federal income tax return , which was filed in September 2013. This accounting change allows a tax deduction for qualifying utility asset improvements that were formerly capitalized for tax purposes , and was implemented in response to a June 2012 rate order issued by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission . &#160; The Pennsylvania rate order provides for a reduction in current income tax expense as a result of the recognition of income tax benefits resulting from the accounting change. This tax accounting change and its treatment under the Pennsylvania rate order financially offset the impact of the water infrastructure rehabilitation surcharge suspension. During 2013 , &#160; our Ohio and North Carolina operating divisions implemented this change . These divisions currently do not employ a method of accounting that &#160; provides for a reduction in current income tax expense , &#160; and as such this change had no impact on our effective income tax rate. 

&#160; 

In general, we believe that Aqua America and its subsidiaries have valid authority, free from unduly burdensome restrictions, to enable us to carry on our business as presently conducted in the franchised or contracted areas we now serve. The rights to provide water or wastewater service to a particular franchised service territory are generally non-exclusive, although the applicable utility commissions usually allow only one regulated utility to provide service to a given area. In some instances, another water utility provides service to a separate area within the same political subdivision served by one of our subsidiaries. Therefore, as a regulated utility, there is little or no competition for the daily water and wastewater service we provide to our customers. Water and wastewater utilities may compete for the acquisition of other water and wastewater utilities or for acquiring new customers in new service territories. Competition for these acquisitions generally comes from nearby utilities, either investor-owned or municipal-owned , and sometimes from strategic or financial purchasers seeking to enter or expand in the water and wastewater industry. We compete for new service territories and the acquisition of other utilities on the following bases: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

economic value ; &#160; 

&#183; 

economies of scale ; &#160; 

&#183; 

our ability to provide quality water and wastewater service ; &#160; 

&#183; 

our existing infrastructure network ; &#160; 

&#183; 

our ability to perform infrastructure improvements ; &#160; 

&#183; 

our ability to comply with environmental, health, and safety regulations, our technical, regulatory, and operational expertise ; &#160; 

&#183; 

our ability to access capital markets ; and &#160; 

&#183; 

our cost of capital. 

&#160; 

The addition of new service territories and the acquisition of other utilities by regulated utilities such as us are generally subject to review and approval by the applicable st ate utility &#160; commissions. 

&#160; 

&#160;

In a very few number of instances , &#160; in one of our southern states, where there are municipally-owned water or wastewater systems near our operating divisions , the municipally-owned system may either have water distribution or wastewater &#160; collection mains that are located adjacent to our division's mains or may construct new mains that parallel our mains. &#160; In these circumstances, on occasion , the municipally-owned system may attempt to voluntarily offer service to customers who are connected to our mains, resulting in our mains becoming surplus or unde rutilized without compensation. 

&#160; 

In the states where our subsidiaries operate, it is possible that portions of our subsidiaries&#8217; operations could be acquired by municipal governments by one or more of the following methods: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

eminent domain; 

&#183; 

the right of purchase given or reserved by a municipality or political subdivision when the original franchise was granted; and 

&#183; 

the right of purchase given or reserved under the law of the state in which the subsidiary was incorporated or from which it received its permit. 

&#160; 

The price to be paid upon such an acquisition by the municipal government is usually determined in accordance with applicable law under eminent domain. In other instances, the price may be negotiated, fixed by appraisers selected by the parties or computed in accordance with a formula prescribed in the law of the state or in the particular franchise or charter. We believe that our operating subsidiaries will be entitled to fair market value for any assets that are condemned, and we believe the fair ma rket value will be in excess of the book value for such assets. 

&#160; 

Despite the condemnation of our water utility systems in Fort Wayne, Indiana , which concluded with the sale of the system in December 2014 , and the sales of selected systems, one of our primary strategies continues to be to acquire additional water and wastewater systems, to maintain our existing systems where there is a business or a strategic benefit, and to actively oppose unilateral efforts by municipal governments to acquire any of our operations, particularly for less than the fair market value of our operations or where the municipal government seeks to acquire more than it is entitled to under the applicable law or agreement. On occasion, we may voluntarily agree to sell systems or portions of systems in order to help focus our efforts in areas where we have more critical mass and economies of scale or for other strategic reasons. 

&#160; 

Environmental, Health and Safety Regulation 

&#160; 

Provision of water and wastewater services is subject to regulation under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, the Clean Water Act, and related state laws, and under federal and state regulations issued under these laws. These laws and regulations establish criteria and standards for drinking water and for wastewater discharges. In addition, we are subject to federal and state laws and other regulations relating to solid waste disposal, dam safety and other aspects of our operations. Capital expenditures and operating costs required as a result of water quality standards and environmental requirements have been traditionally recognized by state utility commissions as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates. 

&#160; 

From time to time, Aqua America has acquired, and may acquire, systems that have e nvironmental compliance issues . Environmental compliance &#160; issues also arise in the course of normal operations or as a result of regulatory changes . Aqua America attempts to align capital budgeting and expenditures to address these issues in due course . &#160; &#160; We believe that the capital expenditures required to address outstanding compliance issues have been budgeted in our capital program and represent approximately $25,500,000 or less t han 2 % of our &#160; expected total capital expenditures over the next five years. &#160; We are parties to agreements with regulatory agencies in Pennsylvania, Texas, Indiana, and Virginia under which we have committed to make improvements for environmental compliance. &#160; These agreements are intended to provide the regulators with assurance that problems covered by these agreements will be addressed, and the agreements generally provide protection from fines, penalties and other actions while corrective measures are being implemented. &#160; The capital improvements associated with the agreements in 

&#160;

Indiana and Virginia have been completed. We are actively working directly with &#160; state environmental officials in Pennsylvania and Texas to implement or amend these agreements as necessary. 

&#160; 

Safe Drinking Water Act - The Safe Drinking Water Act establishes criteria and procedures for the EPA to develop national quality standards for drinking water. &#160; Regulations issued pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act set standards regarding the amount of microbial and chemical contaminants and radionuclides in drinking water. C urrent requirements under the Safe Drinking Water Act are not expected to have a material impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations as we have made and are making investments to meet existing water quality standards. &#160; We may, in the future, be required to change our method of treating drinking water at some &#160; sources of supply and make additional capital investments if additional regulations become effective. 

&#160; 

Clean Water Act - The Clean Water Act regulates discharges from drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities into lakes, rivers, streams, and groundwater. &#160; It is our policy to obtain and maintain all required permits and approvals for the discharge s from our water and wastewater facilities, and to comply with all conditions of those permits and other regulatory requirements. &#160; A program is in place to monitor facilities for compliance with permitting, monitoring and reporting for wastewater discharges. From time to time, discharge violations may occur which may result in fines. These fines and penalties, if any, are not expected to have a material impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. &#160; We are also parties to agreements with regulatory agencies in several states where we operate while improvements are being made to address wastewater discharge issues. &#160; 

&#160; 

Solid Waste Disposal - The handling and disposal of waste generated from water and wastewater treatment facilities is governed by federal and state laws and regulations. &#160; A program is in place to monitor our facilities for compliance with regulatory requirements, and we are not aware of any significant environmental remediation costs necessary from our handling an d disposal of waste material from our water and wastewater operations. 

&#160; 

Dam Safety - Our subsidiaries own fifteen dams that are subject to the requirements of the federal and state regulations related to dam safety , which undergo regular inspections and an annual engineering inspection. We believe that all fifteen dams are structurally sound and well-maintained. 

&#160; 

We performed studies of our dams that identified three dams in Pennsylvania and two dams in Ohio requiring capital improvements resulting from the adoption by state regulatory agencies of revised formulas for calculating the magnitude of a possible maximum flood event. The most significant capital improvement remaining to be performed is on one dam in Pennsylvania at a total estimated cost of $15,000,000. Design for this dam commenced in 2013 and construction is expected to be completed in 2021 . 

&#160; 

Safety Standards - Our facilities and operations may be subject to inspections by representatives of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration from time to time. &#160; We maintain safety policies and procedures to compl y with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration&#8217;s rules and regulations, but violations may occur from time to time, which may result in fines and penalties, which are not expected to have a material impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations . &#160; We endeavor to correct such violations promptly when they come to our attention. 

&#160; 

Security 

&#160; 

We maintain security measures at our facilities , and collaborate with federal, state and local authorities and industry trade associations regarding information on possible threats and security measures for water and wastewater utility operations. &#160; &#160; The costs incurred are expected to be recoverable in water and wastewater rates and are not expected to have a material impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Employee Relations 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015 , we employed a total of 1,617 full-time employees. Our subsidiaries are parties to 15 &#160; labor agreements with labor unions covering 555 &#160; employees. The labor agreements expire at various times between March 2016 &#160; and May 2019 . &#160; 

&#160; 

Available Information
