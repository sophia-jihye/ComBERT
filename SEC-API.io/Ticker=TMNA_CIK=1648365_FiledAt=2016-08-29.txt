Industry background 

&#160; 

The technical consulting and web design industry has been increasing over the last five years. Rapid increases and developments in computer technology have caused the average user to rely on computer professionals to handle their web development, Internet marketing, and search engine optimization needs. In the United States, the market for computer services is immense. Last year approximately $300 billion dollars was spent nationwide on computer and computer related services. 

&#160; 

Computer systems, web design, development, and integration IT services give for about 35% of industry revenue; application design and development services - 25%; and technical support - 10%. IT services companies help clients use computers, software, and communications systems more efficiently. In addition to providing advice on using computer systems, they frequently recommend hardware and software systems to their customers. Firms provide a variety of associated services, including business function. 

&#160; 

As time progresses, management expects that the number of businesses operating within the web design and search engine optimization market will continue to grow as these services are heavily in demand. This segment of the computer consulting industry is relatively new as many companies have realized that in order to thrive online, an expansive marketing and advertising campaign is needed to continually draw traffic to their website. The popularity of these services has skyrocketed over the last few years as many search engines now allow for special placement among online directories. Furthermore, the use of pay-per-click advertising has allowed many smaller internet businesses to thrive on the web. We will seek to capitalize on these trends by assisting companies in the design of their website, the implementation of SEO programs and by managing PPC marketing campaigns. These services will provide the Company with an ongoing stream of revenue on a month-to-month basis.

Products &#38; Services 

&#160; 

We continue provide customers with the web application development services for many different computing needs. We use different types of templates such as: HTML, Word Press, MotoCMS HTML, OpenCart to websites development. 

&#160; 

Website Development 

&#160; 

Our primary revenue creator for our business to be the development of website applications including customized websites for small to medium sized businesses. Customers that use our services will be seeking to develop an expansive e-commerce, or application intensive website. Through our areas of expertise, we will be able to provide small, and medium sized businesses with enterprise level applications customizable for any purpose. 

&#160; 

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) 

&#160; 

We also intend on providing search engine optimization services. This service works by examining the keywords of any given website, and then applying these keywords to search engines that the Company enrolls its customers in. This service provides users with the ability to appear on the direct search engine results for their selected keywords. 

&#160; 

Search engines such as Google, Yahoo, MSN, Ask.com, and many others use complicated algorithms to rank specific websites based on their relevance to the keyword. By adding keyword rich content to a website, the Company will be able to proactively increase the clients&#8217; website&#8217;s visibility by integrating their keywords into these search directories. 

&#160; 

The technical aspect behind SEO service is highly complex, and management will provide a potential investor with a technical specification document outlining the structure of how these services are rendered. 

&#160; 

Management believes that our relations with Megadataweb will be a larger source of income in the future for our business Our web design services are designed to be search engine friendly and will be integrated with the Company&#8217;s SEO services. 

&#160; 

We believe many of us spend a lot of time trying to find the right information online. After the information was found we continue to compare the information we found with our knowledge or with similar data. This applies to any kind of searches for products or services, prices or entertainments. Today, many popular programs were created for the purpose of simplifying and accelerating the development process of applications. These programs were not oriented to process big data fast and efficiently. This is why most web applications become slow, complicated, and require permanent server support. 

&#160; 

We found the one company that could resolve all these problems by developing the following improvements: 

&#160; 

&#8226; Developing a compact data representation with pack and unpack algorithms for faster data delivery. Quantum leap performance of data processing (Can sort 1,000,000 records in one second). &#8226; Developing an advanced compact data format to avoid memory restriction even for mobile devices. &#8226; Finding a way for endless data processing offline, created an advanced data processing engine with focus on simplicity, usability, performance, and maximum functionality without the problems inherent with other solutions. &#160; 

Megadataweb literally delivers &#8220;quantum leap&#8221; improvements in how Web Browser users can rapidly and efficiently make use of big-data databases. 

&#160; 

Megadataweb dramatically streamlines and optimizes the entire process of data mining, editing, analyzing and reporting on data and information from any web, internet or extranet accessible database. For example: Microsoft Excel 2013 has only the maximum worksheet size - 1,048,576 rows by 16,384 columns. Some big companies use bigger databases for their needs that require sort a lot of data in a short time. 

&#160; 

Rapid technological advances drive demand for IT services, but expenses depends on the health of the US economy. The profitability of companies depends on technical expertise, innovative services, and effective marketing. Large companies have advantages in broad service offerings and global reach, which give them the ability to provide outsourcing services to big corporate customers. Small companies can compete effectively by specializing in market niches or by partnering with larger companies that want to broaden their mix of services. 

&#160; 

4&#160; 

&#160; 

We value strategic partnerships and see it as a way to increasing the number of clients by use of their database, a possibility to leverage brand identity while bringing the company's software to large numbers of existing users with minimal marketing efforts on IWEB&#8217;s behalf and together we will create a more powerful value proposition than either could separately. 

&#160; 

We will work with our strategic partner Unusual Concepts (that is currently under development) to create IT products for them. This company will provide groups and individuals with IT training around the world. Our business concept for Unusual Concepts is about teaching: 

&#160; 

&#8220;We love taking people outside their comfort zone, reminding them that everything is in their own hands. We love to see the sparks in the eyes of our clients after we leave. We love awaking the personality in the people we get in touch with and see a cog in the big organizational machine turning into an individual. Any individual aware of own values collaborating with other individuals because of the feeling of responsibility and internal drive not because they are told to. We believe that by making our organizations more agile, create better products and services we can make this world into a better place.&#8221; 

&#160; 

We are a developing company and have generated minimal revenue to date. We currently have no employees. 

&#160; 

Dependence Upon Currents Clients 

&#160; 

We don&#8217;t have the long-term permanent clients and depends from current orders. Also we are working on diversify our business in order to increase our capitalization. 

&#160; 

Fees 

&#160; 

Our pricing depending on the complexity of the work, our expenses and the time needed for its implementation. 

For the period from June 30, 2015 to June 30, 2016 we generated revenues from our customers based on the above information. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Corporate Background 

&#160; 

Our general business strategy is to design web sites for clients, manage advertising campaigns and to develop and become a company that provides better search engine optimization (&#8220;SEO&#8221;) software and techniques to smaller clients. We will be actively engaged in providing high impact internet marketing strategies to small internet based businesses and people seeking to create websites. We believe that there is a niche in this area as smaller companies are not coveted by the big internet advertising firms and they cannot afford to pay the higher fees demanded by large SEO web design companies. 

&#160; 

As a development-stage, the Company had limited operating revenues through June 30, 2016. 

&#160; 

Revenues were generated from clients&#8217; payments. The Company is currently devoting substantially all of its present efforts to find a new clients and expanding business. 

&#160; 

Our Strategy 

&#160; 

IWEB, Inc., is a company is in its early development that formed in the State of Nevada on February 17, 2015. Our strategy is to design web sites for clients, manage advertising campaigns and to develop and become a company that provides better search engine optimization (&#8220;SEO&#8221;) software and techniques to smaller clients. We will be actively engaged in in providing high impact internet marketing strategies to small internet based businesses and people seeking to create websites. We believe that there is a niche in this area as smaller companies are not coveted by the big internet advertising firms and they cannot afford to pay the higher fees demanded by large SEO web design companies. 

&#160; 

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, IWEB has generated minimal cash flow from operations and has accumulated losses since inception. IWEB is in the development stage and to date has generated minimal revenue. In a developing company, management devotes most of its activities to the development and marketing of the Company&#8217;s products and services. The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies that IWEB will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. IWEB is unlikely to pay dividends or generate significant earnings in the immediate or foreseeable future. There is no guarantee that IWEB will be able to raise any equity financing or generate profitable operations. 

&#160; 

When we design and create a website and marketing campaign for a customer we believe we are building an online identity for that customer and thereby, allowing the formation of a potential consumer audience wishing to purchase that customers product or service. We will discuss and work with the customer to establish a brand identity that clearly communicates our customers&#8217; core values as well as making it instantly recognizable. 

&#160; 

Once we have established our web design, advertising and SEO portion of our business we will also design and develop mobile applications for ourselves and customers. 

&#160; 

The Company will also help customers manage their monthly advertising expenditures through pay-per-click, or PPC advertising, which allows business owners to immediately appear on the first page of a web search. By using pay-per-click, a company can automatically increase the presence of its website; we feel that this avenue of growth to a new business can be very important, as the business will be able to generate highly predictable advertising fees on a month to month basis for these services. 

&#160; 

6&#160; 

&#160; 

Cost of service 

&#160; 

Amounts that will be recorded as cost of service relate to expenses incurred for service process. Such costs are recorded and allocated as incurred. Our service cost will consist primarily of the Intellectual work, time and expenses that we spent for service implement. 

&#160; 

Our Competition and Industry 

The online content and media market we participate in is new, rapidly evolving and intensely competitive. Competition is expected to intensify in the future as more companies enter the space. We compete for business on a number of factors including return on marketing investment, price, access to targeted audiences and quality. Competition in the online advertising and marketing industry is also highly fragmented. Our competition is any company that provides one or more of our company&#8217;s core service offerings. 

&#160; 

Our competition includes Advertising Firms, Public Relations Companies, Web Design Companies, Graphic Design Companies, and Search Engine Optimization Firms. Our competitors range in size from small, local independent firms and individuals to very large conglomerates. Such fragmentation can mean that a small business owner can employ more than one advertising and marketing agency to get a needed mix of web design and online marketing services for their desired budget. The online media marketing industry is always evolving with thousands of new competitors entering the market every year. It is becoming very difficult for companies to distinguish themselves in the market and gain new customers. 

&#160; 

In addition to competitors, many businesses are deciding to design their own websites and execute online advertising campaigns themselves, reducing the number of potential customers. There are a large number of companies that provide website templates that a business can purchase and alter easily, without the need to hire a web development company. While basic coding knowledge is needed to effectively customize a template and incorporate social management and monitoring solutions to fit an individual business&#8217;s needs, many new businesses are choosing to use an existing template versus paying for a new website design. 

&#160; 

Our Company is also subject to other competitive risks of early stage and commercial businesses generally, and of technology businesses in particular, including competing in an environment where other companies may be better financed or have more experience than the Company. See &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Regulation 

&#160; 

We are not directly subject to federal, state or local regulation other than regulations applicable to businesses generally or directly applicable to electronic commerce. However, the Internet is increasingly popular. As a result, it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the Internet. These laws may cover issues such as user privacy, freedom of expression, pricing, content and quality of products and services, taxation, advertising, intellectual property rights and information security. Furthermore, the growth of electronic marketing may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws. Several states have proposed legislation to limit the uses of personal user information gathered online or require online services to establish privacy policies. The Federal Trade Commission has also initiated action against at least one online service regarding the manner in which personal information is collected from users and provided to third parties. We will not provide personal information regarding our users to third parties. However, the adoption of such consumer protection laws could create uncertainty in web usage and reduce the demand for our products. 

&#160; 

We are not certain how our business may be affected by the application of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, copyrights, encryption and other intellectual property issues, taxation, libel, obscenity and export or import matters. The vast majority of such laws were adopted prior to the advent of the Internet. As a result, they do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the Internet and related technologies. Changes in laws intended to address such issues could create uncertainty in the Internet market place. Such uncertainty could reduce demand for services or increase the cost of doing business as a result of litigation costs or increased service delivery costs. 

&#160; 

In addition for the most part, the steps to an online business are the same as starting any business. However, doing business online comes with additional legal and financial considerations, particularly in the areas of privacy, security, copyright, and taxation. 

&#160; 

Rules and regulations apply mainly to online retailers and other businesses that perform consumer transactions by collecting customer data. However, even if we do not sell anything online, laws covering digital rights and online advertising may still apply to us. 

&#160; 

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is the primary federal agency regulating e-commerce activities, including use of commercial emails, online advertising and consumer privacy. 

&#160; 

7&#160; 

&#160; 

Other Opportunities 

&#160; 

Current management is exploring other opportunities for the company, including, but not limited to, licensing, acquisitions, mergers, and/or joint ventures. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As on June 30, 2016 we have one officer that working from the beginning and continue to serve. Our Chief Executive Officer, Dmitriy Kolyvayko, works part time on our business.
