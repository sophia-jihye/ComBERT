 ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS . 

&#160; 

History 

&#160;

We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on July 6, 2010 under the name &#8220;Advanced Ventures Corp.&#8221; . Effective January 6, 2014, we changed our name to &#8220;Gold Union Inc.&#8221;

&#160;

In connection with our former business, we entered into an exclusive worldwide patent sale agreement (the &#8220;Patent Transfer and Sales Agreement&#8221;) with Ilanit Appelfeld (the &#8220;Seller&#8221;), to acquire a patented technology, U.S. Patent Number: 6,743,209 (the &#8220;Patent&#8221;), for a catheter with a integral anchoring mechanism on July 27, 2010. We acquired the patent and technology for $17,500 (seventeen thousand five hundred United States Dollars), according to the terms and conditions specified in the Patent Transfer and Sales Agreement related to U.S. Patent Number: 6,743,209.

&#160;

During the second quarter of 2011 the Company raised gross proceeds of $75,000 pursuant to an effective Form S-1 Registration Statement and issued 37,500,000 post forward stock split shares of common stock that were registered pursuant to the Form S-1 Registration Statement.

&#160;

Effective March 7, 2012, we increased the number of our authorized shares of common stock to three billion shares (3,000,000,000) and engaged in a forward stock split of its common shares whereby each one share of our common stock was split into fifteen shares of our common stock.

&#160;

During the second fiscal quarter of 2014, we elected to discontinue our business of exploiting the Patent and began to consider other business opportunities that may bring quicker and greater value to our stockholders. We initially considered entering into the business of trading precious metal bullion primarily in the Asia Pacific region. Therefore, effective January 6, 2014, we changed our name to &#8220;Gold Union Inc.&#8221; to more adequately reflect our initial intended business operations.

&#160;

During the third fiscal quarter of 2014, we identified an opportunity to enter into the real property development business in Cambodia. On August 28, 2014, we executed a Share Exchange Agreement with G.U. International Limited, a limited company incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Seychelles and our wholly owned subsidiary (&#8220;GUI&#8221;), and Kao Wei-Chen, an individual representing herself and 8 other individuals (collectively, the &#8220;Golden Corridor Shareholders&#8221;), which agreement was amended several times to extend the closing date of the acquisition (collectively, the &#8220;Share Exchange Agreement&#8221;). Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, we, through GUI, purchased 480 shares of Phnom Penh Golden Corridor Trading Co. Limited (the &#8220;GC Shares&#8221;), from 9 private Golden Corridor Shareholders, representing 48% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Golden Corridor. As consideration, we agreed to issue to the Golden Corridor Shareholders 2,500,000,000 shares of our common stock, at a value of US $0.002 per share, for an aggregate value of US $5,000,000. We consummated the acquisition of the GC Shares on December 31, 2015.

&#160;

Golden Corridor owns three parcels of land located at National Road 44, Phum Phkung, Chbarmorn Commune, Chbarmorn District, Kampong Speu Province, Kingdom of Cambodia, measuring an aggregate of 172,510 square meters (collectively, the &#8220;Properties&#8221;). Pursuant to an independent valuation conducted by a third party appraisal firm licensed under the Ministry of Economy and Finance of Cambodia and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Cambodia, the Properties have an estimated value of US $10,350,600 as of April 8, 2014. Golden Corridor intends to develop the Properties into an industrial park for rental income within the next two or three years. Golden Corridor has not yet commenced any significant operations.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

As a result of our acquisition of the GC Shares, we elected to cease our metal bullion trading business and enter into the real estate development and rental business located in the Kingdom of Cambodia.

&#160;

A chart of our corporate structure is set forth below.

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

Description of Business 

&#160;

On August 14th, 2013, PHNOM PENH GOLDEN CORRIDOR TRADING CO., LTD. (&#8220;Golden Corridor&#8221;) was officially registered as a private limited liability company and obtained the company business license from the Ministry of Commerce of the Kingdom of Cambodia. Golden Corridor intends to engage in the business of purchasing, selling and leasing of land and houses, as well as making investments in industrial properties.

&#160;

On September 2, 2013, Golden Corridor acquired 3 parcels of land totaling 172,510 square meters located at National Road 44, Phum Phkung, Chbarmorn Commune, Chbarmorn District, Kampong Speu Province, Kingdom of Cambodia (the &#8220;Properties&#8221;) at a purchase price of 2,560,950,000 Riel. On April 8th, 2014, Vtrust Appraisal Co., Ltd., a valuation company having valuation license from Ministry of Economy and Finance and Securities and Exchange Commission of Cambodia (SECC), appraised that the Properties at a fair market value of approximately US$10,356,000. According to the valuation report, the Properties are classified under Community Development type of property.

&#160;

Golden Corridor plans to develop the Properties into an industrial park. It expects to construct, market, sell and or lease light industrial factories, shop lots and low and medium cost residential houses on the Properties. Golden Corridor estimates that it will require approximately US$200,000 to engage the necessary technical experts (including a property development consultant, architect, and civil and electrical engineers) to draw up a comprehensive property development plan. It hopes to raise such funds through loans from its executive officers, directors or shareholders or financial institutions. In the event that Golden Corridor fails to raise the funds required within the next 12 months, it may apply to the land authority in Phnom Penh to subdivide the Properties into smaller parcels and sell such parcels to small and medium sized enterprises and individuals to build their factories, shops and low and medium cost houses in accordance to the current laws in the Kingdom of Cambodia. Golden Corridor hopes to complete such development within the next two or three years, subject to the final approval from the local government.

&#160;

There can be no assurance that Golden Corridor or the Company will ever obtain such funds required to commence property development. Accordingly, our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses, and difficulties frequently encountered in establishing a new property development business, and therefore, our investment in Golden Corridor is a highly speculative venture involving significant financial risk.

&#160;

Market Information 

&#160;

According to an April 2014 report by CB Richard Ellis (Cambodia) Co. Ltd., an affiliate of CBRE Group, Inc., the industrial market in Cambodia remained stable with continued foreign direct investment in manufacturing. It was reported that the inflation rate of Cambodia was 2.9% for the year 2014 which was relatively low as compared to other countries in the Southeast Asian region. It also reported the following trends: the minimum wages for manufacturing sector are comparatively low; Cambodia&#8217;s industrial output grew by 9.5% over the course 2013, the 17th highest industrial growth rate globally and above wider Cambodian GPD of 7.3%; the minimum wage for manufacturing industry workers that were introduced in 2014 appeared not to have significantly diminished demand for industrial space in the short-term; and the rents in industrial zones were generally stable as a continuation of trends seen in 2013, with a rental rate of US$2.50 per square meter per month for prime locations in industrial zones and US$2.0 per square meter per month in lower quality industrial zones, where units are of a lesser standard. It is believed that there remains a distinct lack in the supply of light industrial buildings as occupancy levels in existing industrial zones remain high.

Near-Term Requirements For Additional Capital 

&#160;

For the immediate future, we intend to finance our real estate development efforts and any future real estate acquisitions through sales of our securities to existing shareholders and loans from existing shareholders or financial institutions.

&#160;

We intend to focus on our near-term goal of developing our Properties and any other properties slated for acquisition through prudent use of available resources and our long-term goal of maximizing the value of our development projects. We believe that Kampong Speu, Cambodia is a desirable market and we intend to continue exploring acquisitions in the region. We believe that our developments will have inherent value given their unique nature and location and that this value should be sustainable in the future.

&#160;

Golden Corridor is subject to all of the risks inherent in a property development company, including the fall in value of the Properties. It has never generated revenues. We expect Golden Corridor to incur relatively small operating losses over the next twelve months until we begin property development activities. There can be no assurance that that we will ever be successful in our new real estate development business.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The real estate development business is highly competitive and fragmented. We compete against numerous public and private developers of varying sizes, ranging from local to national in scope. As a result, we may be competing for investment opportunities, financing, and potential buyers with entities that may possess greater financial, marketing, or other resources than we have. Competition for potential buyers has been intensified by an increase in the number of available properties resulting from the recent boom in the real estate market. Our prospective customers generally have a variety of choices of new and existing homes, commercial buildings, home and commercial sites when considering a purchase. We attempt to differentiate our properties primarily on the basis of community design, location, price, quality, uniqueness, and amenities. 

&#160;

The real estate investment industry is highly fragmented among individuals, partnerships and public and private entities, with no dominant single entity or person. Although we may compete against large sophisticated owners and operators, owners and operators of any size can provide effective competition for prospective tenants. We compete for tenants primarily on the basis of property location, rent charged, and the design and condition of improvements.

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We expect to rely on, trade secrets, copyrights, know-how, trademarks, license agreements and contractual provisions to establish our intellectual property rights and protect our brand and services. These legal means, however, afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention.

&#160;

In addition, the laws of Cambodia may not protect our brand and services and intellectual property to the same extent as U.S. laws, if at all. We may be unable to fully protect our intellectual property rights in these countries.

&#160;

We intend to seek the widest possible protection for significant product and process developments in our major markets through a combination of trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights and patents, if applicable. We anticipate that the form of protection will vary depending upon the level of protection afforded by the particular jurisdiction. We expect that our revenue will be derived principally from our operations in Cambodia where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce. In such instances, we may seek protection of our intellectual property through measures taken to increase the confidentiality of our findings. 

&#160;

We intend to register trademarks as a means of protecting the brand names of our companies and products. We intend protect our trademarks against infringement and also seek to register design protection where appropriate.

&#160;

We rely on trade secrets and unpatentable know-how that we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements. We expect that, where applicable, we will require our employees to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment with us. We expect these agreements to provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual&#8217;s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific limited circumstances. The agreements will also provide that all inventions conceived by the individual while rendering services to us shall be assigned to us as the exclusive property of our company. There can be no assurance, however, that all persons who we desire to sign such agreements will sign, or if they do, that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets or unpatentable know-how will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors.

&#160;

Government Regulation and Environmental Matters 

&#160; 

Our real estate investments are subject to extensive local, city, county and state rules and regulations regarding permitting, zoning, subdivision, utilities and water quality as well as federal rules and regulations relating to the environment and wildlife such as air and water quality and protection of endangered species and their habitats. Such regulation may delay development of our properties and result in higher than anticipated developmental and administrative costs. Based on an analysis of our operations in relation to current and presently anticipated environmental requirements, we currently do not anticipate that these costs will have a material adverse effect on our future operations or financial condition.

&#160;

According to a July 2014 report by CB Richard Ellis (Cambodia) Co. Ltd., land titles in Cambodia are represented in two forms: soft and hard title. Soft title refers to a title where a property is registered at the local municipal level but which cannot be used as collateral for bank loans while hard title refers to a title issued at the national government level which can be used as collateral for bank loans. Hard title is the most secure form of ownership. However, the majority of transactions still occur for land with soft title to avoid high transaction costs which include property registration taxes and ownership transfer fees. Private freehold ownership is permissible for all types of land but the full ownership is restricted to Cambodian citizens or companies with the majority of shares being owned by Cambodian citizens. Foreign investors may acquire freehold land only through a land holding company, 51% of which is controlled by a Cambodian citizen or company. Foreign investors can also use land in Cambodia under a long-term lease. The maximum lease term is restricted to 50 years determined by the civil code established in December 2011. The lease structure system allows foreign investors to lease property if the property is properly registered with a land title certificate. Property tax is levied on all property worth over 100 million Riel in Cambodia. This report also described the government&#8217;s taxes on the sale, transfer and ownership of land and properties in Cambodia. According to the report, tax is payable annually by the owner of the property at a rate of 0.1% of the government assessed value; Unused Land Tax is payable for all unused land, calculated at a rate of 2% of the market value of the land per square meter as determined by the Unused Land Valuation Commission of the Ministry of Economy and Finance, on an annually basis; and Property Transfer Tax is levied on a sale of land with Hard Title, at 4% of the assessed property value determined by the tax department, by the purchaser.

&#160;

Seasonality 

&#160;

Our real estate business is not subject to seasonality.

&#160;

Insurance 

&#160; 

Neither we nor Golden Corridor currently maintain property, business interruption and casualty insurance. Golden Corridor intends to obtain such insurance in accordance with customary industry practices.

&#160;

Employees &#160;

&#160;

We currently do not have any full time or part time employees. Our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Secretary, Lim Yew Chuan, is expected to carry out all administrative functions. Once Golden Corridor begins development activities, we expect Golden Corridor to hire additional officers and employees for such operations.

&#160;

We do not have any union employees. &#160;
