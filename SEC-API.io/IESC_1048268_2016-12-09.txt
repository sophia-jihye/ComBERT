 Item 1. Business OVERVIEW OF OUR SERVICES 

IES Holdings, Inc. is a holding company that owns and manages diverse operating subsidiaries across a variety of infrastructure-related end markets. Our operations are currently organized into four principal business segments, based upon the nature of our current services: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Communications &#160;&#151; Nationwide provider of technology infrastructure services to large corporations and independent businesses. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Residential &#160;&#151; Regional provider of electrical installation services for single-family housing and multi-family apartment complexes. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Commercial &#38; Industrial &#160;&#151; Provider of electrical and mechanical design, construction, and maintenance services to the commercial and industrial markets in various regional markets and nationwide in certain areas of expertise, such as the power infrastructure market. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Infrastructure Solutions &#160;&#151; Provider of electro-mechanical solutions for industrial operations. Our businesses are managed in a decentralized manner. While sharing common goals and values, each of the Company&#146;s segments manages its own day-to-day operations. Our corporate office is focused on significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and selection of segment leadership, as well as strategic and operational improvement initiatives and the establishment and monitoring of risk management practices within our segments. 

IES Holdings, Inc. is a Delaware corporation established in 1997 and headquartered in Houston, Texas, with an executive office in Greenwich, Connecticut. In May 2016, we amended our charter to change our name from Integrated Electrical Services, Inc. to IES Holdings, Inc. to better reflect our holding company strategy. 

CORPORATE STRATEGY 

We seek to create shareholder value through improving operating margins and generating free cash flow by investing in our existing businesses and completing acquisitions. We seek to acquire or invest in stand-alone platform companies based in North America or acquire businesses that strategically complement our existing business segments. In evaluating potential acquisition candidates, we seek to invest in businesses with, among other characteristics: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Proven management with a willingness to continue post-acquisition; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Low technological and/or product obsolescence risk; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Established market position and sustainable competitive advantages; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Strong cash flow characteristics. &#160;

We believe that acquisitions provide an opportunity to expand into new end markets and diversify our revenue and profit streams, which we expect will allow us to maximize the value of our significant net operating loss tax carry forwards (&#147;NOLs&#148;). While we may use acquisitions to build our presence in the industries we serve, we will also consider potential acquisitions in other industries, which could result in changes in our operations from those historically conducted by us.

Recent Transactions 

In fiscal 2016, we acquired four businesses for aggregate consideration of $59.5 million and disposed of one non-core operation, as described below: 

Acquisitions: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Calumet Armature &#38; Electric, LLC (&#147;Calumet&#148;), an Illinois-based provider of design, manufacturing, assembly, and repair services of electric motors for the industrial and mass transit markets, was acquired in October 2015 in our Infrastructure Solutions segment. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Shanahan Mechanical and Electrical, Inc. (&#147;Shanahan&#148;), a Nebraska-based provider of mechanical and electrical contracting services, was acquired in November 2015 in our Commercial &#38; Industrial segment. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; An 80% interest in STR Mechanical, LLC (&#147;STR&#148;), a Charlotte, North Carolina-based provider of commercial and industrial mechanical services, including maintenance, repair, and replacement services, and temperature control system installations, was acquired in April 2016 in our Commercial &#38; Industrial segment. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Technibus Inc. (&#147;Technibus&#148;), a Canton, Ohio based provider of custom-engineered, metal-enclosed bus duct solutions for use in power distribution was acquired in June 2016 in our Infrastructure Solutions segment. Dispositions: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; In April 2016, we sold substantially all of the operating assets of HK Engine Components, LLC (&#147;HKEC&#148;), a non-core operation of our Infrastructure Solutions business that was based in Hagerstown, Maryland and manufactured and remanufactured EMD-style power assemblies for various engine types used in the railroad and marine markets. We completed one acquisition in fiscal 2015: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Southern Industrial Sales and Services, Inc. (&#147;Southern Rewinding&#148;), a Columbus, Georgia-based motor repair and related field services company was acquired in May 2015 in our Infrastructure Solutions segment. For more information on these transactions, please see Note 18, &#147;Business Combinations and Divestitures&#148; in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Controlling Shareholder 

A majority of our outstanding common stock is owned by Tontine Associates, L.L.C. and its affiliates (collectively, &#147;Tontine&#148;). On October 5, 2016, Tontine filed an amended Schedule 13D indicating its ownership level of approximately 58%. As a result, Tontine can control most of our affairs, including most actions requiring the approval of shareholders, such as the approval of any potential merger or sale of all or substantially all assets, segments, or the Company itself. Most of Tontine&#146;s shares are registered on a shelf registration statement (the &#147;Shelf Registration Statement&#148;) filed by the Company and declared effective in 2013 by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;SEC&#148;). Tontine&#146;s sale of all or any portion of its shares could result in a change of 

&#160;

control, which would trigger the change of control provisions in a number of our material agreements, including our credit facility, bonding agreements with our sureties and our executive severance plan. For more information see Note 3, &#147;Controlling Shareholder&#148; in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Net Operating Loss Tax Carry Forward 

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have an estimated federal NOL of approximately $404.0 million at September 30, 2016, including approximately $142.0 million resulting from the additional amortization of personal goodwill.

In past periods, we had recorded a significant valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. In order for the Company to release this valuation allowance, a substantial amount of positive evidence regarding current and future earnings is required to outweigh the significant negative evidence associated with historical losses. We have reassessed the need for a valuation allowance at year end fiscal 2016, and due to our significant increase in 2016 earnings over prior years, and four acquisitions completed in fiscal 2016, combined with the previous closure of underperforming branches which generated significant historical losses, we concluded, based on information currently available, that the more recent positive evidence now outweighs the historical negative evidence regarding current and future earnings. Therefore, we believe it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to utilize $93.5 of deferred tax assets, including $0.5 million of which were not reserved with a valuation allowance at the beginning of the year. As a result of this conclusion, we recognized an income tax benefit of $109.0 million in the year ended September 30, 2016. This benefit includes $16.0 million related to the release of a portion of the valuation allowance in connection with current year earnings and 2016 purchase accounting transactions, as well as $93.0 million for the release of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets expected to be utilized in future years. However, this valuation allowance release has no impact on the amount of cash paid for income taxes. An inability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize our deferred tax assets may lead to recording of additional valuation allowances in future periods and a reduction in GAAP net income. Further, any future reduction in the federal statutory tax rate could also cause a reduction in the economic benefit of the NOL available to us, and a corresponding charge to reduce the book value of the deferred tax asset recorded on our balance sheet. 

A change in ownership, as defined by Internal Revenue Code Section 382, could reduce the availability of NOLs for federal and state income tax purposes. Should Tontine sell or otherwise dispose of all or a portion of its position in IES, a change in ownership could occur. In addition, a change in ownership could result from the purchase of common stock by an existing or a new 5% shareholder as defined by Internal Revenue Code Section 382. Should a change in ownership occur, all net operating losses incurred prior to the change in ownership would be subject to limitation imposed by Internal Revenue Code Section 382, which would substantially reduce the amount of NOL currently available to offset taxable income. For more information see Note 3, &#147; Controlling Shareholder &#148; in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

On November 8, 2016, the Company implemented a new tax benefit protection plan (the &#147;NOL Rights Plan&#148;), following the expiration of the Company&#146;s prior tax benefit protection plan, which was implemented in January 2013. Like the prior plan, the NOL Rights Plan was designed to deter an acquisition of the Company&#146;s stock in excess of a threshold amount that could trigger a change of control within the meaning of Internal Revenue Code Section 382. For more information see Note 20, &#147; Subsequent Events &#148; in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160;

OPERATING SEGMENTS 

The Company&#146;s reportable segments consist of the consolidated business segments identified above, which offer different services and are managed separately. The table below describes the percentage of our total revenues attributable to each of our four segments over each of the last three years:

Communications 

Business Description 

Originally established in 1984, our Communications segment is a leading provider of network infrastructure services for data centers and other mission critical environments. Services offered include the design, installation and maintenance of network infrastructure for the financial, medical, hospitality, government, high-tech manufacturing, educational and information technology industries including for Fortune 500 corporations. We also provide the design and installation of audio/visual, telephone, fire, wireless access and intrusion alarm systems as well as design/build, service and maintenance of data network systems. We perform services across the United States from our 13 offices, including our Communications headquarters located in Tempe, Arizona, allowing dedicated onsite maintenance teams at our customers&#146; sites. 

Industry Overview 

Our Communications segment is driven by demand increases for computing and storage resources as a result of technology advancements and obsolescence and changes in data consumption patterns. The data center market remains strong, and we are continuing to expand our offerings in this market to broaden our customer base. Additionally, demand has been growing for our audio-visual and other building technology offerings. Nevertheless, due to economic, technological and other factors, there can be no assurance that demand will continue to increase. 

Sales and Marketing 

Our sales strategy relies on a concentrated business development effort, with centralized marketing programs and direct end-customer communications and relationships. Due to the mission critical nature of the facilities we service, our end-customers significantly rely upon our past performance record, technical expertise and specialized knowledge. A significant portion of our Communications business volume is generated from long-term, repeat customers, some of whom use IES as a preferred provider for major projects. 

Our long-term strategy is to improve our position as a preferred mission critical solutions and services provider to large national corporations and strategic local companies. Key elements of our long-term strategy include continued investment in our employees&#146; technical expertise and expansion of our onsite maintenance and recurring revenue model as well as opportunistic acquisitions of businesses that serve our markets, consistent with our stated corporate strategy. 

&#160;

Competition 

Our competition consists of both large public companies and small, privately owned contractors who have limited access to capital. We compete on quality of service and/or price and seek to emphasize our long history of delivering high quality solutions to our customers.

Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations 

The effects of seasonality on our Communications business are insignificant, as work generally is performed inside structures protected from the weather. Our service and maintenance business is also generally not affected by seasonality. However, communications infrastructure spending has historically been highly cyclical. Our volume of business may be adversely affected by declines in projects resulting from adverse regional or national economic conditions. Quarterly results may also be materially affected by the timing of new construction projects. Accordingly, operating results for any fiscal period are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for any subsequent fiscal period. 

Residential 

Business Description 

Originally established in 1973, our Residential segment is a leading provider of electrical installation services for single-family housing and multi-family apartment complexes and cable television installations for residential and light commercial applications. In addition to our core electrical construction work, the Residential segment also provides services for the installation of residential solar power, both for new construction and existing residences. The Residential segment is made up of 32 total locations, which include the segment headquarters in Houston, Texas. These locations geographically cover the Sun-Belt, Western and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States.

Industry Overview 

Our Residential business is closely correlated to the single and multi-family housing market. Demand for both single-family and multi-family housing has increased in recent years. Nevertheless, due to economic, technological or other factors there can be no assurance that construction and demand will continue to increase in the future. 

Sales and Marketing 

Demand for our Residential services is highly dependent on the number of single-family and multi-family home starts in the markets we serve. Although we operate in multiple states throughout the Sun-Belt, Mid-Atlantic and Western regions of the United States, the majority of our segment revenues are derived from services provided in the state of Texas. Our sales efforts include a variety of strategies, including a concentrated focus on national homebuilders and multi-family developers and a local sales strategy for single and multi-family housing projects. Our cable and solar revenues are typically generated through third parties specializing in these industries who select us as a preferred provider of installation services. A significant portion of our Residential business volume is generated from long-term, repeat customers, some of whom use IES as a preferred provider for major projects. 

Our long-term strategy is to continue to be a leading provider of electrical services to the residential market. The key elements of our long-term strategy include a continued focus on maintaining a low and variable cost structure and cash generation which has allowed us to effectively scale according to the housing cycle. During the housing downturn, we modified our strategy by expanding into markets less exposed to national building cycles, such as solar panel and cable installation services. 

&#160;

Competition 

Our competition primarily consists of small, privately owned contractors who have limited access to capital. We believe that we have a competitive advantage over these smaller competitors due to our key employees&#146; long-standing customer relationships, our financial capabilities, and our local market knowledge and competitive pricing. There are few barriers to entry for electrical contracting services in the residential markets.

Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations 

Results of operations from our Residential segment can be seasonal, depending on weather trends, with typically higher revenues generated during spring and summer and lower revenues during fall and winter. Our service and maintenance business is generally not affected by seasonality. In addition, the construction industry has historically been highly cyclical. Our volume of business may be adversely affected by declines in construction projects resulting from adverse regional or national economic conditions. Quarterly results may also be materially affected by the timing of new construction projects. Accordingly, operating results for any fiscal period are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for any subsequent fiscal period. 

Commercial &#38; Industrial 

Business Description 

Our Commercial &#38; Industrial segment offers a broad range of expertise that enables us to provide a wide array of quality services related to electrical and mechanical design, construction, and maintenance to the commercial and industrial markets. The offerings under our electrical design services platform range from budget assistance to providing design build and LEED (Leadership in Energy &#38; Environmental Design) solutions to our end customers. Our electrical and mechanical construction services range from the initial planning and procurement to installation and start-up and are offered to a variety of new and remodel construction projects, ranging from the construction of office buildings and industrial facilities to transmission and distribution projects. The electrical and mechanical maintenance services offered include critical plant shutdown, troubleshooting, emergency testing, preventative maintenance, and constant presence.

During fiscal 2016, we expanded our geographic and service offerings with the November 2015 acquisition of Shanahan and added mechanical service offerings with the April 2016 acquisition of STR. 

This segment provides services for a variety of project types, including: office buildings, manufacturing facilities, data centers, chemical plants, refineries, wind farms, solar facilities and municipal infrastructure and health care facilities. The Commercial &#38; Industrial segment consists of 20 locations, which include the segment headquarters in Houston, Texas. These locations geographically cover Texas, Nebraska, Colorado, Oregon, and the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. 

Industry Overview 

Given the diverse end markets of our Commercial &#38; Industrial customers, which include both commercial buildings, such as offices, healthcare facilities and schools, and industrial projects, such as power, chemical, refinery and heavy manufacturing facilities, we are subject to many trends within the construction industry. In general, demand for our Commercial &#38; Industrial services is driven by construction and renovation activity levels, economic growth, and availability of bank lending. Due to economic, technological or other factors, there can be no assurance that construction and demand will increase.

Sales and Marketing 

Our sales focus varies by location, but is primarily based upon regional and local relationships and a demonstrated expertise in certain industries, such as transmission and distribution. Our maintenance and certain 

&#160;

renovation and upgrade work tend to be either recurring or experience lower sensitivity to economic cycles, or both. A significant portion of our larger projects are awarded from long-term, repeat customers. From time to time, we are contracted on projects with completion times extending beyond one year or over several years, which are generally more complex and difficult to estimate. 

With a focus on quality service offerings, our long-term strategy is to continue to be one of the preferred providers of electrical and mechanical services in the markets where we have demonstrated expertise and/or are a local market leader. Key elements of our long-term strategy include leveraging our expertise in certain niche markets, expanding our service and maintenance business and maintaining our focus on returns on risk adjusted capital. 

Competition 

The electrical and mechanical contracting services industry is generally highly competitive and includes a number of regional or small privately-held local firms. There are few barriers to entry for our electrical and mechanical contracting services in the commercial and industrial markets, which limits our advantages when competing for projects. Industry expertise, project size, location and past performance will determine our bidding strategy, the level of involvement from competitors and our level of success in winning awards. Our primary advantages vary by location and market, but mostly are based upon local individual relationships with key customers or a demonstrated industry expertise. Additionally, due to the size of many of our projects, our financial resources help us compete effectively against local competitors. 

Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations 

The effects of seasonality on our Commercial &#38; Industrial business are insignificant, as work generally is performed inside structures protected from the weather. Most of our service and maintenance business is also generally not affected by seasonality. However, the construction industry has historically been highly cyclical. Our volume of business may be adversely affected by declines in construction projects resulting from adverse regional or national economic conditions. Quarterly results may also be materially affected by the timing of new construction projects. Accordingly, operating results for any fiscal period are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for any subsequent fiscal period. 

Infrastructure Solutions 

Business Description 

Our Infrastructure Solutions segment provides electro-mechanical solutions for industrial operations to domestic and international customers. In particular, our electro-mechanical services include the maintenance and repair of alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) electric motors and generators, as well as power generating and distribution equipment; the manufacture, remanufacture, and repair of industrial lifting magnets; maintenance and repair of railroad main and auxiliary generators, main alternators, and traction motors; and the manufacture of electro mechanical components used in power distribution. 

This segment serves the steel, railroad, marine, petrochemical, pulp and paper, wind energy, mining, automotive, power generation, scrap yards, and utility industries. Our Infrastructure Solutions segment is comprised of 10 locations and is headquartered in Ohio. These segment locations geographically cover Alabama, Georgia, Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, West Virginia, and California. 

We further enhanced our geographic and service offering through the October 2015 acquisition of Calumet, an Illinois-based provider of design, manufacturing, assembly, and repair services of electric motors for the industrial and mass transit markets, which operates as a subsidiary in this segment. Additionally, through the acquisition of Technibus in June 2016, we expanded our solutions capabilities to include custom-engineered, 

&#160;

metal enclosed bus duct solutions, which are highly engineered electrical components that conduct electricity between medium-voltage generators, breakers, transformers, and switchgear, primarily utilized at power generation plants and large electricity-consuming facilities. 

Industry Overview 

Given the diverse end-markets of Infrastructure Solutions&#146; customers, we are subject to many economic trends. In general, demand for our services has been driven by in-house maintenance departments continuing to outsource maintenance and repair work, output levels and equipment utilization at heavy industrial facilities, railroad companies&#146; and mass transit authorities&#146; capital investments and repair needs, investment in the United States&#146; aging energy and industrial infrastructure, and the overall health of the economy. 

Sales and Marketing 

Demand for Infrastructure Solutions&#146; services is largely driven by the degree to which industrial and mechanical services are outsourced by our customers, production rates at steel mills, investments in power generation and other heavy industrial facilities, and the need for electrical infrastructure improvements. Our sales efforts are primarily driven by personnel based at our 10 locations and independent sales representatives. Given that the majority of our apparatus repair customers are located within a 200-mile radius of our facilities, we believe that this structure allows us to rapidly address and respond to the needs of our customers. Our custom-engineered bus system products and services are principally sold in partnership with an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) or to an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) firm on behalf of the end-user. Our long term strategy is to be the preferred solutions provider of outsourced electro-mechanical services, repairs, and manufacturing to our select markets and a leader in custom-engineered metal enclosed bus systems. 

Competition 

Our competition is comprised mainly of small, specialized manufacturing and repair shops, a limited number of other multi-location providers of electric motor repair, engineering and maintenance services, and various OEMs. Participants in this industry compete primarily on the basis of capabilities, service, quality, timeliness and price. We believe that we have a competitive advantage due to our breadth of capabilities, focus on quality, technical support and customer service.

Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations 

Infrastructure Solutions&#146; revenues from industrial services may be affected by the timing of scheduled outages at its industrial customers&#146; facilities and by weather conditions with respect to projects conducted outdoors, but the effects of seasonality on revenues in its industrial services business are insignificant. Infrastructure Solutions&#146; quarterly results may fluctuate, and the results of one fiscal quarter may not be representative of the results of any other quarter or of the full fiscal year. 

SOURCES OF SUPPLY 

The raw materials and components we use within our segments include, but are not limited to, electrical fixtures and system components, copper, aluminum, and raw steel. These raw materials and components are generally available from a variety of domestic suppliers at competitive prices. Delivery times are typically short for most raw materials and standard components, but during periods of peak demand, may extend to one month or more. Our strategy to reduce commodity cost exposure includes early buying of commodities for particular projects, or for general inventory, as well as including escalation and escape provisions in project bids, quotes and contracts wherever possible. 

&#160;

RISK MANAGEMENT 

The primary risks in our existing operations include project bidding and management, bodily injury, property and environmental damage, and construction defects. We monitor project bidding and management practices at various levels within the Company. We maintain automobile, general liability and construction defect insurance for third party health, bodily injury and property damage, as well as pollution coverage and workers&#146; compensation coverage, which we consider appropriate to insure against these risks. Our third-party insurance is subject to deductibles for which we establish reserves. In light of these risks, we are also committed to a strong safety and environmental compliance culture. We employ full-time and part-time regional safety managers, under the supervision of our full-time Vice President of Safety, and seek to maintain standardized safety and environmental policies, programs, procedures and personal protection equipment relative to each segment, including programs to train new employees, which apply to employees new to the industry and those new to the Company.

In the electrical contracting industry, our ability to post surety bonds provides us with an advantage over competitors that are smaller or have fewer financial resources. We believe that the strength of our balance sheet, as well as a good relationship with our bonding providers, enhances our ability to obtain adequate financing and surety bonds, although there can be no assurance that surety bonding coverage will be available when we need it. For a further discussion of our risks, please refer to Item 1A. &#147;Risk Factors&#148; of this Form 10-K. 

CUSTOMERS 

We have a diverse customer base. During the twelve-month periods ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues. We emphasize developing and maintaining relationships with our customers by providing superior, high-quality service. Management at each of our segments is responsible for determining sales strategies and sales activities. 

BACKLOG 

Backlog is a measure of revenue that we expect to recognize from work that has yet to be performed on uncompleted contracts, and from work that has been contracted but has not started, exclusive of short-term projects. The increase in our Infrastructure Solutions segment&#146;s backlog as of September 30, 2016 is primarily attributable to the acquisition of Technibus. Not all of our work is performed under contracts included in backlog; for example, most of the apparatus repair work that is completed by our Infrastructure Solutions segment is performed under master service agreements on an as-needed basis. Additionally, electrical installation services for single-family housing in our Residential segment is completed on a short-term basis and is therefore excluded from backlog. The table below summarizes our backlog by segment: 

&#160;

&#160; &#160; Years Ended September 30, &#160; &#160; &#160; 2016 &#160; &#160; 2015 &#160; &#160; &#160; (Dollars in millions) &#160; Communications

&#160;

&#160; While all of our backlog is supported by documentation from customers authorizing the performance of future work, backlog is not a guarantee of future revenues, as contractual commitments may change. We expect that 

&#160;

$305 million of our September 30, 2016 backlog will result in revenue during fiscal 2017, with the remaining $36 million expected to be realized in fiscal 2018; however there can be no assurance that this backlog will be completed within expected time frames or at all. 

REGULATIONS 

Our operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations, including: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; licensing requirements applicable to electricians and service technicians; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; building and electrical codes; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; regulations relating to worker safety, labor relations and protection of the environment; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; regulations relating to consumer protection, including those governing residential service agreements; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; qualifications of our business legal structure in the jurisdictions where we do business. Many state and local regulations governing electricians require permits and licenses to be held by individuals. In some cases, a required permit or license held by a single individual may be sufficient to authorize specified activities for all our electricians who work in the state or county that issued the permit or license. It is our policy to ensure that, where possible, any permits or licenses that may be material to our operations in a particular geographic area are held by multiple employees within that area. 

We believe we have all licenses required to conduct our operations and are in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating licenses or an inability to perform government work.
