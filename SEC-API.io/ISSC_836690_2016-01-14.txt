 Item 1. Business 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

Innovative Solutions and Support, Inc. (the &#147;Company,&#148; or &#147;IS&#38;S&#148;) was incorporated in Pennsylvania on February 12, 1988. The Company operates in one business segment as a systems integrator that designs, develops, manufactures, sells, and services air data equipment, engine display systems, standby equipment, primary flight guidance and cockpit display systems for retrofit applications and original equipment manufacturers (&#147;OEMs&#148;). The Company supplies integrated Flight Management Systems (&#147;FMS&#148;), Flat Panel Display Systems (&#147;FPDS&#148;), Integrated Standby Units (&#147;ISU&#148;) and advanced Global Positioning System (&#147;GPS&#148;) receivers that enable reduced carbon footprint navigation. 

&#160; 

The Company has continued to position itself as a system integrator, which capability provides the Company with the potential to generate more substantive orders over a broader product base. The strategy, as both a manufacturer and integrator, is designed to leverage the latest technologies developed for the computer and telecommunications industries into advanced and cost-effective solutions for the general aviation, commercial air transport, United States Department of Defense (&#147;DoD&#148;)/governmental, and foreign military markets. This approach, combined with the Company&#146;s industry experience, is designed to enable IS&#38;S to develop high-quality products and systems, to reduce product time to market, and to achieve cost advantages over products offered by its competitors. 

&#160; 

For several years the Company has been working with advances in technology to provide pilots with more information to enhance both the safety and efficiency of flying, and has developed its COCKPIT/IP&#174; Cockpit Information Portal (&#147;CIP&#148;) product line, that incorporates proprietary technology, low cost, reduced power consumption, decreased weight, and increased functionality. The Company believes the CIP product line is suited to address market demand that will be driven by regulatory mandates, new technologies, and the high cost of maintaining aging/obsolete equipment on airplanes that have been in service for up to fifty years. The Company has incorporated Electronic Flight Bag (&#147;EFB&#148;) functionality, such as charting and mapping systems, into its FPDS product line. 

&#160; 

More recently, the Company has developed an FMS that combines the savings long associated with in flight fuel optimization in enroute flight management combined with the precision of satellite-based navigation required to comply with the regulatory environments of both domestic and international markets. The Company believes that the FMS coupled with its FPDS product line is well suited to address market demand driven by certain regulatory mandates, new technologies, and the high cost of maintaining aging and obsolete equipment on aircraft that will be in service for up to fifty years. The shift in the regulatory and technological environment is illustrated by the dramatic increase in the number of Space Based Augmentation System (&#147;SBAS&#148;) or Wide Area Augmentation System (&#147;WAAS&#148;) approach qualified airports, particularly as realized through Localizer Performance with Vertical guidance (&#147;LPV&#148;) navigation procedures. Aircraft equipped with the Company&#146;s FMS and FPDS product line (equipped with a SBAS/WAAS/LPV enabled navigator) will be qualified to land at such airports and to comply with upcoming Federal Aviation Administration (&#147;FAA&#148;) mandates for Required Navigation Performance (&#147;RNP&#148;), and Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (&#147;ADS-B&#148;) navigation, a fact which IS&#38;S believes will further increase the demand for the Company&#146;s products. The Company&#146;s FMS/FPDS product line is designed for new production and retrofit applications into general aviation, commercial air transport and military transport aircraft. In addition, the Company offers a state of the art ISU, integrating the full functionality of the primary and navigation displays into a small backup-powered unit. This ISU builds on the Company&#146;s legacy air data computer to form a complete next-generation cockpit display and navigation upgrade offering to the commercial and military markets. 

&#160; 

IS&#38;S sells to both the OEM and the retrofit markets. Customers include various OEMs, commercial air transport carriers and corporate/general aviation companies, DoD and its commercial contractors, aircraft operators, aircraft modification centers, and foreign militaries. Occasionally, IS&#38;S sells its products directly to DoD; however, the Company sells its products primarily to commercial customers for end use in DoD programs. Sales to defense contractors are generally made on commercial terms, although some of the termination and other provisions of government contracts are applicable to these contracts. 

&#160; 

Customers have been and may continue to be affected by the economic conditions in the United States and abroad. Such conditions may cause customers to curtail or delay their spending on both new and existing aircraft. Factors that can impact general economic conditions and the level of spending by customers include, but are not limited to, general levels of consumer spending, increases in fuel and energy costs, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, labor and healthcare costs, access to credit, consumer confidence, and other macroeconomic factors that affect spending behavior. In addition, the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the &#147;Budget Act&#148;) triggered substantial, automatic reductions in both defense and discretionary spending. The automatic across-the-board sequestration cuts are in addition to certain other reductions already reflected in defense funding. Furthermore, spending by government agencies may be reduced in the future if tax revenues decline. If customers curtail or delay their spending or are forced to declare bankruptcy or liquidate their operations because of adverse economic conditions, the Company&#146;s revenues and results of operations would be affected adversely. However, the Company believes that, in an uncertain economic environment, customers that 

&#160; 

&#160; 

may have otherwise elected to purchase newly manufactured aircraft may be interested instead in retrofitting existing aircraft as a cost-effective alternative, thereby creating market opportunity for IS&#38;S. 

&#160; 

In March 2015 and July 2015, respectively, the FAA issued its Technical Standard Order authorization (&#147;TSO&#148;) and Supplemental Type Certificate (&#147;STC&#148;) for the Company&#146;s B757 Integrated Standby Unit to be used on B757 aircraft in the United States. In August 2015, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) issued an STC on this system to be used on B757 aircraft in the European Community. 

&#160; 

In December 2014, the FAA issued its TSO and STC to IS&#38;S for a high definition Intergrated Flat Panel Display System for use on Pilatus PC-12 type aircraft in the United States. 

&#160; 

In November 2014, the FAA issued its Technical Standard Order authorization (&#147;TSO&#148;) and Supplemental Type Certificate (&#147;STC&#148;) to IS&#38;S for its Flight Management System for use on the B737 Classic aircraft which enabled IS&#38;S to expand its product offering to owners of the B737 in the United States. 

&#160; 

In October 2014, Delta Airlines, Inc. (&#147;Delta&#148;) issued a cancellation notice to the Company purporting to terminate its contract with IS&#38;S. On February 25, 2015, the Company filed a complaint against Delta in the United States District for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for breach of contract, and the parties are presently engaged in fact discovery. (See Item 3. Legal Proceedings). 

&#160; 

In February 2014, the FAA issued an STC for the Company&#146;s Auto Throttle System and Standby Display Unit (&#147;SDU&#148;) which has been incorporated into its Integrated Flight Management System (&#147;IFMS&#174;&#148;). In September 2013, the FAA issued a TSO to IS&#38;S for its SDU, which enabled IS&#38;S to offer the SDU to owners of various aircraft types in the United States, subject to certification of minor technical modifications for use in specific aircraft. This certification led IS&#38;S to develop an ISU, which combines the Company&#146;s air data technology with the SDU as a standalone industry product. 

&#160; 

Industry 

&#160; 

A wide range of information is critical for proper and safe operation of aircraft. With advances in technology, new types of information to assist pilots are becoming available for display in cockpits, such as satellite-based weather, ground terrain maps, and ADS-B navigation. The Company believes that aircraft cockpits will become more complete information centers, capable of delivering additional information that is either mandated by regulation or demanded by pilots to assist in the safe and efficient operation of aircraft. 

&#160; 

The Company classifies flight data into four general types: aircraft heading and altitude information, flight critical aircraft control data, navigation data, and maintenance and aircraft health data. Aircraft heading and altitude information includes; aircraft speed, altitude, and rates of ascent and descent. Flight critical aircraft control information includes; engine data such as fuel and oil quantity, and other engine measurements. Navigation data includes; radio position, flight management, GPS, and alternative source information (i.e. information not originating on the aircraft, including weather depiction maps, GPS navigation, and surface terrain maps). Maintenance and aircraft health data includes on-board sensors and programs to measure parameters related to the health of a system on the aircraft. Air data calculations are based primarily on air pressure measurements derived from sensors on the aircraft. Engine data are determined by measuring various indices such as temperature, volume, revolutions per minute (&#147;RPM&#148;), and pressure within an aircraft&#146;s engines and other mechanical equipment. GPS and alternative source information are derived typically from satellites or equipment located on land and transmitted by satellite or radio signals to the aircraft. Maintenance and aircraft health data measure multiple parameters on various products and interface with various components to manage, measure, and report on the health, reliability and usability of a system. This information is displayed in the cockpit for reference, enhanced position awareness, and reduced support logistics on properly equipped aircraft. 

&#160; 

Traditionally, flight data and other cockpit information were displayed on a series of separate analog mechanical instruments. In the early 1980s, Cathode Ray Tubes (&#147;CRT&#148;) and digital displays using Liquid Crystal Displays (&#147;LCD&#148;) began to replace some individual analog instruments. Presently, the industry offers high resolution color flat panels using Active Matrix Liquid Crystal Displays (&#147;AMLCD&#148;) to replace traditional analog instruments, CRT or LCD displays. IS&#38;S expects that the ability to display more information in an efficient space and custom platform will become increasingly important if additional information, such as weather depiction maps, traffic information, surface terrain maps, datalink messaging, and surveillance displays, becomes mandated by regulation or demanded by pilots. Accordingly, the Company believes flat panel displays, which can integrate and display a &#147;suite&#148; of information, will replace individual instruments CRTs and LCDs on legacy aircraft. 

&#160; 

In the past, equipment data, such as engine and fuel-related information, were displayed on conventional analog mechanical instruments. Engine and fuel instruments provide information on engine activity, including oil and hydraulic pressures, and temperature. These instruments are clustered throughout an aircraft&#146;s cockpit. Engine and fuel instruments tend to be replaced more frequently than other instruments due to obsolescence and normal wear-and-tear. Aircraft operators continue to purchase individual conventional engine and fuel instruments as replacements, because the information that these instruments display is vital for safe and efficient flight. Increasingly, operators are replacing their clusters of analog mechanical instruments with integrated Engine Instrument Display Systems (&#147;EIDS&#148;) or a FPDS packages. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

As the skies and airports become more crowded, the aviation industry and its regulators are concentrating on new technologies, procedures, and regulations that allow more aircraft to operate in the skies and on the ground safely, efficiently, and with less impact on the environment. These new technologies and procedures, such as traffic avoidance, ground awareness, increased precision of navigation and vertical position, runway incursion prevention, and increased digital communication, will require innovation and intuitive methods to display situational awareness information for the pilots. The Company believes that flat panel displays provide the best solution to these requirements. 

&#160; 

Strategy 

&#160; 

The Company&#146;s objective is to become a leading supplier and integrator of cockpit information, and believes that its industry experience and reputation, technology and products, and business strategy provide the basis to achieve this objective. Key elements of the Company&#146;s strategy include: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Focusing on retrofits. Cockpit avionics upgrades for existing aircraft is of great interest in the present environment. The retrofit of an aircraft with the COCKPIT/IP &#174; &#160; FPDS, FMS, and ISU system components is cost effective compared to the acquisition of a new aircraft and can provide equivalent functionality to that of new aircraft.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Establishing leadership in the flat panel display market. IS&#38;S expects that many aircraft will be retrofitted with flat panel displays over the next several years. Given the versatility, visual appeal, and lower cost of displaying a series of instruments and other flight relevant information on a single flat panel, the Company believes that flat panel displays will increasingly replace individual analog and digital instruments, LCDs and CRTs. The Company believes that the COCKPIT/IP &#174; has significant benefits over competitive flat panel displays, including lower cost, larger size, reduced weight, enhanced viewing angles, and a broader array of functions. The Company&#146;s patented and proprietary Integrity Checking Processor and Zooming features provide increased situational awareness, reliability, performance, and utility to the owner/operator. Accordingly, the Company believes that these advantages will allow IS&#38;S to generate significant revenues from the COCKPIT/IP &#174; &#160; product, and to increase market share. In addition, demand for new aircraft, FAA mandates and obsolescence issues on older aircraft will contribute to this growth.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Continuing engineering and product development successes. IS&#38;S develops innovative products by combining its avionics, engineering, and design expertise with commercially available technologies, components, and products from non-aviation applications, including the personal computer and telecommunications industries. The Company&#146;s COCKPIT/IP &#174; &#160; system components present examples of its ability to engineer products through the selective application of non-avionic technology. In addition, as permitted by law, IS&#38;S applies for and registers its patents and trademarks for the technology and products it develops in the United States and various countries around the world to protect its intellectual property. Research and development (&#147;R&#38;D&#148;) expenses were $2.7 million, $2.6 million and $2.6 million for fiscal years ended September 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. During fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 revenues related to Engineering Development Contracts (&#147;EDC&#148;) accounted for 27%, 32% and 26%, respectively, of total sales. In support of these EDC programs, the Company charged $4.7 million, $15.5 million, and $8.3 million for fiscal years ended September 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively to cost of sales.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Maintaining leadership in air data markets. The Company believes that it is one of the largest suppliers of air data products to the U.S. retrofit market. The pressures on DoD procurement budget make the retrofit of aging military aircraft with newer, more advanced, and more supportable air data systems more attractive. In addition, higher performance engines in business aircraft are creating a need for more sophisticated air data products which the Company supplies.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Increasing sales to DoD, other government agencies, defense contractors, commercial air transport and corporate/general aviation markets. IS&#38;S has extended its efforts to diversify sales to include all aviation end user markets, especially legacy military programs and commercial air transport aircraft. In the commercial air transport market, the Company has addressed national carriers, regional carriers, and other fleet operators. The Company has targeted the corporate/general aviation market, both for retrofits and original equipment, and has ongoing retrofit programs and two OEM programs with Eclipse and Pilatus.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Expanding international presence. IS&#38;S plans to increase its international sales by adding sales and marketing personnel. The Company believes that European and other international aircraft operators and aircraft modification centers will retrofit legacy in-service aircraft with large flat panel displays. IS&#38;S obtained approval from the European Aviation Safety Agency (&#147;EASA&#148;) for installing the FPDS in Europe for the B757/B767 aircraft and expects to obtain EASA approvals for other European aircraft types.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Growing through acquisitions or joint ventures. IS&#38;S may pursue strategic acquisitions or joint ventures as a means to expand the business with enhanced technology, distribution, customer base, or products. The Company may seek to

&#160; 

&#160; 

acquire developers or suppliers of complementary products, technology, information, or to acquire suppliers of similar products to increase its product offerings and market share. 

&#160; 

Products 

&#160; 

Current lines of products include: 

&#160; 

Flat Panel Display Systems 

&#160; 

Flat panel displays are AMLCD screens that can replicate the display of one or a suite of analog or digital displays on one screen. Flat panel displays can replace existing displays in legacy aircraft. AMLCDs are used also for security monitoring on-board aircraft and as tactical workstations on military aircraft. The flat panel product line offers numerous advantages for presentation of engine performance data. During fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, revenues related to FPDS accounted for 98%, 88% and 88%, respectively, of total sales. 

&#160; 

The Company&#146;s FPDS can replace conventional analog and digital displays and can display additional information which is not commonly displayed in the cockpit with conventional analog and digital displays. The COCKPIT/IP &#174; &#160; is capable of displaying nearly all types of air data, engine and fuel data, altitude, heading and navigational data, maintenance and aircraft health data, and alternative source information. As technology and information delivery systems develop further, additional information will be displayed in the cockpit, such as surface terrain maps and data link messaging. IS&#38;S designed the COCKPIT/IP &#174; &#160; to be capable of displaying information from a variety of sources, including its Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (&#147;RVSM&#148;) air data system, engine and fuel instrumentation, and third-party data and information products.

&#160; 

From time to time, customers may order one or more FPDSs customized to their particular requirements. Typically, the Company charges for the added development cost. This revenue is reported as EDC on the consolidated statement of income. Engineering costs incurred in customizing the FPDSs are included in cost of sales. 

&#160; 

Flight Management Systems 

&#160; 

The IS&#38;S NextGen Flight Management System is an easily installed navigation and performance computer that complements the IS&#38;S Flat Panel Display System upgrade for commercial air transport aircraft. The FMS interfaces with the IS&#38;S SBAS GPS Global Positioning System (&#147;GPS&#148;) to provide a GPS based navigation solution. The GPS receiver is located remotely depending on space availability. To minimize use of cockpit space and ease installation efforts, the FMS is housed in an ARINC 739B compliant Multifunction and Control Display Unit (MCDU). 

&#160; 

Each FMS/MCDU has an LCD display, keyboard, mode and function keys, line select keys, annunciator lights, and supports ethernet data loading. The flight crew can manually or datalink waypoint flight plans, routes or user-defined waypoints on the IS&#38;S FMS and modify and update these plans via the FMS/MCDU screen. Once the flight plan data is entered, the MCDU computes the most economical flight profiles and provides steering commands for use by the aircraft control system to fly the airplane along the desired route. 

&#160; 

The FMS/MCDU package incorporates a robust navigation database capable of storing today&#146;s global database with ample growth for the future. Flight crews can utilize the data in the navigation database to create, edit and modify flight plans for display on the FPDS. The navigation data includes airways, jet routes, SIDS, STARS, and company stored routes. 

&#160; 

The FMS/MCDU is ARINC 739B compliant, which provides an interface option for other cockpit equipment such as SATCOM, ACARS, CMU, HUD, and a printer. The interface to the IS&#38;S FPDS is provided via Ethernet. The IS&#38;S EFB is integrated with the FMS/MCDU and FPDS where the control selection of the EFB features and applications are handled via the FMS/MCDU. The display is a five inch LCD with VGA resolution. The touchscreen display uses LED backlighting and is sunlight readable. 

&#160; 

Integrated Standby Unit 

&#160; 

The Company&#146;s new ISU incorporates the measurement and display of attitude, altitude, airspeed, and navigation data into a single standby/backup navigation instrument for military, commercial air transport and corporate/general aviation applications. The ISU has an optional battery module that allows operation of the unit under emergency conditions. The ISU has an integral Inertial Measurement Unit that includes accelerometer, gyro, and magnetometer triads. The unit also includes an integral air data measurement module for measurement of static and total pressure for display of altitude, airspeed, and mach number. 

&#160; 

The ISU is a highly reliable and accurate standby navigation system that is based on IS&#38;S&#146;s merger of COCKPIT/IP &#174; &#160; display technology and RVSM air data products coupled with the latest breakthroughs in MEMS Gyros with exceptional stability. An IS&#38;S proprietary algorithm provides for accurate computation of attitude, heading and air data parameters. The unit includes a triaxial magnetometer that is designed to be tolerant to the local soft iron effects.

&#160; 

&#160; 

The display uses a familiar Primary Flight Display format to reduce pilot workload. Logistics and maintenance savings are realized due to increased reliability and a reduction in LRUs. The unit is equipped with built-in test and display of navigational aid and maintenance data. 

&#160; 

Air Data Systems and Components 

&#160; 

The Company&#146;s air data products calculate and display various measures such as aircraft speed, altitude, and rate of ascent and descent. These air data products utilize advanced sensors to gather air pressure data and customized algorithms to interpret data, thus allowing the system to calculate altitude more accurately. During fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, sales of air data systems and components accounted for 2%, 12%, and 12%, respectively, of total revenues. 

&#160; 

IS&#38;S sells individual components and partial and complete air data systems. The components and systems include: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; digital air data computers, which calculate various air data parameters such as altitude, airspeed, vertical speed, angle of attack and other information derived from the measure of air pressure;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; integrated air data computers and display units, which calculate and convey air data information;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; altitude displays, which convey aircraft altitude measurements;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; airspeed displays, which convey various airspeed measurements including vertical airspeed and rates of ascent and descent; and

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; altitude alerters which allow pilots to select a desired cruising altitude and which provide warnings to pilots when an unacceptable deviation occurs.

&#160; 

Engine and Fuel Displays 

&#160; 

IS&#38;S develops, manufactures and markets engine and fuel displays. These solid-state multifunction displays convey information with respect to fuel and oil levels, and engine activity, such as oil and hydraulic pressure and temperature. They include individual and multiple displays installed throughout the cockpit. The displays can be used in conjunction with the Company&#146;s engine and fuel data equipment or that of other manufacturers. 

&#160; 

Engine and fuel displays are vital to safe flight. In addition, accurate conveyance of engine and fuel information is critical for monitoring engine stress and parts maintenance. Engine and fuel displays tend to be replaced more frequently than other displays, and have been slow to incorporate new technology since their introduction because of their low cost, standard design and universal use. 

&#160; 

IS&#38;S believes that its air data engine and fuel displays are extremely reliable, have been designed to be programmable, and are adaptable easily without major modification to most modern aircraft. These products have been installed on B727, B737, C-130H, DC-9, DC-10, P-3, F-16, and A-10 aircraft. 

&#160; 

Integrated Global Navigation System 

&#160; 

The Company&#146;s Integrated Global Navigation System (&#147;IGNS&#148;) product is an alternative for adding GPS navigation capability to legacy aircraft through the OEM FMS without the high cost of upgrading the current FMS. 

&#160; 

This product includes RNP and RNAV approaches via the certified IS&#38;S Beta 3 GPS and leverages components of the Company&#146;s Flat Panel Display System to provide annunciation to the pilot during GPS procedures. 

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160; 

The Company&#146;s customers include the United States government (including DoD, the Department of Interior (&#147;DOI&#148;) and the Department of Homeland Security (&#147;DHS&#148;)), American Airlines, Inc. (&#147;AAI&#148;), Boeing, BAE Systems, Eclipse, FedEx Corporation (&#147;FedEx&#148;), Icelandair, L-3 Communications, Lockheed Martin Corporation, Pilatus, Sierra Nevada Corporation, and the Department of National Defense (Canada), among others. In fiscal year 2015, the two largest customers, Pilatus and Eclipse accounted for 20% and 15% of total revenue, respectively. In fiscal 2014, the three largest customers, Pilatus, Eclipse Aerospace and FedEx, accounted for 17%, 14%, and 12% of total revenue, respectively. In fiscal year 2013, the two largest customers, Eclipse and American Airlines, accounted for 24% and 14% of total revenue, respectively. 

&#160; 

Retrofit Market 

&#160; 

Historically, a majority of the Company&#146;s sales have come from the retrofit market, which IS&#38;S has pursued because of its continued growth in response to the need to support the world&#146;s aging fleet of aircraft. The design and airframe structure of many types of older aircraft generally exceeds the technology and technical capabilities of the original cockpit instruments and avionics. The Company has developed products that enable owners and operators to upgrade their aircraft by retrofitting them with IS&#38;S products at a competitive cost and with equipment that provides cockpit displays with capabilities and technology equivalent to new aircraft. 

&#160; 

IS&#38;S expects its main customers in the retrofit market will continue to be: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; the DoD and defense contractors,

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; aircraft operators, and

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; aircraft modification centers.

&#160; 

Department of Defense and Defense Contractors. &#160; The Company sells its products directly to the DoD and to domestic and international defense contractors for end use on military aircraft retrofit programs. DoD programs generally take one of two forms: a subcontract with a prime government contractor, such as Boeing, Lockheed Martin, or L-3 Communications, or a direct contract with the appropriate government agency, such as the U.S. Air Force. The government&#146;s desire for cost-effective retrofit of its aircraft has led it to purchase commercial off-the-shelf equipment rather than to develop specially designed products, which are usually more costly and take longer to implement. These retrofit contracts tend to be on arms-length commercial terms, although some termination and other provisions of government contracts are typically applicable to these contracts, as described under &#147;Government Regulation&#148; below. Each government agency or general contractor retains the right to terminate a contract at any time at its convenience. Upon such alteration or termination, IS&#38;S is entitled typically to be compensated for already delivered items and reimbursement for allowable costs incurred.

&#160; 

Aircraft Operators. &#160; The Company sells its products to aircraft operators, including commercial airlines, cargo carriers, and business and general aviation aircraft owners or suppliers, primarily for retrofitting of aircraft owned or operated by these customers. The Company&#146;s commercial fleet customers include or have included, among others, AAI, ABX Air, FedEx and Icelandair. IS&#38;S sells these customers a range of products from FPDS to air data systems.

&#160; 

Aircraft Modification Centers. &#160; Aircraft modification centers, which repair and retrofit private aircraft, represent the primary retrofit market for private and corporate jets. IS&#38;S has established relationships with a number of aircraft modification centers throughout the United States, which act as distribution outlets for the Company&#146;s products.

&#160; 

OEM Market 

&#160; 

The Company was selected to provide the cockpit avionics suite for the new Eclipse E550 production aircraft. During the years 2006 through late 2008, the Company provided cockpit displays in support of Eclipse Aviation Inc.&#146;s (&#147;Aviation&#148;) production of approximately 150 aircraft until late 2008 when Aviation filed for bankruptcy. Eclipse purchased the assets of Aviation in 2009. In 2011, Eclipse announced the planned production in 2013 of the E550 aircraft and selected IS&#38;S as the system integrator. During the past six years, IS&#38;S has been providing, through Eclipse, enhanced capability through retrofits to numerous owners of the Aviation produced aircraft. On April 15, 2015, Eclipse merged with Kestrel Aircraft to form One Aviation. 

&#160; 

In May 2013, Pilatus announced that it had selected IS&#38;S to develop and manufacture the Utilities Management System (&#147;UMS&#148;) for the recently announced Pilatus PC-24 aircraft under a multi-year production contract. The UMS integrates multiple aircraft utility functions commonly supported by multiple individual controllers and monitors. The UMS will provide integrated control of systems from within the avionics suite and automate various normal and emergency tasks to reduce crew workload and improve safety conditions. This open architecture system will allow Pilatus to design and/or refine control and monitoring algorithms internally. 

&#160; 

IS&#38;S also markets its products to other original equipment manufacturers including Boeing and Lockheed Martin.

Backlog represents the value of contracts and purchase orders, less the revenue recognized to date on those contracts and purchase orders. The year over year decrease of $0.8 million was the result of booking of $19.3 million in new business, offset by $20.1 million in recognized revenue. In fiscal 2014 de-bookings of $61.9 million relates to Delta&#146;s purported termination of a contract with IS&#38;S to provide an upgraded cockpit and certain navigation capabilities for its fleet of MD88 and MD90 aircraft, (See Item 3. Legal Proceedings), and $44.1 million of recognized revenue. Air data product backlog as of September 30, 2015 remained constant from September 30, 2014, and FPDS backlog as of September 30, 2015 decreased by $0.8 million from September 30, 2014, reflecting decreased FPDS bookings during the 2015. The backlog excludes potential future sole-source production orders from products currently in development under the Company&#146;s EDC programs, including the Eclipse E550, the Pilatus PC-24, and the KC-46A, all of 

&#160; 

&#160; 

which the Company expects to enter into extended production phases upon completion of development. Although the Company believes that the orders included in backlog are firm, most of the backlog involves orders that can be modified or terminated by the customer. As of September 30, 2015, approximately 1% of the Company&#146;s backlog was expected to be filled beyond fiscal 2016. 

&#160; 

Engineering Development 

&#160; 

The Company invests a large percentage of its sales on engineering development, both R&#38;D and EDC. At September 30, 2015, approximately 34% of the Company&#146;s employees were engineers engaged in various engineering development projects. Total engineering development expense is comprised of both internally funded R&#38;D and product development and design charges related to specific customer contracts. Engineering development expense consists primarily of payroll-related expenses of employees engaged in EDC projects, engineering related product materials and equipment, and subcontracting costs. R&#38;D charges incurred for product design, product enhancements, and future product development are expensed as incurred. Product development and design charges related to specific customer contracts are charged to cost of sales-EDC based on the method of contract accounting (either percentage-of-completion or completed contract) applicable to such contracts. 

&#160; 

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

IS&#38;S focuses its sales efforts on passenger and cargo carrying aircraft operators, general aviation operators, aircraft modification centers, the DoD, DoD contractors, and OEMs. Periodically, the Company evaluates its sales and marketing efforts with respect to these focus areas and, where appropriate, makes use of third-party sales representatives who receive compensation through commissions based on performance. 

&#160; 

The Company&#146;s ability to provide prompt and effective repair and upgrade service is critical to its marketing efforts. The Company&#146;s customer service program offers a 24-hour customer hotline. The Company services its customers utilizing either field service engineers or its in-house repair and upgrade facility. The Company may lend spare units to customers when it is repairing or overhauling their equipment. IS&#38;S provides customers with a standard two-year warranty on new products. The Company offers customers extended warranties of varying lengths beyond the two years for additional fees. 

&#160; 

The majority of the Company&#146;s sales, personnel and assets are within the United States. In fiscal year 2015, 2014 and 2013 net sales outside the United States amounted to $6.6 million, $12.0 million and $4.8 million, respectively. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

FAA regulations govern the manufacture and installation of the Company&#146;s products in aircraft owned and operated in the United States, and the IS&#38;S facility is FAA certified. The most significant product and installation regulations are TSO and STC, which establish the minimum product performance standards. 

&#160; 

Generally, sales of IS&#38;S products to European or other non-U.S. owners of aircraft require approval of EASA, or other relevant governmental agencies. EASA certification requirements for the manufacture and installation of the Company&#146;s products in European owned aircraft mirror FAA regulations, and its process for European certification is similar to that of the FAA. 

&#160; 

In addition to product related regulations, IS&#38;S is subject to U.S. Government procurement regulations with respect to the sale of the Company&#146;s products to government entities or government contractors. The government agency or general contractor retains the right to terminate a contract at any time at its convenience. Upon such alteration or termination, IS&#38;S is generally entitled to an equitable adjustment to the contract price so that the Company receives the purchase price for products or services already delivered and reimbursement for allowable costs incurred and for termination related costs. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing, Assembly and Materials Acquisition 

&#160; 

The Company&#146;s manufacturing activities consist primarily of assembling and testing components and subassemblies, and integrating them into finished systems. Typically, the Company purchases components for products from third-party suppliers and assembles them in a clean room environment. Many of the components purchased are standard products, although certain parts are made to the Company&#146;s specifications. 

&#160; 

When appropriate, IS&#38;S enters into long-term supply agreements and uses its relationships with long-term suppliers to improve product quality and availability, and to reduce delivery times and product costs. In addition, the Company identifies alternative suppliers for important component parts. Generally, the introduction of component parts from new suppliers into existing products requires FAA certification of the entire finished product if the newly sourced component varies significantly from the original drawings and specifications. IS&#38;S has not experienced significant delays in delivery of products caused by the inability to obtain either component parts or FAA approval of products incorporating new component parts. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Quality Assurance 

&#160; 

Product quality is of vital importance. The Company is ISO 9001 and AS9100C certified. These standards represent an international consensus on effective management practices with the goal of ensuring that a company can deliver its products and related services consistently in a manner that meets or exceeds customer quality requirements. IS&#38;S&#146;s certification to these standards allows the Company to represent to customers that it maintains high quality industry standards in the education of its employees, and in the design and manufacture of its products. In addition, the Company&#146;s products undergo extensive and documented quality control testing prior to being delivered to customers. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The market for the Company&#146;s products is highly competitive. Competitors vary in size and resources, and substantially all of the Company&#146;s competitors are much larger than IS&#38;S and have substantially greater resources. With respect to air data systems and related products, the Company&#146;s principal competitors include Honeywell International Inc. (&#147;Honeywell&#148;), Rockwell Collins, Inc., Thales Communications, Inc. (&#147;Thales&#148;), and Garmin Ltd. (&#147;Garmin&#148;). With respect to flat panel displays, principal competitors currently include Honeywell, Rockwell Collins, Inc., L-3 Communications, Garmin and GE Aviation Systems (&#147;GEAS&#148;). However, as the flat panel display industry evolves and the demand for flat panel displays increases, IS&#38;S may face future competition in this area from other suppliers. 

&#160; 

The Company believes that the principal competitive factors in its markets are cost, development cycle time, responsiveness to customer preferences, product quality, technology, and reliability. IS&#38;S believes that its significant and long-standing customer relationships reflect the Company&#146;s ability to compete favorably with respect to these factors. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights 

&#160; 

IS&#38;S relies on patents to protect its proprietary technology. As of September 30, 2015, the Company holds 22 U.S. patents and has 8 U.S. patent applications pending relating to its technology. In addition, IS&#38;S holds 65 international patents and has 13 international patent applications pending. Certain of these patents and patent applications cover technology relating to air data measurement systems and others cover technology relating to flat panel display systems and other aspects of the COCKPIT/IP &#174; solution. While IS&#38;S believes these patents have significant value in protecting its technology, it believes that the innovative skill, technical expertise, and know-how of the Company&#146;s personnel in applying the technology reflected in its patents would be difficult, costly, and time consuming to reproduce.

&#160; 

While IS&#38;S is not aware of any pending lawsuits against the Company alleging patent infringement or the violation of other intellectual property rights, it cannot be certain such infringement claims will not be asserted against the Company in the future. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of September 30, 2015, IS&#38;S had 88 employees. The Company&#146;s future success depends on its ability to attract, train and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for such qualified personnel is intense, and the Company may not be able to attract, train, and retain highly qualified personnel in the future. None of the Company&#146;s employees are currently represented by a labor union.
