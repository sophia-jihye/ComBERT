Overview and Corporate History 

&#160; 

eBizware.com, Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;), a Delaware corporation, was formed on December 31, 2013. The Company is headquartered at Unit B19, 9/F, Efficiency House, 35 Tai Yau Street, San Po Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong. The Company was formed to continue the development and distribution of a software solution that provides visual online data resource for our customers to integrate with third party implementations.

&#160;

On August 12, 2016, in connection with the sale of a controlling interest in the Company, Mark W. DeFoor (the &#8220;Seller&#8221;), the Company&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer and Director entered into and closed on that certain Share Purchase Agreement (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;) with 57 Society International Limited, (&#8220;57 Society&#8221;), a Hong Kong company, whereby 57 Society purchased from the Seller a total of 5,000,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock (the &#8220;Shares&#8221;) for an aggregate price of $321,000. The Shares acquired represent approximately 94.70% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company.

&#160;

Subsequent to the Agreement, the Company discontinued its current business and is seeking new business opportunities and may seek businesses to acquire.

Our Business 

&#160; 

The exchange of data is a constant problem for most organizations no matter what their size. eBizware began operations with the intent of providing customers with middle-ware applications. Our tools allow for the customer to attach our software to their resident database, no matter the manufacturer, via an online connection string builder. Once the customer&#8217;s database is attached to the eBizware tool, you have the ability, through our online resource, resident or on one of our servers, to choose the data you would like to distribute and how you would like to distribute it. eBizware offers several standard delivery options, the system can deliver a .csv file (comma separated value file), a txt file, web service or API (application programming interface), all without any additional programming or resources. 

&#160; 

The Company began generating revenue in September 2014. Our revenue model is a subscription service, paid monthly prior to the beginning of that month. 

&#160; 

Following the sale of a controlling interest in the Company on August 12, 2016, management decided to discontinue the Company&#8217;s current business and is seeking new business opportunities by way of developing and launching a mobile device application (APP) that encourages community building centered around the use of a cloud-based APP. The concept for development of this APP surrounds the use of &#8220;Numbers 1-9&#8221; where products are expected to be customizable according to individual color preferences and suitable number combinations. The Company may also seek business to acquire. 

&#160; 

Competition

Our competition includes other data integration service providers. Some of our competitors may have significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. Our competitors may undertake more far-reaching marketing campaigns, including Internet based advertisements, and adopt more aggressive pricing policies that may allow them to build larger customer and distribution bases than ours. Our competitor&#8217;s services may be equal or superior to our services or that achieve greater market acceptance than ours.
