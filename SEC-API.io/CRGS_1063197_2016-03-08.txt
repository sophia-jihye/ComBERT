 Item 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

History and Development of Our Technology 

Management announced a name change during 2015 in connection with the establishment of its two business divisions. The CURA division is engaged in the fatigue management business and the Aegis division is engaged in the power and hydraulic business. The company intends to submit to its shareholders, at the 2016 annual shareholders meeting, a proposal to approve changing the name of the company to CurAegis Technologies, Inc. Until the legal name of the company is changed, the company is doing business as CurAegis Technologies, a Torvec company. 

&#160; 

Torvec, Inc. was incorporated as a New York business corporation on September 25, 1996. The Company develops and markets advanced technologies in the areas of power, safety and wellness. Currently, we are focusing on the commercialization strategies in the following technologies: 

&#160; 

&#160; (i) 

the CURA system which includes the myCadian&#8482; watch which measures degradation of alertness and sleep attributes and the Z-Coach e-learning education and training tool and 

&#160; (ii) 

the Aegis hydraulic pump 

&#160; 

The myCadian&#8482; watch consists of hardware and software that measures multiple metrics in order to establish that a person&#39;s ability to perform a task or job appears to be degrading. The Aegis hydraulic pump is designed with an innovative hydraulic design that delivers greater efficiencies and is smaller than currently offered products. The Company has not had any significant revenue-producing operations. 

&#160;

It is important to note, regarding both CURA and Aegis products, that the cycle time from the initiation of the sales process to revenue realization can be highly variable especially for a start-up entity. 

&#160; 

CURA Division: the m yCadian &#8482; watch , the CURA&#8482; System , and Z-Coach&#8482; e-learning 

The Company&#8217;s CURA division is developing a proprietary technology and suite of products designed to (i) measure the decrease in a person&#8217;s alertness and (ii) to train individuals on how to improve alertness levels. The CURA&#8482; system and the myCadian&#8482; watch enable the user and third parties to anticipate and avert undesired or disastrous situations caused by the degradation of alertness. With the information provided from the CURA&#8482; software analytics employees can work with Z-Coach, our proprietary sleep training and education solution to correct sleep issues and improve overall wellness. 

&#160; 

CurAegis Technologies is engaged in validation testing with a number of sleep study experts and neurologists to assist with the analysis and validation of our new technologies. The Company believes a solutions approach can be created to indicate a &#8220;degradation of alertness&#8221; and thus give immediate and important information to the user and other parties. These degradations can be caused by drowsiness, alcohol or other drugs, sickness, psychological problems and thought distractions. Action taken upon a warning of a change in alertness will lead to a better and safer environment. The myCadian&#8482; watch paired with the CURA&#8482; system is a real time alertness and emergency monitoring system that addresses sleep and fatigue management solutions. This is especially important when an individual&#8217;s alertness is essential in properly performing tasks, fulfilling responsibilities and averting disasters. The Company has filed for patent protection for these inventions. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The myCadian&#8482; watch is a wearable device developed using physiological monitoring hardware and our proprietary CURA&#8482; (Circadian User Risk Assessment) software and detects a degradation of alertness in a user and reveals sleep and fatigue problems. The MyCadian&#8482; watch will contain an emergency notification function through the use of a panic button or in sensing a lack of motion which would generate a third party panic notification. The CURA&#8482; system will include: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

a proprietary tool that combines signal processing and pattern recognition to guide users and third parties about the alertness of the wearer, 

&#160; &#9679; 

a risk assessment that identifies the degradation of alertness potentially affecting the wearer&#8217;s ability perform tasks, 

&#160; &#9679; 

a comprehensive assessment for wellness, alertness and sleep, 

&#160; &#9679; 

real-time reporting that distills complex data into actionable information on mobile and desktop platforms, 

&#160; &#9679; 

predictive reporting for a user to take action when alertness begins to wane-before fatigue becomes dangerous, 

&#160; &#9679; 

flexible settings to provide employers a customized CURA tool within existing safety definitions and to create protocols for a unique environment, 

&#160; &#9679; 

pricing that makes it affordable across a broad based workforce. 

&#160; 

The Company estimates the possible market opportunity for the CURA&#8482; system and the myCadian&#8482; watch at approximately 700 million users worldwide. We believe customer shipments of the myCadian&#8482; watch will begin in 2016. 

&#160; 

The Z-Coach e-learning tool was created by highly respected fatigue management scientists and was acquired by the Company in September 2015. The first of six Z-Coach e-learning modules, Z-Coach Aviation, has been designed for aviation professionals, from flight and ground crews, to scheduling, dispatch, administration and management . Z-Coach learning topics include: Risks and Costs of Fatigue, Fundamentals of Sleep, Fatigue Mitigation and Countermeasures. Z-Coach participants gain an awareness of the dangers inherent in the lack of sleep and learn to utilize lifestyle tools to make changes to improve their health, mood, productivity and safety. In 2016, CurAegis Technologies plans to release five additional industry-specific versions of Z-Coach in conjunction with the launch of the CURA&#8482; system and the myCadian&#8482; watch. Z-Coach Aviation will be available for sale in the first quarter of 2016. &#160; 

&#160; 

Aegis Division: Hydraulic Pump &#8211; &#160; 

The development of our hydraulic pump has taken on added significance in light of recent U.S. government emissions regulations for off road diesel engines. These regulations will require diesel engines to pollute less. To help achieve these new standards, companies are attempting to run diesel engines, and thus their hydraulic pumps, at lower rotational speeds. This requires larger displacement hydraulic pumps to be installed to compensate for the decrease in rotational speed. Among other advantages, the unique technology of our hydraulic pump allows a larger displacement pump to fit into the same or smaller footprint than that of existing pumps. This enables manufacturers to keep the current equipment layout without the need for expensive modifications to accommodate larger hydraulic pumps. 

&#160; 

Our goal with the hydraulic pump technology is to give the marketplace a revolutionary new concept in hydraulic pumps and motors that will be: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

smaller and lighter than conventional pumps and motors, 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

more efficient, 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

as reliable, 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

price competitive, and 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

unique in its ability to scale larger, allowing more powerful pumps and motors. 

&#160; 

Since 2012, we have invested in software, test equipment and personnel to enhance our development efforts and began a drastic redesign of the hydraulic pump to improve the overall performance while maintaining the significant advantages we have in size and weight. We have built our own testing facility for initial testing, which would have otherwise taken place at a third party testing facility. Our engineer and design team has progressively made adjustments to the valve sealing design and each change has shown an improvement in the measured efficiency of the pump. We have recently achieved our pressure goal of 5000 psi. We believe this is a significant accomplishment and major milestone in our development. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

We will continue to design modifications to enhance the overall pump technology. We have filed for patent protection for our novel non-rotating group pump concept, and we are also working on additional patents as a result of engineering breakthroughs in our design process. Although there is still much to be done, we continue to be extremely encouraged by our testing. 

&#160; 

In addition to the activities to be undertaken by us to implement our plan of operation detailed above, we may expand and/or refocus our marketing activities depending upon future circumstances and developments. Information regarding the Company and all of our inventions, including regular updates on technological and business developments, can be found on our website, www.torvec.com . The website and its contents are not incorporated by reference into this report. 

&#160; &#160; 

IsoTorque&#174; Differential &#8211; &#160; 

Until the latter part of 2014, the Company&#8217;s focus had included the development of its IsoTorque&#174; differential technology, which is designed to provide for improved traction, handling, performance and safety of a vehicle without the need for complex electronics and clutches that wear out. At this time, however, development efforts for this technology have been temporarily suspended in order to focus resources on the other technologies highlighted above. 

&#160; &#160; 

Competition, Industry and Market Acceptance 

Competition in both the wearable device market and the hydraulic device market is, and is expected to remain, intense. The competition ranges from development stage companies to major domestic and international companies, many of which have financial, technical, marketing, sales, manufacturing, distribution and other resources significantly greater than ours. As we commercialize our technologies and begin to sell product, we expect to compete on the basis of performance, uniqueness of design, reliability, and price. There can be no assurance that our technologies and products will not be rendered obsolete by developments in competing technologies that are currently under development or that may be developed in the future or that our competitors will not market competing products that obtain market acceptance more rapidly than ours. 

&#160; 

We believe that the technologies we are developing have significant advantages relative to similar products manufactured in the worldwide wearable device and hydraulic device marketplaces. With respect to our mechanical device technologies, we believe that our development efforts represent a paradigm shift with respect to presently known technology. With respect to our wearable device technology, we believe that our development efforts are focused on a market that is seeking a better solution to predicting an individual&#8217;s level of alertness. Although we have not yet generated significant revenues from the commercialization of our technologies, we are focusing our efforts toward those areas where we believe we can get to market the quickest and most successfully. 

&#160; 

Patents, Trade Secrets and Trademarks &#160; 

Our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology, products and manufacturing processes. We principally rely upon patent, trademark, trade secrets and contract law to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary information, there can be no assurance that others will not either develop the same or similar information independently or obtain access to our proprietary information. In addition, there can be no assurance that we would prevail if we asserted our intellectual property rights against third parties, or that third parties will not successfully assert infringement claims against us in the future. 

&#160; 

We currently hold various patents and have a number of patent applications in process in multiple countries including the United States, Australia, Canada, Europe, Japan, China, India and South Korea. 

&#160; 

All key employees are required to enter into agreements providing for confidentiality and the assignment of rights to inventions made by them while employed by us. These agreements also contain certain noncompetition and non-solicitation provisions effective during the employment term and for varying periods thereafter depending on position and location. There can be no assurance that we will be able to enforce these agreements. All of our employees agree to abide by the terms of a Code of Ethics policy that provides for the confidentiality of certain information received during the course of their employment. 

&#160; 

Trademarks are an important aspect of our business. The following are our registered trademarks: Torvec &#174; , IsoTorque &#174; , myCadian&#8482;, CurAegis&#8482;, CURA&#8482;, Z-Coach&#8482; and ZZ Coach&#8482;.
