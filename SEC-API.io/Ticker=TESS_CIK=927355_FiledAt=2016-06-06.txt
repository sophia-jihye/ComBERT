&#160; 

For information regarding our website address and material available free of charge through the website, see the information appearing under the heading &#8220;Available Information&#8221; included in Item 7 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 27, 2016. 

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160; 

We evaluate our business and customers as one segment. However, to provide investors with increased visibility into the markets we serve, we report revenue and gross profit by the following customer market units: (1) public carriers, contractors and program managers that are generally responsible for building and maintaining the infrastructure system and provide airtime service to individual subscribers; (2) government system operators including federal agencies as well as state and local governments that run wireless networks for their own use; (3) private system operators such as major 

&#160;

utilities and transportation companies that run wireless networks for their own use; (4) commercial dealers and resellers that sell, install and/or service cellular telephone, wireless networking, broadband and two-way radio communications equipment primarily for the enterprise market; and (5) retailers, dealer agents and carriers. Beginning in the third quarter of fiscal year 2015, we began reporting private system operators and government operators as two separate market units. All periods have been restated to reflect this change. 

&#160; 

Public carriers, contractors and program managers are system operators that are generally responsible for building and maintaining the public infrastructure system and providing airtime service to individual subscribers, and accounted for approximately 17% of fiscal year 2016 revenue. Government system operators including federal agencies and state and local governments accounted for 6% of fiscal year 2016 revenues. Private system operators, including commercial entities, major utilities, transportation companies, manufacturers, and installation centers, accounted for 16% of fiscal year 2016 revenues. Commercial dealers and resellers include dealers and resellers that sell, install and/or service cellular telephone, wireless networking, broadband and two-way radio communications equipment for the enterprise and consumer markets. These resellers include local and national value-added resellers and retailers, and accounted for 25% of fiscal year 2016 revenues. Our retailers, independent dealer agents and carriers market accounted for 36% of fiscal year 2016 revenues. 

&#160; 

Our top ten customer relationships totaled 22% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2016, and no customer relationship accounted for more than 4% of our total revenues. 

&#160; 

Approximately 98% of our sales have been made to customers in the United States during each of the past three fiscal years, although we currently sell to customers in over 90 countries. Due to our diverse product offering and our wide customer base, our business is not significantly affected by seasonality in the aggregate. However, sales to our retailers generally peak in our second and third quarters in preparation for the winter holiday season and decline significantly in our fourth quarter. Also, our base station infrastructure sales are typically affected by weather conditions in the United States, especially in our fourth quarter. 

&#160; 

For more detailed financial information regarding customer market and product category activity within our sole operating segment for each of the past three fiscal years, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 27, 2016. 

&#160; 

Products and Services 

&#160; 

We principally offer competitively priced, manufacturer brand-name products, ranging from simple hardware items to sophisticated test equipment, with per item prices ranging from less than $1 to over $150,000 and gross profit margins ranging from less than 5% to 99%. We offer products classified into our four business categories: base station infrastructure; network systems; installation, test and maintenance products; and mobile devices and accessories, which accounted for approximately 39%, 15%, 7%, and 39% of fiscal year 2016 revenues, respectively. Base station infrastructure products are used to build, repair and upgrade wireless broadband systems. Products include base station antennas, cable and transmission lines, small towers, lightning protection devices, connectors, power systems, enclosures, grounding, jumpers, miscellaneous hardware, and mobile antennas. Our base station infrastructure service offering includes connector installation, custom jumper assembly, site kitting and logistics integration. Network systems products are used to build and upgrade public and private wireless broadband networks. Products include fixed and mobile broadband radio equipment, wireless networking filtering systems, distributed antenna systems, two-way radios and security and surveillance products. This product category also includes training classes, technical support and engineering design services. Installation, test and maintenance products are used to install, tune, and maintain wireless communications equipment. Products include sophisticated analysis equipment and various frequency-, voltage- and power-measuring devices, as well as an assortment of tools, hardware, GPS, safety and replacement and component parts and supplies required by service technicians. Mobile devices and accessory products include cellular, smart phone and data device accessories such as replacement batteries, cases, screen protectors, speakers, mobile amplifiers, power supplies, bluetooth and corded headsets, mounts, car antennas, music accessories and data and memory cards. 

&#160; 

While we principally provide manufacturer brand-name products, a variety of products are developed, manufactured and offered under TESSCO-owned brands including Ventev &#61650; , Wireless Solutions &#61650; , and TerraWave &#174; . The products we offer under these brands generally consist of device accessory products that fall into the mobile device and 

&#160;

accessory product category, as well as WLAN and network systems accessory products and remote monitoring and control solutions that fall into the network systems category. Also, our WLAN certification training is offered under our training unit GigaWave &#174; trade name and is reported in the network systems category. We have not incurred significant research and development expenditures in any of the last three fiscal years. Sales of proprietary products were 14% of our total sales in fiscal year 2016. 

&#160; 

Our products are sold as part of our integrated product and supply chain solutions. Our supply chain services for all product areas are grouped under Knowledge, Configuration, Delivery and Control. Knowledge solutions include the entire suite of TESSCO knowledge tools that focus on educating the industry, including product highlights, showcases and/or comparisons, with comprehensive specifications on the products, solutions and applications that are offered and reinforced by engineering, sales and technical support, as well as hands-on training programs. Configuration services are comprised of customized product solution kitting and assembly, logistics management and consumer and retail merchandising and marketing, allowing the products to be delivered ready for immediate use, installation or resale. Our delivery system allows the customer to select speed of delivery options, to specific delivery locations, designed to eliminate the customer&#8217;s need for staging and warehousing. Our services that increase customer control include predetermined monthly pricing levels, the ability to monitor multi-site purchasing with pre-approved, customized parameters indicating who is able to order how much of which specific products, order delivery tracking, product usage tracking, history reporting and alternative financing options. 

&#160; 

As part of our commitment to customer service, we typically allow most customers to return most products for any reason, for credit, within 30 days of the date of purchase. Total returns and credits have been less than 3% of revenues in each of the past three fiscal years. 

&#160; 

Revenues from sales of products purchased from our largest two vendors, Otter Products, LLC and CommScope Inc., accounted for 15% and 11%, respectively, of total fiscal year 2016 revenues. Sales of products purchased from our ten largest vendors generated approximately 42% of our total fiscal year 2016 revenues. 

&#160; 

The amount of purchases we make from each of our approximately 400 vendors may significantly increase or decrease over time. As the level of business changes, we may request, or be requested by our vendors, to adjust the terms of our relationships. Therefore, our ability to purchase and re-sell products from each of our vendors depends on being able to reach and maintain agreements with these vendors on acceptable business terms. In addition, the agreements and arrangements on which most of our larger vendor relationships are based are typically of limited duration and terminable for any or no reason by either party upon notice of varying lengths, usually between several months and two years. Generally, we believe that alternative sources of supply are available for many of the product types we carry, although we may be unable, or find it more difficult, to source branded products from other than the manufacturer. 

&#160; 

The scope of products available for purchase from a given vendor may fluctuate, and is generally limited only by the scope of the vendor&#8217;s catalog and available inventory. Therefore, we often source the same product type from multiple vendors, although in some instances branded products are available only from the manufacturer or a particular vendor, and in some instances, customers might favor one vendor or brand over another. The terms of the vendor contract typically apply to all products purchased from a particular vendor, whether or not the item is specifically identified in the contract. 

&#160; 

When negotiating with vendors, we seek the most favorable terms available under the circumstances. Our preferred terms include among others, terms that provide for product warranty and return rights, as well as product liability and intellectual property indemnification rights, in each case consistent with our preferred business methods and objectives. We have not been able, nor do we expect in the future to be able, to negotiate the inclusion of all our preferred terms, or our preferred language for those terms, in every vendor contract. The degree of our success in this regard is largely a function of the parties&#8217; relative bargaining positions. 

&#160; 

We are dedicated to superior performance, quality and consistency of service in an effort to maintain and expand vendor relationships but there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in this regard in the future, or that competitive pressures or other events beyond our control will not have a negative impact on our ability to maintain these relationships or to continue to derive revenues from these relationships. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Method of Operation 

&#160; 

We believe that we have developed a highly integrated, technologically advanced and efficient method of operation based on the following key tenets: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Understanding and anticipating customers' needs and building solutions by cultivating lasting relationships; 

&#183; 

Allowing customers to make the best decisions by delivering product knowledge, not just information, through our knowledge tools, including The Wireless Journal &#174; and the TESSCO.com &#174; Solution and Transaction System; 

&#183; 

Responding to what we refer to as "the moments of truth" by providing customers with sales, service and technical support, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year; 

&#183; 

Providing customers what they need, when and where they need it by delivering integrated product and supply chain solutions; and 

&#183; 

Helping customers enhance their operations by providing real-time order tracking and performance measurement. 

&#160; 

We operate as a team of teams structured to enhance marketing innovation, customer focus and operational excellence. 

&#160; 

Market Development and Sales: &#160; In order to meet the needs of a dynamic and diverse marketplace, our sales and marketing activities are organized on an end-market basis. Sales teams are focused on our customers: 1) public carriers, contractors, and program managers, 2) government system operators 3) private system operators, 4) commercial dealers and resellers, and 5) retailers, independent dealer agents and carriers. This organization allows for the development of unique product and solution offerings to meet the needs of our diverse customer base. 

&#160; 

We attempt to understand and anticipate customers' needs and to build solutions by cultivating lasting relationships. Our commercial customer database contains detailed information on approximately 272,300 existing customers, including the names of key personnel, past contacts, inquiries, and buying and credit histories. Additionally, we have information on approximately 630,200 contacts that serve as potential new customers in our market. This extensive customer database enables us to identify and target potential customers and to market specific products to these targeted customers. Potential customers are identified through their responses to TESSCO.com &#174; , direct &#8209;marketing materials, advertisements in trade journals and industry trade shows, as well as through referrals from other TESSCO customers and vendors. Customer relationship representatives pursue these customer inquiries through distribution of our Knowledge Tools and through phone contact, electronic communications, and field visits. The information technology system tracks potential customer identification from the initial marketing effort through the establishment and development of a purchasing relationship. Once a customer relationship is established, we carefully analyze purchasing patterns and identify opportunities to encourage customers to make more frequent purchases of a broader array of products. Scheduled contacts are made to each regularly purchasing customer for the purpose of information dissemination, order generation, database maintenance, and the overall enhancement of the business relationship. The process is aimed at attracting prospects to TESSCO, converting these prospects to buying customers, and ultimately migrating them to loyal, total-source monthly buyers. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Solutions Development and Product Management: &#160; We actively monitor advances in technologies and industry trends, both through market research and continual customer and manufacturer interaction, and continue to enhance our product offering as new wireless communications products and technologies are developed. To complement our broad product portfolio, we provide technical expertise and consultation to assist our customers in understanding technology and choosing the right products for their specific application. Our Solution Architects offer applications engineering to market-specific applications such as DAS systems (Distributed Antennae Systems), wireless backhaul and fiber networks, custom integrated solutions for power systems, and site kitting and flexible custom network design services for areas such as in-building coverage, tower design, and wireless video surveillance systems. 

&#160; 

In addition to determining the product offering, our Product and Solutions Development Teams provide the technical foundation for both customers and our personnel. The Wireless Product Knowledge System (WPKS) is continually updated to add new products and additional technical information in response to manufacturer specification changes and customer inquiries. WPKS contains detailed information on each stock keeping unit (SKU) offered, including full product descriptions, category classifications, technical specifications, illustrations, product cost, pricing and delivery information, alternative and associated products, and purchase and sales histories. This information is available on a real-time basis to all of our personnel for product development, procurement, technical support, cataloging and marketing. 

&#160; 

Strategic Marketing &#8211; As a thought leader in the wireless industry, TESSCO&#8217;s marketing materials are used for both educating the industry and for promoting TESSCO&#8217;s value. We utilize our WPKS to develop both broad-based and customized product solution information materials. These materials are designed to encourage both existing and potential customers to realize the value we provide in their product solution and supply chain decisions. These Knowledge Tools are an integrated suite of informational print and electronic media. They include: The Wireless Guide &#174; , our product catalogue which is readily available electronically on TESSCO.com; The Wireless Journal &#174; , a trade journal with a bimonthly circulation of approximately 116,500, which is designed to introduce the reader to our capabilities and product offerings, and contains information on significant industry trends and product reviews; The Wireless Update &#174; , which is emailed on a regular basis to an average of 94,300 different individuals and is uniquely produced for various portions of our customer base; The Wireless Bulletin &#174; &#160; family, including The Wireless Bulletin for Accessories for Handsets, Tablets &#38; Music Devices which has a bimonthly circulation of approximately 11,400, The Wireless Bulletin for Installation, Test &#38; Maintenance Products, The Wireless Bulletin for Security &#38; Surveillance, The Wireless Bulletin for Site Planning, The Wireless Bulletin for Training, and The Wireless Bulletin for Wireless Networking Solutions, which are &#160; distributed on an as-need basis in a given year; Technical Application Notes, interactive Systems Supported Reference Drawings, and White Papers, which provide in-depth planning and installation instructions and diagrams; and TESSCO.com &#174; . In addition, TESSCO publishes online, web-browser-enabled, companion versions of its many printed publications, including The Wireless Bulletin Online, The Wireless Guide Online, and The Wireless Journal Online . 

&#160; 

TESSCO.com &#174; is our e-commerce site and the gateway to Your Total Source &#174; for the knowledge, products, and solutions for building, using, and maintaining and reselling wireless broadband solutions. It offers online access to a real-time system of Knowledge, Configuration, Delivery and Control of product and supply chain solutions and is intended for our commercial customers.

&#183; 

A Feedback Center that makes it easy for customers to provide input on our services, Knowledge Tools and Website; and 

&#183; 

Interactive versions of various Knowledge Tools, including: several customized versions of The Wireless Bulletin &#174; , The Wireless Update &#174; , The Wireless Guide &#174; , and The Wireless Journal &#174; . 

&#160; 

Our Knowledge Tools empower our customers to make better decisions by delivering product knowledge, rather than just information. These tools also afford our manufacturers the opportunity to develop their brands and promote their products to a broad and diverse customer base. 

&#160; 

Customer Support and Order Entry: Our customer support teams are responsible for responding to what we refer to as "the moments of truth" by delivering sales and customer support services through an effective and efficient transaction system. We also continually monitor our customer service performance through report cards sent for each product delivery, customer surveys and regular interaction with customers. By combining our broad product offering with a commitment to superior customer service, we seek to reduce a customer's overall procurement costs by enabling the customer to consolidate the number of suppliers from which it obtains products, while also reducing the customer's need to maintain high inventory levels. 

&#160; 

Our information technology system provides detailed information on every customer account, including recent inquiries, buying and credit histories, separate buying locations within a customer account and contact diaries for key personnel, as well as detailed product information, including technical, product availability and pricing information. The information technology system increases sales productivity by enabling any customer support representative to provide any customer with personalized service and also allows non-technical personnel to provide a high level of technical product information and order assistance. 

&#160; 

We believe that our commitment to providing prompt, friendly and efficient customer service before, during and after the sale enables us to maximize sales, customer satisfaction and customer retention. The monthly average number of non-consumer customers decreased slightly from approximately 12,400 for fiscal year 2015 to approximately 12,200 in fiscal year 2016. The average monthly purchase per customer remained flat at approximately $3,700 in fiscal year 2015 and fiscal year 2016. 

&#160; 

Procurement and Inventory Management: Our product management and purchasing system aims to provide customers with a total source of broad and deep product availability, while maximizing the return on our inventory investment. 

&#160; 

&#160;

We use our information technology system to monitor and manage our inventory. Historical sales results, sales projections and information regarding vendor lead times are all used to determine appropriate inventory levels. The information technology system also provides early warning reports regarding upcoming inventory requirements. As of March 27, 2016 and March 29, 2015, we had an immaterial level of backlog orders. Most backlog orders as of March 27, 2016 are expected to be filled within 90 days of fiscal year-end. For the fiscal years ended March 27, 2016 and March 29, 2015, inventory write-offs were 0.7% and 0.5% of total purchases, respectively. In many cases, we are able to return slow-moving inventory to our vendors pursuant to stock rotation agreements. Inventory turns for fiscal years 2016 and 2015 were 6.6 and 6.4, respectively. 

&#160; 

Fu lfillment and Distribution: Orders are received at our Timonium, Maryland, Reno, Nevada and San Antonio, Texas customer sales support centers. As orders are received, customer representatives have access to technical information, alternative and complementary product selections, product availability and pricing information, as well as customer purchasing and credit histories and recent inquiry summaries. An automated warehouse management system, which is integrated with the product planning and procurement system, allows us to ensure inventory control, to minimize multiple product shipments to complete an order and to limit inventory duplication. Bar-coded labels are used on every product, allowing distribution center personnel to utilize radio frequency scanners to locate products, fill orders and update inventory records in real-time, thus reducing overhead associated with the distribution functions. We contract with a variety of freight line and parcel transportation carrier partners to deliver orders to customers. 

&#160; 

Performance and Delivery Guarantee (PDG) charges are generally calculated on the basis of the weight of the products ordered and on the delivery service requested, rather than on distance to the customer. We believe that this approach emphasizes on-time delivery instead of shipment dates, enabling customers to minimize their inventories and reduce their overall procurement costs while guaranteeing date specific delivery, thereby encouraging them to make us their total source supplier. 

&#160; 

Information Technology: Our information technology system is critical to the success of our operations. We have made substantial investments in the development of this system, which integrates cataloging, marketing, sales, fulfillment, inventory control and purchasing, financial control and internal and external communications. The information technology system includes highly developed customer and product databases and is integrated with our Configuration, Fulfillment and Delivery system. The information contained in the system is available on a real-time basis to all of our employees as needed and is utilized in every area of our operations. 

&#160; 

We believe that we have been successful to date in pursuing a highly integrated, technologically advanced and efficient method of operations; however, disruption to our day-to-day operations, including failure of our information technology or distribution systems, or freight carrier interruption, could impair our ability to receive and process orders or to ship products in a timely and cost-efficient manner. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The wireless communications distribution industry is competitive and fragmented, and is comprised of distributors such as Brightstar, D&#38;H, Genco ATC Logistics, Superior Communications and VoiceComm in our retail market and Alliance Corporation, Anixter, Comstor, Graybar, Hutton Communication, KPG Logistics, Ingram Micro, Talley Communications, Tech Data, Site Pro 1, VAV Wireless, Westcon and Winncom in our other markets. In addition, many manufacturers sell and fulfill directly to customers. Barriers to entry for distributors are relatively low, particularly in the mobile devices and accessory market, and the risk of new competitors entering the market is high. In addition, the agreements or arrangements with our customers or vendors looking to us for product and supply chain solutions are typically of limited duration and are terminable by either party upon several months or otherwise short notice. Accordingly, our ability to maintain these relationships is subject to competitive pressures and challenges. Some of our current competitors have substantially greater capital resources and sales and distribution capabilities than we do. In response to competitive pressures from any of our current or future competitors, we may be required to lower selling prices in order to maintain or increase market share, and such measures could adversely affect our operating results. We believe, however, that our strength in service, the breadth and depth of our product offering, our information technology system, our knowledge and expertise in wireless technologies and the wireless marketplace, and our large customer base and 

&#160;

purchasing relationships with approximately 400 manufacturers, provide us with a significant competitive advantage over new entrants to the market. 

&#160; 

Continuing changes in the wireless communications industry, including risks associated with conflicting technology, changes in technology, inventory obsolescence, and consolidation among wireless carriers, could adversely affect future operating results. 

&#160; 

We believe that the principal competitive factors in supplying products to the wireless communications industry are the quality and consistency of customer service, particularly timely delivery of complete orders, breadth and quality of products offered and total procurement costs to the customer. We believe that we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors. In particular, we believe we differentiate ourselves from our competitors based on the breadth of our product offering, our ability to quickly provide products and supply chain solutions in response to customer demand and technological advances, our knowledge and expertise in wireless technologies and the wireless marketplace, the level of our customer service and the reliability of our order fulfillment process. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We seek to protect our intellectual property through a combination of trademarks, service marks, confidentiality agreements, trade secret protection and, if and when appropriate, patent protection. Thus far, we have generally sought to protect our intellectual property, including our product data and information, customer information and information technology systems, through trademark filings and nondisclosure, confidentiality and trade secret agreements. We typically require our employees, consultants, and others having access to our intellectual property, to sign confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements. There can be no assurance that these confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements will be honored, or whether they can be fully enforced, or that other entities may not independently develop systems, technologies or information similar to that on which we rely. 

&#160; 

TESSCO Communications Incorporated, a wholly-owned subsidiary of TESSCO Technologies Incorporated, maintains a number of registered trademarks and service marks in connection with our business activities, including: A Simple Way of Doing Business Better &#174; , Delivering Everything for Wireless &#174; , Delivering What You Need&#8230;When and Where You Need It &#174; , GigaWave Technologies &#174; , Going Beyond the Ordinary &#174; , LinkUPS &#174; , ORDERflow &#174; , Solutions That Make Wireless Work &#174; , TerraWave Solutions &#174; , TESSCO &#174; , TESSCO Making Wireless Work &#174; , TESSCO Technologies &#174; , TESSCO.com &#174; , Ventev &#174; , Ventev Innovations &#174; , The Vital Link to a Wireless World &#174; , The Wireless Bulletin &#174; , The Wireless Guide &#174; , The Wireless Journal &#174; , Wireless Solutions &#174; , The Wireless Update &#174; , Your Total Source &#174; , and Your Virtual Inventory &#174; , among many others. Our general policy is to file for trademark and service mark protection for each of our trademarks and trade names and to enforce our rights against any infringement. 

&#160; 

We currently hold one patent related to our online order entry system. We intend, if and when appropriate, to seek patent protection for any additional patentable technology. The ability to obtain patent protection involves complex legal and factual questions. Others may obtain patent protection for technologies that are important to our business, and as a result, our business may be adversely affected. In response to patents of others, we may need to license the right to use technology patented by others, or in the event that a license cannot be obtained, to design our systems around the patents of others. 

&#160; 

Environmental Regulation 

&#160; 

We are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the United States. We are also subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration concerning employee safety and health matters. Compliance with these federal, state and local laws and regulations related to protection of the environment and employee safety and health has had no material effect on our business. There were no material capital expenditures for environmental projects in fiscal year 2016 and there are no material expenditures planned for such purposes in fiscal year 2017. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Employees 

&#160; 

As of March 27, 2016, we had 786 full-time equivalent employees. Of our full-time equivalent employees, 423 &#160; were engaged in customer and vendor service, marketing, sales and product management, 271 were engaged in fulfillment and distribution operations and 92 were engaged in administration and technology systems services. No employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our employee relations to be excellent.
