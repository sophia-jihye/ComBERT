 ITEM 1. BUSINESS CVB Financial Corp. 

CVB Financial Corp. (referred to herein on an unconsolidated basis as &#147;CVB&#148; and on a consolidated basis as &#147;we&#148;, &#147;our&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;) is a bank holding company incorporated in California on April 27, 1981 and registered with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (&#147;Federal Reserve&#148;) under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the &#147;Bank Holding Company Act&#148;). The Company commenced business on December 30, 1981 when, pursuant to a reorganization, it acquired all of the voting stock of Chino Valley Bank. On March 29, 1996, Chino Valley Bank changed its name to Citizens Business Bank (&#147;CBB&#148; or the &#147;Bank&#148;). The Bank is our principal asset. The Company also has one inactive subsidiary, Chino Valley Bancorp. The Company is also the common stockholder of CVB Statutory Trust III. CVB Statutory Trust III was created in January 2006 to issue trust preferred securities in order to raise capital for the Company. 

CVB&#146;s principal business is to serve as a holding company for the Bank and for other banking or banking related subsidiaries, which the Company may establish or acquire. CVB has not engaged in any other material activities to date. As a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries, CVB&#146;s principal source of funds is, and will continue to be, dividends paid by and other funds advanced from the Bank and capital raised directly by CVB. Legal limitations are imposed on the amount of dividends that may be paid and loans that may be made by the Bank to CVB. See &#147;Item 1. Business &#151; Regulation and Supervision &#151; Dividends.&#148; As of December 31, 2015, the Company had $7.67 billion in total consolidated assets, $3.96 billion in net loans, $5.92 billion in deposits, and $690.7 million in customer repurchase agreements. 

On October 16, 2009, we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed substantially all of the liabilities of San Joaquin Bank (&#147;SJB&#148;), headquartered in Bakersfield, California, in an FDIC-assisted transaction. We acquired all five branches of SJB, one of which we consolidated with our existing Bakersfield business financial center. Through this acquisition, we acquired $489.1 million in loans, $25.3 million in investment securities, $530.0 million in deposits, and $121.4 million in borrowings. The foregoing amounts were reflected at fair value as of the acquisition date. 

On May 15, 2014, the Bank acquired all of the assets and assumed all of the liabilities of American Security Bank (&#147;ASB&#148;) for $57.0 million in cash. As a result, ASB was merged with CBB. This transaction served to further expand CBB&#146;s footprint in Southern California. The assets and liabilities, both tangible and intangible, were recorded at their estimated fair values as of May 15, 2014. The total fair value of assets acquired approximated $436.4 million, which included $117.8 million in cash and cash due from banks, $44.5 million in investment securities available for sale, $242.7 million in loans receivable, $2.1 million in core deposit intangible assets acquired. The total fair value of liabilities assumed was $379.4 million, which included $378.4 million in deposits. Goodwill of $19.1 million from the acquisition represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired. At close, ASB had five branches located in the Southern California communities of: Newport Beach, Laguna Niguel, Corona, Lancaster, and Apple Valley. ASB also had two electronic branch vestibules in the High Desert area of California and a loan production office in Ontario, California. In the latter half of the third quarter of 2014, branch locations were consolidated with branches of CBB and the two electronic banking vestibules were closed. By the end of 2014, the integration of ASB into CBB was completed. This included personnel decisions, center consolidations and system conversions. 

On October 14, 2015, we announced that we have entered into a merger agreement with County Commerce Bank (&#147;CCB&#148;), pursuant to which County Commerce Bank will merge into CBB when the transaction closes. County Commerce Bank is headquartered in Ventura County with four branch locations in Ventura and Santa Barbara Counties and total assets of approximately $250 million. This acquisition extends our geographic footprint northward into the central coast of California. We expect to close this announced acquisition in the first 

&#160; 

quarter of 2016, subject to compliance by each party to the merger with the required closing conditions outlined in the merger agreement. Applicable regulatory approvals and the approval of County Commerce Bank shareholders have already been obtained. 

The principal executive offices of CVB and the Bank are located at 701 North Haven Avenue, Suite 350, Ontario, California. Our phone number is (909) 980-4030. 

Citizens Business Bank 

The Bank commenced operations as a California state-chartered bank on August 9, 1974. The Bank&#146;s deposit accounts are insured under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act up to applicable limits. The Bank is not a member of the Federal Reserve System. At December 31, 2015, the Bank had $7.66 billion in assets, $3.96 billion in net loans, $5.93 billion in deposits, and $690.7 million in customer repurchase agreements. 

As of December 31, 2015, there were 40 Business Financial Centers and eight Commercial Banking Centers (collectively &#147;Centers&#148;) located in the Inland Empire, Los Angeles County, Orange County, San Diego County, Ventura County, Santa Barbara County, and the Central Valley areas of California. 

We also have three trust offices located in Ontario, Newport Beach and Pasadena. These offices serve as sales offices for the Bank&#146;s wealth management, trust and investment products. 

The Bank opened a new Commercial Banking Center in Santa Barbara in January 2016. 

Through our network of Centers, we emphasize personalized service combined with a wide range of banking and trust services for businesses, professionals and individuals located in the service areas of our Centers. Although we focus the marketing of our services to small-and medium-sized businesses, a wide range of banking, investment and trust services are made available to the local consumer market. 

We offer a standard range of bank deposit instruments. These include checking, savings, money market and time certificates of deposit for both business and personal accounts. We also serve as a federal tax depository for our business customers. 

We also provide a full complement of lending products, including commercial, agribusiness, consumer, real estate loans and equipment and vehicle leasing. Commercial products include lines of credit and other working capital financing, accounts receivable lending and letters of credit. Agribusiness products are loans to finance the operating needs of wholesale dairy farm operations, cattle feeders, livestock raisers, and farmers. We provide bank qualified lease financing for municipal governments. Financing products for consumers include automobile leasing and financing, lines of credit, credit cards and home equity loans and lines of credit. Real estate loans include mortgage and construction loans. 

We also offer a wide range of specialized services designed for the needs of our commercial customers. These services include cash management systems for monitoring cash flow, a credit card program for merchants, courier pick-up and delivery, payroll services, remote deposit capture, electronic funds transfers by way of domestic and international wires and automated clearinghouse, and on-line account access. We make available investment products offered by other providers to our customers, including mutual funds, a full array of fixed income vehicles and a program to diversify our customers&#146; funds in federally insured time certificates of deposit of other institutions. 

We offer a wide range of financial services and trust services through our CitizensTrust division. These services include fiduciary services, mutual funds, annuities, 401(k) plans and individual investment accounts. 

&#160; 

Business Segments 

We are a community bank with two reportable operating segments: (i) Business Financial and Commercial Banking Centers (&#147;Centers&#148;) and (ii) Treasury. Our Centers are the focal points for customer sales and services. As such, these Centers comprise the largest active business segment of the Company. Our other reportable segment, Treasury, manages all of the investments for the Company. All administrative and other smaller operating departments are combined into the &#147;Other&#148; category for reporting purposes. See the sections captioned &#147;Results by Segment Operations&#148; in Item 7. Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 21 &#151; Business Segments of the notes to consolidated financial statements. 

Competition 

The banking and financial services business is highly competitive. The competitive environment faced by banks is a result primarily of changes in laws and regulations, changes in technology and product delivery systems, and the ongoing consolidation among insured financial institutions. We compete for loans, deposits, and customers with other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, savings banks, securities and brokerage companies, mortgage companies, insurance companies, finance companies, money market funds, credit unions, and other nonbank financial service providers, including online banks and &#147;peer-to-peer&#148; or &#147; marketplace&#148; lenders and other small business and consumer lenders. Many competitors are much larger in total assets and capitalization, have greater access to capital markets and/or offer a broader range of financial products and services, including technology-based services. 

Economic Conditions/Government Policies 

Our profitability, like most financial institutions, is primarily dependent on interest rate spreads and noninterest income. In general, the difference between the interest rates paid by the Bank on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and other borrowings, and the interest rates received by the Bank on interest-earning assets, such as loans extended to customers and securities held in the investment portfolio, will comprise the major portion of our earnings. These rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, such as inflation, recession and unemployment, government monetary and other policies, and the impact which future changes in domestic and foreign economic conditions might have on us cannot be predicted. 

Opportunity for banks to earn fees and other noninterest income have also been limited by restrictions imposed by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (&#147;Dodd-Frank&#148;) and other government regulations. As the following sections indicate, the impact of current and future changes in government laws and regulations on our ability to maintain an increase on fees and other noninterest income could be material and cannot be predicted. 

Our business is also influenced by the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and the policies of regulatory agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve implements national monetary policies (with objectives such as curbing inflation, increasing employment and combating recession) through its open-market operations in U.S. Government securities by buying and selling treasury and mortgage-backed securities, by adjusting the required level of reserves for depository institutions subject to its reserve requirements, and by varying the target federal funds and discount rates applicable to borrowings by depository institutions. The actions of the Federal Reserve in these areas influence the growth and performance of bank loans, investments, and deposits and also affect interest earned on interest-earning assets and paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Government fiscal and budgetary policies, including deficit spending, can also have a significant impact on the capital markets and interest rates. The nature and impact of any future changes in monetary and fiscal policies on us cannot be predicted. 

&#160; 

Regulation and Supervision 

General 

The Company and the Bank are subject to significant regulation and restrictions by federal and state laws and regulatory agencies. These regulations and restrictions are intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#147;FDIC&#148;) Deposit Insurance Fund (&#147;DIF&#148;) and for the protection of borrowers, and secondarily for the stability of the U.S. banking system. The following discussion of statutes and regulations is a summary and does not purport to be complete nor does it address all applicable statutes and regulations. This discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the statutes and regulations referred to in this discussion. From time to time, federal and state legislation is enacted and implemented by regulations which may have the effect of materially increasing the cost of doing business, limiting or expanding permissible activities, or affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial services providers. 

We cannot predict whether or when other legislation or new regulations may be enacted, and if enacted, the effect that new legislation or any implemented regulations and supervisory policies would have on our financial condition and results of operations. Such developments may further alter the structure, regulation, and competitive relationship among financial institutions, may limit the types or pricing of the products and services we offer, and may subject us to increased regulation, disclosure, and reporting requirements. 

Legislation and Regulatory Developments 

The federal banking agencies continue to implement the remaining requirements in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (&#147;Dodd-Frank Act&#148;) as well as promulgating other regulations and guidelines intended to assure the financial strength and safety and soundness of banks and the stability of the U.S. banking system. Following on the implementation in 2014 and effectiveness in 2015 of new capital rules (&#147;the New Capital Rules&#148;) and the so called Volcker Rule restrictions on certain proprietary trading and investment activities, developments in 2015 included: 

(i) the extension of the Volcker Rule conformance period until July 21, 2016 and a possible additional extension until 2017 for banking institutions to conform existing investments, including certain collateralized loan obligations, and relationships, with certain exceptions, with &#147;covered funds&#148;, including hedge funds, private equity funds and certain other private funds. The Company and the Bank held no investment positions at December 31, 2015 which were subject to the final rule. &#151; See &#147;Volcker Rule&#148; and has controls in place to ensure compliance with the Volcker Rule going forward. 

(ii) the shift in the stress testing cycle and reporting dates required by the banking agencies for institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion to $50 billion to assess the potential impact of different scenarios on earnings, losses, liquidity and capital. The Bank conducts a modified form of stress testing but is not currently subject to these requirements. 

(iii) the implementation of an additional &#147;capital conservation buffer&#148; of 0.625% in 2016 for minimum risk-weighted asset ratios under the New Capital Rules. &#151; See &#147;Capital Adequacy&#148; and &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#151; Capital Resources. 

(iv) the effectiveness in October, 2015 of the final TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure (&#147;TRID&#148;) rules promulgated by the CFPB, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act, which require new mortgage disclosures and training of staff for most mortgage loan applications. CBB is employing its best efforts to comply with the new TRID requirements. &#151; See &#147;CFPB&#148;. 

(v) the release by the Interagency Federal Financial Institutions Examinations Council (FFIEC) of a cybersecurity assessment tool for voluntary use by banks which provides guidelines to measure a bank&#146;s individual risk profile&#148; and &#147;Cybersecurity maturity&#148;. The Bank is considering whether and in what form we would implement this tool. 

&#160; 

(vi) the adoption of the Fixing America&#146;s Surface Transportation Act (the &#147;FAST Act&#148;), highway legislation which contains financial services provisions, including (a) expanding the extended 18 months examination cycle for banks with up to $1 billion in assets; (b) deleting the annual privacy notice for banks which have not changed their policy or practices of sharing of information with third parties and (c) limiting the percentage payment of dividends on reserve bank stock held by banks with more than $10 billion in assets. The bank as a nonmember state bank holds no reserve bank stock. 

In the exercise of their supervisory and examination authority, the regulatory agencies have emphasized corporate governance, capital planning and stress testing, enterprise risk management and other board responsibilities; anti-money laundering compliance; information technology adequacy; cyber security preparedness; vendor management and fair lending and other consumer compliance obligations. 

Capital Adequacy Requirements 

Bank holding companies and banks are subject to similar regulatory capital requirements administered by state and federal banking agencies. The basic capital rule changes in the New Capital Rules adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies were fully effective on January 1, 2015, but many elements are being phased in over multiple future years. The risk-based capital guidelines for bank holding companies, and additionally for banks, require capital ratios that vary based on the perceived degree of risk associated with a banking organization&#146;s operations, both for transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets, such as loans, and for those recorded as off-balance sheet items, such as commitments, letters of credit and recourse arrangements. The risk-based capital ratio is determined by classifying assets and certain off-balance sheet financial instruments into weighted categories, with higher levels of capital being required for those categories perceived as representing greater risks, and with the applicable ratios calculated by dividing qualifying capital by total risk-adjusted assets and off-balance sheet items. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weighting and other factors. Bank holding companies and banks engaged in significant trading activity may also be subject to the market risk capital guidelines and be required to incorporate additional market and interest rate risk components into their risk-based capital standards. To the extent that the new rules are not fully phased in, the prior capital rules will continue to apply. 

The New Capital Rules revised the previous risk-based and leverage capital requirements for banking organizations to meet the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act and to implement the international Basel Committee on Banking Supervision Basel III agreements. Many of the requirements in the New Capital Rules and other regulations and rules are applicable only to larger or internationally active institutions and not to all banking organizations, including institutions currently with less than $10 billion of assets, which includes CVB and the Bank. These include required annual stress tests for institutions with $10 billion or more assets and Enhanced Prudential Standards, Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review requirements, Capital Plan and Resolution Plan or living will submissions. These also include an additional countercyclical capital buffer, a supplementary leverage ratio and the Liquidity Coverage Ratio rule requiring sufficient high-quality liquid assets, which may in turn apply to institutions with $50 billion or more in assets, $250 billion or more in assets, or institutions which may be identified as Global Systematically Important Banking Institutions (G-SIBs). 

Under the risk-based capital guidelines in place prior to the effectiveness of the New Capital Rules, which trace back to the 1988 Basel I accord, there were three fundamental capital ratios: a total risk-based capital ratio, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and a Tier 1 leverage ratio. To be deemed &#147;well capitalized,&#148; a bank must have a total risk-based capital ratio, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least ten percent, six percent and five percent, respectively. Under the capital rules that applied in 2014, there was no Tier 1 leverage requirement for a holding company to be deemed well-capitalized. 

The following are the New Capital Rules applicable to the Company and the Bank beginning January 1, 2015: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; an increase in the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio from 4.00% to 6.00% of risk-weighted assets; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; a new category and a required 4.50% of risk-weighted assets ratio is established for &#147;common equity Tier 1&#148; as a subset of Tier 1 capital limited to common equity; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; a minimum non-risk-based leverage ratio is set at 4.00%; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; changes in the permitted composition of Tier 1 capital to exclude trust preferred securities subject to certain grandfathering exceptions for organizations like CVB which were under $15 billion in assets as of December 31, 2009, mortgage servicing rights and certain deferred tax assets and include unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities unless the organization opts out of including such unrealized gains and losses, which election the Company made in 2015; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the risk-weights of certain assets for purposes of calculating the risk-based capital ratios are changed for high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans, certain past due non-residential mortgage loans and certain mortgage-backed and other securities exposures; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; an additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk weighted assets above the regulatory minimum capital ratios, which will be phased in until 2019 beginning at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets for 2016 and must be met to avoid limitations on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends, repurchase shares or pay discretionary bonuses. 

Management believes that, as of December 31, 2015, the Company and the Bank would meet all requirements under the New Capital Rules applicable to them on a fully phased-in basis if such requirements were currently in effect. 

Including the capital conservation buffer of 2.5%, the New Capital Rules would result in the following minimum ratios to be considered well capitalized: (i) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, (ii) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. At December 31, 2015, the respective capital ratios of the Company and the Bank exceeded the minimum percentage requirements to be deemed &#147;well-capitalized&#148; for regulatory purposes. &#151; See &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#151; Capital Resources.&#148; 

While the New Capital Rules set higher regulatory capital standards for the Company and the Bank, bank regulators may also continue their past policies of expecting banks to maintain additional capital beyond the new minimum requirements. The implementation of the New Capital Rules or more stringent requirements to maintain higher levels of capital or to maintain higher levels of liquid assets could adversely impact the Company&#146;s net income and return on equity, restrict the ability to pay dividends or executive bonuses and require the raising of additional capital. See &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis &#151; Capital Resources . 

Prompt Corrective Action Provisions 

The Federal Deposit Insurance Act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to take &#147;prompt corrective action&#148; with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards, including requiring the prompt submission of an acceptable capital restoration plan. Depending on the bank&#146;s capital ratios, the agencies&#146; regulations define five categories in which an insured depository institution will be placed: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. At each successive lower capital category, an insured bank is subject to more restrictions, including restrictions on the bank&#146;s activities, operational practices or the ability to pay dividends or executive bonuses. Based upon its capital levels, a bank that is classified as well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition, or an unsafe or unsound practice, warrants such treatment. 

The prompt corrective action standards were also changed as the New Capital Rules ratios became effective. Under the new standards, in order to be considered well-capitalized, the bank will be required to meet the new 

&#160; 

common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5%, an increased Tier 1 ratio of 8% (increased from 6%), a total capital ratio of 10% (unchanged) and a leverage ratio of 5% (unchanged). 

The federal banking agencies also may require banks and bank holding companies subject to enforcement actions to maintain capital ratios in excess of the minimum ratios otherwise required to be deemed well capitalized, in which case institutions may no longer be deemed to be well capitalized and may therefore be subject to certain restrictions such as taking brokered deposits. 

Volcker Rule 

In December 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies adopted final rules that implement a part of the Dodd-Frank Act commonly referred to as the &#147;Volcker Rule.&#148; Under these rules and subject to certain exceptions, banking entities are restricted from engaging in activities that are considered proprietary trading and from sponsoring or investing in certain entities, including hedge or private equity funds that are considered &#147;covered funds.&#148; These rules became effective on April 1, 2014, although certain provisions are subject to delayed effectiveness under rules promulgated by the FRB. The Company and the Bank held no investment positions at December 31, 2015 which were subject to the final rule. Therefore, while these new rules may require us to conduct certain internal analysis and reporting to ensure continued compliance, they did not require any material changes in our operations or business. 

Bank Holding Company Regulation 

Bank holding companies and their subsidiaries are subject to significant regulation and restrictions by Federal and State laws and regulatory agencies, which may affect the cost of doing business, and may limit permissible activities and expansion or impact the competitive balance between banks and other financial services providers. 

A wide range of requirements and restrictions are contained in both Federal and State banking laws, which together with implementing regulatory authority: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Require periodic reports and such additional reports of information as the Federal Reserve may require; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Require bank holding companies to meet or exceed increased levels of capital (See &#147;Capital Adequacy Requirements&#148;); 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Require that bank holding companies serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to subsidiary banks and commit resources as necessary to support each subsidiary bank; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Limit of dividends payable to shareholders and restrict the ability of bank holding companies to obtain dividends or other distributions from their subsidiary banks. The Company&#146;s ability to pay dividends on both its common and preferred stock is subject to legal and regulatory restrictions. Substantially all of the Company&#146;s funds to pay dividends or to pay principal and interest on our debt obligations are derived from dividends paid by the Bank; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Require a bank holding company to terminate an activity or terminate control of or liquidate or divest certain subsidiaries, affiliates or investments if the Federal Reserve believes the activity or the control of the subsidiary or affiliate constitutes a significant risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of any bank subsidiary; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Require the prior approval of senior executive officer or director changes and prohibit golden parachute payments, including change in control agreements, or new employment agreements with such payment terms, which are contingent upon termination if an institution is in &#147;troubled condition&#148;; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Regulate provisions of certain bank holding company debt, including the authority to impose interest ceilings and reserve requirements on such debt and require prior approval to purchase or redeem securities in certain situations; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; Require prior approval for the acquisition of 5% or more of the voting stock of a bank or bank holding company by bank holding companies or other acquisitions and mergers with banks and consider certain competitive, management, financial, anti-money-laundering compliance, potential impact on U.S. financial stability or other factors in granting these approvals, in addition to similar California or other state banking agency approvals which may also be required; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Require prior notice and/or prior approval of the acquisition of control of a bank or a bank holding company by a shareholder or individuals acting in concert with ownership or control of 10% of the voting stock being a presumption of control. 

Other Restrictions on the Company&#146;s Activities 

Subject to prior notice or Federal Reserve approval, bank holding companies may generally engage in, or acquire shares of companies engaged in, activities determined by the Federal Reserve to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Bank holding companies which elect and retain &#147;financial holding company&#148; status pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (&#147;GLBA&#148;) may engage in these nonbanking activities and broader securities, insurance, merchant banking and other activities that are determined to be &#147;financial in nature&#148; or are incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature without prior Federal Reserve approval. Pursuant to GLBA and Dodd-Frank, in order to elect and retain financial holding company status, a bank holding company and all depository institution subsidiaries of a bank holding company must be considered well capitalized and well managed, and, except in limited circumstances, depository subsidiaries must be in satisfactory compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act (&#147;CRA&#148;), which requires banks to help meet the credit needs of the communities in which they operate. Failure to sustain compliance with these requirements or correct any non-compliance within a fixed time period could lead to divestiture of subsidiary banks or require all activities to conform to those permissible for a bank holding company. CVB has not elected financial holding company status and neither CVB nor the Bank has engaged in any activities determined by the Federal Reserve to be financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature. 

CVB is also a bank holding company within the meaning of Section 3700 of the California Financial Code. Therefore, CVB and any of its subsidiaries are subject to examination by, and may be required to file reports with, the California Department of Business Oversight (&#147;DBO&#148;). DBO approvals may also be required for certain mergers and acquisitions. 

Securities Exchange Act of 1934 

CVB&#146;s common stock is publicly held and listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market (&#147;NASDAQ&#148;), and CVB is subject to the periodic reporting, information, proxy solicitation, insider trading, corporate governance and other requirements and restrictions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;) promulgated thereunder as well as listing requirements of NASDAQ. 

Sarbanes-Oxley Act 

The Company is subject to the accounting oversight and corporate governance requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, including, among other things, required executive certification of financial presentations, requirements for board audit committees and their members, and disclosure of controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. 

Bank Regulation 

As a California commercial bank whose deposits are insured by the FDIC, the Bank is subject to regulation, supervision, and regular examination by the DBO and by the FDIC, as the Bank&#146;s primary Federal regulator, and 

&#160; 

must additionally comply with certain applicable regulations of the Federal Reserve. Specific federal and state laws and regulations which are applicable to banks regulate, among other things, the scope of their business, their investments, their reserves against deposits, the timing of the availability of deposited funds, their activities relating to dividends, investments, loans, the nature and amount of and collateral for certain loans, servicing and foreclosing on loans, borrowings, capital requirements, certain check-clearing activities, branching, and mergers and acquisitions. California banks are also subject to statutes and regulations including Federal Reserve Regulation O and Federal Reserve Act Sections 23A and 23B and Regulation W, which restrict or limit loans or extensions of credit to &#147;insiders&#148;, including officers, directors, and principal shareholders, and loans or extension of credit by banks to affiliates or purchases of assets from affiliates, including parent bank holding companies, except pursuant to certain exceptions and only on terms and conditions at least as favorable to those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated parties. 

Pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (&#147;FDI Act&#148;) and the California Financial Code, California state chartered commercial banks may generally engage in any activity permissible for national banks. Therefore, the Bank may form subsidiaries to engage in the many so-called &#147;closely related to banking&#148; or &#147;nonbanking&#148; activities commonly conducted by national banks in operating subsidiaries or in subsidiaries of bank holding companies. Further, California banks may conduct certain &#147;financial&#148; activities permitted under GLBA in a &#147;financial subsidiary&#148; to the same extent as may a national bank, provided the bank is and remain s &#147;well-capitalized,&#148; &#147;well-managed&#148; and in satisfactory compliance with the CRA. The Bank currently has no financial subsidiaries. 

FDIC and DBO Enforcement Authority 

The federal and California regulatory structure gives the bank regulatory agencies extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of appropriate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. The regulatory agencies have adopted guidelines to assist in identifying and addressing potential safety and soundness concerns before an institution&#146;s capital becomes impaired. The guidelines establish operational and managerial standards generally relating to: (1) internal controls, information systems, and internal audit systems; (2) loan documentation; (3) credit underwriting; (4) interest-rate exposure; (5) asset growth and asset quality; and (6) compensation, fees, and benefits. Further, the regulatory agencies have adopted safety and soundness guidelines for asset quality and for evaluating and monitoring earnings to ensure that earnings are sufficient for the maintenance of adequate capital and reserves. If, as a result of an examination, the DBO or the FDIC should determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, or other aspects of the Bank&#146;s operations are unsatisfactory or that the Bank or its management is violating or has violated any law or regulation, the DBO and the FDIC , and separately the FDIC as insurer of the Bank&#146;s deposits, have residual authority to: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Direct an increase in capital and the maintenance of higher specific minimum capital ratios, which could preclude the Bank from being deemed well capitalized and restrict its ability to accept certain brokered deposits; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Restrict the Bank&#146;s growth geographically, by products and services, or by mergers and acquisitions, including bidding in FDIC receiverships for failed banks; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Enter into or issue informal or formal enforcement actions, including required Board resolutions, Matters Requiring Board Attention (MRBA), written agreements and consent or cease and desist orders or prompt corrective action orders to take corrective action and cease unsafe and unsound practices; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Require prior approval of senior executive officer or director changes; remove officers and directors and assess civil monetary penalties; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Terminate FDIC insurance, revoke the charter and/or take possession of and close and liquidate the Bank or appoint the FDIC as receiver. 

&#160; 

Deposit Insurance 

The FDIC is an independent federal agency that insures deposits, up to prescribed statutory limits, of federally insured banks and savings institutions and safeguards the safety and soundness of the banking and savings industries. The FDIC insures our customer deposits through the DIF up to prescribed limits for each depositor. The Dodd-Frank Act revised the FDIC&#146;s DIF management authority by setting requirements for the Designated Reserve Ratio (the DIF balance divided by estimated insured deposits) and redefining the assessment base, which is used to calculate banks&#146; quarterly assessments. The amount of FDIC assessments paid by each DIF member institution is based on its asset size and relative risk of default as measured by regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory factors. The FDIC may terminate a depository institution&#146;s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution&#146;s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices that pose a risk to the DIF or that may prejudice the interest of the bank&#146;s depositors. The termination of deposit insurance for a bank would also result in the revocation of the bank&#146;s charter by the DBO. 

We are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance, which can be affected by the cost of bank failures to the FDIC among other factors. In October 2015, the FDIC published for comment a proposed rule that would enable the FDIC to reach a 1.35% DIF reserve ratio by September 30, 2020, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. by imposing a surcharge on the quarterly assessments of depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more, which could have potential impact on the bank&#146;s deposit insurance assessments in future years. Any future increases in FDIC insurance premiums may have a material and adverse effect on our earnings and could have a material adverse effect on the value of, or market for, our common stock. 

Dividends 

It is the Federal Reserve&#146;s policy that bank holding companies should generally pay dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year, and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization&#146;s expected future needs and financial condition. It is also the Federal Reserve&#146;s policy that bank holding companies should not maintain dividend levels that undermine their ability to be a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries. The Federal Reserve also discourages dividend payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels unless both asset quality and capital are very strong. 

The Bank is a legal entity that is separate and distinct from its holding company. The Company is dependent on the performance of the Bank for funds which may be received as dividends from the Bank for use in the operation of the Company and the ability of the Company to pay dividends to shareholders. Future cash dividends by the Bank will also depend upon management&#146;s assessment of future capital requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors. The new Capital Rules may restrict dividends by the Bank if the additional capital conservation buffer is not achieved. See &#147;Capital Adequacy Requirements&#148;. 

The power of the board of directors of the Bank to declare a cash dividend to CVB is subject to California law, which restricts the amount available for cash dividends to the lesser of a bank&#146;s retained earnings or net income for its last three fiscal years (less any distributions to shareholders made during such period). Where the above test is not met, cash dividends may still be paid, with the prior approval of the DBO, in an amount not exceeding the greatest of (1) retained earnings of the bank; (2) the net income of the bank for its last fiscal year; or (3) the net income of the bank for its current fiscal year. 

Operations and Consumer Compliance Laws 

The Bank must comply with numerous federal and state anti-money laundering and consumer protection statutes and implementing regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, the Bank Secrecy Act, the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, the CRA, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Home 

&#160; 

Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the National Flood Insurance Act, the California Homeowner Bill of Rights and various federal and state privacy protection laws, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act , CAN-SPAM Act. Noncompliance with any of these laws could subject the Bank to compliance enforcement actions as well as lawsuits and could also result in administrative penalties, including, fines and reimbursements. The Bank and the Company are also subject to federal and state laws prohibiting unfair or fraudulent business practices, untrue or misleading advertising and unfair competition. 

These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure and reporting requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans, servicing, collecting and foreclosure of loans, and providing other services. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can subject the Bank and the Company to various penalties, including but not limited to enforcement actions, injunctions, fines or criminal penalties, punitive damages to consumers, and the loss of certain contractual rights. 

The Bank received a &#147;Satisfactory&#148; rating in its most recent FDIC CRA performance evaluation, which measures how financial institutions support their communities in the areas of lending, investment and service. 

Dodd-Frank provided for the creation of the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (&#147;CFPB&#148;) as an independent entity within the Federal Reserve with broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services, including deposit products, residential mortgages, home-equity loans and credit cards. The bureau&#146;s functions include investigating consumer complaints, conducting market research, rulemaking, supervising and examining bank consumer transactions, and enforcing rules related to consumer financial products and services. CFPB regulations and guidance apply to all financial institutions and banks with $10 billion or more in assets are subject to examination by the CFPB. Banks with less than $10 billion in assets, including the Bank, will continue to be examined for compliance by their primary federal banking agency. 

In 2014, the CFPB adopted revisions to Regulation Z, which implement the Truth in Lending Act, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, and apply to all consumer mortgages (except home equity lines of credit, timeshare plans, reverse mortgages, or temporary loans). The revisions mandate specific underwriting criteria for home loans in order for creditors to make a reasonable, good faith determination of a consumer&#146;s ability to repay and establish certain protections from liability under this requirement for &#147;qualified mortgages&#148; meeting certain standards. In general, a &#147;qualified mortgage&#148; is a mortgage loan without negative amortization, interest-only payments, balloon payments, or terms exceeding 30 years. In addition, to be a qualified mortgage the points and fees paid by a consumer cannot exceed 3% of the total loan amount. The Bank primarily makes non-qualified mortgages and continues to employ its best efforts to comply with the new TRID requirements.
