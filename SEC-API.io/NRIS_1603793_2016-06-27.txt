 Item 1. Business. 

&#160; 

Our Company 

&#160; 

International Western Petroleum, Inc. (&#8220;IWP&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was incorporated on February 19, 2014 as a Nevada corporation and is based in Irving, Texas. The Company was formed to conduct operations in the oil and gas industry. We are an oil and natural gas company that focuses on the acquisition, development, and exploration of crude oil and natural gas properties in Texas. On May 4, 2015, the Company acquired significant working interests from the Bend Arch Lion 1A Joint Venture and the Bend Arch Lion 1B Joint Venture encompassing a total production of seven (7) producing oil and gas wells on a total 380 acres out of 777 acres of the Bend Arch Lion project showing proven recoverable reserves of approximately 429.48 Mbbl and 353.78 MMcf. To date, the Company, together with its affiliated operator; International Western Oil Corporation (IWO), have completed drilling an additional three (3) oil and gas wells, thus totaling ten (10) gross wells in production. It is noted that the Bend Arch Lion 1A and 1B Joint Ventures are parts of the total 777-acre leaseholds that have not been fully explored. Currently, IWO holds approximately 2,400 acres in leaseholds in the Central West Texas region. The Company plans to acquire additional leaseholds from IWO in the future.

&#160; 

The Company is continually seeking strategic investors to help it develop additional exploration projects located within the Bend Arch-Fort Worth Basin as well as other prime acquisition targets in the Central West, South and East Texas. As such, the Company is working on obtaining enough funding to provide a budget for new acquisitions in the remaining calendar year of 2016 as well as new exploration projects in 2017 to meet its financial objectives during the fiscal year ending February 28, 2017. 

&#160; 

Business Strategy 

&#160; 

We are an E&#38;P (Exploration &#38; Production) oil and natural gas company that focuses on the acquisition, development, and exploration of crude oil and natural gas properties in Texas. The Company is currently managed by business and oil and gas exploration veterans who specialize in the oil and gas acquisition and exploration markets of the Central West Texas region. The Company&#8217;s goal is to tap into the high potential leases of the Central West Texas region of the United States, aiming to unlock its potential, specifically in the prolific Bend Arch-Forth Worth region. This area is approximately 120 miles long and 40 miles wide running from Archer County, Texas in the north to Brown County, Texas in the south. Indeed, it has been one of the most active drilling areas during the recent resurgence of United States drilling activities.

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer, Ross Henry Ramsey, and his family have participated in a number of exploration projects with several major oil and gas companies. Management believes that state-of the-art technology is one of the key differentiators of the Company. Oil and natural gas reserve development is a highly technologically oriented industry. Management believes that the use of leading edge technology has greatly increased the success rate of finding commercial oil or natural gas deposits. In this context, success rate means the ability to make an oil/gas well that can produce a commercialized quantity of hydrocarbons. In general, the Company expects to apply georadiometry exploration technology to determine the drilling locations and the drilling depths as it has applied this technology via its last 10 drilling projects, resulting in 100% success rate so far. 

&#160; 

Our core business strategy is to: 

&#160; 

(a) acquire petroleum exploration companies with moderate production growth and add capital infusion and advanced technologies to instigate explosive growth;

&#160;

(b) acquire large-reserve land leases and perform initial explorations on those leases to add value as &#8220;proven reserve&#8221; properties and then sell them off at multiples of the cost basis;

&#160; 

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

(c) acquire mature oil and gas production with large reserves and apply new EOR (Enhanced Oil Recovery) methods to increase production revenues; and

&#160;

(d) develop more oil and natural gas reserves via leaseholds acquisitions to increase the Company&#8217;s valuation.

&#160; 

Our operation strategy is to identify &#8220;prime time&#8221; hydrocarbon land leases in Texas with in-depth studies and develop proven reserves via drilling new wells and re-entering existing low production wells to maximize production and enhance valuation of our production assets. We also plan to position the Company in the international marketplace as a petroleum expert in the United States to partner up with multinational oil and gas players after establishing our new presence in the Permian Basin of Texas and applying state-of-the-art exploration technology on our new leases. 

&#160; 

Based upon Management&#8217;s general management and petroleum exploration experience as well as its geology expertise and its ability to identify high potential acreage and high production fields, Management believes that the Company&#8217;s near future valuation as a public company is attractive.

&#160;

Our immediate revenue strategy today is to acquire existing production with large reserves and unlock their full potential by new enhanced oil recovery (&#8220;EOR&#8221;) methods and drilling new wells to be hand-picked by Management. We are at full speed to acquire and develop more reserves to increase and create enduring value of our company.

&#160; 

Rationale 

&#160; 

It is the time for a company like us with no liabilities to take advantage of the current low oil prices to acquire high potential production at low cost. Management believes there are opportunities for profits to be made once oil prices start moving up. Unlike many major oil companies that often drill very deep wells with a high degree of risk, we are a specialist in shallow well exploration (sub 5,000 feet) that is less expensive and has lower risk factors. That is our most important exploration practice.

&#160;

Management believes our CEO is a true &#8220;oil man&#8221; who is a local West Texan and has a special talent in acquiring local &#8220;prime time&#8221; hydrocarbon land leases that have the high potential for hydrocarbon reserves. Management believes that these prospective leases are currently &#8220;under the radar&#8221; because the wells that can be drilled in these prospective leases will have the capacity to normally produce only up to 100 barrels (&#8220;Bbls&#8221;) of oil per day per well. As such, Management believes that these highly valuable leases are not economically justifiable for the major oil and gas companies in the region because such companies need the wells they dig to produce at least 300 Bbls of oil per day per well.

&#160;

The basis for Management&#8217;s belief that the wells that can be drilled in the prospective leases will have the capacity to produce a reasonable amount of hydrocarbon and due to our recent studies of the general areas where we are prospecting the projects. We have obtained historic production of certain locations from the Railroad Commission of Texas (&#8220;Texas RRC&#8221;), the state regulatory agency that regulates the oil and gas industry in Texas. According to information from the Texas RRC and from informational products developed by Drillinginfo, Inc., some oil wells in the Ellenberger pay zone at approximately 4,500 feet to 5,000 feet in depth have produced up to an average of 100 barrels per day at the Initial Production (&#8220;IP&#8221;) of the primary production stage. Please find below some IP data that lists: bopd (Barrels of Oil per Day) and TD (Total Depth) from neighboring wells in Coleman County. These wells are within 3.5 miles of the location of the Bend Arch Lion project. Despite the historical production of nearby wells, there can be no assurance that the wells that can be drilled in our prospective leases will be productive.

&#160; 

The Company has a highly committed international team comprised of a 4th generation &#8220;oil man&#8221;, an international business executive, and a petroleum expert who will team up with local senior geologists having high credentials and in-depth local experience. 

&#160; 

The Company is currently listed on the OTCQB marketplace of OTC Link as an E&#38;P oil and gas company. The Company intends to upgrade to a senior US stock exchange in the future.

&#160; 

Technologies 

&#160; 

Management believes that technology is one of the key differentiators of the Company. Oil and natural gas reserve development is a highly technologically oriented industry; many techniques developed by the industry are now used in other industries, including the space program. Management believes that technological innovations have made it possible for the oil and natural gas industry to furnish the fuels that power the world economy. Management also believes that technology has greatly increased the success rate of finding commercial oil or natural gas deposits. In this context, success rate means the ability to make an oil/gas well that can produce a commercialized quantity of hydrocarbon. According to the website of the hydrocarbon imaging company we hired, www.hydrocarbonimaging.com, the georadiometry exploration technology that the Company will be using provides a radiometric imaging service that rivals conventional seismic and downhole logging via a surface survey of the &#8220;radiation footprint&#8221; of a given area of geography. This technology goes beyond conventional techniques in both arenas of cost and reserve identification. In general, the Company expects to apply the following technologies to determine the drilling locations and the drilling depths. 

&#160; 

Georadiometry 

&#160; 

The use of 3-D Hydrocarbon Imaging brought georadiometric technology into the cutting edge of identifying and quantifying oil reservoirs and reserves with sophisticated field equipment and software integration abilities that aided explorers in locating oil and gas leasehold reserves. All specific drilling recommendations and opinions are based upon the technical results of inferences from global positioning satellites, electrical, and gamma ray devices and calibrated measurements based on georadiometric technology. 3-D Hydrocarbon Imaging rivals conventional seismic and downhole logging for reserve identification. This technology goes beyond conventional techniques in both arenas of cost and reserve identification and has been leveraged to meet the needs of the industry. 3-D Hydrocarbon Imaging has taken historical radiometric technology to a more complete and reliable level today. Historical documentation of radiometric&#8217;s success ratio and interpretation average above 90% in its accuracy. To date, this radiometry technology has demonstrated that it has clearly improved on this with its thoroughness in gathering field data and applying its sophisticated computer modeling and interpretation. 

&#160; 

Hydrocarbon Satellite Imaging 

&#160; 

Hydrocarbon survey maps are generated from several data sources downloaded from scientific instruments installed on Earth orbit satellites. These instruments are designed to retrieve physical data from outer space as well as from the Earth. Instruments installed on the satellites include, for our use, Radar, Infrared (Temperature), Radiation (Radiometrics), Dialectic Potential (Tellurics), Ionization, and Geo-Magnetics. These data sets are stacked and embedded into each data stream that result in the final map interpretation. All of these exploration techniques can be done separately with land based tools but with the use of satellites it is possible to cover much larger areas more economically. 

&#160; 

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Directional Drilling 

&#160; 

Drilling technology has come a long way over the years. Among the most recent advancements in drilling are Rotary Steerable tools which allow three dimensional control of the bit without stopping the drill string. One of the benefits of this technology is increasing the exposed section throughout the target reservoir by drilling through it at an angle. Directional drilling also allows drilling into reservoirs where vertical access is difficult or not possible; for instance, an oilfield under a town, lake, or hard to drill through formation. 

&#160; 

Fracturing Technology 

&#160; 

Fracturing technology allows the industry to get more oil or natural gas out of each deposit that it finds. Newer stimulation technologies, completion treatment fluids, and enhanced recovery techniques enable the oil or natural gas to move more easily to producing well bores. Hydraulic fracturing techniques create small cracks from the well bore into the reservoir rock. A &#8220;propant&#8221; (usually sand), is then pumped into the formation to keep the fractures open. These fractures serve as a &#8220;highway&#8221; for the hydrocarbons to be produced. Horizontal-drilling technologies allow the reservoir to be penetrated horizontally rather than vertically, opening more of the reservoir to the well bore and enhancing recovery. &#8220;Acidizing&#8221;, is another stimulation technique that is frequently used in carbonate (limestone, dolomite) reservoirs to increase porosity, permeability and to enhance recovery. Sometimes the techniques of fracturing and acidizing are combined in an &#8220;acid-frac job&#8221; resulting in increased production. Secondary and tertiary recovery techniques can include &#8220;water flood&#8221; which utilizes water injection wells to push oil from partially depleted reservoirs to recovery wells. CO2 injection wells pressure up the depleted reservoir for the same purpose of increasing production. 

&#160; 

At IWP, we have a passion for Geoscience while understanding complex mineralogy in shale reservoirs and better determining zones prone to fracture stimulation. This technology knows where to frack by providing us with rapid loads of massive data while delivering game changing levels of collaboration: multi-well, multi-user and multi interpreter. Our field engineers, geologists and petrophysicists work together for better drilling decisions.

&#160; 

&#8220;Green&#8221; Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) Technology 

&#160; 

With billions of barrels of oil remain untapped around the world, the Company has recently identified a proven EOR technology that has been applied to diverse environments in over 40 oil fields in 4 continents with 92% average increase in mature productions in over 300 well applications. This proprietary technology produces environmentally safe, consistent and repeatable results, thus increasing cash flow, oil reserves, and property value. 

&#160; 

Reservoir Estimate 

&#160; 

The Company acquired the working interests of the 2 production joint ventures in the Bend Arch-Fort Worth region of Texas. The Bend Arch is a prolific structure that, Management believes, still contains a vast amount of commercial hydrocarbons. This structure has yielded a large amount of commercial revenue from hydrocarbon recovery for over 80 years. Management believes that a study of the history of prospecting for oil and gas in the Bend Arch reveals that a treasure trove of oil and gas reserves still exist because, Management believes, early oilmen often failed to use a methodical approach or a calculated drilling program to fully find and develop many of the fields that exist in the Bend Arch.

&#160; 

Historically speaking, in 1917, discovery of the Ranger field stimulated, Management believes, one of the largest exploration and development &#8220;booms&#8221; in Texas. The Ranger field produces oil from the Atoka-Bend formation, a sandstone-conglomerate reservoir that directly overlies the Barnett formation. Operators drilled more than 1,000 wildcat wells in and around the Fort Worth basin attempting to duplicate the success of Ranger. These wildcat efforts resulted in the discovery of more fields and production from numerous other reservoirs including Strawn fluvial/deltaic sandstone, Atoka-Bend fluvial/deltaic sandstone and conglomerate, Marble Falls carbonate bank limestone, Barnett siliceous shale, and Ellenberger dolomitic limestone. 

&#160; 

One of the major leases we are looking at lies on the western edge of Coleman County. This is on the western dip of the Bend Arch as it starts to dip westerly and extend until it merges with the Permian Basin. Management believes that prolific oil and gas revenues have been generated on this western flank of the Arch because of the many folds, anticlines, and strategic traps that are present. Early drilled wells showed both oil and gas in commercial quantities. However, encountering gas before reaching the oil bearing zone resulted, Management believes, in many wells being abandoned because historical data shows that the price of gas per MCF only reached $1.00/MCF in 1980. 

&#160; 

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Historical well data for Coleman County, Texas as well as many drilled and producing wells surrounding our prospective leases show, Management believes, that production has come from as many as 5 different pay-zones on a commercial basis. The 5 pay-zones (Fry, Tannehill, Strawn Sands (consisting of Gray, Gardner, and 2 other consolidated sands), Caddo, and Ellenberger) are dispersed on the western flank of the Arch and are present in our prospective leases. 

&#160; 

The Bend Arch region has a history of wells producing oil and gas for 40 to 60 years at, Management believes, an attractive commercial rate in primary production mode, secondary recovery mode, and even tertiary recovery mode with, Management believes, time on our side which means modern technology will become more advanced in the future. 

&#160; 

Oil and Gas Market Outlook 

&#160; 

According to an April 2016 press release discussing the consulting firm Frost &#38; Sullivan&#8217;s release of a report entitled, 2016 Global Outlook of the Oil and Gas Industry, &#8220;the decline in the oil price is causing hardships for some exploration companies, but will increase opportunities for those with the financial resources to acquire value assets that become available.&#8221; 

&#160; 

(The below is a summary of Portions of &#8220;The Outlook for Energy: A View to 2040 &#8211; Highlights&#8221; 

http://www.exxonmobil.com/MENA-English/PA/Files/English_Energy_Outlook2013_Highlights.pdf) 

&#160; 

Global energy demand will be about 35% higher in 2040 compared to 2010, as economic output more than doubles and prosperity expands across a world whose population will grow to nearly 9 billion people. Energy demand growth will slow as economies mature, efficiency gains accelerate and population growth moderates. 

&#160; 

In the countries belonging to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) &#8211; including countries in North America and Europe &#8211; we see energy use remaining essentially flat, even as these countries achieve economic growth and even higher living standards. In contrast, Non OECD energy demand will grow by 65%. China&#8217;s surge in energy demand will extend over the next decade then gradually flatten as its economy matures and energy efficiency improves. Elsewhere, billions of people will be working to advance their living standards &#8211; requiring more energy. 

&#160; 

Demand for coal will peak and begin a gradual decline, in part because of emerging policies that will seek to curb emissions by imposing a cost on higher-carbon fuels. Use of renewable energies and nuclear power will grow significantly. 

&#160; 

Natural gas will grow fast enough to overtake coal for the number-two position behind oil. For both oil and natural gas, an increasing share of global supply will come from unconventional sources such as those produced from shale formations. 

&#160; 

Global energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions will grow slowly, then level off around 2030. In the United States and Europe, where a shift from coal to less carbon-intensive fuels such as natural gas already is under way, emissions will decline through 2040. 

&#160; 

In one of the most significant development shown over the Outlook for Energy, advancements in drilling technology will cause natural gas to overtake coal as the No. 2 fuel source by 2040. Oil is projected to remain the No.1 fuel. Oil and gas will supply 60 % of global demand in 2040, up from 55% percent in 2010. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Sales Strategy 

&#160; 

Abilene, Texas is the closest city with oil handling and sales firms. Our sales strategy in relation to spot pricing will be to produce less when the sales price is lower and produce more when the sales price is higher. To maintain the lowest production cost, we will aim to have our inventory be virtually zero. Members of the Ramsey family that are related to our CEO have business relationships with BML and Transport Oil. The Company intends to leverage these business relationships in order to enter into material agreements with BML and Transport Oil so that, as our tier 1 buyers, they can handle pick-up and sales of our crude stock to refineries.

&#160; 

As such, crude oil will be picked up from the leases as needed during the calendar month. At the end of the month the crude total sales will be tallied by lease and the 30-day average of the daily closing of oil will be tabulated. On or about the 25th of the following month the proceeds checks will be issued to the financial parties of record.

Operational Plans 

&#160; 

During fiscal year 2017, the Company is actively looking for large-reserve oil and gas concessions and existing production to acquire and continue to raise enough capital via equity financing options to meet its operational goal in fiscal year 2017.

&#160;

Based on Management&#8217;s general management and petroleum exploration experience as well as its geology expertise, the Company believes in its ability to identify high potential acreages and high production fields.

&#160;

Since the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, the Company has reviewed several good acquisition candidates in the West, Permian Basin and South Texas. After identifying any new prospect, additional research and evaluation was carried out using personal contacts, geologists, seismic, satellite hydrocarbon imaging, production data and every available resource to glean information and data in order to make an acquisition decision. Our operational plan after each acquisition is to increase production of the acquired oil and gas properties using state-of-the-art production technologies using a designated budget pre-approved by the Company&#8217;s senior management team.

&#160;

The Company has plans to design a cost effective operating budget for each exploration project associated with an acquisition project and each budget will vary depending on the total depth of drilling and whether it is a new drilling or a re-entry. For each project, the Company plans on hiring selected operators to work under the close supervision of a core team of Company geologists, engineers and scientists.

&#160; 

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

The exploration process is a 2-phase process: 1) drilling and testing and 2) well completion. The Company plans on hiring drilling specialists and technical consultants designated to oversee the drilling for each well during the drilling and testing phase. For the well completion process, the Company will hire technical data collectors and cementing operators to ensure the best performance upon perforating the wells at different pay zones based on thorough technical advisory work done by our internal and external geologists before production.

&#160;

The Company also has an immediate operational plan to apply selective leading edge Enhanced Oil Recovery (&#8220;EOR&#8221;) technologies from technology vendors to improve existing production after each future acquisition.

&#160;

To date, the Company has prospected and completed several exploration and acquisition projects:

&#160;

On May 4, 2015, the Company acquired a 39.5% working interest from International Western Oil Corporation (&#8220;IWO&#8221;) in the Bend Arch Lion 1A Joint Venture (the Pittard Bend Arch White property encompassing 160 acres &#8211; State ID# 21488) (the &#8220;1A Venture&#8221;) and a 50% working interest in the Bend Arch Lion 1B Joint Venture (the Pittard Bend Arch Red property encompassing 220 acres - State ID# 13121) (the &#8220;1B Venture&#8221;). By acquiring these working interests, the Company will directly receive the share of working interest revenue (after accounting for applicable taxes, expenses, and landowner royalties) IWO was receiving prior to the acquisitions.

&#160; 

Exploration 

&#160; 

The Bend Arch Lion Project is a multi-well exploration opportunity that includes several drilling programs. In May 2015, the Company acquired significant working interests from two drilling joint venture programs as described in more detail below. Management believes this is the first achievement of our core business as the result of our in-depth studies showing high quality proven reserves in several pay zones highlighted by the &#8220;Gray Sand&#8221; pay zone and in some instances the &#8220;Ellenberger&#8221; pay zone. 

&#160; 

The Bend Arch Tiger Project is multi-well exploration program expanding over 310 acres, also located in the historical Bend Arch/Ft. Worth Basin. The Bend Arch Tiger Project targets the Ellenburger formation expanding over 310 acres, also located in the historical Bend Arch/Ft. Worth Basin. This project has is an infield drilling package aimed at 4,700 feet highlighted by the Ellenburger and Jennings Sand pay zones as well as many others. At the present time, this project is under a very extensive study for horizontal drilling using a new, proprietary exploration technology that, management believes, can offer a substantial increase from the normal production in this field. Currently, there are producers drilled in 1983 with a very low and stable decline curve. IWP has access to injection well from this leasehold for the Bend Arch Lion 1A JV and has identified initial drilling locations to date. 

&#160; 

Completed Acquisitions 

&#160; 

The Bend Arch Lion 1A JV is a 160-acre leasehold having 4 producing wells which have been drilled by our Texas-based operating partner International Western Oil. In May 2015, the Company acquired working interests of this leasehold which has been surveyed with high quality proven reserves encompassing several pay zones highlighted by the Gray Sand and in some instances the Ellenburger pay zone. The Company plans to apply a suitable EOR technology after further review in in order to increase its production. Based on our recent studies, there are the necessary inclusionary and sedimentary formations for hydrocarbon generation and deposits and geology studies have concluded that there are significant hydrocarbon reserves present on this property. With additional geology studies, we have also identified additional drilling locations on this concession.

&#160;

The Bend Arch Lion 1B JV is a 220-acre leasehold having 6 new producing wells which have been drilled by our Texas-based operating partner International Western Oil. In May 2015, the Company acquired working interests of this leasehold which has been surveyed with high quality proven reserves encompassing several pay zones highlighted by the Gray Sand and in some instances the Ellenburger pay zone. At the moment, the leasehold has 3 producing wells coming from the Gray Sand formation and 3 producing wells coming from the Ellenberger formation. The Company plans to apply a suitable EOR technology on the Ellenburger formation to significantly increase its production in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. Based on our recent studies, there are the necessary inclusionary and sedimentary formations for hydrocarbon generation and deposits and geology studies have concluded that there are significant hydrocarbon reserves present on this property. With additional geology studies, we have also identified additional drilling locations on this concession.
