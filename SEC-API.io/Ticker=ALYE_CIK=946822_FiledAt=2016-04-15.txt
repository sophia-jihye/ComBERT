 Item 1. Business 

&#160;

General 

&#160;

Throughout this report, we refer to Aly Energy Services, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, as "we," "our", "us," "Aly Energy" or "the Company."

&#160;

We provide a variety of oilfield services to owners and operators of oil and gas wells. Generally, these services fall within the following three categories:

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Surface rental equipment

&#160;

&#183; 

Solids control systems

&#160;

&#183; 

Directional drilling and measurement-while-drilling ("MWD") services

&#160;

On July 17, 2012, Munawar "Micki" Hidayatallah founded and incorporated Aly Operating Inc. ("Aly Operating"), in Delaware with the strategic objective of creating an oilfield services company that serves exploration and production companies from well planning to plug and abandonment. We have grown our business both through organic growth resulting from investment in existing operations and through the acquisition of existing businesses operating in our industry.

&#160;

Since 2012, we have completed three acquisitions: the acquisition of Austin Chalk Petroleum Services Corp. ("Austin Chalk") in October 2012, the acquisition of United Centrifuge LLC ("United") and the leased fixed assets associated with that business in April 2014, and the acquisition of Evolution Guidance Systems Inc. ("Evolution") in July 2014. Subsequent to the acquisition of each of these businesses, we have made significant investments to expand their operations and capitalize on organic growth opportunities in existing and expansion markets. We consistently seek opportunities to bundle product offerings and to cross sell services across markets and product lines, which we believe increases client retention and the utilization of our equipment.

&#160;

Our growth strategy focuses on pursuing organic growth and, when capital resources are available, acquiring existing businesses. The strategy consists of the following elements: 

&#160;

&#183; 

increase inventory of rental products and increase capacity to provide services;

&#160;

&#183; 

add new and differentiated product and service offerings;

&#160;

&#183; 

expand into new geographic markets; and, diversify and grow our customer base.

&#160;

Acquisition of Austin Chalk 

&#160;

On October 26, 2012, we acquired all of the stock of Austin Chalk for a total purchase price of $22.5 million. Total consideration included $17.9 million cash (net of cash acquired of approximately $58,000), a payable of $0.8 million and the issuance of 4.0 million shares of redeemable preferred stock at Aly Operating ("Aly Operating Redeemable Preferred Stock"), $0.01 par value, at fair value of $3.8 million.

&#160;

Austin Chalk is a provider of high performance, explosion-resistant rental equipment used primarily in land-based horizontal drilling. Austin Chalk currently offers a robust inventory of surface rental equipment as well as roustabout services, including the rig-up and rig-down of equipment and the hauling of equipment to and from the customer's location.

&#160;

Share Exchange 

&#160;

On May 14, 2013, Preferred Voice, Inc. ("Preferred Voice") and Aly Operating entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the "Exchange Agreement"). Preferred Voice, incorporated in 1992, provided operations in the telecommunications space through January 2012 at which time it discontinued all operations. From and after that date, Preferred Voice was deemed to be a "shell company" (as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act.

&#160;

Prior to the execution and delivery of the Exchange Agreement, Preferred Voice's board of directors approved the Exchange Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. Similarly, the board of directors of Aly Operating approved the Exchange Agreement.

&#160;

Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, the holders of common stock of Aly Operating surrendered all of their shares in exchange for approximately 3.4 million newly issued shares of common stock of Preferred Voice (the "Share Exchange"), representing approximately 92% of the outstanding common stock of Preferred Voice after giving effect to the Share Exchange. Shares were exchanged at the ratio of 19.91 shares of Preferred Voice common stock for each one share of Aly Operating common stock.

&#160;

Immediately after the execution and delivery of the Exchange Agreement, Preferred Voice amended its certificate of incorporation to change its name from Preferred Voice to Aly Energy Services, Inc. 

&#160;

For financial accounting purposes, this acquisition was a reverse acquisition of Preferred Voice by Aly Operating under the acquisition method of accounting and was treated as a recapitalization with Aly Operating as the accounting acquirer. 

&#160;

Acquisition of United 

&#160;

On April 15, 2014, we acquired the equity interests of United as well as certain assets used in United's business that were owned by related parties of United (collectively the "United Acquisition"). In connection with the United Acquisition, United merged with and into Aly Centrifuge Inc. ("Aly Centrifuge"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Aly Energy. United operates within the solids control sector of the oilfield services industry, offering its customers the option of renting centrifuges and auxiliary solids control equipment without personnel or the option of paying for a full-service solids control package which includes operators on-site 24 hours a day. United owns centrifuges which are differentiated from the competition due to the ability to remove the rotating assembly from a centrifuge within 45 minutes while on the rig site thereby minimizing customer down time.

&#160;

Total consideration for the United Acquisition of $24.5 million included $15.1 million cash, net of cash acquired of approximately $0.6 million, the issuance of 5,000 shares of redeemable preferred stock at Aly Centrifuge ("Aly Centrifuge Redeemable Preferred Stock"), $0.01 par value, at a fair value of $5.1 million, contingent consideration of up to $5.0 million in aggregate over 3 years at a fair value of $3.5 million, and a payable of $0.8 million. The contingent consideration consists of up to three future cash payments to the sellers in an amount equal to 5% of the gross revenues of the business acquired for each of the 12 month periods ending on March 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017. The payment for the 12 months ending March 31, 2015 was $0.9 million.

&#160;

Acquisition of Evolution 

&#160;

On July 1, 2014, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding stock of Evolution, which specializes in providing MWD services. Total consideration was approximately $2.0 million, consisting of the issuance of 150,000 shares of common stock at an estimated fair value of $1.7 million and a payable of $0.3 million. Subsequent to the acquisition, we expanded the Evolution service offering by adding full package directional drilling services. In addition, we fabricated five MWD kits that we believe provide a technological advantage over other MWD kits on the market.

Products and Services 

&#160;

We are a provider of solids control systems, surface rental equipment, and directional drilling and MWD services. Our equipment and services are primarily designed for and used in land-based horizontal drilling. Our equipment includes centrifuges and auxiliary solids control equipment, mud circulating tanks (400 and 500 barrel capacity) and auxiliary surface rental equipment, portable mud mixing plants, containment systems, and MWD kits. In conjunction with the rental of some of our solids control packages and MWD kits, we provide personnel at the customer's well site to operate our equipment. We also provide personnel to rig-up/rig-down and haul our equipment to and from the customer's location.

&#160;

Rental Products 

&#160;

Centrifuges: We currently own approximately 77 centrifuges. We provide three different sizes of centrifuges to meet varying client specifications: SS800, SS1000, and SS2000. We purchase our centrifuges from United Oilfield Inc. with whom we have a supply agreement. The supply agreement, among other things, grants us exclusivity to purchase centrifuges from and manufactured by United Oilfield Inc. for use in the oilfield services industry in the United States. We believe our centrifuges provide a competitive advantage because the rotating assembly within each centrifuge can be removed and replaced on a customer's well site within 45 minutes if it fails thereby minimizing downtime.

&#160;

Mud Circulating Tanks ("MCTs") : We currently have approximately 108 vertical 400-barrel MCTs and 139 500-barrel MCTs. We developed a vertical 400-barrel MCTs as an innovative solution that minimizes location size, which we believe is an attractive feature for customers. The majority of our 500-barrel MCTs are highly mobile with rounded bottoms and customized jet-lines to ensure more consistent mud and easier cleanout at the completion of a job. MCTs are typically rented with auxiliary equipment such as diesel or electric mud pumps, hoses, and wooden mats.

&#160;

Mud Mixing Plants ("MMPs") : We own 13 MMPs ranging in size from 60-barrel capacity to 400-barrel capacity. We believe that the large 400-barrel capacity MMPs, which are designed and fabricated in-house, are unique and offer significant advantages to our customers.

&#160;

Containment Systems: Containment systems consist of berms and plastic linings constructed to ensure that all products and chemicals present on the well site, particularly those which might be environmentally undesirable if spilled, are contained. We believe the demand for containment systems will continue to increase as environmental regulations tighten.

&#160;

MWD Kits: Our MWD kits provide highly accurate data while remaining stable over a wide temperature range and have a mean-time-between-failure rate that we believe is significantly greater than current industry standards. We fabricate our MWD kits in-house which provides us with the ability to modify our kits to meet the specific downhole conditions of each job in a cost effective manner. We believe the capabilities of and the technology associated with our MWD kits is similar to larger competitors and we are typically able to offer our kits at discounted pricing due to our cost structure.

&#160;

Service Offerings Which Include Personnel 

&#160;

Solids Control Services: When a customer's solids control design and drilling operations are complex, we provide operators on-site 24 hours a day at an additional day rate. In these instances, we typically rent a full package of solids control equipment to the customer, which may include two centrifuges, shakers, vertical dryers, waste removal units, and/or various tanks.

&#160;

Directional Drilling and MWD Services: We offer full directional drilling packages and MWD only services, which include both equipment, such as downhole motors and MWD kits, and personnel, such as experienced directional drillers and MWD operators, at one package day rate.

&#160;

Hauling of Equipment and Rig-Up/Rig-Down Services: We offer hauling of our rental equipment to the well site and rig-up/rig-down of such equipment.

&#160; &#160;

Fabricating Capabilities 

&#160;

We fabricate certain equipment in our rental fleet, including 400-barrel MCTs, MMPs, and MWD kits. Fabrication takes place in our facilities in Giddings, Texas and in Houston, Texas. Items fabricated in-house are typically unique and we believe our ability to fabricate such products in-house provides us with cost efficiencies that result in a competitive advantage. 

&#160;

Geographic Markets 

&#160;

We service the Permian Basin (in Texas and New Mexico), Eagle Ford Shale, Utica Shale, Marcellus Shale, Woodford Shale, Granite Wash, Mississippian Lime, and Tuscaloosa Marine Shale. 

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

We experience significant competition in our business. The markets in which we operate are highly fragmented and there are a large number of companies in these markets offering rental equipment and services that overlap with our offerings. We believe the principal differentiators among competitors in the sectors and markets in which we operate are safety record, service quality, existence of unique attributes of equipment that benefit the customer, customer relationships and price. 

&#160;

Customers 

&#160;

We provide equipment and services to several well-known, established operators, such as EQT Production, Discovery Natural Resources LLC, EOG Resources, Inc., Pioneer Natural Resources, Continental Resources, Inc. and Devon Energy Corporation.

&#160;

One customer accounted for 13.7% of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2015. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our top three customers represented approximately 30.1% and 29.3% of total revenues, respectively. 

&#160;

Safety 

&#160;

Our record and reputation for safety is important to all aspects of our business. In the oilfield services industry, an important competitive factor in establishing and maintaining long-term customer relationships is having an experienced, skilled and well-trained work force. In recent years, many of our larger customers have placed an added emphasis on the safety records and quality management systems of their vendors.

&#160;

We commit substantial resources toward employee safety and quality management. We believe that our policies and procedures provide a solid framework to ensure our employees minimize the hazards inherent in our work environment, meet regulatory requirements and exceed customer expectations.

&#160;

&#160; &#160;

Employees 

&#160;

We currently employ approximately 110 individuals. The corporate cost center employs four individuals, including the chief executive officer, the chief operating officer and the chief financial officer, approximately 80 individuals work primarily in the field, and the remaining employees provide selling, general, and administrative services. 

&#160;

Intangibles 

&#160;

We are not dependent on any significant patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises, concessions, royalty agreements or labor contracts. In the last two years, we have not spent or incurred a material amount on research and development activities.

&#160;

We have a supply agreement with United Oilfield Inc., the manufacturer of all of our centrifuges and some of our auxiliary solids control equipment, which matures in 2018. The agreement, entered into in conjunction with the United Acquisition, grants us exclusivity to purchase centrifuges for use in the oilfield services industry in the United States. We believe that these centrifuges provide us with a significant competitive advantage.

&#160;

Governmental Regulation 

&#160;

Our business is impacted by federal, state and local laws and other regulations relating to the oil and natural gas industry, as well as laws and regulations relating to worker safety and environmental protection. We cannot predict the level of enforcement of existing laws and regulations or how such laws and regulations may be interpreted by enforcement agencies or court rulings, whether additional laws and regulations will be adopted, or the effect such changes may have on us, our business or financial condition.

&#160;

In addition, our customers are impacted by laws and regulations relating to the exploration for and production of natural resources such as oil and natural gas. These regulations are subject to change, and new regulations may curtail or eliminate our customers' activities in certain areas where we currently operate. We cannot determine the extent to which new legislation may impact our customers' activity levels, and ultimately, the demand for our services.
