BCB Community Bank 

BCB Community Bank opened for business on November 1, 2000 as Bayonne Community Bank, a New Jersey chartered commercial bank. The Bank changed its name from Bayonne Community Bank t o BCB Community Bank in April 2007. At December 31, 201 5 , the Bank operated through 15 branches in Bayonne, Colonia, Jersey City, Hoboken, Fairfield, Monroe Township, South Orange, Rutherford and Woodbridge, New Jersey , and one branch in Staten Island, New York and through executive office s loca ted at 104-110 Avenue C and an administrative office located at 591-595 Avenue C, Bayonne, New Jersey 07002. The Bank&#x2019;s deposit accounts are insured by the Federal Dep osit Insurance Corporation, (the &#x201C;FDIC&#x201D; ) and the Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System . 

We are a community-oriented financial institution. Our business is to offer FDIC-insured deposit products and to invest funds held in deposit accounts at the Bank, together with funds generated from operations, in loans and investment securities. We offer our customers: 

&#xB7; 

loans, including commercial and multi-family real estate loans, one- to four-family mortgage loans, home equity loans, construction loans, consumer loans and commercial business loans.

Significant Event s 

The Company has progressed on an organic branching initiative which is intended to mitigate the location risk of our strong Hudson County , New Jersey concentration, to develop our branch infrastructure in a manner more consistent with the expansion of lending markets and to fill in and grow our branch footprint in a more uniform and coherent fashion, which previously ha d grown predominately through merger activity. To this end, the Company opened a branch in Colonia, New Jersey in July 2014, one in Fairfield, New Jersey in November 2014, and one branch in each of Staten Island, New York and Rutherford, New Jersey in February 2015. The Company is also looking to open several more branches within the next ye ar. 

In November 2015, the Company issued and sold in a public offering an aggregate of 2, 760 ,000 shares of the Company&#x2019;s common stock at $10.00 per share.

The Form S-3 registered certain types of our securities, including our common stock, up to a total dollar amount of $50.0 million.

Janney Montgomery Scott LLC and Oppenheimer &amp; Company Inc. acted as co-managers for the offering. The offering commenced on October 28, 2015 and terminated on November 4, 2015. 

The offering resulted in $25.6 million of net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses of $ 2.0 million payable by us. None of the underwriting discounts and commissions or other offering expenses were incurred or paid to our directors or officers or their associates or to persons owning 10% or more of our common stock or to any of our affiliates. 

On November 27, 2015, the Company closed a private placement of Series C Noncumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, resulting in the issuance of 388 shares of Series C 6% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Shares (&#x201C;Series C Shares&#x201D;) for gross proceeds of $3.88 million through December 31, 2015.

There is no ability to convert the Series C Shares to common shares. Dividends on the Series C Shares, if and when declared, will be paid quarterly in arrears.

Business Strategy 

Our business strategy is to operate as a well-capitalized, profitable and independent community-oriented financial institution dedicated to providing the highest quality customer service. Management&#x2019;s and the Board of Directors&#x2019; extensive knowledge of the markets we serve helps to differentiate us from our competitors. Our business strategy incorporates the following elements: maintaining a community focus, focusing on profitability, continuing our growth, concentrating on real estate - based lending, capitalizing on market dynamics, providing attentive and personalized service , and attracting highly qualified and experienced personnel. These attributes coupled with our desire to seek out under-served markets for banking products and services , facilitate our plan to grow our franchise footprint organically and synergistically. 

Maintaining a community focus. Our management and Board of Directors have strong ties to the communities we serve. Many members of the management team are New Jersey natives and are active in the communities we serve through non-profit board membership, local business development organizations, and industry associations. In addit ion, our board members are well- established professionals and business leaders in the communities we serve. Management and the Board are interested in making a lasting contribution to these communities , and they have succeeded in attracting deposits and loans through attentive and personalized service. 

Strengthening our balance sheet. For the year ended December 31, 201 5 , our return on average equity was 6.52 % and our return on average assets was 0. 48 %. Our earnings per diluted share was $0. 69 for the year ended December 31, 201 5 compared to $ 0.81 for the year ended December 31, 201 4 . Earnings per share results were lower in 201 5 primarily as a result of the Company&#x2019;s investment in growth with an increase in staffing, occupancy and equipment expenses related to retention of additional experienced business development and loan administration personnel, as well as new and anticipated branch openings. Management remains committed to strengthening the Bank&#x2019;s statements of financial condition and maintaining profitability by diversifying the products, pricing and services we offer. As a result of our efforts, total past due loans (greater than 90 days) have decreased from $14.8 million at December 31, 2012 to $ 1 4.5 million at December 31, 201 5 , while gross loans increased from $936 . 2 million at December 31, 2012 to $1. 44 billion at December 31, 201 5 . 

Concentrating on real estate-based lending. A primary focus of our business strategy is to originate loans secured by commercial and multi-family properties. Such loans generally provide higher returns than loans secured by one- to four-family properties . As a result of our underwriting practices, including debt service requirements for commercial real estate and multi-family loans, management believes that such loans offer us an opportunity to obtain higher returns without a measu rable increased level of risk. 

Capitalizing on market dynamics. The consolidation of the banking industry in northeast New Jersey has provided a un ique opportunity for a customer- focused banking institution, such as the Bank. We believe our local ro ots and community focus provide the Bank with an opportunity to capitalize on the consolidation in our market area. This consolidation has moved decision making away from local, community-based banks to much larger banks headqu artered outside of New Jersey. We believe our local ro ots and community focus provide the Bank with an opportunity to capitalize on the consolidation in our market area. 

Providing attentive and personalized service. Management believes that providing attentive and personalized service is the key to gaining deposit and loan relationships in the markets we serve and their surrounding communities. Since we began operations, our branches have bee n open seven days a week. 

Attracting highly experienced and qualified personnel. An important part of our strategy is to hire bankers who have prior experience in the markets we serve, as well as pre-existing business relationships. Our management team averages over 20 years of banking experience, while our lenders and branch personnel have significant experience at community banks and regional banks throughout the region . Management believes that its knowledge of these markets has been a critical element in the success of the Bank. Management&#x2019;s extensive knowledge of the local communities has allowed us to develop and implement a highly focused and disciplined approach to lending , and has enabled the Bank to attract a high percentage of low cost deposits. 

Our Market Area 

We are located in Bayonne, Jersey City and Hoboken in Hudson County, Colonia, Monroe Township and Woodbridge in Middlesex County, Rutherford in Bergen County and Fairfield and South Orange in Essex County, New Jersey. The Bank has also recently opened a branch in Staten Island , New York. The Bank&#x2019;s locations are easily accessible and provide convenient services to businesses and individuals throughout our market area. 

Our market area includes Bayonne, Jersey City, Hoboken, Colonia, Fairfield, South Orange, Woodbridge, Rutherford and Monroe Township, New Jersey, and now includes the boroughs of New York City . These areas are all considered &#x201C;bedroom&#x201D; or &#x201C;commuter&#x201D; communities to Manhattan. Our market area is well-served by a network of arterial roadways , including Route 440 and the New Jersey Turnpike. 

Our market area has a high level of commercial business activity. Businesses are concentrated in the service sector and retail trade areas. Major employers in our market area include certain medical centers and local boards of education. 

Competition 

The banking industry in northeast New Jersey and New York City is extremely competitive. We compete for deposits and loans with existing New Jersey and out-of-state financial institutions that have longer operating histories, larger capital reserves and more established customer bases. Our competition includes large financial service s companies and other entities, in addition to traditional banking institutions , such as savings and loan associations, savings banks, commercial banks and credit unions. Our larger competitors have a greater ability to finance wide-ranging advertising campaigns through greater capital resources. Our marketing efforts depend heavily upon referrals from officers, directors, stockholders, advertising in local media and through a social media presence . We compete for business principally on the basis of personal service to customers, customer access to our business development and other officers and directors , and competitive interest rates and fees. 

In the financial services industry in recent years, intense market demands, techn ological and regulatory changes, and economic pressures have eroded industry classifications that were once clearly defined. Banks have diversified their services, competitively priced their deposit products and become more cost- effective as a result of competition with each other and with new types of financial service companies, including non-banking competitors. Some of these market dynamics have resulted in a number of new bank and non-bank competitors, increased merger activity, and increased customer awareness of product and service differences among competitors.

Commercial and Multi-family Real Estate Loans . Commercial real estate loans are secured by improved property such as office buildings, mixed use buildings retail stores, shopping centers, warehouses, and other non-residential buildings. Loans secured by multi-family residential units are properties consisting of five or more residential units. The Bank offers fully amortizing loans on commercial and multi-family properties at loan amounts up to 75% of the appraised value of the property. Commercial and multi-family real estate loans are generally made at rates that adjust above the five year Federal Home Loan Bank of New York interest rate, with terms of up to 30 years . The Bank also offers balloon loans with fixed interest rates which generally mature in three to five years with amort ization periods up to 30 years. As of December 31, 2015, the Bank&#x2019;s largest commercial real estate loan had an outstanding prin cipal balance of $17.0 million. This loan is secured by a 49 unit Multi-family property located in New York City, NY. This loan is performing in accordance with its terms at December 31, 2015. 

Loans secured by commercial and multi-family real estate are generally larger and involve a greater degree of risk than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. The borrower&#x2019;s creditworthiness and the feasibility and cash flow potential of the project is of primary concern in commercial and multi-family real estate lending. Loans secured by owner occupied properties are generally larger and involve greater risks than one-to-four family residential and non-owner occupied commercial mortgage loans because payments on loans secured by owner occupied properties are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the business. The Bank intends to continue emphasizing the origination of loans secured by commercial real estate and multi-family properties. 

Construction Loans . The Bank offers loans to finance the construction of various types of commercial and residential properties. Construction loans to builders generally are offered with terms of up to thirty months and interest rates tied to the prime rate plus a margin. These loans generally are offered as adjustable rate loans. The Bank will originate construction loans to customers provided all necessary plans and permit s are in order. Construction loan funds are disbursed as the project progresses. The Bank also offers construction loans that convert to a permanent mortgage on the property upon completion of the construction and adherence to conditions established at the time the constr uction loan was first approved. Terms of such permanent mortgage loans are similar to other mortgage loans secured by similar properties, with the interest rate establi shed at the time of conversion. As of December 31, 2015, the Bank&#x2019;s largest construction loan has a borrowing capacity of $8.5 million, of which $1.1 million has been disbursed. This loan is performing in accordance with its&#x2019; terms at December 31, 2015. 

Construction financing is generally considered to involve a higher degree of risk than commercial real estate loans or one-to-four family residential lending. To mitigate these risks the Bank will obtain a plan and cost review from a third party vendor to review the proposed construction budget in an effort to avoid cost overruns. The Bank also obtains multiple appraised values based upon various po ssible outcomes of the project. These values include &#x201C;As Is,&#x201D; &#x201C;As Completed, &#x201D;As a Rental,&#x201D; &#x201C;As Sellout,&#x201D; and &#x201C;As a Bulk Sale&#x201D;. 

Commercial Business Loans . The Bank offers a variety of commercial business loans in forms of either lines of credit or term loans that are fully amortized. Lines of credit are typically utilize d for working capital purposes. These loans are either revolving or non-revolving and provide loan terms between one to three years. The re-payment is generally interest only and the interest rate is adjustable based upon, the Prime Rate. Term loans are typically for purchasing a busine ss or equipment for a business. Term loans have loan terms between five to twenty-five y ears and are fully amortizing. The interest rate is adjustable and tied to the five year Federal H ome Loan Bank of New York rate. Commercial business loans are underwritten on the basis of the borrower&#x2019;s ability to service such debt from income. These loans are generally made to small and mid-sized companies located within the Bank&#x2019;s primary and secondary lending areas. A commercial business loan may be secured by equipment, accounts receivable, inve ntory, chattel or other assets. As of December 31, 2015, the Bank&#x2019;s largest commercial business loan is a revolving line of credit to school district loan in Hudson County, NJ secured by plant, equ ipment and accounts receivable. The borrowing capacity is $15.0 million, of which no dollars have been dispersed. This loan is performing in accordance with its&#x2019; terms at December 31, 2015. 

Commercial business loans generally have higher rates and shorter terms than one to four family residential loans, but they may also involve higher average balances and a higher risk of default since their repayment generally depends on the successful operation of the borrower&#x2019;s business. 

SBA Lending. The Bank offers qualifying business loans guaranteed by the U . S . Small Business Administration (&#x201C;SBA&#x201D;). To qualify the borrower may have low capitalization, inexperience in the industry, or a specialized i ndustry or other unusual risks. As of December 31, 2015, the Bank&#x2019;s largest SBA loan is secured by a 4-story hotel building located in Brooklyn, New York. The borrowing capacity is $6.0 million, of which $3.1 million has been dispersed. This loan is performing in accordance with its terms at December 31, 2015. 

Residential Lending. Residential loans are secured by one-to-four family dwellings, condominiums and cooperative units. Residential mortgage loans are secured by properties located in our primary lending areas of Bergen, Essex, Middlesex, Hudson, Monmouth and Richmond Counties; adjoining counties are considered as our secondary lending areas. We generally originate residential mortgage loans up to 75% loan-to-value at a m aximum loan amount of $3.0 million for primary residences . Loan-to-value is based on the lesser of the appraised value or the purchase price without the requirement of private mortgage insurance. We will originate loans with loan to value ratios up to 90%, provided the borrower obtains privat e mortgage insurance approval. We originate both fixed rate and adjustable rate residential loans with a term of up to 30 years. We offer 15, 20, and 30 year fixed, 15/30 year balloon and 3/1, 5/1, 7/1 and 10/1 adjustable rate loans with payments being calculated to include principal, interest, taxes and insurance. The 3/1 and 5/1 adjustable rate loans are qualified at 2% above the start rate; all other loans are qualified at the start rate. We have a number of correspondent relationships with third party lenders in which we deliver closed first mortgage loans. Our correspondent banking relationships allow us to offer customers competitive long term fixed rate and adjustable rate loans we could not otherwise originate, while providing the Bank a source of fee income. During 2015, we originated for sale approximately $17.3 million in residential loans and recognized gains of approximately $450,000 from the sale of such loans. 

Home Equity Loans and Home Equity Lines of Credit . The Bank offers home equity loans and lines of credit that are secured by either the borrower&#x2019;s primary residence, a seconda ry residence or an investment. Our home equity loans can be structured as loans that are disbursed in full at closing or as lines of credit. Home equity lines of credit are off ered with terms up to 30 years. Virtually all of our home equity loans are originated with fixed rates of interest and home equity lines of credit are originated with adjustable interest rates tied to the prime rate. Home equity loans and lines of credit are underwritten under the same criteria that we use to underwrite one to four family residential loans. Home equity lines of credit may be underwritten with a loan-to-value ratio of up to 80% in a first lien position. At December 31, 2015, the outstanding balances of home equity loans and lines of credit totaled $50.2 million, or 3.45% of total loans. 

Consumer Loans . The Bank makes secured Passbook, Automobile and occasion ally unsecured consumer loans. Consumer loans generally have te rms between one and five years. They generally are made on a fixed rate basis, fully-amortizing. 

Loan Approval Authority and Underwriting . The Bank&#x2019;s Lending Policy has established lending l imits for executive management. The President or the Chief Lending Officer, together with two Credit Officers, have authority to approv e loan requests up to $1.5 million . Loan requests in excess of $1.5 million shall be presented to the Bank&#x2019;s Board of Directors Loan Committee, which shall be comprised of a quorum of the Bank&#x2019;s Board of Directors. Loan requests in excess of $2 .0 million must be ratified by the entire Bank Board of Directors. 

Upon receipt of a completed loan application including all appropriate financial information from a prospective borrower, the Bank will cond uct its due diligence analysis. Property valuations or appraisals are required for all real estate collateralized loans. Appraisals are prepared by a state certified independent appraiser approved by the Bank Board of Directors. 

Loan Commitments . Written commitments are given to prospective borrowers on all approved loans. Generally, we honor commitments for up to 60 days from the date of issuance. At December 31, 2015, our outstanding loan origination commitments totaled $44.8 million, standby letters of credit totaled $1.7 million, undisbursed construction funds totaled $26.7 million and undisbursed lines of credit funds totaled $107.3 million. 

Loan Delinquencies . Notices of nonpayment are generated to borrowers once the loan ac count(s) becomes either 10 or 15 days past due, as specified in the applicable promissory no te. A nonresponsive borrower will receive collection calls and a site visit from a bank representative in addition to follow -up delinquency notices. If such payment i s not received after 60 days, a notice of right to cure default is sent to the borrower providing 30 additional days to bring the loan current before foreclosure or other remedies are commenced. The Bank utilizes various reporting tools to closely monitor the performance and asset quality of the loan portfolio. The Bank complies with all federal, state and local laws regarding collection of its delinquent accounts. 

Non-Accrual Status . Loans are placed on a non-accrual status when the loan becomes more than 90 days delinquent or when, in our opinion, the collection of payment is doubtful. Once placed on non-accrual status, the accrual of interest income is discontinued until the loan has been returned to normal accrual. At December 31, 2015, the Bank had $23.4 million in non-accruing loans. The largest exposure of non-performing loans consisted of a combined borrowing relationship in which the loans are collateralized by multiple properties whose combined balance at December 31, 2015 was $3.3 million. 

Impairment Status. A loan is considered impaired when it is probable the borrower will not repay the loan according to the original contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impaired loans can be loans which are more than 90 days delinquent, troubled debt restructured, part of our special residential program, in the process of foreclosure, or a forced Bankruptcy plan. We have determined that first mortgage loans on one- to four-family properties and all consumer loans represent large groups of smaller-balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated. Additionally, we have determined that an insignificant delay (less than 90 days) will not cause a loan to be classified as impaired if we expect to collect all amounts due including interest accrued at the contractual interest rate for the period of delay. We independently evaluate all loans identified as impaired. We estimate credit losses on impaired loans based on the present value of expected cash flows or the fair value of the underlying collateral if the loan repayment will be derived from the sale or operation of such collateral. Impaired loans, or portions of such loans, are charged off when we determine a realized loss has occurred. Until such time, an allowance for loan losses is maintained for estimated losses. Cash receipts on impaired loans are applied first to accrued interest receivable unless otherwise required by the loan terms, except when an impaired loan is also a nonaccrual loan, in which case the portion of the receipts related to interest is applied to principal. At December 31, 2015, we had 176 loans with unpaid principal balances totaling $51.1 million which are classified as impaired and on which loan loss allowances totaling $3.7 million have been established. Durin g 2015, interest income of $1.6 million was recognized on impaired loans during the time of impairment. 

Troubled Debt Restructuring. A troubled debt restructuring (&#x201C;TDR&#x201D;) is a loan that has been modified whereby the Bank has agreed to make certain concessions to a borrower to meet the needs of both the borrower and the Bank to maximize the ultimate recovery of a loan. TDR occurs when a borrower is experiencing, or is expected to experience, financial difficulties and the loan is modified using a modification that would otherwise not be granted to the borrower. The types of concessions granted generally included, but not limited to, interest rate reductions, limitations on the accrued interest charged, term extensions, and deferment of principal. The total troubled debt restructured loans were $28.5 million and $30.7 million at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. 

The Bank had allocated $ 1.7 million and $904,000 of specific reserves to customers whose loan terms have been modified in troubled debt restructurings as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. There were no unfunded commitments to lend additional amounts to customers with outstanding loans that are classified as troubled debt restructurings. 

If management determines that the value of the modified loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan, impairment is recognized by segment or class of loan, as applicable, through an allowance estimate or charge-off to the allowance. This process is used, regardless of loan type, and for loans modified as TDRs that subsequently default on their modified terms.

For the year ended December 31, 201 5 , gross interest income which would have been recorded had our non-accruing loans been current in accordance with their original terms amounted to $ 1. 1 million. We received and recorded $ 326 ,000 in interest income for such loans for the year ended December 31, 201 5 . 

Classified Loans . The Bank&#x2019;s Lending Policy contains a classification system which evaluates the overall risk of a problem loan. When a loan is classified and determined to be impaired, the Bank may establish specific allowances for loan losses. General allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. A portion of general loss allowances established to cover possible losses related to assets classified as substandard or doubtful may be included in determining our regulatory capital. Specific valuation allowances for loan losses generally do not qualify as regulatory capital. At December 31, 2015, the Bank reported $37.4 million in classified assets. The loans classified are represented by loans secured either by one-to-four family or commercial real estate. 

The Bank&#x2019;s internal classification system is defined by risk rating grades in accordance with guidance offered by the banking regulatory agencies. The grades of excellent, good, satisfactory and bankable with care (1-6 rating) are considered as a &#x201C;pass&#x201D; rating. The &#x201C;classified&#x201D; risk ratings of (7-9 rating) are detailed below. 

6 &#x2013; Special Mention- Loans currently performing but with potential weaknesses including adverse trends in borrower&#x2019;s operations, credit quality, financial strength, or possible collateral deficiency. 

7 &#x2013; Substandard - Loans that are inadequately protected by current sound worth, paying capacity, and collateral support. Loans on &#x201C;nonaccrual&#x201D; status. The loan needs special and corrective attention. 

8 &#x2013; Doubtful - Weaknesses in credit quality and collateral support make full collection improbable, but pending reasonable factors remain sufficient to defer the loss status. 

9 &#x2013; Loss - Continuance as a bankable asset is not warranted. However, this does not preclude future attempts of recovery. 

Effective January 2015, the Bank revised its&#x2019; risk rating scale expanding the grades to a one to nine scale. Grades one through five will be a considered a pass grade where as six through nine will be considered a classified grade. The grades are determined through the uses of a qualitative matrix taking into account various characteristics of the loan such as quality of management, principals&#x2019;/guarantors&#x2019; character, balance sheet strength, collateral quality, cash flow coverage, position within the industry, loan structure and documentation. 

Allowances for Loan Losses . A provision for loan losses is charged to operations based on management&#x2019;s evaluation of the losses that may be incurred in our loan portfolio. In addition, our determination of the amount of the allowance for loan losses is subject to review by the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance and the FDIC, as part of their examination process. After a review of the information available, our regulators might require the establishment of an additional allowance. Any increase in the loan loss allowance required by regulators would have a negative impact on our earnings. Management reviews the adequacy of the allowance on at least a quarterly basis to ensure that the provision for loan losses has been charged against earnings in an amount necessary to maintain the allowance at a level that is adequate based on management&#x2019;s assessment of probable estimated losses. The Bank&#x2019;s methodology for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses consists of several key elements. These elements include a general allocated allowance for non-impaired loans, a specific allowance for impaired loans, and an unallocated portion. 

The Bank consistently applies the following comprehensive methodology. During the quarterly review of the allowance for loan losses, the Bank considers a variety of factors that include: 

&#xB7; 

General economic conditions. 

&#xB7; 

Trends in charge-offs. 

&#xB7; 

Trends and levels of delinquent loans. 

&#xB7; 

Trends and levels of non-performing loans, including loans over 90 days delinquent. 

&#xB7; 

Trends in volume and terms of loans. 

&#xB7; 

Levels of allowance for specific classified loans. 

&#xB7; 

Credit concentrations 

The methodology includes the segregation of the loan portfolio into two divisions of performing loans and loans determined to be impaired. Loans which are performing are evaluated homogeneously by loan class or loan type. The allowance of performing loans is evaluated based on historical loan experience, including consideration of peer loss analysis, with an adjustment for qualitative factors due to economic conditions in the market. Impaired loans can be loans which are more than 90 days delinquent, troubled debt restructured, part of our special residential program, in the process of foreclose, or a forced Bankruptcy plan. These loans are individually evaluated for loan loss either by current appraisal, estimated economic factor, or net present value. Management reviews the overall estimate for feasibility and bases the loan loss provision accordingly. As of December 31, 2015, non-accrual loans differed from the amount of total loans past due greater than 90 days due to troubled debt restructuring of loans which are maintained on non-accrual status for a minimum of six months until the borrower has demonstrated their ability to satisfy the terms of the restructured loan. The Bank also maintains an unallocated allowance. The unallocated allowance is used to cover any factors or conditions which may cause a potential loan loss but are not specifically identifiable. It is prudent to maintain an unallocated portion of the allowance because no matter how detailed an analysis of potential loan losses is performed, these estimates lack some element of precision. Management must make estimates using assumptions and information that is often subjective and subject to change. 

The following table sets forth an analysis of the Bank&#x2019;s allowance for loan losses.

Investment Activities 

Investment Securities . We are required under federal regulations to maintain a minimum amount of liquid assets that may be invested in specified short-term securities and certain other investments. The level of liquid assets varies depending upon several factors, including: (i) the yields on investment alternatives, (ii) our judgment as to the attractiveness of the yields then available in relation to other opportunities, (iii) expectation of future yield levels, and (iv) our projections as to the short-term demand for funds to be used in loan origination and other activities. Investment securities, including mortgage-backed securities, are classified at the time of purchase, based upon management&#x2019;s intentions and abilities, as securities held-to-maturity or securities available for sale. Debt securities acquired with the intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and are stated at cost and adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount, which are computed using the level yield method and recognized as adjustments of interest income. All other debt and equity securities are classified as available for sale to serve principally as a source of liquidity. 

As of December 31, 201 5 , there were no securities classified as held-to-maturity. We had $9. 6 million in securities classified as available for sale, and no se curities classified as trading or held- to - maturity . Securities classified as available for sale are reported for financial reporting purposes at the fair value with net changes in the fair value from period to period included as a separate component of stockholders&#x2019; equity, net of income taxes. Changes in the fair value of securities classified as held-to-maturity or available for sale do not affect our income, unless we determine there to be an other-than-temporary impairment for those securities in an unrealized loss position. As of December 31, 201 5 , management concluded that all unrealized losses were temporary in nature since they are related to interest rate fluctuations rather than any underlying credit quality of the issuers. Additionally, the Bank has no plans to sell these securities and has concluded that it is unlikely it would have to sell these securities prior to the anticipated rec overy of the unrealized losses. 

In 2013, management decided to sell certain mortgage-backed securities that were issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association (&#x201C;FNMA&#x201D;) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (&#x201C;FHLMC&#x201D;). While these securities were classified as held to maturity, with the intent to hold to maturity, ASC 320 (formerly FAS 115) allows sales of securities so designated, provided that a substantial portion (at least 85%) of the principal balance purchased has been amortized prior to the sale. Sales of securities that had been classified as held to maturity, and do not meet any of the safe harbor exemptions under ASC 320, would then require that all remaining securities be transferred to the available for sale category and the Company would be prohibited from using the held to maturity classification for at least a two-year period. In July 2014, the Company transferred all of its remaining held-to-maturity investments to the available-for-sale category. Management determined that it no longer had the positive intent to hold its investment in securities classified as held-to-maturity, and in July 2014, proceeds from the sales of securities previously classified as held to maturity totaled approximately $99.2 million, and resulted in gross gains of $2.76 million and gross losses of $470,000. Sales of held-to-maturity securities that met the 85% threshold for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 totaled approximately $537,000, and resulted in gross gains of approximately $40,000, and gross losses of approximately $1,000. During the year ended December 31, 2013, proceeds from sales of securities held to maturity meeting the 85% threshold totaled approximately $9.5 million and resulted in gross gains of $401,00 0 and gross losses of $23,000. 

As of December 31, 201 5 , our investment policy allowed investments in instruments such as: (i) U.S. Treasury obligations; (ii) U.S. federal agency or federally sponsored enterprise obligations; (iii) mortgage-backed securities; and (iv) certificates of deposit. The Board of Directors may aut horize additional investments. 

As a source of liquidity and to supplement our lending activities, we have invested in residential mortgage-backed securities. Mortgage-backed securities generally yield less than the loans that underlie such securities because of the cost of payment guarantees or credit enhancements that reduce credit risk. Mortgage-backed securities can serve as collateral for borrowings and, through repayments, as a source of liquidity. Mortgage-backed securities represent a participation interest in a pool of single-family or other type of mortgages. Principal and interest payments are passed from the mortgage originators, through intermediaries (generally government-sponsored enterprises) that pool and repackage the participation interests in the form of securities, to investors, like us. The government-sponsored enterprises guarantee the payment of principal and interest to investors and include Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae, and Fannie Mae. 

Mortgage-backed securities typically are issued with stated principal amounts. The securities are backed by pools of mortgage loans that have interest rates that are within a set range and have varying maturities. The underlying pool of mortgages can be composed of either fixed rate or adjustable rate mortgage loans. Mortgage-backed securities are generally referred to as mortgage participation certificates or pass-through certificates. The interest rate risk characteristics of the underlying pool of mortgages (i.e., fixed rate or adjustable rate) and the prepayment risk, are passed on to the certificate holder. The life of a mortgage-backed pass-through security is equal to the life of the underlying mortgages. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities due to scheduled repayments and because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without prepayment penalties.

Sources of Funds 

Our major external source of funds for lending and other investment purposes are deposits. Funds are also derived from the receipt of payments on loans, prepayment of loans, maturities of investment securities and mortgage-backed securities and borrowings. Scheduled loan principal repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows and loan prepayments are significantly influenced by general interest rates and market conditions. 

Deposits . Consumer and commercial deposits are attracted principally from within our primary market area through the offering of a selection of deposit instruments including demand, NOW, savings and club accounts, money market accounts, and term certificate accounts. Deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required, the time period the funds must remain on deposit, and the interest rate. 

The interest rates paid by us on deposits are set at the direction of our senior management. Interest rates are determined based on our liquidity requirements, interest rates paid by our competitors, our growth goals, and applicable regulatory restrictions and requirements. As of December 31, 201 5 and December 31, 201 4 we had $ 46.7 million and $ 56.0 million in brokered deposits, respectively.

Borrowings . The Overnight A dvance Program permits the Bank to borrow overnight up to its maximum borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (&#x201C;FHLB&#x201D;) . At December 31, 20 1 5 , the Bank&#x2019;s total credit exposure cannot exceed 50% of its total assets, or $ 809.2 million, based on the borrowing limitations outlined in the FHLB member products guide. The total credit exposure limit to 50% of total assets is recalculated each quarter. Additionally, at December 31, 201 5 we had a floating rate junior subordinated debenture of $ 4.1 million which has been callable at the Bank &#x2019;s option since June 17, 2009 , and quarterly thereafter.

Employees 

At December 31, 201 5 , we had 331 full-time equivalent employees. None of our employees is represented by a collective bargaining group. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good. 

Subsidiaries 

We have three non-bank subsidiaries. BCB Holding Company Investment Corp. was established in 2004 for the purpose of holding and investing in securities. Only securities authorized to be purchased by BCB Community Bank are held by BCB Holding Company Investment Corp. At December 31, 201 5 , this company held $ 9. 6 million in securities. With the merger with Pamrapo Bancorp. Inc., we acquired Pamrapo Service Corporation which has been inactive since May 2010. BCB New York Management, Inc. was established in October 2012 for the purpose of holding and investing in various loan products and investing in securities. For the year ended December 31, 201 5 , there was no activity related to this subsidiary. 

Supervision and Regulation 

Bank holding companies and banks are extensively regulated under both federal and state law. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors and the deposit insurance funds, rather than to protect shareholders and creditors. The description below is limited to certain material aspects of the statutes and regulations addressed, and is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effec ts on the Company or the Bank. 

Set forth below is a summary of certain material and regulatory requirements applicable to the Company and the Bank. These and any other changes in applicable laws or regulations, whether by Congress or regulatory agencies, may have a material effect on the business and prospects of the Company and the Bank. These and any other changes in applicable laws or regulations, whether by Congress or regulatory agencies, may have a material effect on the business and prospec ts of the Company and the Bank. 

The Dodd-Frank Act 

The Dodd-Frank Act changed the bank regulatory structure and is affect ing the lending, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the Office of Thrift Supervision and requires that federal savings associations be regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the primary federal regulator for national banks). The Dodd-Frank Act also authorizes the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board (&#x201C;Federal Reserve&#x201D;) to supervise and regulate all savi ngs and loan holding companies. 

In July, 2013, the FDIC and the other federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule to revise their risk-based and leverage capital requirements and their method for calculating risk-weighted assets, to make them consistent with the agreements that were reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rule applies to all depository institutions, top-tier bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $500 million (which is currently proposed to increase to $1.0 billion) or more, and top-tier savings and loan holding companies (&#x201C;banking organizations&#x201D;). Among other things, the rule establishes a new common equity Tier 1 minimum capital requirement (4.5% of risk-weighted assets), sets a uniform minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%, increases the minimum Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets requirement (from 4% to 6% of risk-weighted assets) and assigns a higher risk weight (150%) to exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on nonaccrual status and to certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property. The final rule also limits a banking organization&#x2019;s capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a &#x201C;capital conservation buffer&#x201D; consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets. The final rule became effective for us on January 1, 2015. The capital conservation buffer requirement is being phased in beginning January 1, 2016 and ending January 1, 2019, when the full capital conservation buffer requirement will be effective. 

In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act excludes proceeds of trust preferred securities from Tier 1 capital unless such securities were issued prior to May 19, 2010 by bank or savings and loan holding companies with less than $15 billion of assets. The legislation also establishes a floor for capital of insured depository institutions that cannot be lower than the standards in effect today, and directs the federal banking regulators to implement new leverage and capital requirements within 18 months. These new leverage and capital requirements must take into account off-balance sheet activities and other risks, including risks relating to securitized products and derivatives. 

The Dodd-Frank Act created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit &#x201C;unfair, deceptive or abusive&#x201D; acts and practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. Banks and savings institutions with $10 billion or less in assets will be examined by their applicable bank regulators. The new legislation also weakens the federal preemption available for national banks and federal savings associations, and gives the state attorneys general the ability to enforce applicable federal consumer protection laws. 

The Dodd- Frank Act also broadens the base for FDIC insurance assessments. In accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act, t he FDIC has promulgate d rules under which assessments are based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution. The Dodd-Frank Act also permanently increases the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor. Lastly, the Dodd-Frank Act increases stockholder influence over boards of directors by requiring companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so-called &#x201C;golden parachute&#x201D; payments, and by authorizing the Securities and Exchange Commission to promulgate rules that would allow stockholders to nominate and solicit votes for their own candidates using a company&#x2019;s proxy materials. The legislation also directs the Federal Reserve to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank holding company executives, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded. 

B ank Holding Company Regulation 

As a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, the Company is subject to the regulation and supervision applicable to bank holding companies by the Federal Reserve. The Company is also subject to the provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act of 1948 (the &#x201C;New Jersey Banking Act&#x201D;) and the regulations of the Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance (&#x201C;Commissioner&#x201D;). The Company is required to file reports with the Federal Reserve and the Commissioner regarding its business operations and those of its subsidiaries. 

Federal Regulation. The Bank Holding Company Act requires, among other things, the prior approval of the Federal Reserve in any case where a bank holding company proposes to (i) acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any other bank, (ii) acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the outstanding voting stock of any bank (unless it owns a majority of such company&#x2019;s voting shares) or (iii) merge or consolidate with any other bank holding company. The Federal Reserve will not approve any acquisition, merger, or consolidation that would have a substantially anti-competitive effect, unless the anti-competitive impact of the proposed transaction is clearly outweighed by a greater public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve also considers capital adequacy and other financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the companies and the banks concerned, together with the convenience and needs of the community to be served, when reviewing acquisitions or mergers. 

The Bank Holding Company Act generally prohibits a bank holding company, with certain limited exceptions, from (i) acquiring or retaining direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the outstanding voting stock of any company which is not a bank or bank holding company, or (ii) engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, or performing services for its subsidiaries, unless such non-banking business is determined by the Federal Reserve to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be properly incident thereto. 

The Bank Holding Company Act has been amended to permit bank holding companies and banks, which meet certain capital, management and Community Reinvestment Act standards, to engage in a broader range of non-banking activities. In addition, bank holding companies which elect to become financial holding companies may engage in certain banking and non-banking activities without prior Federal Reserve approval. At this time, the Company has not elected to become a financial holding company, as it does not engage in any activities not permissible for banks. 

There are a number of obligations and restrictions imposed on bank holding companies and their depository institution subsidiaries by law and regulatory policy that are designed to minimize potential loss to the depositors of such depository institutions and the FDIC insurance funds in the event the depository institution is 

in danger of default. Under a policy of the Federal Reserve with respect to bank holding company operations, a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institutions and to commit resources to support such institutions in circumstances where it might not do so absent such policy. The Federal Reserve also has the authority under the Bank Holding Company Act to require a bank holding company to terminate any activity or to relinquish control of a non-bank subsidiary upon the Federal Reserve&#x2019;s determination that such activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness and stability of any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company. 

The Federal Reserve has adopted risk-based capital guidelines for bank holding companies. The risk-based capital guidelines are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profile among banks and bank holding companies, to account for off-balance sheet exposure, and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets. Under these guidelines, assets and off-balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories each with appropriate weights. The resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items. 

As described above, effective January 1, 2015, t he Company became subject to regulatory capital requirements and guidelines imposed by the Federal Reserve, which are substantially similar to those imposed by the FDIC on depository institutions within their jurisdictions. If the capital requirements were effective at December 31, 2014, the Company w ould have been considered to be a well- capitalized Bank Holding Company. 

The Federal Reserve may set higher capital requirements for holding companies whose circumstances warrant it. For example, holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets. 

New Jersey Regulation. Under the New Jersey Banking Act, a company owning or controlling a savings bank is regulated as a bank holding company and must file certain reports with the Commissioner and is subject to examination by the Commissioner. Under the New Jersey Banking Act, as well as Federal law, no person may acquire control of the Company or the Bank without first obtaining approval of such acquisition of control from the Federal Reserve and the Commissioner. 

Bank Regulation 

As a New Jersey-chartered commercial bank, the Bank is subject to the regulation, supervision, and examination of the Commissioner. As a state-chartered Bank , the Bank is subject to the regulation, supervision and examination of the FDIC as its primary federal regulator . The regulations of the FDIC and the Commissioner impact virtually all of our activities, including the minimum level of capital we must maintain, our ability to pay dividends, our ability to expand through new branches or acquisitions and various other matters. 

Insurance of Deposit Accounts. The FDIC insures deposits at FDIC insured financial institutions such as the Bank. Deposit accounts in the Bank are insured by the FDIC generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor and up to a maximum of $250,000 for self -directed retirement accounts. 

Under the FDIC&#x2019;s current risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other risk factors. Assessments are based on an institution&#x2019;s risk category and certain specified adjustments with higher assessments applying to institutions deemed most risky. 

In February 2011, the FDIC published a final rule under the Dodd-Frank Act to reform the deposit insurance assessment system. The rule redefine d the assessment base used for calculating deposit insurance assessments effective April 1, 2011. Under the new rule, assessments are based on an institution&#x2019;s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity as opposed to total deposits. Since the new base is much larger than the current base, the FDIC also lowered assessment rates so that the total amount of revenue collected from the industry is not significantly altered. 

Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. We do not currently know of any practice, condition or violation that may lead to termination of our deposit insurance. 

In addition to the FDIC assessments, the Financing Corporation (&#x201C;FICO&#x201D;) is authorized to impose and collect, with the approval of the FDIC, assessments for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the FICO in the 1980s to recapitalize the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The bonds issued by the FICO are due to mature in 2017 through 2019. For the year ended December 31, 201 4 , we paid $ 71 ,000 in FICO assessments. 

Capital Adequacy Guidelines . The FDIC has promulgated risk-based capital rules, which are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profile among banks, to account for off-balance sheet exposure, and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets. Under these rules, assets and off-balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories, each with appropriate weights. The resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items. These rules are substantially similar to the Federal Reserve rules discussed above. 

In addition to the risk-based capital rules, the FDIC has adopted a minimum Tier 1 capital (leverage) ratio. This measurement is substantially similar to the Federal Reserve leverage capital measurement discussed above. At December 31, 201 5 , the Bank&#x2019;s ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets was 12.06 %. Our Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets was 10. 81 %, and our Tier 1 capital to average assets was 8. 61 %. 

In July 2013, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve approved a new rule that will substantially amend the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to the Bank and the Company. The final rule implements the &#x201C;Basel III&#x201D; regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. 

The final rule includes new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which became effective for the Bank and the Company on January 1, 2015, and refines the definition of what constitutes &#x201C;capital&#x201D; for purposes of calculating these ratios. The new minimum capital requirements will be: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from current rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. The final rule also establishes a &#x201C;capital conservation buffer&#x201D; of 2.5%, and will result in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5%; and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The new capital conservation buffer requirement will be phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such actions. 

Transactions with Affiliates. Transactions between banks and their related parties or affiliates are limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the bank. In a holding company context, the parent bank holding company and any companies which are controlled by such parent holding company are affiliates of the bank. Generally, Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W (i) limit the extent to which the bank or its subsidiaries may engage in &#x201C;covered transactions&#x201D; with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10.0% of such institution&#x2019;s capital stock and surplus, and contain an aggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20.0% of such institution&#x2019;s capital stock and surplus and (ii) require that all such transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the institution or subsidiary 

as those provided to non-affiliates. The term &#x201C;covered transaction&#x201D; includes the making of loans, purchase of assets, issuance of a guarantee and other similar transactions. In addition, loans or other extensions of credit by the financial institution to the affiliate are required to be collateralized in accordance with the requirements set forth in Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 generally prohibits loans by a company to its executive officers and directors. However, the law contains a specific exception for loans by a depository institution to its executive officers and directors in compliance with federal banking laws assuming such loans are also permitted under the law of the institution&#x2019;s chartering state. Under such laws, the Bank&#x2019;s authority to extend credit to executive officers, directors and 10% shareholders (&#x201C;insiders&#x201D;), as well as entities such person&#x2019;s control, is limited. The law limits both the individual and aggregate amount of loans the Bank may make to insiders based, in part, on the Bank&#x2019;s capital position and requires certain board approval procedures to be followed. Such loans are required to be made on terms substantially the same as those offered to unaffiliated individuals and not involve more than the normal risk of repayment. There is an exception for loans made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to all employees of the institution and does not give preference to insiders over other employees. Loans to executive officers are further limited by specific categories. 

The Dodd-Frank Act requires that the Federal Reserve make certain changes to the regulations governing transactions with affiliates described above. It is uncertain when such changes will become effective. 

Dividends . The Bank may pay dividends as declared from time to time by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available, subject to certain restrictions. Under the New Jersey Banking Act of 1948, as amended, the Bank may not pay a cash dividend unless, following the payment, the Bank&#x2019;s capital stock will be unimpaired and the Bank will have a surplus of no less than 50% of the Bank capital stock or, if not, the payment of the dividen d will not reduce the surplus. In addition, the Bank cannot pay dividends in amounts that would reduce the Bank&#x2019;s capital below regulatory imposed minimums. 

Federal Securities Laws 

The Company&#x2019;s common stock is registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (&#x201C;Exchange Act&#x201D;). The Company is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the S ecurities Exchange Act of 1934. 

Under the Exchange Act, we are required to conduct a comprehensive review and assessment of the adequacy of our existing financial systems and controls. For the year ended December 31, 201 5 , our auditors are required to audit our internal control over financial reporting. 

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. We have prepared policies, procedures and systems designed to ensure compliance with these regulations. 

Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to conduct a comprehensive review and assessment of the adequacy of our existing financial systems and controls.
