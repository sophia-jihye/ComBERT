&#160; 

Description of Business 

&#160; 

Agritek&#8217;s business plan is to acquire and lease real estate, then lease or sub-lease the real estate to licensed marijuana operators, including providing complete turnkey growing space and related facilities to licensed marijuana growers and dispensary owners. Additionally, the Company offers a variety of services and product lines to the medicinal marijuana sector, including the distribution of hemp- based nutritional products and a line of innovative solutions for electronically processing merchant transactions. 

The Company does not grow, harvest, distribute or sell marijuana or any substances that violate the laws of the United States of America. 

Real Estate Leasing 

&#160; 

Our real estate leasing business primarily includes the acquisition and leasing of cultivation space and related facilities to licensed marijuana growers and dispensary owners for their operations. Management anticipates that these facilities will range in size from 5,000 to 50,000 square feet. These facilities will only be leased to tenants that possess the requisite state licenses to operate cultivation facilities. The leases with the tenants will provide certain requirements that permit us to continually evaluate our tenants&#8217; compliance with applicable laws and regulations. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

As of the date of this report, we are a deed holder of one cultivation property that is located in a suburb of Pueblo, Colorado. The property consists of approximately 80 acres of land zoned for cultivating cannabis. We are evaluating strategic options for this property. 

&#160; 

On March 18, 2014, in conjunction with a land purchase of 80 acres in Pueblo County, Colorado, the Company paid $36,000 cash and entered into a promissory note in the amount of $85,750. The Company plans to lease individual parcels of the 80 acre parcel to fully-licensed and compliant growers and dispensaries within the regulated medicinal and recreational market of Colorado. The Company plans to receive rents and management fees for providing infrastructure, water, electricity, equipment leasing and security services to potential tenants. In November 2015, the Company was made aware that the land transaction regarding 80 acres in Pueblo County, Colorado, may not have been properly deeded to the Company. The company was a party to the land purchase, however, it was recently discovered the second party to the land contract never filed the original quit claim deed on behalf of the Company, even though a copy of the notarized quit claim deed was sent to the Company. To date, the Company has paid a total of $47,438 ($36,000 at closing) and is on the deed of trust of the property. Accordingly, until the deed is properly recorded, the Company reduced the remaining balance of the note payable for the acquisition of the land of $74,313 and recorded a reserve allowance for the remaining balance of the asset of $54,490. 

&#160; 

On April 28, 2014, the Company entered into a lease agreement for 20 acres of an agricultural farming facility located in South Florida, following the approval of the so-called &#8220;Charlotte&#8217;s Web&#8221; legislation, aimed at decriminalizing low grade marijuana specifically for the use of treating epilepsy and cancer patients. Pursuant to the lease agreement, the Company has a first right of refusal to purchase the property for three years. 

&#160; 

On July 11, 2014, the Company signed a 10- year lease agreement for 40 acres in Pueblo, Colorado, now bringing total land holdings in the country&#8217;s first recreational cannabis state to over 120 acres zoned for its planned agricultural and cultivation facilities located in Pueblo County, Colorado. The lease requires monthly rent payments of $10,000 during the first year and is subject to a 2% annual increase over the life of the lease. The lease also provides rights to 50 acres of certain tenant water rights for $50,000 annually plus cost of approximately $2,400 annually. The water rights ensure the Company&#8217;s non-interruption of operations on behalf of new tenants qualified as fully registered and licensed grow and manufacturing operations. 

&#160; 

We plan to continue to acquire additional commercial real estate and lease land to licensed participants in the cannabis industry. These participants include, cultivators, dispensary owners, product packaging, lighting, cultivation supplies, and financial services. In exchange for certain services that may be provided to these tenants, we expect to receive rental income in the form of cash. In certain cases, we may acquire equity interests or provide debt capital to these businesses. 

&#160; 

Equipment leasing and financing 

&#160; 

We will expand our division to lease cultivation equipment and facilities to customers in the cannabis industry. We expect we will enter into sale lease-back transactions of grow lights, tenant improvements and other grow equipment. Since Colorado State law does not allow entities operating under a cannabis license to pledge the assets or the license of the cannabis operation for any type of general borrowing activity, we intend to provide loans to individuals and businesses in the cannabis industry on an unsecured basis. Equipment will only be leased to tenants that possess the requisite state licenses to operate such facilities. The leases with the tenants will provide certain requirements that permit us to continually evaluate its tenants&#8217; compliance with applicable laws and regulations. 

&#160; 

We are exploring lending opportunities in Oregon, Washington, Colorado, and Arizona. Our finance strategy will include making direct term loans and providing revolving lines of credit to businesses involved in the cultivation and sale of cannabis and related products. These loans will generally be secured to the maximum extent permitted by law. We believe there is a significant demand for this financing. We are pursuing other finance services including customized finance, capital formation, and banking, for participants in the cannabis industry. 

&#160; 

Consulting and Advisory 

&#160; 

Through AVH we offer comprehensive consulting services to the cannabis industry that include obtaining licenses, compliance, cultivation, logistical support, facility design and building services. Our business plan is based on the future growth of the regulated cannabis market in the United States. We will provide general advisory services for business development, facilities design and construction, cultivation and retail operations, marketing and the improvement and expansion of existing operations. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Through December 31, 2015, we operated in one reportable segment, wholesale sales. &#160; 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

Other than the Company&#8217;s sole officer and director, the Company does not have any full-time employees. The Company relies on several independent contractors and other agreements it has with other companies to provide the services needed. Each management hire has been carefully selected to address immediate needs in particular functional areas, but also with consideration of the Company&#8217;s future needs during a period of expected rapid growth and expansion. Value is placed not only on outstanding credentials in specific areas of functional expertise, but also on cross-functionality, a strong knowledge of content acquisition and distribution, along with hands-on experience in scaling operations from initial beta and development stage through successful commercial deployment. 

&#160; 

Sales and Marketing Strategy 

Agritek&#8217;s plan is to gain market share within the medicinal and recreational cannabis industry. Agritek intends to accomplish this by providing infrastructure and turnkey solutions to operators and licensees within legal jurisdictions. Agritek canprovide these operations support with the licensing process, site selection, agriculture planning, build out, equipment leasing/financing, security and oversight by operational expertise. The Company additionally has expanded its product offerings to include a proprietary brand of vaporizers and accessories under its wholly owned subsidiary Prohibition Products Inc. and is planning to enter the edibles and nutraceutical markets through third party licenses. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Currently, there are a number of other companies that provide similar products and/or services, such as hydroponic supplies, hemp products, leasing of real estate and consulting services to the cannabis industry. In the future we fully expect that other companies will recognize the value of ancillary businesses serving the cannabis industry and enter into the marketplace as competitors. 

&#160; 

The cannabis industry in the United States is highly fragmented, rapidly expanding and evolving. The industry is characterized by new and potentially disruptive or conflicting legislation propounded on a state-by-state basis. Our competitors may be local or international enterprises and may have financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources greater than ours. These companies may also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel and consultants. 

&#160; 

Our competitive position will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified licensees in regulated jurisdictions, consultants and advisors with industry depth, and talented managerial, operational and other personnel. Our competitive position will also depend on our ability to develop and acquire effective proprietary products and solutions, personal relationships of our executive officers and directors, and our ability to secure adequate capital resources. We compete to attract and retain customers of our services. We expect to compete in this area on the basis of price, regulatory compliance, vendor relationships, usefulness, availability, and ease of use of our services. 

&#160; 

A few of the companies competing within the recreational cannabis sector including: 

&#160; 

Medbox, Inc. (OTCB: MDBX) is seeking to become a dispensary and cultivation infrastructure and licensing specialist, patented technology provider, and partner to the cannabis industry. 

&#160; 

Terra Tech Corp (OTCB: TRTC) is integrating the best of the natural world with technology to create sustainable renewable solutions for food production, indoor cultivation, and agricultural research and development. 

&#160; 

Cannabics Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (OTCQB: CNBX) is an emerging drug development company focused on the development and commercialization of advanced drugs, therapies, food supplements and administration routes based on the wide range of active ingredients found in diverse and unique strains of the Cannabis plant. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

As of March 31, 2016, there are 23 states plus the District of Columbia that have laws and/or regulation that recognize in one form or another legitimate medical uses for cannabis and consumer use of cannabis in connection with medical treatment. Many other states are considering similar legislation. Conversely, the federal government regulates drugs through the Controlled Substances Act (&#8220;CSA&#8221;), which does not recognize the difference between medical and recreational use of cannabis. Under federal law, cannabis is treated like every other controlled substance, such as cocaine and heroin. The federal government places every controlled substance in a schedule, in principle according to its relative potential for abuse and medicinal value. Under the CSA, cannabis is classified as a Schedule I drug, which means that the federal government views medical cannabis as highly addictive and having no medical value. Pursuant to the CSA, it is unlawful for any person (1) to sell or offer for sale drug paraphernalia; (2) to use the mails or any other facility of interstate commerce to transport drug paraphernalia; or (3) to import or export drug paraphernalia. 

The extent to which the regulation of drug paraphernalia under the CSA is applicable to our business and the sale of our product is found in the definition of drug paraphernalia. Drug paraphernalia means any equipment, product, or material of any kind which is primarily intended or designed for use in manufacturing, compounding, converting, concealing, producing processing, preparing, injecting ingesting, inhaling or otherwise introducing into the human body a controlled substance, possession of which is unlawful. Our products are primarily designed for general agricultural use. 

&#160; 

In an effort to provide guidance to federal law enforcement, the Department of Justice (the &#8220;DOJ&#8221;) has issued Guidance Regarding Marijuana Enforcement to all United States Attorneys in a memorandum from Deputy Attorney General David Ogden on October 19, 2009, in a memorandum from Deputy Attorney General James Cole on June 29, 2011 and in a memorandum from Deputy Attorney General James Cole (the &#8220;Cole Memo&#8221;) on August 29, 2013. Each memorandum provides that the DOJ is committed to enforcement of the CSA but the DOJ is also committed to using its limited investigative and prosecutorial resources to address the most significant threats in the most effective, consistent and rational way. 

The Cole Memo provides updated guidance to federal prosecutors concerning marijuana enforcement in light of state laws legalizing medical and recreational marijuana possession in small amounts. The memorandum sets forth certain enforcement priorities that are important to the federal government: 

&#160; &#8226; Distribution of marijuana to children; &#160; 

&#160; &#8226; Revenue from the sale of marijuana going to criminals; &#160; 

&#160; &#8226; Diversion of medical marijuana from states where is legal to states where it is not; &#160; 

&#160; &#8226; Using state authorized marijuana activity as a pretext of other illegal drug activity; &#160; 

&#160; &#8226; Preventing violence in the cultivation and distribution of marijuana; &#160; 

&#160; &#8226; Preventing drugged driving; &#160; 

&#160; &#8226; Growing marijuana on federal property; and &#160; 

&#160; &#8226; Preventing possession or use of marijuana on federal property. The DOJ has not historically devoted resources to prosecuting individuals whose conduct is limited to possession of small amounts of marijuana for use on private property but relied on state and local law enforcement to address marijuana activity. If the Department of Justice (the &#8220;DOJ&#8221;) Guidance Regarding Marijuana Enforcement to all United States Attorneys from Deputy Attorney General David Ogden on October 19, 2009, and from Deputy Attorney General James Cole on June 29, 2011 and again from Deputy Attorney General James Cole on August 29, 2013, were reversed and it was determined that the Company violated the regulation of drug paraphernalia under the CSA, then the Company would need to make appropriate modifications to its products to avoid violation of the CSA. Until Congress amends the CSA with respect to medical marijuana, there is a risk that federal authorities may enforce current federal law. Active enforcement of the current federal regulatory position on cannabis may thus indirectly, adversely and materially affect revenues and profits of the Company. The risk of strict enforcement of the CSA in light of congressional activity, judicial holdings and stated federal policy remains uncertain.
