 Item 1. Business Overview 

Ryman is the successor to Gaylord Entertainment Company (&#147;Gaylord&#148;), formerly a Delaware corporation originally incorporated in 1956. As part of the plan to restructure our business operations to facilitate our qualification as a real estate investment trust (&#147;REIT&#148;) for federal income tax purposes, Gaylord merged with and into its wholly-owned subsidiary, Ryman, on October 1, 2012, with Ryman as the surviving corporation and Ryman succeeded to and began conducting, either directly or indirectly, all of the business conducted by Gaylord immediately prior to the merger. Ryman is a Delaware corporation that began operating as a self-advised and self-administered REIT for federal income tax purposes on January 1, 2013. We specialize in group-oriented, destination hotel assets in urban and resort markets. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal corporate income taxes on that portion of our capital gain or ordinary income from our REIT operations that is distributed to our stockholders. This treatment substantially eliminates the federal &#147;double taxation&#148; on earnings from our REIT operations, or taxation once at the corporate level and again at the stockholder level, that generally results from investment in a regular C corporation. Our non-REIT operations, which consist of the activities of our taxable REIT subsidiaries (&#147;TRSs&#148;) that lease or sublease our hotels from our qualified REIT subsidiaries, as well as businesses within our Entertainment segment, will continue to be subject, as applicable, to federal and state corporate income taxes. 

Our owned assets include a network of four upscale, meetings-focused resorts totaling 7,795 rooms that are managed by lodging operator Marriott International, Inc. (&#147;Marriott&#148;) under the Gaylord Hotels brand. These four resorts, which we refer to as our Gaylord Hotels properties, consist of the Gaylord Opryland Resort &#38; Convention Center in Nashville, Tennessee (&#147;Gaylord Opryland&#148;), the Gaylord Palms Resort &#38; Convention Center near Orlando, Florida (&#147;Gaylord Palms&#148;), the Gaylord Texan Resort &#38; Convention 

&#160;

Center near Dallas, Texas (&#147;Gaylord Texan&#148;) and the Gaylord National Resort &#38; Convention Center near Washington D.C. (&#147;Gaylord National&#148;). Other owned assets managed by Marriott include Gaylord Springs Golf Links (&#147;Gaylord Springs&#148;), the Wildhorse Saloon, the General Jackson Showboat (&#147;General Jackson&#148;), the Inn at Opryland, a 303-room overflow hotel adjacent to Gaylord Opryland, and the AC Hotel at National Harbor, Washington D.C. (&#147;AC Hotel&#148;), a 192-room overflow hotel adjacent to Gaylord National, which we purchased in December 2014 and opened in April 2015. We also own and operate media and entertainment assets including the Grand Ole Opry, the legendary weekly showcase of country music&#146;s finest performers for over 90 years; the Ryman Auditorium, the storied live music venue and former home of the Grand Ole Opry located in downtown Nashville; and WSM-AM, the Opry&#146;s radio home. 

Our operations are organized into three principal business segments: (i) Hospitality, which includes our hotel properties and the results of hotel operations; (ii) Entertainment, previously referred to as Opry and Attractions, which includes our Grand Ole Opry assets, WSM-AM and our Nashville attractions; and (iii) Corporate and Other, which includes corporate expenses. These three business segments &#151; Hospitality, Entertainment, and Corporate and Other &#151; represented approximately 91%, 9%, and 0%, respectively, of our total revenues for 2015. 

Financial information by business segment and for each of our Gaylord Hotels properties as of December 31, 2015 and for each of the three years in the period then ended appears in Item 6, &#147;Selected Financial Data,&#148; Item 7, &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,&#148; and in the Financial Reporting by Business Segments note (Note 13) to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Our Strategic Plan 

Our goal is to become the nation&#146;s premier hospitality REIT for group-oriented, destination hotel assets in urban and resort markets. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Existing Hotel Property Design. Our hotel properties focus on the large group meetings market in the United States and incorporate meeting and exhibition space, signature guest rooms, food and beverage offerings, fitness and spa facilities and other attractions within a large hotel property so attendees&#146; needs are met in one location. This strategy creates a better experience for both meeting planners and guests, and has placed our current hotel properties among the leading convention hotels in the country. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Expansion of Hotel Asset Portfolio. While we intend our short-term capital allocation strategy to focus on paying cash dividends to stockholders, part of our long-term growth strategy includes acquisitions of other hotels, particularly in the group meetings sector of the hospitality industry, either alone or through joint ventures or alliances with one or more third parties. We intend to pursue attractive investment opportunities which meet our acquisition parameters, specifically, group-oriented large hotels and overflow hotels with existing or potential leisure appeal. We are generally interested in highly accessible upper-upscale assets with over 400 hotel rooms in urban and resort group destination markets. We also consider assets that possess or are located near convention centers that present a repositioning opportunity and/or would significantly benefit from capital investment in additional rooms or meeting space. We plan to expand the geographic diversity of our existing asset portfolio through acquisitions. As a REIT, we do not view independent, large-scale development of resort and convention hotels as part of our long-term growth strategy. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Leverage Brand Name Awareness. We believe the Grand Ole Opry is one of the most recognized entertainment brands in the United States. We promote the Grand Ole Opry name through various media, including our WSM-AM radio station, the Internet and television, and through performances by the Grand Ole Opry&#146;s members, many of whom are renowned country music artists. As such, we have alliances in place with multiple distribution partners in an effort to foster brand extension. We are continuously exploring additional products, such as television specials and retail products, through which we can capitalize on our brand affinity and awareness. We believe that licensing our brand for products may provide an opportunity to increase revenues and cash flow with relatively little capital investment. Description of our Hotel Portfolio 

Our Gaylord Hotels properties incorporate meeting, convention and exhibition space with a large hotel property so the attendees never have to leave the location during their meetings. This concept of a self-contained destination dedicated primarily to the meetings industry has placed our Gaylord Hotels properties among the leading convention hotels in the country. 

&#160;

Marriott is responsible for the day-to-day management of our Gaylord Hotels, the Inn at Opryland, and the AC Hotel. We believe that our Gaylord Hotels properties have benefitted and will continue to benefit from Marriott&#146;s expansive sales force and popular frequent traveler program, as well as their ability to manage group business. 

Based on our information and information and data obtained from Smith Travel Research, the top 10 hotels within the United States with the highest square footage of self-contained exhibit and meeting space as of January 2016 are as follows:

Gaylord Opryland has a number of themed restaurants, retail outlets, and a full-service spa with 27,000 square feet of dedicated space and 12 treatment rooms. It also serves as a destination resort for vacationers due to its proximity to the Grand Ole Opry, the General Jackson Showboat, the Gaylord Springs Golf Links (our 18-hole championship golf course), and other attractions in the Nashville area. Gaylord Opryland has 2,882 signature guest rooms, four ballrooms with approximately 127,000 square feet, 111 banquet/meeting rooms, and total meeting, exhibit and pre-function space of approximately 640,000 square feet. Gaylord Opryland has been recognized by many industry and commercial publications, receiving Successful Meetings magazine&#146;s Pinnacle Award from 2010 through 2015, Meeting &#38; Conventions&#146; Gold Key and Gold Platter Awards every year since 1993, and is recognized as a member of Meeting &#38; Conventions Hall of Fame. 

Gaylord Palms Resort and Convention Center &#151; Kissimmee, Florida. Gaylord Palms has 1,406 signature guest rooms, three ballrooms with approximately 76,000 square feet, 76 banquet/meeting rooms, and total meeting, exhibit and pre-function space of approximately 400,000 square feet. The resort is situated on a 65-acre site in Osceola County, Florida, which we have leased pursuant to a 75-year ground lease with a 24-year renewal option. The resort is approximately a five minute drive from the main gate of the Walt Disney World &#174; Resort complex. Gaylord Palms has a number of themed restaurants, retail outlets and a full-service spa, with 20,000 square feet of dedicated space and 25 treatment rooms. In 2012, a new resort pool and new 2-story sports bar complex opened at Gaylord Palms. Hotel guests also have golf privileges at Celebration Golf Club, located approximately two miles from the property. The Gaylord Palms is rated as a AAA Four-Diamond Hotel and has been recognized by many publications, receiving Successful Meetings magazine&#146;s Pinnacle Award from 2007 to 2015, Meeting and Convention&#146;s Gold Key Award every year since 2003 and their Gold Platter Award eleven times since 2003, and is recognized as a member of Meeting &#38; Conventions Hall of Fame. 

Gaylord Texan Resort and Convention Center &#151; Grapevine, Texas. Gaylord Texan is situated on approximately 85 acres and is located approximately six minutes from the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. Of the 85 acres, we own 75 acres and lease approximately 10 acres pursuant to a ground lease. The hotel features a lavish and expansive atrium, 1,511 signature guest rooms, three ballrooms with approximately 85,000 square feet, 70 banquet/meeting rooms, and total meeting, exhibit and pre-function space of approximately 400,000 square feet.

Description of our Entertainment Portfolio (previously referred to as Opry and Attractions) 

The Grand Ole Opry. The Grand Ole Opry, which celebrated its 90 th anniversary in 2015, is one of the most widely known platforms for country music in the world. The Opry features a live country music show with performances every Friday and Saturday night, as well as additional weekly performances on a seasonal basis. The Opry House, home of the Grand Ole Opry, seats approximately 4,400, is located in the Opryland complex, and was named the Venue of the Year by the Academy of Country Music in 2014. The Grand Ole Opry moved to the Opry House in 1974 from its most famous home in the Ryman Auditorium in downtown Nashville. Each week, the Grand Ole Opry is broadcast live to millions of country lifestyle consumers on radio via WSM-AM and Sirius/XM Radio and streamed on the Internet. Special episodes of the Grand Ole Opry are also broadcast on television via the Great American Country network. The show has been broadcast since 1925 on WSM-AM, making it the longest running live radio program in the United States. In addition to performances by its members, the Grand Ole Opry presents performances by many other country music artists and other acts. 

Ryman Auditorium. The Ryman Auditorium, which was built in 1892 and seats approximately 2,300, is designated as a National Historic Landmark. The former home of the Grand Ole Opry, the Ryman Auditorium was renovated and re-opened in 1994 for concerts and musical productions. The Grand Ole Opry returns to the Ryman Auditorium periodically, most recently from November 2015 to January 2016. The Ryman Auditorium has been nominated for &#147;Theatre of the Year&#148; by Pollstar Concert Industry Awards every year since 2003, winning the award in 2003, 2004, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015, and was named the Venue of the Year by the Academy of Country Music in 2009, 2011, 2013 and 2015. 

The General Jackson Showboat. We own the General Jackson Showboat, a 300-foot, four-deck paddle wheel showboat on the Cumberland River, which flows past the Gaylord Opryland complex in Nashville. Its Victorian Theatre can seat 600 people for banquets and 1,000 people for theater-style presentations. The showboat stages Broadway-style shows and other theatrical productions. The General Jackson is one of many sources of entertainment that is available to conventions held at Gaylord Opryland. During the day, it operates cruises, primarily serving tourists visiting the Gaylord Opryland complex and the Nashville area. Marriott manages the day-to-day operations of the General Jackson. 

Gaylord Springs. Minutes from Gaylord Opryland, Gaylord Springs (our 18-hole championship golf course) was designed by former U.S. Open and PGA Champion Larry Nelson. The 40,000 square-foot antebellum-style clubhouse offers meeting space for up to 500 guests. Marriott manages the day-to-day operations of Gaylord Springs. 

The Wildhorse Saloon. Since 1994, we have owned the Wildhorse Saloon, a country music performance venue on historic Second Avenue in downtown Nashville. The three-story facility includes a dance floor of approximately 2,000 square feet, as well as a restaurant and banquet facility that can accommodate up to 2,000 guests. Marriott manages the day-to-day operations of the Wildhorse Saloon. 

WSM-AM. WSM-AM commenced broadcasting in 1925. The involvement of Ryman&#146;s predecessors with country music dates back to the creation of the radio program that became The Grand Ole Opry, which has been broadcast live on WSM-AM since 1925. WSM-AM is broadcast from the Gaylord Opryland complex in Nashville and has a country music format. WSM-AM is one of the nation&#146;s &#147;clear channel&#148; stations, meaning that no other station in a 750-mile radius uses the same frequency for night time broadcasts. As a result, the station&#146;s signal, transmitted by a 50,000 watt transmitter, can be heard at night in much of the United States and parts of Canada. 

&#160;

Corporate and Other Segment 

Our Corporate and Other segment includes operating and general and administrative expenses related to the overall management of the Company which are not allocated to the other reportable segments, including certain costs for our retirement plans, equity-based compensation plans, information technology, human resources, accounting, and other administrative expenses. 

Corporate History and Structure 

We were originally incorporated in 1956 and were reorganized in connection with a 1997 corporate restructuring. Prior to our REIT conversion, we operated as a C corporation. In 2012, we completed restructuring transactions intended to facilitate our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, which included the merger, effective on October 1, 2012, of our predecessor, Gaylord, with and into its wholly-owned subsidiary, Ryman, with Ryman surviving the merger, at which time Ryman succeeded to and began conducting, directly or indirectly, all of the business conducted by Gaylord immediately prior to the merger. Prior to Marriott&#146;s assumption of the day-to-day management of our hotels and certain of our Nashville attractions, we managed such assets. We elected REIT status effective January 1, 2013. 

All of our assets are held by, and all of our operations are conducted through, RHP Hotel Properties, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the &#147;Operating Partnership&#148;). In the future, we may amend the limited partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership to provide that its partnership units will be convertible on a one-for-one basis for shares of our common stock. Under certain circumstances, we may issue such partnership units as consideration to acquire hotel properties. By offering partnership units, the seller of such hotel property could defer federal income tax on any of the seller&#146;s gains on sale, and this tax advantage may enable us to acquire hotel properties in the future which otherwise may not be available for sale. 

As a REIT, at least 75% of our gross income for each taxable year must generally be derived from &#147;rents from real property&#148; or other income permitted by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;). To meet this requirement, our hotel properties are owned or leased by certain subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership, which are disregarded entities for federal income tax purposes, and these subsidiaries lease or sublease our hotels to our TRSs pursuant to leases that contain economic terms which are similar to leases between unrelated parties. The rent that we receive from our TRS lessees qualifies as &#147;rents from real property&#148; as long as the property is operated on behalf of our TRS lessees by a person who qualifies as an &#147;independent contractor&#148; (as defined in the Code) and who is, or is related to a person who is, actively engaged in the trade or business of operating &#147;qualified lodging facilities&#148; (as defined in the Code) for any person unrelated to us and our TRS lessees (an &#147;eligible independent contractor&#148;). Our TRS lessees have engaged Marriott to manage the day-to-day operations of our hotels as an eligible independent contractor. 

In addition, we own our Entertainment businesses in TRSs, and certain of those TRSs have engaged Marriott to manage their assets, as described above. 

Tax Status 

As a REIT, we generally are not subject to corporate federal income tax on that portion of our REIT taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders. In addition to the requirement that 75% of our gross income for each taxable year be derived from &#147;rents from real property&#148; discussed above, we are subject to other organizational and operational requirements including the requirement that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income each year and the requirement that no more than 50% in value of our outstanding shares may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Code to include various kinds of entities). We will be subject to federal and state income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates if we fail to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes in any taxable year, or to the extent we distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income. In that event, we will also not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes until the fifth year following any year in which qualification is lost. Our non-REIT operations, which consist of the activities of our TRSs that lease or sublease our hotels from our qualified REIT subsidiaries, as well as businesses within our Entertainment segment, will continue to be subject, as applicable, to federal and state corporate income taxes. 

&#160;

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 249 full-time and 497 part-time and temporary employees. Of these, approximately 198 full-time and 495 part-time employees were employed in our Entertainment segment; and approximately 51 full-time employees and 2 part-time employees were employed in our Corporate and Other segment. We believe our relations with our employees are good. In connection with Marriott&#146;s assumption of the day-to-day management of our Gaylord Hotels properties and certain other assets, effective October 1, 2012, our former employees involved in the day-to-day operations of our Gaylord Hotels, as well as the General Jackson, Gaylord Springs and Wildhorse Saloon businesses, became employees of Marriott, and effective December 1, 2012, our former employees involved in the day-to-day operations of the Inn at Opryland became employees of Marriott. On those respective dates, Marriott assumed responsibility for hiring and maintaining the labor force at each of these properties. 

Competition 

Hospitality 

Our current hotel properties compete with numerous other hotels throughout the United States and abroad, particularly the approximately 100 convention hotels that, on average, have over 1,000 rooms and a significant amount of meeting and exhibit space. We believe that competition among convention hotels is based on, among other things: (i) the hotel&#146;s reputation, (ii) the quality of the hotel&#146;s facility, (iii) the quality and scope of a hotel&#146;s meeting and convention facilities and services, (iv) the desirability of a hotel&#146;s location, (v) travel distance to a hotel for meeting attendees, (vi) a hotel facility&#146;s accessibility to a recognized airport, (vii) the amount of entertainment and recreational options available in and in the vicinity of the hotel, (viii) service levels at the hotel, and (ix) price. Our hotels also compete against large municipal convention centers, including Orlando, Chicago, Atlanta, Dallas, Nashville and Washington, D.C. 

The hotel business is management and marketing intensive. Our current hotel properties compete with other hotels throughout the United States for high quality management and marketing personnel. We believe that Marriott&#146;s international brand, marketing scale and ability to manage group business have improved our hotels&#146; competitive position. However, there can be no assurance that Marriott will be able to continue to attract and retain employees with the requisite managerial and marketing skills. 

Additionally, as a REIT, we compete for investment opportunities in the hospitality industry, particularly the group-oriented meetings sector of the hospitality industry, with entities that may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have. These entities generally may be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage. Our focus on acquiring hotels in the large group meetings sector of the hospitality industry and the competition in this sector may generally limit the number of hotel properties that we are able to acquire. This competition may also increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell to us, making it more difficult for us to acquire new properties on attractive terms. 

Entertainment 

The Grand Ole Opry and our other entertainment businesses compete with all other forms of entertainment and recreational activities. The success of the Entertainment group is dependent upon certain factors beyond our control, including economic conditions, the amount of available leisure time, transportation cost, public taste and weather conditions. Our radio station competes with numerous other types of entertainment businesses, and success is often dependent on taste and fashion, which may fluctuate from time to time. 

Management Agreements 

Gaylord Hotels. We are a party to a management agreement with Marriott for each of our Gaylord Hotels properties, as well as a pooling agreement with Marriott with respect to the Gaylord Hotels properties on an aggregate basis. Each of the management agreements has a term expiring in 2047, with three automatic 10-year renewal periods (provided the applicable hotel has met certain performance thresholds). Each of the management agreements requires us to pay Marriott a base management fee of approximately 2% of gross revenues from the applicable property for each fiscal year or portion thereof. Additionally, the pooling agreement requires us to pay to Marriott an incentive fee of: (i) 20% of pooled available cash flow (which is generally operating profit for the pooled hotels less an owner&#146;s priority) in each of 2013 and 2014; (ii) 10% of the first $10.0 million of pooled available cash flow, plus 20% of any additional pooled available cash flow over such threshold for 2015; and (iii) 10% of the first $15.0 million of pooled available cash flow plus 20% of any additional pooled available cash flow over such threshold in or after 2016. The owner&#146;s priority is collectively $240 million, plus certain additional amounts, including 10% of certain non-routine capital expenditures and conversion work, and 10% of replacements of furniture, fixtures, and equipment and routine capital expenditures in excess of a reserve. If one or 

&#160;

more of our Gaylord Hotels properties were not a &#147;pooled hotel&#148; (i.e., if we cease to own the hotel or we lease the hotel to a third party), the thresholds used to calculate the incentive fee in the pooling agreement will be adjusted, and the incentive fee for the non-pooled hotel will be based on such hotel&#146;s performance. The management agreements and pooling agreement also contain certain restrictions on our incurring indebtedness that encumber our Gaylord Hotels properties on an individual or aggregate basis. The management agreements may be terminated earlier than the stated term if certain events occur, including the failure of Marriott to satisfy certain performance standards. The management agreements prohibit us from selling the Gaylord Hotels properties to certain persons, including any person who does not, in Marriott&#146;s reasonable judgment, have sufficient financial resources and liquidity to fulfill our obligations under the management agreements, or any person who owns a controlling interest in a hotel brand (e.g., Hilton or Hyatt) totalling at least ten full-service hotels that are not affiliated with a brand but that are marketed and operated as a collective group, if such brand or group of hotels compete with Marriott. In addition, we may not sell a Gaylord Hotels property if we are then in breach of the applicable management agreement. 

Inn at Opryland. Marriott manages the day-to-day operations of the Inn at Opryland pursuant to a management agreement that requires us to pay Marriott a base management fee of approximately 2% of gross revenues for each fiscal year or portion thereof. This management agreement expires in 2022, with five five-year renewal options, so long as neither party terminates the agreement. Additionally, this management agreement requires us to pay to Marriott an incentive fee of 20% of the excess of available cash flow (as defined in the management agreement) over a certain threshold. 

AC Hotel. Marriott manages the day-to-day operations of the AC Hotel pursuant to a management agreement that requires us to pay Marriott a base management fee of 5% of gross revenues for the first fiscal year, 6% of gross revenues for the second fiscal year, and 7% of gross revenues for each fiscal year thereafter. This management agreement expires in 2040, with two ten-year renewal options so long as neither party terminates the agreement. Additionally, this management agreement requires us to pay to Marriott an incentive fee of 20% of the excess of available cash flow (as defined in the management agreement) over a certain threshold. 

Certain Nashville Attractions. Marriott manages the General Jackson, the Wildhorse Saloon, and Gaylord Springs pursuant to management agreements. Each of these management agreements require us to pay Marriott a base management fee of approximately 2% of total revenues. Additionally, the management agreements require us to pay to Marriott an incentive fee of 20% of the excess of available cash flow (as defined in the management agreements) over a certain threshold. The management agreements for the General Jackson and the Wildhorse Saloon expire in 2017, with five one-year renewal options, so long as neither party terminates the agreement. The management agreement for Gaylord Springs expires in 2022. 

Total base management fees incurred during 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $17.4 million, $19.6 million and $18.1 million, respectively. Total incentive fees incurred during 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $1.4 million, $0.4 million and $0.1 million, respectively. Management fees are presented in the accompanying financial information net of the amortization of the deferred management rights proceeds discussed further in the REIT Conversion note (Note 2) to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Seasonality 

Portions of our business are seasonal in nature. The group convention business at our Gaylord Hotels properties is subject to reduced levels of demand during the year-end holiday periods.

Our current hotel properties are subject to certain federal, state, and local governmental laws and regulations including, without limitation, labor regulations, health and safety laws and environmental regulations applicable to hotel and restaurant operations. The hotels are also subject to the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act and similar state laws, as well as regulations pursuant thereto. We believe that our hotel properties and our attractions are in substantial compliance with such regulations. In addition, the sale of alcoholic beverages by a hotel requires a license and is subject to regulation by the applicable state and local authorities. The agencies involved have the power to limit, condition, suspend or revoke any such license, and any disciplinary action or revocation could have an adverse effect upon the results of operations of our Hospitality segment. Pursuant to management agreements with Marriott, we are no longer in control of many of these activities at our hotel properties, and we rely on Marriott to comply with all such federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations with respect to such properties. However, under the terms of our management agreements with Marriott, we may be required to bear the cost of any capital expenditures necessary to comply with a legal requirement. 

&#160;

Entertainment 

WSM-AM is subject to regulation under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended. Under the Communications Act, the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, among other things, assigns frequency bands for broadcasting; determines the frequencies, location, and signal strength of stations; issues, renews, revokes, and modifies station licenses; regulates equipment used by stations; and adopts and implements regulations and policies that directly or indirectly affect the ownership, operation, and other practices of broadcasting stations. Licenses issued for radio stations have terms of eight years. Radio broadcast licenses are renewable upon application to the FCC and in the past have been renewed except in rare cases. Competing applications will not be accepted at the time of license renewal, and will not be entertained at all unless the FCC first concludes that renewal of the license would not serve the public interest. A station will be entitled to renewal in the absence of serious violations of the Communications Act or FCC regulations or other violations which constitute a pattern of abuse. WMS-AM&#146;s current radio station license will expire in August 2020; however, we are not aware of any reason why WSM-AM&#146;s radio station license should not be renewed. 

In addition, our Nashville area attractions are also subject to the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act and similar state laws, as well as the laws and regulatory activities associated with the sale of alcoholic beverages described above. Pursuant to management agreements with Marriott, we are no longer in control of many of these activities with respect to the General Jackson Showboat, Gaylord Springs, and the Wildhorse Saloon, and we rely on Marriott to comply with all such federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations with respect to such businesses. However, under the terms of our management agreements with Marriott, we may be required to bear the cost of any capital expenditures necessary to comply with a legal requirement.
