 ITEM 1. &#160; &#32; BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Overview 

Barnwell was incorporated in Delaware in 1956 and fiscal 2016 &#32;represented Barnwell&#8217;s 60th year of operations. Barnwell operates in the following four principal business segments: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Oil and Natural Gas Segment &#160; - Barnwell engages in oil and natural gas development, production, acquisitions and sales in Canada. 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Land Investment Segment &#160; - Barnwell invests in land interests in Hawaii. 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Contract Drilling Segment &#160; - Barnwell provides well drilling services and water pumping system installation and repairs in Hawaii. 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Residential Real Estate Segment &#32; - Barnwell develops homes for sale in Hawaii. 

&#160; 

Oil and Natural Gas Segment 

Overview 

Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Barnwell of Canada, we are involved in the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas properties. Barnwell of Canada initiates and participates in acquisition and developmental operations for oil and natural gas on properties in which it has an interest and evaluates proposals by third parties with regard to participation in exploratory and developmental operations elsewhere. 

&#160; 

Operations 

Barnwell&#8217;s investments in oil and natural gas properties are located in Canada, principally in the province of Alberta, with minor, non-producing holdings in the provinces of Saskatchewan and British Columbia. These property interests are principally held under governmental leases or licenses. Under the typical Canadian provincial governmental lease, Barnwell must perform exploratory operations, establish production and comply with certain other conditions. Lease terms vary with each province, but, in general, the terms grant Barnwell the right to remove oil, natural gas and related substances subject to payment of royalties on production that vary based on production rates and commodity prices. 

&#160; 

All acquisition and developmental activities, as well as all field operations and regulatory compliance, are the direct responsibility of Barnwell of Canada&#8217;s President and Chief Operating Officer, with strategic direction and approvals for major expenditures secured from Barnwell&#8217;s senior executive management. In fiscal 2016 , Barnwell participated in acquisition and developmental operations in Alberta, although Barnwell does not limit its consideration of acquisition and developmental operations to this area. 

&#160; 

Natural gas prices are typically higher in the winter than at other times due to increased heating demand. Oil prices are also subject to seasonal fluctuations, but to a lesser degree. Oil and natural gas unit sales are based on the quantity produced from the properties by the properties&#8217; operator. 

Our oil and natural gas segment revenues, profitability, and future rate of growth are dependent on oil and natural gas prices. The industry has experienced a prolonged period of low oil and natural gas prices that has negatively impacted our operating results, cash flows and liquidity. Credit and capital markets for 

oil and natural gas companies have been negatively affected as well, resulting in a decline in sources of financing as compared to previous years. 

In September 2015, Barnwell sold its interests in its principal oil and natural gas properties located in the Dunvegan and Belloy areas of Alberta, Canada. Barnwell's net proceeds from the sale, after broker's fees and other closing costs, were $14,162,000 . The disposition was recorded in fiscal 2015 using preliminary purchase price adjustments. Barnwell and the purchaser updated and finalized the purchase price adjustments in accordance with the terms of the purchase and sale agreement during fiscal 2016 which resulted in additional proceeds of $493,000 and the recognition of an additional gain in the amount of $472,000 during the year ended September 30, 2016, bringing the total gain on the sale of these properties to $6,689,000. 

The sale of Dunvegan resulted in a 60% decrease in our proved natural gas reserves and a 34% decrease in our proved oil and natural gas liquids reserves. In fiscal 2015, Dunvegan accounted for 74% of our net natural gas production and 44% of our net oil and natural gas liquids production, and contributed 46% of our total oil and natural gas revenues. 

As a result of the disposition, Barnwell&#8217;s revolving credit facility at Royal Bank of Canada was amended in September 2015 to decrease the amount of the borrowing capacity from $6,500,000 Canadian dollars to $1,000,000 Canadian dollars. Barnwell repaid the $4,800,000 then outstanding on the credit facility in full from a portion of the proceeds of the Dunvegan disposition. In April 2016, the revolving credit facility was terminated. In June 2016, Barnwell entered into a new agreement with Royal Bank of Canada for a revolving demand facility in the amount of $500,000 Canadian dollars, or U.S. $381,000 &#32;at the September 30, 2016 &#32;exchange rate, which is secured by a $500,000 Canadian dollar, or U.S. $381,000, guaranteed investment certificate pledged to the Royal Bank of Canada. 

We intend to continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire additional acreage and producing assets and to access new drilling and recompletion opportunities in order to deploy some or all of the cash proceeds from the sale of Dunvegan and other cash on hand. However, to date, we have not made any such significant investments in new oil and natural gas properties since the sale of Dunvegan. Without a significant reinvestment in our oil and natural gas business, it is likely that our future cash flow from operations from this segment will continue to decline and may become negative. If we do not redeploy this cash in new investments in our oil and natural gas business, or in our other businesses, or in new businesses, the funds from the sale of Dunvegan, including potentially the entire remaining balance, and other cash on hand are likely to be used to fund existing ongoing operations, general and administrative expenses, asset retirement obligations and retirement plan funding. 

&#160; 

Preparation of Reserve Estimates 

Barnwell&#8217;s reserves are estimated by our independent petroleum reserve engineers, InSite, in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles and techniques and rules and regulations of the SEC. All information with respect to the Company&#8217;s reserves in this Form 10-K is derived from the report of InSite. A copy of the report issued by InSite is filed with this Form 10-K as Exhibit 99.1. InSite, and its predecessor company Paddock Lindstrom Associates Ltd., has been the Company&#8217;s independent petroleum reserve engineering firm for over 20 years. 

&#160; 

The preparation of data used by the independent petroleum reserve engineers to compile our oil and natural gas reserve estimates is completed in accordance with various internal control procedures which include verification of data input into reserves evaluation software, reconciliations and reviews of data 

provided to the independent petroleum reserve engineers to ensure completeness, and management review controls, including an independent internal review of the final reserve report for completeness and accuracy. 

&#160; 

Barnwell has a Reserves Committee consisting of four independent directors, the Company&#8217;s President and Chief Operating Officer, and the Company&#8217;s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The Reserves Committee was established to ensure the independence of the Company&#8217;s petroleum reserve engineers. The Reserves Committee is responsible for reviewing the annual reserve evaluation report prepared by the independent petroleum reserve engineering firm and ensuring that the reserves are reported fairly in a manner consistent with applicable standards. The Reserves Committee meets annually to discuss reserve issues and policies and to meet with Company personnel and the independent petroleum reserve engineers. 

&#160; 

Barnwell of Canada&#8217;s President and Chief Operating Officer has primary responsibility for overseeing the preparation of the Company&#8217;s reserve estimates by our independent petroleum reserve engineers. He is a professional engineer with over 30 years of relevant experience in all facets of the oil and natural gas industry in Canada and is a member of the Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of Alberta. 

Reserves 

The amounts set forth in the following table, based on InSite&#8217;s evaluation of our reserves, summarize our estimated proved reserves of oil (including natural gas liquids) and natural gas as of September 30, 2016 &#32;on all properties in which Barnwell has an interest. All of Barnwell&#8217;s proved reserves are developed; Barnwell has no proved undeveloped reserves as of September 30, 2016 . All of our oil and natural gas reserves are located in Canada and are based on constant dollars. No estimates of total proved net oil or natural gas reserves have been filed with, or included in reports to, any federal authority or agency, other than the SEC, since October 1, 2015 .

During fiscal 2016 , Barnwell&#8217;s total net proved developed reserves of oil and natural gas liquids decreased by 19,000 Bbls (4%) and total net proved developed reserves of natural gas decreased by 1,683,000 Mcf (54%), for a combined decrease of 310,000 Boe (31%). The decreases were primarily the result of downward revisions in volumes resulting from lower rolling average historical first-day-of-the-month oil and natural gas prices used in the determination of reserve volumes at September 30, 2016 as well as production during the year, partially offset by acquisitions of reserves and extensions, discoveries and other additions. 

The following table sets forth Barnwell&#8217;s oil and natural gas net reserves at September 30, 2016 , by property name, based on information prepared by InSite, as well as net production and net revenues by property name for the year ended September 30, 2016 . This table is based on constant dollars where reserve estimates are based on sales prices, costs and statutory tax rates in existence at September 30, 2016 , the date of the projection.

Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows 

The following table sets forth Barnwell&#8217;s &#8220;Estimated Future Net Revenues&#8221; from total proved oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves and the present value of Barnwell&#8217;s &#8220;Estimated Future Net Revenues&#8221; (discounted at 10%) as of September 30, 2016 . Estimated future net revenues for total proved reserves are net of estimated future expenditures of developing and producing the proved reserves, and assume the continuation of existing economic conditions. Net revenues have been calculated using the average first-day-of-the-month price during the 12-month period ending as of the balance sheet date and current costs, after deducting all royalties, operating costs, future estimated capital expenditures (including abandonment costs), and income taxes.

_______________________________________________ 

* &#160; &#32; This amount does not purport to represent, nor should it be interpreted as, the fair value of Barnwell&#8217;s natural gas and oil reserves. An estimate of fair value would also consider, among other items, the value of Barnwell&#8217;s undeveloped land position, the recovery of reserves not presently classified as proved, anticipated future changes in oil and natural gas prices (these amounts were based on a natural gas price of $1.35 per Mcf and an oil price of $34.19 per Bbl) and costs, and a discount factor more representative of the time value of money and the risks inherent in reserve estimates. 

&#160; 

Oil and Natural Gas Production 

The following table summarizes (a) Barnwell&#8217;s net production for the last three fiscal years, based on sales of natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids, from all wells in which Barnwell has or had an interest, and (b) the average sales prices and average production costs for such production during the same periods. Production amounts reported are net of royalties. All of Barnwell&#8217;s net production in fiscal 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;was derived in Canada, primarily in Alberta. For a discussion regarding our total annual production 

volumes, average sales prices, and related production costs, see Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221;

At September 30, 2016 , Barnwell was not in the process of drilling any oil or natural gas wells. 

&#160; 

Productive Wells 

As of September 30, 2016 , Barnwell had interests in 156 gross (31.3 net) productive wells, of which 86 gross (17.0 net) were oil wells and 70 gross (14.3 net) were natural gas wells. Four natural gas wells and two oil wells have dual or multiple completions. All wells were in Canada. 

&#160; 

Developed Acreage and Undeveloped Acreage

* &#160; &#32; &#8220;Developed Acreage&#8221; includes the acres covered by leases upon which there are one or more producing wells. &#8220;Undeveloped Acreage&#8221; includes acres covered by leases upon which there are no producing wells and which are maintained by the payment of delay rentals or the commencement of drilling thereon. 

&#160; 

Sixty-six percent of Barnwell&#8217;s undeveloped acreage is not subject to expiration at September 30, 2016 . Thirty-four percent of Barnwell&#8217;s leasehold interests in undeveloped acreage is subject to expiration and expire over the next five fiscal years, if not developed, as follows: 22% expire during fiscal 2017; 6% expire during fiscal 2018; 0% expire during fiscal 2019; 3% expire during fiscal 2020; and 3% expire in fiscal 2021. There can be no assurance that Barnwell will be successful in renewing its leasehold interests in the event of expiration. 

&#160; 

Much of the undeveloped acreage is at non-operated properties over which we do not have control, and the value of such acreage is not estimated to be significant at current commodity prices. Barnwell&#8217;s 

undeveloped acreage includes a significant concentration in the Thornbury (5,919 net acres) area of Alberta, Canada. 

Marketing of Oil and Natural Gas 

&#160; 

Barnwell sells all of its oil and natural gas liquids production under short-term contracts between itself and marketers of oil. The price of oil and natural gas liquids is freely negotiated between buyers and sellers and is largely determined by the world price for oil, which is principally denominated in U.S. dollars. 

Natural gas sold by Barnwell is generally sold under short-term contracts with prices indexed to market prices. The price of natural gas is freely negotiated between buyers and sellers and is principally determined for Barnwell by western Canadian/Midwestern U.S. prices for natural gas. In fiscal 2016 &#32;and 2015 , Barnwell took virtually all of its oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas &#8220;in kind&#8221; where Barnwell markets the products instead of having the operator of a producing property market the products on Barnwell&#8217;s behalf. 

&#160; 

We sell oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids to a variety of energy marketing companies. Because our products are commodities for which there are numerous marketers, we are not dependent upon one purchaser or a small group of purchasers. Accordingly, the loss of any single purchaser would not materially affect our revenue. 

&#160; 

In fiscal 2016 , over 85% of Barnwell&#8217;s oil and natural gas revenues were from products sold at spot prices. 

&#160; 

Governmental Regulation 

The jurisdictions in which the oil and natural gas properties of Barnwell are located have regulatory provisions relating to permits for the drilling of wells, the spacing of wells, the prevention of oil and natural gas waste, allowable rates of production and other matters. The amount of oil and natural gas produced is subject to control by regulatory agencies in each province that periodically assign allowable rates of production. The province of Alberta and Government of Canada also monitor and regulate the volume of natural gas that may be removed from the province and the conditions of removal. 

&#160; 

There is no current government regulation of the price that may be charged on the sale of Canadian oil or natural gas production. Canadian natural gas production destined for export is priced by market forces subject to export contracts meeting certain criteria prescribed by Canada&#8217;s National Energy Board and the Government of Canada. 

&#160; 

Different royalty rates are imposed by government agencies and private interests with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. In addition, provincial governments receive additional revenue through the imposition of taxes on oil and natural gas owned by private interests within the province. Essentially, provincial royalties are calculated as a percentage of revenue and vary depending on production volumes, selling prices and the date of discovery. 

&#160; 

All of Barnwell&#8217;s gross revenues were derived from properties located within Alberta. The province of Alberta charges oil and natural gas producers a royalty for production in Alberta. The province of Alberta determines its royalty share of natural gas and oil by using reference prices that average all natural gas sales and oil sales, respectively, in Alberta. Barnwell also pays gross overriding royalties and leasehold royalties on a portion of its natural gas and oil sales to parties other than the province of Alberta. 

Under the current Alberta Royalty Framework (&#8220;ARF&#8221;), royalty rates operate on a sliding rate formula sensitive to the price and production volumes of conventional oil and natural gas. The maximum royalty rate for conventional oil is 40% and the maximum royalty rate for natural gas is 36%. The price-sensitive maximum is reached for oil when oil is selling at or above $120.00 Canadian dollars per barrel and for natural gas when natural gas is selling at or above $17.50 Canadian dollars per Mcf. In January 2016, the Alberta Royalty Panel recommended a new modernized Alberta royalty framework ("New Framework") which will apply to wells drilled on or after January 1, 2017. The current ARF will continue to apply to wells drilled prior to January 1, 2017 for a period of ten years, starting January 1, 2017, after which they will fall under the New Framework. Under the New Framework the same royalty calculation applies to both oil and natural gas wells, whereas the current ARF has different royalties applicable to each category, and royalties will be determined on a revenue minus cost basis where producers will pay a flat royalty rate of 5% of gross revenues until a well reaches payout after which an increased post-payout royalty will apply. Post payout royalties vary with commodity prices and are adjusted down for cost increases as wells age. 

In fiscal 2016 &#32;and 2015 , 54% and 73%, respectively, of royalties related to Alberta government charges, and 46% and 27%, respectively, of royalties related to freehold, override and other charges which are not directly affected by the ARF. 

&#160; 

In fiscal 2016 , the weighted-average royalty rate paid on all of Barnwell&#8217;s natural gas was 1%, and the weighted-average royalty rate paid on oil was 16%. 

&#160; 

Barnwell's oil and natural gas segment is subject to the provisions of the Alberta Energy Regulator's (&#8220;AER&#8221;) Licensee Liability Rating (&#8220;LLR&#8221;) program. Under the LLR program the AER calculates a Liability Management Ratio (&#8220;LMR&#8221;) for a company based on the ratio of the company&#8217;s deemed assets over its deemed liabilities relating to wells and facilities for which the company is the licensed operator. The LMR assessment is designed to assess a company&#8217;s ability to address its suspension, abandonment, remediation, and reclamation liabilities. The value of the deemed assets is based on each well's most recent twelve months of production and a rolling three-year average industry netback as determined by the AER annually. The AER has not recalculated the three-year average industry netback since March 2015 making the current value a premium to what most producers have been realizing. A recalculation of the value using current industry netback values would likely have a significant negative impact on our LMR. Companies with an LMR less than 1.0 are required to deposit funds with the AER to cover future deemed liabilities. At September 30, 2016 , the Company had sufficient deemed asset value that no security deposit was due. 

In June 2016, the AER implemented changes in the Liability Management Program ("LMP") which now requires purchasers of AER licensed oil and natural gas assets to have an LMR of 2.0 or higher immediately following the transfer of a license, up from the previous requirement of 1.0 or higher. This change in the LMR requirement for well transfers will result in significantly less qualified buyers and may hinder our ability to generate capital by selling oil and natural gas assets. Additionally, it may inhibit our ability to grow through acquisitions without depositing collateral with the AER, as we do not currently have an LMR of 2.0 or higher. 

&#160; 

Additionally, in July 2014, the AER introduced an Inactive Well Compliance Program which resulted in the acceleration of expenditures to suspend and/or abandon long-term inactive wells. Under the program all inactive wells that were non-compliant as of April 1, 2015 need to be brought into compliance by the operator within five years, in increments of not less than 20 percent per year. At April 1, 2015, Barnwell had 25 inactive wells identified as non-compliant by the AER. At September 30, 2016, 22 of these 25 wells had been brought into compliance through a combination of re-activation, abandonment, or suspension. 

The estimated impact of the LLR program and Inactive Well Compliance Program has been incorporated into Barnwell's estimate of its asset retirement obligation liability. 

&#160; 

Competition 

Barnwell competes in the sale of oil and natural gas on the basis of price and on the ability to deliver products. The oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive in all phases, including the exploration for new production and reserves and the acquisition of equipment and labor necessary to conduct drilling activities. The competition comes from numerous major oil companies as well as numerous other independent operators. There is also competition between the oil and natural gas industry and other industries in supplying the energy and fuel requirements of industrial, commercial and individual consumers. Barnwell is a minor participant in the industry and competes in its oil and natural gas activities with many other companies having far greater financial, technical and other resources. 

&#160; 

Land Investment Segment 

Overview 

Barnwell owns a 77.6% interest in Kaupulehu Developments, a Hawaii general partnership that has the right to receive percentage of sales payments from KD I and KD II resulting from the sale of lots and/or residential units by KD I and KD II within the approximately 870 acres of the Kaupulehu Lot 4A area in two increments (&#8220;Increment I&#8221; and &#8220;Increment II&#8221;), located approximately six miles north of the Kona International Airport in the North Kona District of the island of Hawaii. Kaupulehu Developments also holds an interest in approximately 1,000 acres of vacant leasehold land zoned conservation located adjacent to Lot 4A under a lease that terminates in December 2025, which currently has no development potential without both a development agreement with the lessor and zoning reclassification. 

&#160; 

Barnwell, through two limited liability limited partnerships, KD Kona 2013 LLLP and KKM Makai, LLLP, holds a 19.6% non-controlling ownership interest in the Kukio Resort land development partnerships which is comprised of KD Kukio Resorts, LLLP, KD Maniniowali, LLLP and KD Kaupulehu, LLLP. These land development partnerships own certain real estate and development rights interests in the Kukio, Maniniowali and Kaupulehu portions of Kukio Resort, a private residential community on the Kona coast of the island of Hawaii, as well as Kukio Resort&#8217;s real estate sales office operations. KD Kaupulehu, LLLP, which is comprised of KD I and KD II, is the developer of Kaupulehu Lot 4A Increments I and II, the area in which Barnwell has interests in percentage of sales payments. Barnwell&#8217;s investment in these entities is accounted for using the equity method of accounting. The partnerships derive income from the sale of residential parcels, of which 25 lots remain to be sold within Kaupulehu Increment I and one ocean front parcel over two acres in size remains to be sold in Kaupulehu Increment II, as well as from commissions on real estate sales by the real estate sales office. 

&#160; 

Kaupulehu 2007, a Hawaii limited liability limited partnership 80%-owned by Barnwell, owns one residential parcel in Kaupulehu Lot 4A Increment I that is available for sale. 

&#160; 

Operations 

In the 1980s, Kaupulehu Developments obtained the state and county zoning changes necessary to permit development of the Four Seasons Resort Hualalai at Historic Ka`upulehu and Hualalai Golf Club, 

which opened in 1996, a second golf course, and single-family and multi-family residential units. These projects were developed by an unaffiliated entity on leasehold land acquired from Kaupulehu Developments. 

&#160; 

In the 1990s and 2000s, Kaupulehu Developments obtained the state and county zoning changes necessary to permit development of single-family and multi-family residential units, a golf course and a limited commercial area on approximately 870 leasehold acres, known as Lot 4A, zoned for resort/residential development, located adjacent to and north of the Four Seasons Resort Hualalai at Historic Ka`upulehu. In 2004 and 2006, Kaupulehu Developments sold its leasehold interest in Kaupulehu Lot 4A to KD I's and KD II's predecessors in interest, which was prior to Barnwell&#8217;s affiliation with KD I and KD II which commenced on November 27, 2013, the acquisition date of our ownership interest in the Kukio Resort land development partnerships. 

&#160; 

Increment I is an area planned for approximately 80 single-family lots, of which 25 lots remain to be sold, and a beach club on the portion of the property bordering the Pacific Ocean. The purchasers of the 80 single-family lots will have the right to apply for membership in the Kuki`o Golf and Beach Club, which is located adjacent to and south of the Four Seasons Resort Hualalai at Historic Ka`upulehu. Increment II is the remaining portion of the approximately 870-acre property and is zoned for single-family and multi-family residential units and a golf course and clubhouse. Two residential lots of significant value approximately two to three acres in size fronting the ocean were developed within Increment II by KD II, of which one lot was sold in fiscal 2016, and the remaining acreage within Increment II is not yet under development. It is uncertain when or if KD II will develop the other areas of Increment II, and there is no assurance with regards to the amounts of future sales from Increments I and II. 

Kaupulehu Developments is entitled to receive payments from KD I based on the following percentages of the gross receipts from KD I&#8217;s sales of single-family residential lots in Increment I: 9% of the gross proceeds from single-family lot sales up to aggregate gross proceeds of $100,000,000; 10% of such aggregate gross proceeds greater than $100,000,000 up to $300,000,000; and 14% of such aggregate gross proceeds in excess of $300,000,000. In fiscal 2016 , three single-family lots in Increment I were sold bringing the total amount of gross proceeds from single-family lot sales through September 30, 2016 &#32;to $205,000,000. 

&#160; 

Kaupulehu Developments is entitled to receive payments from KD II based on a percentage of the sales price of KD II&#8217;s sales of residential lots or units in Increment II ranging from 8% to 10% of the price of improved or unimproved lots or 2.60% to 3.25% of the price of units constructed on a lot, to be determined in the future depending upon a number of variables, including whether the lots are sold prior to improvement. Kaupulehu Developments is also entitled to receive up to $8,000,000 in additional payments after the members of KD II have received distributions equal to the capital they invested in the project. One of the two ocean front lots developed by KD II was sold in fiscal 2016 for $20,000,000, of which we received a percentage of sales payment in the amount of $1,600,000 from KD II representing 8% of the gross sales price of the parcel. 

&#160; 

In April 2016, the Kukio Resort land development partnerships made a cash distribution to its partners of which Barnwell received $5,320,000, after distributing $40,000 to minority interests. 

&#160; 

Competition 

Barnwell&#8217;s land investment segment is subject to intense competition in all phases of its operations including the acquisition of new properties, the securing of approvals necessary for land rezoning, and the search for potential buyers of property interests presently owned. The competition comes from numerous independent land development companies and other industries involved in land investment activities. The principal factors affecting competition are the location of the project and pricing. Barnwell is a minor participant in the land development industry and competes in its land investment activities with many other entities having far greater financial and other resources. 

&#160; 

Contract Drilling Segment 

Overview 

Barnwell&#8217;s wholly-owned subsidiary, Water Resources, drills water and water monitoring wells of varying depths in Hawaii, installs and repairs water pumping systems, and is the distributor for Floway pumps and equipment in the state of Hawaii. 

&#160; 

Operations 

Water Resources owns and operates four water well drilling rigs, two pump rigs and other ancillary drilling and pump equipment. Additionally, Water Resources leases a three-quarter of an acre maintenance facility in Honolulu, Hawaii, a one acre maintenance and storage facility with 2,800 square feet of interior space in Kawaihae, Hawaii, and a one-half acre equipment storage yard in Waimea, Hawaii, and maintains an inventory of drilling materials and pump supplies. 

Water Resources currently operates in Hawaii and is not subject to seasonal fluctuations. The demand for Water Resources&#8217; services is primarily dependent upon land development activities in Hawaii. Water Resources markets its services to land developers and government agencies, and identifies potential contracts through public notices, its officers&#8217; involvement in the community and referrals. Contracts are usually fixed price per lineal foot drilled or day rate contracts and are negotiated with private entities or obtained through competitive bidding with private entities or local, state and federal agencies. Contract revenues are not dependent upon the discovery of water or other similar targets, and contracts are not subject to renegotiation of profits or termination at the election of the governmental entities involved. Contracts provide for arbitration in the event of disputes. 

&#160; 

In fiscal 2016 , Water Resources started one well drilling and two pump installation and repair contracts and completed three well drilling and one pump installation and repair contracts. All three of the well drilling and the one pump installation and repair contracts completed were started in the prior year. Fifty percent of well drilling and pump installation and repair jobs, representing 36% of total contract drilling revenues in fiscal 2016 , have been pursuant to government contracts. 

&#160; 

At September 30, 2016 , there was a backlog of two well drilling and five pump installation and repair contracts, of which one well drilling and four pump installation and repair contracts were in progress as of September 30, 2016 . 

&#160; 

The approximate dollar amount of Water Resources&#8217; backlog of firm well drilling and pump installation and repair contracts at December 1, 2016 &#32;and 2015 &#32;was as follows: 

&#160;

&#160; 

Of the contracts in backlog at December 1, 2016 , $3,400,000 is expected to be recognized in fiscal 2017 with the remainder to be recognized in the following fiscal year. 

&#160; 

Competition 

Water Resources competes with other drilling contractors in Hawaii, some of which use drill rigs similar to Water Resources&#8217;. These competitors are also capable of installing and repairing vertical turbine and submersible water pumping systems in Hawaii. These contractors compete actively with Water Resources for government and private contracts. Pricing is Water Resources&#8217; major method of competition; reliability of service is also a significant factor. 

&#160; 

Competitive pressures are expected to remain high, thus there is no assurance that the quantity or values of available or awarded jobs which occurred in fiscal 2016 &#32;will continue. 

Residential Real Estate Segment 

Overview 

Kaupulehu 2007 develops luxury residences for sale. 

&#160; 

Operations 

We began our homebuilding business in fiscal 2007 when Kaupulehu 2007 purchased two parcels in the Lot 4A Increment I area of Kaupulehu. Construction of the two homes commenced in fiscal 2007 and was completed in fiscal 2009. One of the homes was sold in fiscal 2012 and the other was sold in fiscal 2016, and the Company has no current homebuilding plans. 

&#160; 

Competition 

Barnwell&#8217;s residential real estate segment is subject to intense competition in all phases of its operations including the acquisition of land, the building of residential homes, including the need for raw materials and skilled labor and the search for potential purchasers of completed homes. The competition comes from numerous independent real estate developers. The principal factors affecting competition are the location of the project, reputation, design, quality and pricing. Kaupulehu 2007 is a minor participant in the residential real estate industry and competes with many other entities having far greater financial and other resources. 

&#160; 

Financial Information About Industry Segments and Geographic Areas 

Note 15 in the &#8220;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#8221; in Item 8 contains information on our segments and geographic areas. 

&#160; 

Employees 

At December 1, 2016 , Barnwell employed 34 individuals; 33 on a full time basis and 1 on a part time basis. 

&#160; 

Environmental Costs 

Barnwell is subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations. U.S. Federal and state and Canadian Federal and provincial governmental agencies issue rules and regulations and enforce laws to protect the environment which are often difficult and costly to comply with and which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply, particularly in regard to the discharge of materials into the environment. These laws, which are constantly changing, regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and maintenance of surface conditions and may require Barnwell to remove or mitigate the environmental effects of the disposal or release of petroleum or chemical substances at various sites. 

In January 2015, there was an oil and saltwater release from one of our operated oil pipelines in Alberta, Canada. The gross environmental remediation costs were approximately $2,200,000. Barnwell&#8217;s working interest in the well is 58%, and we have recovered all of the monies from the other working interest owners for their share of the costs. We have collected insurance proceeds, less an $80,000 deductible, for our share of the costs. There was no remaining liability at September 30, 2016. 

In February 2016, a gas migration was detected at one of our previously abandoned non-operated wells in Alberta, Canada. We have estimated that probable environmental remediation costs will be within the range of $400,000 to $800,000. Barnwell&#8217;s working interest in the well is 50%, and accordingly we accrued approximately $200,000 at September 30, 2016, however as non-operator we have no control over the actual cost or timing of the eventual remediation. 

&#160; 

For further information on environmental remediation, see the Contingencies section included in Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; and the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#8221;
