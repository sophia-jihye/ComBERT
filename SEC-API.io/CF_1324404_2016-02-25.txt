We are one of the largest manufacturers and distributors of nitrogen fertilizer and other nitrogen products in the world. Our principal customers are cooperatives, independent fertilizer distributors, farmers and industrial users. Our principal nitrogen fertilizer products are ammonia, granular urea, urea ammonium nitrate solution (UAN) and ammonium nitrate (AN). Our other nitrogen products include diesel exhaust fluid (DEF), urea liquor, nitric acid and aqua ammonia, which are sold primarily to our industrial customers, and compound fertilizer products (NPKs), which are solid granular fertilizer products for which the nutrient content is a combination of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Our core market and distribution facilities are concentrated in the midwestern United States and other major agricultural areas of the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. We also export nitrogen fertilizer products from our Donaldsonville, Louisiana; Yazoo City, Mississippi; and Billingham, United Kingdom manufacturing facilities. 

Prior to March 17, 2014, we also manufactured and distributed phosphate fertilizer products. Our principal phosphate products were diammonium phosphate (DAP) and monoammonium phosphate (MAP). On March 17, 2014, we completed the sale of our phosphate mining and manufacturing business, which was located in Florida, to The Mosaic Company (Mosaic) for approximately $1.4 billion in cash. See Note 4&#8212;Acquisitions and Divestitures &#32;for additional information. 

Our principal assets include: 

&#8226; 

six North American nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities located in: Donaldsonville, Louisiana (the largest nitrogen fertilizer complex in North America); Medicine Hat, Alberta (the largest nitrogen fertilizer complex in Canada); Port Neal, Iowa; Courtright, Ontario; Yazoo City, Mississippi; and Woodward, Oklahoma; 

&#8226; 

two United Kingdom nitrogen manufacturing complexes located in Ince and Billingham that produce AN, ammonia and NPKs; 

&#8226; 

a 75.3% &#32;interest in Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P. (TNCLP), a publicly-traded limited partnership of which we are the sole general partner and the majority limited partner and which, through its subsidiary Terra Nitrogen, Limited Partnership (TNLP), operates a nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facility in Verdigris, Oklahoma; 

&#8226; 

an extensive system of terminals and associated transportation equipment located primarily in the midwestern United States; and 

&#8226; 

a 50% &#32;interest in Point Lisas Nitrogen Limited (PLNL), an ammonia production joint venture located in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago that we account for under the equity method. 

In 2015, we entered into a number of strategic agreements and transactions as follows: 

&#8226; 

We acquired the remaining 50% equity interest in CF Fertilisers UK Group Limited &#32;(formerly known as GrowHow UK Group Limited) (CF Fertilisers UK) not previously owned by us on July 31, 2015 for total consideration of $570.4 million, and CF Fertilisers UK &#32;became wholly owned by us. This transaction added CF Fertilisers UK &#8217;s nitrogen manufacturing complexes in Ince, United Kingdom and Billingham, United Kingdom to our consolidated manufacturing capacity. 

&#8226; 

We sold our interests in KEYTRADE AG (Keytrade), a global fertilizer trading company headquartered near Zurich, Switzerland, to the other key principals of Keytrade. 

&#8226; 

We sold our 50% ownership interest in an ammonia storage joint venture in Houston, Texas. 

CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. 

&#8226; 

We entered into a definitive agreement (as amended, the Combination Agreement) under which we will combine with the European, North American and global distribution businesses (collectively, the ENA Business) of OCI N.V. (OCI). The combination transaction includes OCI&#8217;s nitrogen production facility in Geleen, Netherlands; its nitrogen production facility under construction in Wever, Iowa; its approximately 79.88% equity interest in an ammonia and methanol complex in Beaumont, Texas; and its global distribution business and the assumption of approximately $2 billion in net debt. Under the terms of the Combination Agreement, CF Holdings will become a subsidiary of a new holding company (New CF) domiciled in the Netherlands. This transaction is expected to close in mid-2016, subject to the approval of shareholders of both CF Holdings and OCI, the receipt of certain regulatory approvals, and other closing conditions. See Note 4&#8212;Acquisitions and Divestitures &#32;for additional information. 

&#8226; 

We entered into a strategic venture with CHS Inc. (CHS). The strategic venture commenced on February 1, 2016, at which time CHS purchased a minority equity interest in CF Industries Nitrogen, LLC (CFN), a subsidiary of CF Holdings, for $2.8 billion. CHS also began receiving deliveries from us pursuant to a supply agreement under which CHS has the right to purchase annually from us up to approximately 1.1 million tons of granular urea and 580,000 tons of UAN at market prices. CHS is entitled to semi-annual profit distributions from CFN as a result of its minority equity interest in CFN. See Note 27&#8212;Subsequent Event &#32;for additional information on this strategic venture. 

We are currently constructing new ammonia and UAN plants at our Donaldsonville, Louisiana complex and new ammonia and urea plants at our Port Neal, Iowa complex. In November 2015, the new urea plant at the Donaldsonville, Louisiana complex came on line and was the first plant to be commissioned as part of our capacity expansion projects in North America. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&#38;A)&#8212;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Capacity Expansion Projects and Restricted Cash for additional information related to our capacity expansion projects. 

In the third quarter of 2015, we changed our reportable segment structure to separate AN from our Other segment as our AN products increased in significance as a result of the CF Fertilisers UK &#32;acquisition. Our reportable segment structure reflects how our chief operating decision maker (CODM), as defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), assesses the performance of our operating segments and makes decisions about resource allocation. Our reportable segments now consist of ammonia, granular urea, UAN, AN, Other, and phosphate. These segments are differentiated by products. Our management uses gross margin to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Historical financial results have been restated to reflect the new reportable segment structure on a comparable basis. See Note 4&#8212;Acquisitions and Divestitures &#32;for additional information. 

On May 15, 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a five-for-one split of our common stock to be effected in the form of a stock dividend. On June 17, 2015, stockholders of record as of the close of business on June 1, 2015 (Record Date) received four additional shares of common stock for each share of common stock held on the Record Date. Shares reserved under the Company's equity and incentive plans were adjusted to reflect the stock split. All share and per share data has been retroactively restated to reflect the stock split, except for the number of authorized shares of common stock. Since the par value of the common stock remained at $0.01 per share, the recorded value for common stock has been retroactively restated to reflect the par value of total outstanding shares with a corresponding decrease to paid-in capital. 

On March 17, 2014, we sold our phosphate mining and manufacturing business which was reported in our phosphate segment. The phosphate segment reflects the reported results of the phosphate business through March 17, 2014, plus the continuing sales of the phosphate inventory in the distribution network after March 17, 2014. The remaining phosphate inventory was sold in the second quarter of 2014; therefore, the phosphate segment does not have operating results subsequent to that quarter. However, the segment will continue to be included until the reporting of comparable period phosphate results ceases. See Note 4&#8212;Acquisitions and Divestitures &#32;for additional information. 

The ammonia, granular urea, UAN, AN and Other segments are also referred to throughout this document as the &#8220;Nitrogen Product Segments." For the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , we sold 13.7 million , 13.3 million &#32;and 12.9 million &#32;product tons from the Nitrogen Product Segments &#32;generating net sales of $4.31 billion , $4.57 billion &#32;and $4.68 billion , respectively.

Company History 

We were founded in 1946 as a fertilizer brokerage operation by a group of regional agricultural cooperatives. During the 1960s, we expanded our distribution capabilities and diversified into fertilizer manufacturing through the acquisition of several existing plants and facilities. During the 1970s and again during the 1990s, we expanded our production and distribution capabilities significantly, spending approximately $1 billion in each of these decades. 

We operated as a traditional manufacturing and supply cooperative until 2002, when we adopted a new business model that established financial performance as our principal objective, rather than assured supply to our owners. A critical aspect of the new business model was to establish a more economically driven approach to the marketplace. 

In August 2005, we completed our initial public offering (IPO) of common stock, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. In connection with the IPO, we consummated a reorganization transaction whereby we ceased to be a cooperative and our pre-IPO owners' equity interests in CF Industries were canceled in exchange for all of the proceeds of the offering and shares of our common stock. 

In April 2010, we acquired Terra Industries Inc. (Terra), a leading North American producer and marketer of nitrogen fertilizer products for a purchase price of $4.6 billion, which was paid in cash and shares of our common stock. As a result of the Terra acquisition, we acquired five nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities, our 75.3% interest in TNCLP and certain joint venture interests. 

In March 2014, we completed the sale of our phosphate mining and manufacturing business, which was located in Florida, to Mosaic for approximately $1.4 billion in cash. 

In July 2015, we acquired the remaining 50% equity interest in CF Fertilisers UK &#32;not previously owned by us for total consideration of $570.4 million, and CF Fertilisers UK &#32;became wholly owned by us. 

Product Tons and Nutrient Tons 

Unless otherwise stated, we measure our production and sales volume in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in product tons, which represents the weight of the product measured in short tons (one short ton is equal to 2,000 pounds). References to UAN product tons assume a 32% nitrogen content basis for production volume. 

We also provide certain supplementary volume information measured in nutrient tons. Nutrient tons represent the weight of the product&#8217;s nitrogen content, which varies by product. Ammonia represents 82% nitrogen content, granular urea represents 46% nitrogen content, UAN represents between 28% and 32% nitrogen content and AN represents between 29% and 35% nitrogen content. 

Reportable Segments 

As discussed above, our reportable segments now consist of the following segments: ammonia, granular urea, UAN, AN, Other, and phosphate. These segments are differentiated by products. Historical financial results have been restated to reflect this new reportable segment structure on a comparable basis. See Note 21&#8212;Segment Disclosures &#32;for additional information. 

We use gross margin to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Total other operating costs and expenses (consisting of selling, general and administrative expenses and other operating&#8212;net) and non-operating expenses (interest and income taxes), are centrally managed and are not included in the measurement of segment profitability reviewed by management. 

CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Other segment products include DEF, urea liquor, nitric acid, aqua ammonia and NPKs. 

Gross margin for the Nitrogen Product Segments &#32;was $1.55 billion , $1.77 billion &#32;and $2.45 billion &#32;for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. 

We operate seven nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities in North America. We own four nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities in the United States, one in Medicine Hat, Alberta, Canada and one in Courtright, Ontario, Canada. We also have a 75.3% &#32;interest in TNCLP and its subsidiary, TNLP, which owns a nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facility in Verdigris, Oklahoma. In 2015 , the combined production capacity of these seven facilities represented approximately 37%, 34%, 45% and 21% of North American ammonia, granular urea, UAN and AN production capacity, respectively. Each of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities in North America has on-site storage to provide flexibility to manage the flow of outbound shipments without impacting production. 

We also operate two United Kingdom nitrogen manufacturing complexes located in Ince and Billingham that produce ammonia, AN and NPKs and serve primarily the British agricultural and industrial markets.

Gross ammonia capacity includes ammonia used to produce upgraded products. Net ammonia capacity is gross ammonia capacity less ammonia used to produce upgraded products based on the product mix shown in the table. 

(3) &#160; 

Measured in tons of UAN containing 32% nitrogen by weight. 

(4) &#160; 

Urea is sold as granular urea from the Donaldsonville and Medicine Hat facilities, as urea liquor from the Port Neal, Woodward and Yazoo City facilities and as either granular urea or urea liquor from the Courtright facility. Urea liquor produced at the Yazoo City, Courtright, Woodward and Port Neal facilities can be sold as DEF. 

(5) &#160; 

AN includes prilled products (Amtrate and IGAN) and AN solution produced for sale. 

(6) &#160; 

The urea expansion capacity at Donaldsonville is online and available (Note: the urea expansion capacity of approximately 1.3 million tons has not been added to the capacity table above). If the full urea expansion capacity of approximately 1.3 million tons were produced, then the net ammonia balance would decrease by approximately 768,000 tons. 

(7) &#160; 

The Donaldsonville facility's remaining production capacity depends on product mix. Including the urea expansion capacity, the facility is capable of producing approximately 3.0 million tons of granular urea with UAN running at capacity. Granular urea production can be increased to approximately 3.3 million tons if UAN production is reduced to approximately 1.6 million tons. 

(8) &#160; 

Production of urea products at the Port Neal and Courtright facilities can be increased by reducing UAN production. Urea liquor production at the Yazoo City facility can be increased by obtaining additional ammonia to supplement the facility's ammonia production. 

(9) &#160; 

Represents 100% of the capacity of this facility. 

(10) &#160; 

Reduction of UAN or AN production at the Yazoo City, Courtright, Verdigris and Billingham facilities can allow more merchant nitric acid to be made available for sale. 

(11) &#160; 

The Yazoo City facility's production capacity depends on product mix. With the facility maximizing the production of AN products, 160,000 &#32;tons of UAN can be produced. UAN production can be increased to 450,000 tons by reducing the production of AN to 945,000 tons. 

(12) &#160; 

The Ince facility's production capacity depends on product mix. The facility can increase production of NPKs to 550,000 tons by reducing AN production to 485,000 tons.

These locations collectively have on-site storage for 40,000 &#32;tons of ammonia and 128,000 &#32;tons of AN. 

CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. 

Point Lisas, Trinidad 

The Point Lisas Nitrogen facility in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago is owned jointly through a 50/50 venture with Koch Fertilizer LLC. This facility has the capacity to produce 720,000 tons of ammonia annually from natural gas supplied under a contract with The National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago. 

Nitrogen Fertilizer Raw Materials 

Natural gas is the principal raw material and primary fuel source used in the ammonia production process at our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities. In 2015 , natural gas accounted for approximately 45% &#32;of our total production costs for nitrogen fertilizer products. Our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities have access to abundant, competitively-priced natural gas through a reliable network of pipelines that are connected to major natural gas trading hubs near the facilities. Our facilities utilize the following natural gas hubs: Henry Hub in Louisiana; ONEOK in Oklahoma; AECO in Alberta; Ventura in Iowa; Demarcation in Kansas; Dawn in Ontario; and the National Balancing Point in the United Kingdom. 

Our nitrogen manufacturing facilities consume, in the aggregate, approximately 280 million MMBtus of natural gas annually. We employ a combination of spot and term purchases from a variety of quality suppliers to maintain a reliable, competitively-priced supply of natural gas. We also use certain financial instruments to hedge natural gas prices. For further information about our natural gas hedging activities, see Note 16&#8212;Derivative Financial Instruments . 

Nitrogen Fertilizer Distribution 

The safe, efficient and economical distribution of nitrogen fertilizer products is critical for successful operations. Our nitrogen fertilizer production facilities have access to multiple transportation modes by which we ship fertilizer products to terminals, warehouses and customers. Each of our production facilities has a unique distribution pattern based on its production capacity and location. 

Our North American nitrogen production facilities can ship products via truck and rail to customers and our storage facilities in the U.S. and Canada, with access to our leased railcar fleet of approximately 5,600 tank and hopper cars, as well as railcars provided by rail carriers. Our United Kingdom nitrogen production facilities ship products via truck. 

The North American waterway system is also used extensively to ship products from our Donaldsonville, Verdigris and Yazoo City facilities. We employ a fleet of twelve leased tow boats and 40 river barges to ship ammonia and UAN. We also utilize contract marine services to move urea fertilizer. We also export nitrogen fertilizer products via barge from our Billingham, United Kingdom manufacturing facility. 

Three of our nitrogen production facilities also have access to pipelines for the transportation of ammonia. The Donaldsonville facility is connected to the 2,000-mile long Nustar pipeline through which we transport ammonia to more than 20 terminals and shipping points in the midwestern U.S. corn belt. Our Verdigris and Port Neal facilities are connected to the 1,100-mile long Magellan ammonia pipeline that also serves the U.S. Midwest. 

Phosphate Segment 

The phosphate segment reflects the reported results of the phosphate business through March 17, 2014, plus the continuing sales of the phosphate inventory in the distribution network after March 17, 2014. The remaining phosphate inventory was sold in the second quarter of 2014; therefore, the phosphate segment does not have operating results subsequent to that quarter although the segment will continue to be included until the reporting of comparable period phosphate results ceases. 

Upon selling the phosphate business, we began to supply Mosaic with ammonia produced by our PLNL joint venture. The contract to supply ammonia to Mosaic from our PLNL joint venture represents the continuation of a supply practice that previously existed between our former phosphate mining and manufacturing business and other operations of the Company. Prior to March 17, 2014, PLNL sold ammonia to us for use in the phosphate business and the cost was included in our production costs in our phosphate segment. Subsequent to the sale of the phosphate business, we now sell the PLNL-sourced ammonia to Mosaic. The revenue from these sales to Mosaic and the costs to purchase the ammonia from PLNL are now included in our ammonia segment. Our 50% share of the operating results of our PLNL joint venture continues to be included in equity in earnings of operating affiliates in our consolidated statements of operations. Because of the significance of this continuing supply practice, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the phosphate mining and manufacturing business is not reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations. For additional information regarding this sale, see Note 4&#8212;Acquisitions and Divestitures .

Our lease agreements are typically for periods of one to five years. 

Customers 

The principal customers for our nitrogen fertilizer and other nitrogen products are cooperatives, independent fertilizer distributors, farmers and industrial users. None of our customers in 2015 &#32;accounted for more than ten percent of our consolidated net sales. Sales are generated by our internal marketing and sales force. 

Competition 

Our markets are global and intensely competitive, based primarily on delivered price and, to a lesser extent, on customer service and product quality. During the peak demand periods, product availability and delivery time also play a role in the buying decisions of customers. 

Our primary North American-based competitors include Agrium Inc., Koch Fertilizer LLC and Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc. There is also significant competition from products sourced from other regions of the world, including some with lower natural gas or other feedstock costs. Because ammonia, urea and UAN are widely-traded fertilizer products and there are limited barriers to entry, we experience competition from foreign-sourced products continuously. 

Our primary United Kingdom competition comes from imported products supplied by companies including Yara International, Origin Fertilisers, Bunn Fertiliser Limited (Koch), Ameropa, CHS and Helm. Urea and UAN are not produced in the United Kingdom, but along with AN, are widely-traded fertilizer products with limited barriers to entry. 

CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. 

Seasonality 

The fertilizer business is seasonal. The degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors. The strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season, with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest. We and our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons. Seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the short application season and the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product. The seasonality of fertilizer demand generally results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring planting season. Our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weather-related shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns. 

Financial Information About Foreign and Domestic Sales and Operations 

The amount of net sales attributable to our sales to foreign and domestic markets over the last three fiscal years and the carrying value of our foreign and domestic long-lived assets are set forth in Note 21&#8212;Segment Disclosures . 

Environmental, Health and Safety 

We are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, including laws and regulations relating to the generation and handling of hazardous substances and wastes; the cleanup of hazardous substance releases; the discharge of regulated substances to air or water; and the demolition of existing plant sites upon permanent closure. In the United States, these laws include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) and various other federal, state, provincial, local and international statutes. Violations of environmental, health and safety laws can result in substantial penalties, court orders to install pollution-control equipment, civil and criminal sanctions, permit revocations and facility shutdowns. In addition, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations may impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault, for cleanup costs on potentially responsible parties who have released or disposed of hazardous substances into the environment. We may be subject to more stringent enforcement of existing or new environmental, health and safety laws in the future. 

Environmental, Health and Safety Expenditures 

Our environmental, health and safety capital expenditures in 2015 &#32;totaled approximately $32.0 million. In 2016 , we estimate that we will spend approximately $43.0 million for environmental, health and safety capital expenditures. Environmental, health and safety laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We expect that continued government and public emphasis on environmental issues will result in increased future expenditures for environmental controls at our operations. Such expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or reinterpretation of current laws and regulations may require us to make substantial expenditures. Our costs to comply with, or any liabilities under, these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

Clean Air Act&#8212;Section 185 Fee 

Our Donaldsonville nitrogen complex is located in a five-parish region near Baton Rouge, Louisiana that, as of 2005, was designated as being in "severe" nonattainment with respect to the national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) for ozone (the 1-hour ozone standard) pursuant to the Federal Clean Air Act (the Act). Section 185 of the Act requires states, in their state implementation plans, to levy a fee (Section 185 fee) on major stationary sources (such as the Donaldsonville complex) located in a severe nonattainment area that did not meet the 1-hour ozone standard by November 30, 2005. For additional information on the Section 185 fee, see Note 20&#8212;Contingencies . 

Clean Air Act Information Request 

On February 26, 2009, we received a letter from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under Section 114 of the Act requesting information and copies of records relating to compliance with New Source Review and New Source Performance Standards at our Donaldsonville facility. For additional information on the Clean Air Act Information Request, see Note 20&#8212;Contingencies . 

CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. 

CERCLA/Remediation Matters 

From time to time, we receive notices from governmental agencies or third parties alleging that we are a potentially responsible party at certain cleanup sites under CERCLA or other environmental cleanup laws. In 2011, we received a notice from the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality (IDEQ) that alleged that we were a potentially responsible party for the cleanup of a former phosphate mine we owned in the late 1950s and early 1960s located in Georgetown Canyon, Idaho. The current owner of the property and a former mining contractor received similar notices for the site. We and the current owner are currently conducting a remedial investigation/feasibility study of the site. In 2015, we and several other parties received a notice that the U.S. Department of Interior and other trustees intend to undertake a natural resource damage assessment for a group of former phosphate mines in southeast Idaho, including the former Georgetown Canyon mine. For additional information on the CERCLA/Remediation matters, see Note 20&#8212;Contingencies . 

Regulation of Greenhouse Gases 

We are subject to regulations in the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States concerning greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. 

The United Kingdom is a party to the Kyoto Protocol. As a result of agreements reached during a conference in Durban, South Africa in 2011, the Kyoto Protocol will continue in force for a second commitment period, which will expire by 2020. On December 12, 2015, 195 countries adopted by consensus a new international agreement known as the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement is intended to provide a framework pursuant to which the parties to the agreement will attempt to hold the increase in global average temperatures to below 2&#176;C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5&#176;C above pre-industrial levels. The Paris Agreement could result in more aggressive efforts to reduce GHG emissions in the jurisdictions in which we operate. 

The United Kingdom has adopted GHG emissions regulations, including regulations to implement the European Union Greenhouse Gas Trading System. Our U.K. manufacturing plants are required to report GHG emissions annually to the United Kingdom Environment Agency pursuant to their site Environmental Permits and Climate Change Agreement, which specify energy efficiency targets. Failure to meet efficiency targets may require these plants to purchase CO 2 &#32;emissions allowances. The steam boilers at each of our U.K. sites are also subject to the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme. 

Canada withdrew from further participation in the Kyoto Protocol in December 2011, but is a signatory to the Paris Agreement. In Canada, we are required to conduct an annual review of our operations with respect to compliance with Environment Canada's National Pollutant Release Inventory and Ontario's Mandatory Monitoring and Reporting Regulation and the GHG Reporting Regulation. Ontario is party to the Western Climate Initiative (WCI), comprising California and several Canadian provinces. In April 2015, Ontario announced that it intended to implement its own GHG cap and trade program. On November 16, 2015, Ontario published a notice seeking comments on the design of its cap and trade system. The notice stated that Ontario was proposing to commence operation of the cap and trade program by January 1, 2017 and that this program would link with the cap and trade programs already in operation in California and Quebec. The design document further proposed that the initial cap be set at forecasted GHG emissions for 2017, with annual reductions in the cap designed to achieve the objective of reducing Ontario's GHG emissions to 15% below 1990 levels by 2020. 

&#32;In Alberta, the Specified Gas Emitters Regulation (GHG Regulation) was implemented in 2007. This program requires facilities emitting more than 100,000 tons of GHGs per year to reduce emissions by 12% over such facilities' 2007 levels. To meet this requirement, companies can reduce emissions, purchase/use offset credits, or contribute to a technology fund at an annual rate of $15 per ton of CO 2 . Currently, our Medicine Hat facility&#8217;s method of compliance is to make contributions to the technology fund. Alberta has recently announced that it is replacing its current approach with respect to carbon by introducing a carbon tax that applies across all sectors. The carbon tax is set at $20 per ton (Canadian dollars) effective January 1, 2016 with an emissions reduction target of 15%, rise to $30 per ton (Canadian dollars) effective January 1, 2017 with an emissions reduction target of 20% and increase with the rate of inflation thereafter. 

The United States is not a party to the Kyoto Protocol, but is a signatory to the Paris Agreement. In the United States, GHG regulation is evolving at state, regional and federal levels, although some of the more significant developments to date, including EPA's Clean Power Plan, do not directly impose obligations on our facilities. The EPA has issued a mandatory GHG reporting rule that required all of our U.S. manufacturing facilities to commence monitoring GHG emissions beginning on January 1, 2010 and begin reporting the previous year's emissions annually starting in 2011. In addition, if we seek to modify or expand any of our major facilities and as a result, are required to obtain a Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) construction permit applicable to such facilities, we could be subject to pollution control requirements applicable to GHGs in addition to requirements applicable to conventional air pollutants. Such requirements may result in increased costs or delays in completing such projects. Other than the states' implementation of this permitting requirement, none of the states where our 

CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. 

U.S. production facilities are located&#8212;Louisiana, Mississippi, Iowa and Oklahoma&#8212;has proposed control regulations limiting GHG emissions. 

New Source Performance Standards for Nitric Acid Plants 

We operate 13 nitric acid plants in the United States. On August 14, 2012, the EPA issued a final regulation revising air emission standards applicable to newly constructed, reconstructed or modified nitric acid plants. The regulations will apply to these plants if and when we undertake activities or operations that are considered modifications, including physical changes that would allow us to increase our production capacity at these plants. The regulations include certain provisions that could make it difficult for us to meet the limits on emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO x ) notwithstanding pollution controls we may add to our plants, and accordingly, the regulations, could impact our ability to expand production at our existing plants. The EPA regulation did not include a limitation on emissions of nitrous oxide (a greenhouse gas). 

Regulatory Permits and Approvals 

We hold numerous environmental and other governmental permits and approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities. A decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed regulatory material permit or approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing material permit or approval, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility. Any future expansion of our existing operations is also predicated upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals. More stringent environmental standards may impact our ability to obtain such permits. The Baton Rouge area, where our Donaldsonville facility is located, currently is classified as marginal nonattainment for ozone with respect to the ozone standard issued in 2008. EPA has proposed reclassifying the Baton Rouge area as in attainment with the 2008 ozone standard based on 2012-2014 data. However, on October 26, 2015, EPA published a more stringent national ambient air quality standard for ozone that could cause Baton Rouge to again be classified as a nonattainment area. Such a classification (in the Baton Rouge area or in other areas where our manufacturing facilities are located) could result in more stringent air pollution emissions limits for our existing operations and would also subject our facilities to more stringent requirements to obtain approvals for plant expansions, or could make it difficult to obtain such approvals. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we employed approximately 2,800 full-time and 100 part-time employees.
