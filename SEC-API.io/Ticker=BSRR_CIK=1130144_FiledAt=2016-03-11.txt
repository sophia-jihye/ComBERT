&#160; 

The Company 

&#160;

Sierra Bancorp (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a California corporation headquartered in Porterville, California, and is a registered bank holding company under federal banking laws. The Company was formed to serve as the holding company for Bank of the Sierra (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;), and has been the Bank&#8217;s sole shareholder since August 2001. The Company exists primarily for the purpose of holding the stock of the Bank and of such other subsidiaries it may acquire or establish. At the present time, the Company&#8217;s only other direct subsidiaries are Sierra Statutory Trust II and Sierra Capital Trust III, which were formed in March 2004 and June 2006, respectively, solely to facilitate the issuance of capital trust pass-through securities (&#8220;TRUPS&#8221;). Pursuant to the Financial Accounting Standards Board&#8217;s guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities, these trusts are not reflected on a consolidated basis in the financial statements of the Company. References herein to the &#8220;Company&#8221; include Sierra Bancorp and its consolidated subsidiary, the Bank, unless the context indicates otherwise. At December 31, 2015, the Company had consolidated assets of $1.797 billion, gross loans of $1.133 billion, deposits of $1.465 billion and shareholders&#8217; equity of $190 million. The Company&#8217;s liabilities include $31 million in debt obligations due to Sierra Statutory Trust II and Sierra Capital Trust III, related to TRUPS issued by those entities.

&#160;

The Bank 

&#160;

The Bank is a California state-chartered bank headquartered in Porterville, California. We offer a full range of retail and commercial banking services primarily in Tulare, Kern, Fresno, and Kings Counties in Central California, and in select markets in Southern California including Ventura County and the Santa Clarita Valley. Bank of the Sierra was incorporated in September 1977, and opened for business in January 1978 as a one-branch bank with $1.5 million in capital and eleven employees. Our growth in the ensuing years has primarily been organic, but includes two acquisitions: Sierra National Bank in the year 2000, and Santa Clara Valley Bank (&#8220;SCVB&#8221;) in 2014. We are the largest bank headquartered in the South San Joaquin Valley, and plan to expand even further in 2016 with the acquisition of Coast Bancorp, the holding company for Coast National Bank, and the purchase of certain deposits and loans from Citizens Business Bank (see the following section, Recent Developments, for more details on these acquisitions).

&#160;

Our chief products and services are related to the business of lending money and accepting deposits. The Bank&#8217;s lending activities include real estate, commercial (including small business), mortgage warehousing, agricultural, and consumer loans. The bulk of our real estate loans are secured by commercial, professional office, and agricultural properties which are predominantly owner occupied, and we also offer a complete line of construction loans for residential and commercial development, permanent mortgage loans, land acquisition and development loans, and multifamily credit facilities. Secondary market services for residential mortgage loans are provided through the Bank&#8217;s affiliations with Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and certain non-governmental institutions. As of December 31, 2015, the percentage of our total loan and lease portfolio for each of the principal types of credit we extend was as follows: (i) loans secured by real estate (68.7%); (ii) agricultural production loans (4.1%); (iii) commercial and industrial loans and leases (including SBA loans and direct finance leases) (10.0%); (iv) mortgage warehouse loans (15.9%); and (v) consumer loans (1.3%). Interest, fees, and other income on real-estate secured loans, which is by far the largest segment of our portfolio, totaled $38.2 million, or 49% of net interest plus other income in 2015, and $33.5 million, or 49% of net interest plus other income in 2014.

&#160;

In addition to loans, we offer a wide range of deposit products for individuals and businesses including checking accounts, savings accounts, money market demand accounts, time deposits, retirement accounts, and sweep accounts. The Bank&#8217;s deposit accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the &#8220;FDIC&#8221;) up to maximum insurable amounts. We attract deposits throughout our market area with direct-mail campaigns, a customer-oriented product mix, competitive pricing, convenient locations, drive-through banking, and a multitude of alternative delivery channels, and we strive to retain our deposit customers by providing a consistently high level of service. At December 31, 2015 we had 101,200 deposit accounts totaling $1.465 billion, compared to 99,200 deposit accounts totaling $1.367 billion at December 31, 2014.

The Bank has also received regulatory approvals for a de-novo branch in Sanger, California, which is scheduled to open in the second quarter of 2016, and another branch in Bakersfield, California, although the timing of that opening remains uncertain. In addition to our stand-alone offices the Bank has specialized lending units which include a real estate industries center, an agricultural credit center, and an SBA lending unit. We also have ATMs at all branch locations and offsite ATMs at six different non-branch locations. Furthermore, the Bank is a member of the Allpoint network, which provides our customers with surcharge-free access to over 43,000 ATMs across the nation and another 12,000 ATMs in foreign countries, and our customers have access to electronic point-of-sale payment alternatives nationwide via the Pulse EFT network. To ensure that account access preferences are addressed for all customers, we provide the following options: an internet branch which provides the ability to open deposit accounts online; an online banking option with bill-pay and mobile banking capabilities, including mobile check deposit; a customer service center that is accessible by toll-free telephone during business hours; and an automated telephone banking system that is usually accessible 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We offer a multitude of other banking products and services to complement and support our lending and deposit products, including remote deposit capture and automated payroll services for business customers.

&#160;

We have not engaged in any material research activities related to the development of new products or services during the last two fiscal years. However, our officers and employees are continually searching for ways to increase public convenience, enhance customer access to payment systems, and enable us to improve our competitive position. The cost to the Bank for these development, operations, and marketing activities cannot be calculated with any degree of certainty. We hold no patents or licenses (other than licenses required by bank regulatory agencies), franchises, or concessions. Our business has a modest seasonal component due to the heavy agricultural orientation of the Central Valley, but as our branches in more metropolitan areas have expanded we have become less reliant on the agriculture-related base. We are not dependent on a single customer or group of related customers for a material portion of our core deposits, but for loans we do have what could be considered to be industry concentrations in loans to the dairy industry (10% of total loans), and to mortgage companies in the form of mortgage warehouse loans (16% of total loans). Our efforts to comply with government and regulatory mandates on consumer protection and privacy, anti-terrorism, and other initiatives have resulted in significant ongoing expense to the Bank, including staffing additions and costs associated with compliance-related software. However, as far as can be determined there has been no material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position as a result of environmental regulation at the Federal, state, or local level.

&#160;

Recent Developments 

&#160;

In January 2016 the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Coast Bancorp, the holding company for Coast National Bank, which as of December 31, 2015 had $145 million in total assets, $94 million in loans, $24 million in investment securities, and $127 million in deposits. Coast maintains offices in San Luis Obispo, Paso Robles, Arroyo Grande, and Atascadero, California. We expect the transaction to be completed in the second quarter of 2016, subject to customary closing conditions including the receipt of required regulatory approvals and the consent of Coast Bancorp shareholders. One-time acquisition costs are expected to add roughly $3.2 million to the Company&#8217;s pre-tax non-interest expense in 2016. Also announced in January 2016 was the Company&#8217;s agreement to acquire the Porterville branch of Citizens Business Bank, including approximately $22 million in deposits and $1 million in loans which we plan to consolidate into our Porterville Main office. Pending regulatory approvals, that transaction is also scheduled for completion in the second quarter of 2016.

&#160;

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

&#160;

Information on recent accounting pronouncements is contained in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The banking business in California in general, and more specifically in many of our market areas, is highly competitive. The industry continues to consolidate, particularly with the relatively large number of FDIC-assisted takeovers of failed banks and other acquisitions of troubled banks in recent years. There are also many unregulated companies competing for business in our markets with financial products targeted at profitable customer segments. Many of those companies are able to compete across geographic boundaries and provide meaningful alternatives to significant banking products and services. These competitive trends are likely to continue.

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

With respect to commercial bank competitors, the business is dominated by a relatively small number of major banks that operate a large number of offices within our geographic footprint. Based on June 30, 2015 FDIC market share data for the 20 cities within which the Company maintains branches, the largest portion of deposits belongs to Wells Fargo Bank with 23.4% of total combined deposits, followed by Bank of America (16.2%), JPMorgan Chase (8.4%), Union Bank (6.7%), and Bank of the West (6.2%). Bank of the Sierra ranks sixth on the 2015 market share list with 5.6% of total deposits. In Tulare County, however, where the Bank was originally formed, we rank first for deposit market share with 19.6% of total deposits and have the largest number of branch locations (12, including our online branch). The larger banks noted above have, among other advantages, the ability to finance wide-ranging advertising campaigns and to allocate their resources to regions of highest yield and demand. They can also offer certain services that we do not provide directly but may offer indirectly through correspondent institutions, and by virtue of their greater capitalization those banks have legal lending limits that are substantially higher than ours. For loan customers whose needs exceed our legal lending limits, we typically arrange for the sale, or participation, of some of the balances to financial institutions that are not within our geographic footprint.

&#160;

In addition to other banks, our competitors include savings institutions, credit unions, and numerous non-banking institutions such as finance companies, leasing companies, insurance companies, brokerage firms, asset management groups, mortgage banking firms and internet-based companies. Technological innovations have lowered traditional barriers of entry and enabled many of these companies to offer services that previously were considered traditional banking products, and we have witnessed increased competition from companies that circumvent the banking system by facilitating payments via the internet, wireless devices, prepaid cards, and other means.

&#160;

Strong competition for deposits and loans among financial institutions and non-banks alike affects interest rates and other terms on which financial products are offered to customers. Mergers between financial institutions have created additional pressures within the industry to remain competitive by streamlining operations, reducing expenses, and increasing revenues. Competition is also impacted by federal and state interstate banking laws which permit banking organizations to expand into other states. The relatively large California market has been particularly attractive to out-of-state institutions.

&#160;

For years we have countered rising competition by offering a broad array of products with flexibility in structure and terms that cannot always be matched by our competitors. We also offer our customers community-oriented, personalized service, and rely on local promotional activity and personal contact by our employees. As noted above, layered onto our traditional personal-contact banking philosophy are technology-driven initiatives that improve customer access and convenience.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015 the Company had 352 full-time and 79 part-time employees. On a full-time equivalent basis staffing stood at 417 at December 31, 2015, down slightly from 420 at December 31, 2014.

&#160; 

Regulation and Supervision 

&#160;

Banks and bank holding companies are heavily regulated by federal and state laws and regulations. Most banking regulations are intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the deposit insurance fund and not for the benefit of shareholders. The following is a summary of certain statutes, regulations and regulatory guidance affecting the Company and the Bank. This summary is not intended to be a complete explanation of such statutes, regulations and guidance, all of which are subject to change in the future, nor does it fully address their effects and potential effects on the Company and the Bank.

&#160;

Regulation of the Company Generally 

&#160;

The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank and its other subsidiaries. As a bank holding company, the Company is regulated under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the &#8220;BHC Act&#8221;), and is subject to supervision, regulation and inspection by the Federal Reserve Board. The Company is also under the jurisdiction of the SEC and is subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, each administered by the SEC. The Company&#8217;s common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select market (&#8220;NASDAQ&#8221;) under the trading symbol &#8220;BSRR&#8221; and the Company is, therefore, subject to the rules of NASDAQ for listed companies.

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The Company is a bank holding company within the meaning of the BHC Act and is registered as such with the Federal Reserve Board. A bank holding company is required to file annual reports and other information with the Federal Reserve regarding its business operations and those of its subsidiaries. In general, the BHC Act limits the business of bank holding companies to banking, managing or controlling banks and other activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto, including securities brokerage services, investment advisory services, fiduciary services, and management advisory and data processing services, among others. A bank holding company that also qualifies as and elects to become a &#8220;financial holding company&#8221; may engage in a broader range of activities that are financial in nature or complementary to a financial activity (as determined by the Federal Reserve or Treasury regulations), such as securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and agency, and making merchant banking investments. The Company has not elected to become a financial holding company but may do so at some point in the future if deemed appropriate in view of opportunities or circumstances at the time.

&#160;

The BHC Act requires the prior approval of the FRB for the direct or indirect acquisition of more than five percent of the voting shares of a commercial bank or its parent holding company. Acquisitions by the Bank are subject instead to the Bank Merger Act, which requires the prior approval of an acquiring bank&#8217;s primary federal regulator for any merger with or acquisition of another bank.

&#160;

The Company and the Bank are deemed to be &#8220;affiliates&#8221; of each other and thus are subject to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act as well as related Federal Reserve Regulation W which impose both quantitative and qualitative restrictions and limitations on transactions between affiliates. The Bank is also subject to laws and regulations requiring that all loans and extensions of credit to our executive officers, directors, principal shareholders and related parties must, among other things, be made on substantially the same terms and follow credit underwriting procedures no less stringent than those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not related to the Bank.

&#160;

Under certain conditions, the Federal Reserve has the authority to restrict the payment of cash dividends by a bank holding company as an unsafe and unsound banking practice, and may require a bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve prior to purchasing or redeeming its own equity securities, unless certain conditions are met. The Federal Reserve also has the authority to regulate the debt of bank holding companies.

&#160;

A bank holding company is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength for its subsidiary banks and must commit resources as necessary to support such subsidiaries. In this connection, the Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to contribute additional capital to an undercapitalized subsidiary bank and may disapprove of the payment of dividends to the shareholders if the Federal Reserve Board believes the payment of such dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice.

&#160;

Regulation of the Bank Generally 

&#160;

As a state chartered bank, the Bank is subject to broad federal regulation and oversight extending to all its operations by the FDIC and to state regulation by the California Department of Business Oversight (the &#8220;DBO&#8221;). The Bank is also subject to certain regulations of the Federal Reserve Board.

&#160;

Capital Adequacy Requirements 

&#160;

The Company and the Bank are subject to the regulations of the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC, respectively, governing capital adequacy. These agencies have adopted risk-based capital guidelines to provide a systematic analytical framework which makes regulatory capital requirements sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banking organizations, considers off-balance sheet exposures in evaluating capital adequacy, and minimizes disincentives to holding liquid, low-risk assets. Capital levels, as measured by these standards, are also used to categorize financial institutions for purposes of certain prompt corrective action regulatory provisions.

&#160;

Prior to January 1, 2015, the guidelines included a minimum required ratio of qualifying Tier 1 plus Tier 2 capital to total risk weighted assets of 8% (&#8220;Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio&#8221; or &#8220;Total RBC Ratio&#8221;), and a minimum required ratio of Tier 1 capital to total risk weighted assets of 4% (&#8220;Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio&#8221; or &#8220;Tier 1 RBC Ratio&#8221;). The guidelines also provided for a minimum Leverage Ratio, which is defined as Tier 1 capital to adjusted average assets (quarterly average assets less the disallowed capital items discussed below). The minimum Leverage Ratio is 3% for institutions having the highest regulatory rating, and 4% for all other institutions. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as the sum of core capital elements, less goodwill and other intangible assets, accumulated other comprehensive income, disallowed deferred tax assets, and certain other deductions. The following items are defined as core capital elements: (i) common shareholders&#8217; equity; (ii) qualifying non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus (and, in the case of holding companies, senior perpetual preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury Department pursuant to the Troubled Asset Relief Program); (iii) minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries; and (iv) &#8220;restricted&#8221; core capital elements (which include qualifying trust preferred securities) up to 25% of all core capital elements. Tier 2 capital includes the following supplemental capital elements: (i) allowance for loan and lease losses (but not more than 1.25% of an institution&#8217;s risk-weighted assets); (ii) perpetual preferred stock and related surplus not qualifying as core capital; (iii) hybrid capital instruments, perpetual debt and mandatory convertible debt instruments; and, (iv) term subordinated debt and intermediate-term preferred stock and related surplus. The maximum amount of Tier 2 capital is capped at 100% of Tier 1 capital.

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Pursuant to the adoption of final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision&#8217;s capital guidelines for all U.S. banks and bank holding companies with more than $500 million in assets, minimum regulatory requirements for both the quantity and quality of capital held by the Company and the Bank increased effective January 1, 2015. Furthermore, a new capital class known as Common Equity Tier 1 capital was added, and most financial institutions were given the option of a one-time election to continue to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;) from regulatory capital. Since the Company exercised its option to exclude AOCI with its first regulatory filings for 2015, our Common Equity Tier 1 capital includes common stock, additional paid-in capital, and retained earnings, less the following: disallowed goodwill and intangibles, disallowed deferred tax assets, and any insufficient additional capital to cover the deductions. The definitions of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital are essentially unchanged, although disallowed amounts increased with the new rules. The final rules include new regulatory minimums of 4.5% for the common equity Tier 1 capital to total risk weighted assets ratio (&#8220;Common Equity Tier 1 RBC Ratio&#8221;), 6.0% for the Tier 1 RBC Ratio, 8.0% for the Total RBC Ratio, and 4.0% for the Leverage Ratio. The final rules also require a Common Equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets which is in addition to the other minimum risk-based capital standards in the rule. The capital buffer requirement will be phased in over three years beginning in 2016, and will effectively raise the minimum required Common Equity Tier 1 RBC Ratio to 7.0%, the Tier 1 RBC Ratio to 8.5%, and the Total RBC Ratio to 10.5% on a fully phased-in basis. Institutions that do not maintain the required capital buffer will become subject to progressively more stringent limitations on the percentage of earnings that can be paid out in dividends or used for stock repurchases, and on the payment of discretionary bonuses to executive management.

&#160;

The final rules also increase the required capital for certain categories of assets, including higher-risk construction and real estate loans, certain past-due or nonaccrual loans, and certain exposures related to securitizations. The final rules permanently grandfather non-qualifying capital instruments (such as trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock) issued before May 19, 2010 for inclusion in the Tier 1 capital of banking organizations with total consolidated assets of less than $15 billion at December 31, 2009, subject to a limit of 25% of Tier 1 capital. As all of the Company&#8217;s trust preferred securities were issued prior to that date, they will continue to qualify as Tier 1 capital under the new rules.

&#160;

The new minimum capital ratios became effective for us on January 1, 2015, and the capital buffers will be fully phased in by January 1, 2019. Based on our capital levels at December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company and the Bank would have met all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules on a fully phased-in basis. For more information on the Company&#8217;s capital, see Part II, Item 7, Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation &#8211; Capital Resources. Risk-based capital ratio (&#8220;RBC&#8221;) requirements are discussed in greater detail in the following section.

&#160;

Prompt Corrective Action Provisions 

&#160;

Federal law requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured financial institutions, including but not limited to those that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios. The federal banking agencies have by regulation defined the following five capital categories: &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; (Total RBC Ratio of 10%; Tier 1 RBC Ratio of 8%; Common Equity Tier 1 RBC Ratio of 6.5%; and Leverage Ratio of 5%); &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; (Total RBC Ratio of 8%; Tier 1 RBC Ratio of 6%; Common Equity Tier 1 RBC Ratio of 4.5%; and Leverage Ratio of 4%); &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; (Total RBC Ratio of less than 8%; Tier 1 RBC Ratio of less than 6%; Common Equity Tier 1 RBC Ratio of less than 4.5%; or Leverage Ratio of less than 4%); &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; (Total RBC Ratio of less than 6%; Tier 1 RBC Ratio of less than 4%; Common Equity Tier 1 RBC Ratio of less than 3%; or Leverage Ratio less than 3%); and &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; (tangible equity to total assets less than or equal to 2%). A bank may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if, after notice and the opportunity for a hearing, the appropriate federal agency finds an unsafe or unsound condition or practice so warrants, but no bank may be treated as &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; unless its actual capital ratio warrants such treatment. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, both the Company and the Bank were deemed to be well capitalized for regulatory capital purposes.

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

At each successively lower capital category, an insured bank is subject to increased restrictions on its operations. For example, a bank is generally prohibited from paying management fees to any controlling persons or from making capital distributions if to do so would make the bank &#8220;undercapitalized.&#8221; Asset growth and branching restrictions apply to undercapitalized banks, which are required to submit written capital restoration plans meeting specified requirements (including a guarantee by the parent holding company, if any). &#8220;Significantly undercapitalized&#8221; banks are subject to broad regulatory authority, including among other things capital directives, forced mergers, restrictions on the rates of interest they may pay on deposits, restrictions on asset growth and activities, and prohibitions on paying bonuses or increasing compensation to senior executive officers without FDIC approval. Even more severe restrictions apply to &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; banks. Most importantly, except under limited circumstances, not later than 90 days after an insured bank becomes critically undercapitalized the appropriate federal banking agency is required to appoint a conservator or receiver for the bank.

&#160;

In addition to measures taken under the prompt corrective action provisions, insured banks may be subject to potential actions by the federal regulators for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses or for violations of any law, rule, regulation or any condition imposed in writing by the agency or any written agreement with the agency. Enforcement actions may include the issuance of cease and desist orders, termination of insurance of deposits (in the case of a bank), the imposition of civil money penalties, the issuance of directives to increase capital, formal and informal agreements, or removal and prohibition orders against &#8220;institution-affiliated&#8221; parties.

&#160;

Safety and Soundness Standards 

&#160;

The federal banking agencies have also adopted guidelines establishing safety and soundness standards for all insured depository institutions. Those guidelines relate to internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan underwriting and documentation, compensation, and liquidity and interest rate exposure. In general, the standards are designed to assist the federal banking agencies in identifying and addressing problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If an institution fails to meet the requisite standards, the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to submit a compliance plan and could institute enforcement proceedings if an acceptable compliance plan is not submitted or adhered to.

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 

&#160;

Legislation and regulations enacted and implemented since 2008 in response to the U.S. economic downturn and financial industry instability continue to impact most institutions in the banking sector. Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (&#8220;Dodd-Frank&#8221;), which was enacted in 2010, are now effective and have been fully implemented, including revisions in the deposit insurance assessment base for FDIC insurance and a permanent increase in coverage to $250,000; the permissibility of paying interest on business checking accounts; the removal of barriers to interstate branching and required disclosure and shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation. Additional actions taken to implement Dodd-Frank provisions include (i) final new capital rules, (ii) a final rule to implement the so called Volcker rule restrictions on certain proprietary trading and investment activities and (iii) final rules and increased enforcement action by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (discussed further below in connection with consumer protection).

&#160;

Some aspects of Dodd-Frank are still subject to rulemaking and will take effect over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the ultimate financial impact on the Company, its customers or the financial services industry more generally. However, certain provisions of Dodd-Frank are already affecting our operations and expenses, including but not limited to changes in FDIC assessments, the permitted payment of interest on demand deposits, and enhanced compliance requirements. Some of the rules and regulations promulgated or yet to be promulgated under Dodd-Frank will apply directly only to institutions much larger than ours, but could indirectly impact smaller banks, either due to competitive influences or because certain required practices for larger institutions may subsequently become expected &#8220;best practices&#8221; for smaller institutions. We expect to see continued increases in the attention and resources devoted by the Company to ensure compliance with the statutory and regulatory requirements engendered by Dodd-Frank.

Deposit Insurance 

&#160;

The Bank&#8217;s deposits are insured up to maximum applicable limits under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, and the Bank is subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the FDIC&#8217;s Deposit Insurance Fund (the &#8220;DIF&#8221;). In October 2010, the FDIC adopted a revised restoration plan to ensure that the DIF&#8217;s designated reserve ratio (&#8220;DRR&#8221;) reaches 1.35% of insured deposits by September 30, 2020, the deadline mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act. However, financial institutions like Bank of the Sierra with assets of less than $10 billion are exempted from the cost of this increase. Furthermore, the restoration plan proposed an increase in the DRR to 2% of estimated insured deposits as a long-term goal for the fund. The FDIC also proposed future assessment rate reductions in lieu of dividends, when the DRR reaches 1.5% or greater.

&#160;

As noted above, the Dodd-Frank Act provided for a permanent increase in FDIC deposit insurance per depositor from $100,000 to $250,000 retroactive to January 1, 2008. Furthermore, the FDIC redefined its deposit insurance premium assessment base from an institution&#8217;s total domestic deposits to its total assets less tangible equity, effective in the second quarter of 2011. The changes to the assessment base necessitated changes to assessment rates, which became effective April 1, 2011. The revised assessment rates are lower than prior rates but the assessment base is larger, so approximately the same amount of assessment revenue is being collected by the FDIC. We are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance. If there are additional bank or financial institution failures or if the FDIC otherwise determines, we may be required to pay even higher FDIC premiums, which may have a material adverse effect on our earnings and could have a material adverse effect on the value of, or market for, our common stock.

&#160;

In addition to DIF assessments, banks must pay quarterly assessments that are applied to the retirement of Financing Corporation bonds issued in the 1980&#8217;s to assist in the recovery of the savings and loan industry. The assessment amount fluctuates, but was 0.60 basis points of insured deposits for the fourth quarter of 2015. Those assessments will continue until the Financing Corporation bonds mature in 2019.

&#160;

Community Reinvestment Act 

&#160;

The Bank is subject to certain requirements and reporting obligations involving Community Reinvestment Act (&#8220;CRA&#8221;) activities. The CRA generally requires federal banking agencies to evaluate the record of a financial institution in meeting the credit needs of its local communities, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA further requires the agencies to consider a financial institution&#8217;s efforts in meeting its community credit needs when evaluating applications for, among other things, domestic branches, mergers or acquisitions, or the formation of holding companies. In measuring a bank&#8217;s compliance with its CRA obligations, the regulators utilize a performance-based evaluation system under which CRA ratings are determined by the bank&#8217;s actual lending, service, and investment performance, rather than on the extent to which the institution conducts needs assessments, documents community outreach activities or complies with other procedural requirements. In connection with its assessment of CRA performance, the FDIC assigns a rating of &#8220;outstanding,&#8221; &#8220;satisfactory,&#8221; &#8220;needs to improve&#8221; or &#8220;substantial noncompliance.&#8221; The Bank most recently received a &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; CRA assessment rating in August 2013.

&#160;

Privacy and Data Security 

&#160;

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, also known as the Financial Modernization Act of 1999 (the &#8220;Financial Modernization Act&#8221;), imposed requirements on financial institutions with respect to consumer privacy. Financial institutions, however, are required to comply with state law if it is more protective of consumer privacy than the Financial Modernization Act. The Financial Modernization Act generally prohibits disclosure of consumer information to non-affiliated third parties unless the consumer has been given the opportunity to object and has not objected to such disclosure. The statute also directed federal regulators, including the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, to establish standards for the security of consumer information, and requires financial institutions to disclose their privacy policies to consumers annually.

Overdrafts 

&#160;

The Electronic Funds Transfer Act, as implemented by the Federal Reserve&#8217;s Regulation E, governs transfers initiated through automated teller machines (&#8220;ATMs&#8221;), point-of-sale terminals, and other electronic banking services. Regulation E prohibits financial institutions from assessing an overdraft fee for paying ATM and one-time point-of-sale debit card transactions, unless the customer affirmatively opts in to the overdraft service for those types of transactions. The opt-in provision establishes requirements for clear disclosure of fees and terms of overdraft services for ATM and one-time debit card transactions. The rule does not apply to other types of transactions, such as check, automated clearinghouse (&#8220;ACH&#8221;) and recurring debit card transactions. Additionally, in November 2010 the FDIC issued its Overdraft Guidance on automated overdraft service programs, to ensure that a bank mitigates the risks associated with offering automated overdraft payment programs and complies with all consumer protection laws and regulations. The procedural changes and fee adjustments necessitated by those regulatory changes resulted in lower overdraft income for the Company, and could further adversely impact non-interest income in the future.

&#160; 

Consumer Financial Protection and Financial Privacy 

&#160;

Dodd-Frank created the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (the &#8220;CFPB&#8221;) as an independent entity with broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services including deposit products, residential mortgages, home-equity loans and credit cards. The CFPB&#8217;s functions include investigating consumer complaints, conducting market research, rulemaking, supervising and examining bank consumer transactions, and enforcing rules related to consumer financial products and services. CFPB regulations and guidance apply to all financial institutions, including the Bank, although only banks with $10 billion or more in assets are subject to examination by the CFPB. Banks with less than $10 billion in assets, including the Bank, will continue to be examined for compliance by their primary federal banking agency.

&#160;

In January 2013, the CFPB issued final regulations governing primarily consumer mortgage lending. One rule which became effective in January 2014 imposes additional requirements on lenders, including rules designed to require lenders to ensure borrowers&#8217; ability to repay their mortgages. The CFPB also finalized a rule on escrow accounts for higher priced mortgage loans and a rule expanding the scope of the high-cost mortgage provision in the Truth in Lending Act. The CFPB also issued final rules implementing provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that relate to mortgage servicing. In November 2013 the CFPB issued a final rule on integrated and simplified mortgage disclosures under the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, which became effective in October 2015.

&#160;

The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer financial laws that apply to all banks, including, among other things, the authority to prohibit &#8220;unfair, deceptive or abusive&#8221; acts and practices. Abusive acts or practices are defined as those that materially interfere with a consumer&#8217;s ability to understand a term or condition of a consumer financial product or service or take unreasonable advantage of a consumer&#8217;s: (i) lack of financial savvy, (ii) inability to protect himself in the selection or use of consumer financial products or services, or (iii) reasonable reliance on a covered entity to act in the consumer&#8217;s interests.

&#160;

The Bank continues to be subject to numerous other federal and state consumer protection laws that extensively govern its relationship with its customers. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Service Members Civil Relief Act, and respective state-law counterparts to these laws, as well as state usury laws and laws regarding unfair and deceptive acts and practices. These and other laws require disclosures including the cost of credit and terms of deposit accounts, provide substantive consumer rights, prohibit discrimination in credit transactions, regulate the use of credit report information, provide financial privacy protections, prohibit unfair, deceptive and abusive practices, restrict the Company&#8217;s ability to raise interest rates and subject the Company to substantial regulatory oversight.

&#160;

In addition, the Bank, like all other financial institutions, is required to maintain the privacy of its customers&#8217; non-public, personal information. Such privacy requirements direct financial institutions to: (i) provide notice to customers regarding privacy policies and practices; (ii) inform customers regarding the conditions under which their non-public personal information may be disclosed to non-affiliated third parties; and (iii) give customers an option to prevent disclosure of such information to non-affiliated third parties.

&#160;

Interstate Banking and Branching 

&#160;

The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (the &#8220;Interstate Act&#8221;) together with Dodd-Frank relaxed prior interstate branching restrictions under federal law by permitting, subject to regulatory approval, state and federally chartered commercial banks to establish branches in states where the laws permit banks chartered in such states to establish branches. The Interstate Act requires regulators to consult with community organizations before permitting an interstate institution to close a branch in a low-income area. Federal banking agency regulations prohibit banks from using their interstate branches primarily for deposit production and the federal banking agencies have implemented a loan-to-deposit ratio screen to ensure compliance with this prohibition. Dodd-Frank effectively eliminated the prohibition under California law against interstate branching through de novo establishment of California branches. Interstate branches are subject to certain laws of the states in which they are located. The Bank presently does not have any interstate branches.

&#160;

USA Patriot Act of 2001

&#160;

The impact of the USA Patriot Act of 2001 (the &#8220;Patriot Act&#8221;) on financial institutions of all kinds has been significant and wide ranging. The Patriot Act substantially enhanced anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws, and required certain regulatory authorities to adopt rules that promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators, and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering. Under the Patriot Act, financial institutions are subject to prohibitions regarding specified financial transactions and account relationships, as well as enhanced due diligence and &#8220;know your customer&#8221; standards in their dealings with foreign financial institutions and foreign customers. The Patriot Act also requires all financial institutions to establish anti-money laundering programs. The Bank expanded its Bank Secrecy Act compliance staff and intensified due diligence procedures concerning the opening of new accounts to fulfill the anti-money laundering requirements of the Patriot Act, and also implemented systems and procedures to identify suspicious banking activity and report any such activity to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.

&#160;

Incentive Compensation 

&#160;

In June 2010, the FRB and the FDIC issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to help ensure that banking organizations do not undermine their own safety and soundness by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization&#8217;s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization's board of directors. These three principles are incorporated into proposed joint compensation regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act that would prohibit incentive-based payment arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks at specified regulated entities having at least $1 billion in total assets. The regulatory agencies will review, as part of their regular risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as the Company, that are not &#8220;large, complex banking organizations.&#8221; Where appropriate, the regulatory agencies will take supervisory or enforcement action to address perceived deficiencies in an institution&#8217;s incentive compensation arrangements or related risk-management, control, and governance processes. The Company believes that it is in full compliance with the regulatory guidance on incentive compensation policies.

&#160;

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 

&#160;

The Company is subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (&#8220;Sarbanes-Oxley&#8221;) which addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. Among other things, Sarbanes-Oxley mandates chief executive and chief financial officer certifications of periodic financial reports, additional financial disclosures concerning off-balance sheet items, and accelerated share transaction reporting for executive officers, directors and 10% shareholders. In addition, Sarbanes-Oxley increased penalties for non-compliance with the Exchange Act. SEC rules promulgated pursuant to Sarbanes-Oxley impose obligations and restrictions on auditors and audit committees intended to enhance their independence from management, and include extensive additional disclosure, corporate governance and other related rules.

Commercial Real Estate Lending Concentrations 

&#160;

As a part of their regulatory oversight, the federal regulators have issued guidelines on sound risk management practices with respect to a financial institution&#8217;s concentrations in commercial real estate (&#8220;CRE&#8221;) lending activities. These guidelines were issued in response to the agencies&#8217; concerns that rising CRE concentrations might expose institutions to unanticipated earnings and capital volatility in the event of adverse changes in the commercial real estate market. The guidelines identify certain concentration levels that, if exceeded, will expose the institution to additional supervisory analysis with regard to the institution&#8217;s CRE concentration risk. The guidelines are designed to promote appropriate levels of capital and sound loan and risk management practices for institutions with a concentration of CRE loans. In general, the guidelines establish two concentration levels: first, if the institution&#8217;s total construction, land development and other land loans represent 100 percent or more of total risk-based capital; and second, if total loans for construction, land development and other land and loans secured by multifamily and non-owner occupied non-farm residential properties (excluding loans secured by owner-occupied properties) represent 300 percent or more of total risk-based capital and the institution&#8217;s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by 50 percent or more during the prior 36 month period. The Bank believes that the guidelines are applicable to it, as it has a relatively high concentration in CRE loans. The Bank and its board of directors have discussed the guidelines and believe that the Bank&#8217;s underwriting policies, management information systems, independent credit administration process, and monitoring of real estate loan concentrations are sufficient to address the guidelines.

&#160;

Other Pending and Proposed Legislation 

&#160;

Other legislative and regulatory initiatives which could affect the Company, the Bank and the banking industry in general are pending, and additional initiatives may be proposed or introduced before the United States Congress, the California legislature and other governmental bodies in the future. Such proposals, if enacted, may further alter the structure, regulation and competitive relationship among financial institutions, and may subject the Bank to increased regulation, disclosure and reporting requirements. In addition, the various banking regulatory agencies often adopt new rules and regulations to implement and enforce existing legislation. It cannot be predicted whether, or in what form, any such legislation or regulations may be enacted or the extent to which the business of the Company or the Bank would be affected thereby.
