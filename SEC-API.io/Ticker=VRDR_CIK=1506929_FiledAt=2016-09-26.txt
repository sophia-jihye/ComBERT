The following diagram illustrates our current corporate structure:

&#160;

According to ASC 810-05-08 A, CSB is a deemed subsidiary of GBL where GBL controls the Board of Directors of CSB, rights to receive future benefits and residual value, and obligation to absorb loss and finance for CSB. GBL has the power to direct the activities of CSB that most significantly impact CSB's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of CSB that could potentially be significant to the CSB or the right to receive benefits from CSB that could potentially be significant to CSB. GBL is the primary beneficiary of CSB because GBL can direct the activities of CSB through the common directors and 85% shareholder FMR. Under 810-23-42, 43, it is determined that CSB is de-facto agent of the principal GBL and so GBL will consolidate CSB from July 1, 2013. On April 1, 2014, GBL purchased 85% equity interest of CSB, and CSB became indirect subsidiary of the Company.

Contractual Arrangements 

&#160;

Our exploration and mining business is currently provided through contractual arrangements with CSB through our wholly-owned subsidiary GBL.

&#160;

CSB, the VIE of GBL, sells gold minerals directly to the registered gold trading company in Malaysia. We have been and are expected to continue to be dependent on our VIE to operate our exploration and mining business. GBL has entered into contractual arrangements with its VIE, which enable us to exercise effective control over the VIE, receive substantially all of the economic benefits from the VIE, and have the option to purchase equity interests in the VIE.

&#160;

On July 1, 2013, the Company's subsidiary GBL entered into a series of agreements ("VIE agreements") with FMR and details of the VIE agreements are as follows :

&#160;

&#160;

On April 1, 2014, GBL purchased 85% equity interest of CSB, and CSB became indirect subsidiary of the Company.

&#160;

Stage Of Operation 

&#160;

The Company does not own any title and/or concession right in any mines. The Company is undertaking natural mineral resource extraction management services. The Company expects to hire a mine management team to supervise the mineral resource extraction activities to ensure that the operations can be carried out without significant problems.

&#160;

According to the United States Industry Guide 7 (a) (4) on mining operations, the Merapoh Gold Mine is currently in the production stage because the mine has produced approximately 30 kilograms of gold from July 2015 to June 2016. According to the ASC 930-330-20 Glossary, the production phase is defined as "when saleable minerals are extracted (produced) from an ore body, regardless of the level of production". However, the production is limited to a small part of the site, and extraction is alluvial gold only. The objective of the Company is preparing to improve the productivity of the mines to ensure that the operation will be carried out effectively and efficiently at minimum cost.

Regional Geology: 

&#160;

The Malaysia Central Gold Belt runs along the entire backbone of Peninsular Malaysia, extending further to the north. It was formed between the Sibumasu block in the west and Manabor block in the east that runs along major mineral deposits in Thailand, Myanmar and China. The regional gold deposits were made of Epithermal deposits that formed in a series of volcanic environment, where the tensional fractures along the subduction zone allows the intrusion of mineral rich acidic magma within deep faults.

&#160;

Rock Formations and Mineralization: 

&#160;

Site IV-1 of the Merapoh Gold Mine covers an area of 400 acres with mineralization structure being Permian limestone dominating the South-East portion, felsic volcanic tuff in the Western portion of the area and intrusive dacite rock to the north-west of the area. Tectonic contact within the sheer zone of creates epithermal mineralization, forming mineral rich vein along the contact zone. The mineralized zone is made of highly altered tuffacaous rock with abundant pyrite dissemination and moderately spaced quartz vein.

&#160;

Work Completed and Present Condition: 

&#160;

Lode gold exploration on Site IV-1 has commenced since 2011 and still in progress with both in-house drilling team and third party drilling services running in parallel to expedite data collection to generate a comprehensive JORC compliant gold reserve report.

&#160;

Description of Processing Facilities: 

&#160;

Process for removing ore concentrates from the ore body 

&#160;

1.

The ore body is transported to the treatment plants in vehicles capable of hauling huge, heavy loads.

2.

The ore body is separated into Ore Type 1 Stockpile and Ore Type 2 Stockpile.

3.

The monitor washes finer gold bearing material off larger rocks which is screened on an inclined coarse wire screen.

4.

An excavator is used to turn over the rocks so wash is removed from all sides of the coarse material.

5.

A monitor pushes the rock down the inclined coarse screen where the course is removed and stockpiled at the bottom.

6.

Finer material passes through the mesh screen into the sluice system and runs over the sluice.

7.

The carpets are removed and taken to refining facility for gold recovery.

8.

A suction pipe recovers water of the fine tailings pond for use in the system.

&#160;

Refining of the concentrate 

&#160;

1.

The carpets holding concentrate from the sluice are brought to a shed in the camp site where the gold is refined.

2.

The first stage of the refining is to wash the gold containing concentrate into large bins. This is pumped to a jig and shaking table.

3.

Nuggets are handpicked from the coarse fraction and the fine fraction is amalgamated to remove the gold. After distillation, gold from the amalgam and the coarse are melted with flux and the gold is poured into small bars.

&#160;

Current State of Exploration: 

&#160;

As of the date of this report, the Merapoh Gold Mine property is without known reserves.

&#160;

The Merapoh Gold Mine commenced exploratory operation in alluvia mining and achieved its first gold pour in July 2011. Through the years of operation, the Company has performed ongoing exercises to improve upon the matching of processing method with the types of ore in order to optimize cost to recovery ratio. In July 2013, production was outsourced to a reputable subcontractor, and developed a resource management system to match ore against processes to achieve the most cost efficient and highest recovery production procedure.

&#160; &#160; 8 

&#160;

&#160;

Gold ore extraction of the Merapoh Gold Mine for the twelve months ended June 30, 2016, was approximately 285,745 tons of gold ore or a monthly average of 23,812 tons (using a 12-month average), with an average gold grade of 0.106 g/t. Gold concentrate sold for the twelve months ended June 30, 2016, was approximately 27.47 kg. The production level, in units of daily tonnage of raw mineral rocks extracted, averaged 783 tons/day (12-month average) during the fiscal year 2016.

&#160;

The Merapoh Gold Mine is currently at the production stage. In the effort to expand production capacity, the Company intends to purchase more vehicles, machineries and equipment as well as to conduct feasibility studies for exploration of alluvial and lode gold resources.

&#160;

Subcontractors 

&#160;

In an effort to enhance the efficiency of mine operations at the Merapoh Gold Mine, Champmark Sdn Bhd ("CSB") entered into an Operation Term Sheet ("OTS") agreement in July 2013 to outsource the exploitation works of alluvial gold resources at Site IV-1 of the Merapoh Gold Mine to a third party subcontractor Borneo Oil &#38; Gas Corporation Sdn Bhd ("BOG"). However, BOG became the Company's shareholder in January 29, 2014 and was no longer a third party subcontractor.

&#160;

BOG has the experience and local knowledge in managing the exploitation of alluvial gold at the Merapoh Gold Mine. The Company currently intends to continue to outsource the exploitation of alluvial gold at our mine site to BOG as our third party subcontractor. The Company will provide necessary disclosure when any significant agreements have been made with the sub-contractor in the future. 

&#160;

Under the terms of the Agreement and relevant subsequent Supplemental Agreement, FMR assigned its management rights to the Company Board of Directors of FMR agreed to transfer 1 share common stock of Gold Billion Global Limited ("GBL") which represented all shares of common stock of GBL owned by the Investor, and the Company's Board of Directors agreed to issue 80,000,000 million shares of common stock in full value as consideration. At the time of closing under the AAMA, the Investor transferred 100% ownership of GBL shares to the Company, and the Company issued 80,000,000 million shares of common stock to the shareholders of FMR in exchange for the GBL Shares. The effect of the transaction was to make GBL and its deemed subsidiaries become wholly-owned and 85.00% owned subsidiaries of the Company, and to cause a change of control of GBL. Following the closing, there was a change of control in the Company.

&#160;

The Transaction was accounted for as a "reverse merger," since FMR owned a majority of the outstanding shares of VRDR's common stock immediately following the execution of the transaction. The Company was deemed to be the accounting acquirer in the reverse merger. Consequently, the assets and liabilities and the historical operations that were reflected in the financial statements for periods prior to the transaction were those of the Company and its deemed subsidiaries, and were recorded at the historical cost basis of the Company. After completion of the transaction, the Company's consolidated financial statements were include the assets and liabilities of the Company and its subsidiaries, the historical operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, and the operations of the Company and its subsidiaries from the closing date of the transaction.
