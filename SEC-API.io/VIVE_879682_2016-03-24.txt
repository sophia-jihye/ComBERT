 Item 1. Business 

&#160; 

On September 23, 2014, Viveve&#174; Medical, Inc. (formerly PLC Systems, Inc.), a Yukon Territory corporation (&#8220;Viveve Medical&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221;) completed a reverse acquisition and recapitalization pursuant to the terms and conditions of an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#8220;Merger Agreement&#8221;) by and among PLC Systems Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of PLC Systems Inc., with and into Viveve, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the &#8220;Merger&#8221;). In conjunction with the Merger, we changed our name from PLC Systems Inc. to Viveve Medical, Inc. to better reflect our new business. Viveve Medical competes in the women&#8217;s health industry by marketing the Viveve System&#8482; as a way to improve the overall sexual well-being and quality of life of women suffering from vaginal laxity. We are located at 150 Commercial Street, Sunnyvale, California and our telephone number is (408) 530-1900. Our website can be accessed at www.viveve.com . The information contained on or that may be obtained from our website is not a part of this report. Viveve, Inc. operates as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Viveve Medical. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Viveve, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, was incorporated in 2005. We design, develop, manufacture and market medical devices for the non-invasive treatment of vaginal laxity. Vaginal laxity occurs in many women as a result of natural childbirth, during which the vaginal opening, or introitus, is over-stretched and fails to return to its pre-childbirth state. Vaginal laxity can often cause decreased sexual function and satisfaction in women. The Viveve Treatment is a non-invasive solution for vaginal laxity that is performed in less than 30 minutes, in a physician&#8217;s office, and does not require the use of anesthesia. The Viveve System uses patented monopolar radiofrequency, or RF, energy to generate low temperature heat. The vaginal mucosa is simultaneously cooled while this non-ablative heat is delivered into the submucosal layer. The RF energy stimulates the formation of collagen and causes the collagen fibers to remodel thereby tightening the submucosal tissue of the vaginal introitus. The RF stimulation causes subtle alterations in the collagen that can renew the tissue and further tighten the vaginal tissue over the next one to three months following treatment (the &#8220;Viveve Treatment&#8221;) and lead to increased sexual function as shown by the results of our clinical trials described in this report. ( See discussion under the heading &#8220; Clinical Studies &#8221;.) The Viveve Treatment provides patients suffering from vaginal laxity and decreased sexual function a non-invasive alternative to surgical procedures, which in contrast, can cost up to tens of thousands of dollars and involve weeks of recovery. The tissue tightening effect caused from the application of RF energy has been demonstrated by our own pre-clinical and clinical studies, as more fully described in the discussion under the heading Clinical Studies . The technology underlying the Viveve System is identical to the technology underlying the Thermage System, except for certain system modifications required for use in a different indication than that used by the Thermage System. ( See discussion under the heading &#8220; Patents and Proprietary Technology &#8221;.) 

&#160; 

We received regulatory approval to market the Viveve System in Europe through a CE Mark issued on December 7, 2010. An amendment to the CE Mark was approved and it will remain active through September 18, 2020. On April 26, 2012, we received Canada Health Medical Device License approval from the Canadian Medical Devices Bureau, subject to annual renewal. In Hong Kong, a Certification of Type Acceptance was issued on June 28, 2012. We currently import into Japan via Japan&#8217;s physician import license pathway. We currently market and sell the Viveve System, including the single-use treatment tips, through trained sales employees, consultants and distributors. Experienced OB/GYN physicians who currently use the Viveve System provide initial training for new physicians on its proper use, and our sales employees and consultants and distributors maintain frequent interactions with customers to promote repeat sales of our single-use treatment tips. 

&#160; 

We currently have 17 exclusive relationships covering distribution of the Viveve System in 51 countries around the world, and we have regulatory clearance to market and sell our product in 22 of those countries:

Market Overview 

&#160; 

Overview of Vaginal Laxity 

&#160; 

Vaginal laxity and tissue architecture have often been overlooked as contributing etiological factors to female sexual dysfunction. Vaginal laxity can lead to diminished physical sensation during intercourse. This reduction in sensation is often coupled with a reduction in sexual satisfaction, all of which can also impact a woman&#8217;s sense of sexual self-esteem and her relationship with her sexual partner. 

&#160; 

Vaginal laxity is rarely discussed in the clinical situation, yet most surveyed OB/GYNs and urogynecologists recognize that it is an underreported, yet bothersome, medical condition that impacts relationship happiness and sexual function. 1 Another survey of OB/GYNs, found that vaginal laxity is the most frequent physical change seen or discussed post-vaginal delivery 2 . Additionally, in a survey of women ranging from 25-45 years of age, who had experienced at least one vaginal delivery, approximately half expressed some degree of concern over &#8220;looseness&#8221; of the vaginal introitus. 3 

&#160; 

Women can develop vaginal laxity for a number of reasons, including aging, genetic predisposition, lifestyle, and/or trauma. As women age, slower cellular renewal coupled with reduced vascular and glandular networks contributes to loss of underlying supportive fibrous tissue. Some women may have underlying pathophysiological issues with collagen formation, remodeling and repair; and their lifestyle choices (e.g., alcohol consumption, tobacco use, and excessive food consumption) also play a role in the integrity of vaginal tissue. Vaginal trauma (e.g., childbirth, surgery, self-stimulation, or coitus) can also contribute to vaginal laxity. 

&#160; 

All women who have given birth vaginally undergo stretching of the tissues of the vaginal opening to accommodate the fetal head. Often the effects are permanent and many women have long-term physical and psychological consequences including sexual dissatisfaction. One significant issue is the loosening of the introitus &#9472; the vaginal opening. This happens with the first vaginal delivery and usually is made worse with subsequent vaginal deliveries. Vaginal laxity can result in decreased sexual pleasure for both women and their partners during intercourse. We believe that this condition is not frequently discussed because women are embarrassed, fear that their concerns will be dismissed or fear that their physicians will not understand. Physicians hesitate to discuss the situation with their patients because historically there has been no safe and effective treatment. Physicians frequently recommend Kegel exercises. However, these exercises only strengthen the pelvic floor muscles and do not address the underlying cause of vaginal laxity &#8211; loss of tissue elasticity. While surgery can be performed to tighten the vaginal canal, the formation of scar tissue from the surgery may lead to painful intercourse and permanent side effects. 

&#160; 

As a consequence of the physical tissue damage that can result from childbirth, a significant decrease in sexual satisfaction has been reported in women who underwent vaginal delivery, when assessed two years after delivery, in comparison with those who underwent elective caesarian section. In the past several years there has been a marked increase in the number of women requesting delivery by caesarian section with the intention of preventing damage to the pelvic floor and introitus. Caesarian sections are not without risk to both the baby and mother. Whether or not to agree to a woman&#8217;s request for an elective caesarian section has generated considerable controversy among obstetricians. If a procedure were available to address the concerns of women about vaginal laxity, we believe the perceived need to have a caesarian section to prevent vaginal tissue damage may decrease significantly.

Market for a Proven Solution to Vaginal Laxity 

&#160; 

In 2009, we sponsored several on-line marketing surveys in the U.S. with both OB/GYNs and women, ages 25-55, to assess attitudes of physicians and women about vaginal laxity and towards a safe, non-invasive solution to treat this condition. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#9679;

Physician Survey : An OB/GYN marketing survey was conducted by OB/GYN Alliance with nearly 525 practicing OB/GYNs from across the U.S. The objectives of the study were to: obtain insights from physicians on physical changes resulting from childbirth and the corresponding sexual health implications for patients; understand the perceptions and opinions of OB/GYN physicians on a procedure that could be offered to address vaginal laxity following childbirth; and gain an understanding of whom the early adopters may be of the Viveve Treatment. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#9679;

Consumer Survey : In a consumer marketing survey conducted by Q&#38;A Research, 421 women were screened for vaginal delivery, age (25-55), Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (&#8220;HHI&#8221;) ($50K+) and education. The objectives of the survey were to assess the need for the Viveve Treatment and better understand the complexity of emotions and the psychological profile of women who experience, but do not discuss, vaginal changes post childbirth.

&#160;

Results from these surveys suggested that vaginal laxity is a significant unmet medical need, and that patients and physicians would benefit significantly from a safe and effective non-invasive treatment that would also increase physical sensation and sexual satisfaction following vaginal childbirth. Of the 421 patient respondents, up to 48% felt that vaginal laxity was a concern post-childbirth. Furthermore, it is evident that patients and their OB/GYNs are not discussing vaginal laxity on a regular basis; in fact, we believe such conversations occur quite infrequently due to many factors, including patient embarrassment and fear of being ridiculed, lack of time and lack of solutions for physicians. Of the 525 OB/GYNs surveyed, 84% indicated that vaginal laxity is the number one post-delivery physical change for women, being more prevalent than weight gain, urinary incontinence and stretch marks, and believe that it is under-reported by their patients. Additionally, in a separate international survey of urogynecologists, 83% of the 563 respondents described vaginal laxity as underreported by their patients and the majority considered it a bothersome condition that impacts sexual function and relationships. Despite the lack of communication regarding this issue, we believe there is a strong interest among patients and doctors for a treatment that is clinically proven and safe. 

&#160; 

Applying U.S. census data, CDC Vital Statistics data and our projections as a result of these studies, we estimate there are approximately 6 million post-partum women who are potential candidates for this procedure in the U.S. alone, approximately 3 million of whom could be early adopters for the Viveve Treatment. 

&#160; 

In 2012, we conducted a similar consumer study in Japan and Canada in order to understand cultural differences that may exist towards vaginal laxity and the Viveve Treatment. The results corroborated our U.S. survey conclusions. Applying World Health Organization census data as well as data from individual countries, we estimate there are 25-30 million women outside the U.S. that could be early adopters of the Viveve Treatment. 

&#160; 

Current Treatments and Their Limitations 

&#160; 

Currently, few medical treatments are available to effectively treat vaginal laxity. The most widely prescribed treatments include Kegel exercises and invasive surgical procedures, known as laser vaginal rejuvenation (&#8220;LVR&#8221;) or vaginoplasty. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Kegel Exercises : Kegels are an exercise that was developed by Dr. Arnold Kegel designed to strengthen the muscles of the pelvic floor - the pubococcygeal (&#8220;PC&#8221;) muscles - to increase vaginal muscle tone, improve sexual response, and limit involuntary urine release due to stress urinary incontinence. These exercises are often prescribed following childbirth or during and after menopause. However, we are not aware of any validated evidence indicating that Kegels improve vaginal laxity or sexual function due to laxity. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Surgical Procedures : Of the various alternatives for treating vaginal laxity, invasive surgical procedures, such as LVR, are the only modalities with any proven efficacy outcomes. Typically, they are performed by plastic surgeons with patients under general anesthesia. According to The International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (&#8220;ISAPS&#8221;), approximately 114,135 LVR surgeries were performed world-wide in 2013. However, these invasive surgical procedures are expensive, costing thousands of dollars, and can involve weeks of post-surgical recovery time for the patient. They also carry the risk of scarring, which can lead to uncomfortable or painful intercourse, long-term or permanent loss of sensation, serious infection, tissue necrosis, hematomas (fluid collection under the tissue that may require removal), and adverse reactions to anesthesia. 

&#160; 

The Viveve Solution 

&#160; 

We believe that the Viveve System provides a compelling, safe, non-invasive treatment for vaginal laxity and improvement of sexual function. The Viveve System consists of an RF generator with cooling capability that protects the mucosa from over-heating and a handpiece that, in conjunction with a single-use treatment tip, regulates the application of RF energy and monitors treatment data. The Viveve Treatment is typically performed in a medical office setting by, or under the supervision of, trained and qualified physicians, that may include obstetricians and gynecologists, plastic surgeons, dermatologists, general surgeons, urologists, urogynecologists or family practitioners. 

&#160; 

Benefits of the Viveve Solution 

&#160; 

Our solution provides a number of benefits for physicians and patients: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Non-Invasive, Non-Ablative Alternative to Surgery with No Identified Safety Issues . The Viveve Treatment has been used to treat over 200 clinical patients and physician users have reported use of the Viveve Treatment on approximately 1,500 additional patients as of the date of this report. The procedure is non-invasive and offers an alternative to surgery at a much lower price with little or no downtime from the patient&#8217;s normal routine. It is also not a surgical procedure and does not damage either the mucosal or sub-mucosal tissue or require any form of anesthesia. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Single Treatment . The Viveve Treatment is normally performed in a medical office setting as a single treatment that takes less than 30 minutes to complete. Our studies have shown that the clinical effect from our procedure occurs within one to three months and patients continue to report improvements over a period of six months following treatment. In addition, our studies have shown that the Viveve Treatment maintains its effect for at least 12 months, based upon currently available data from our clinical studies. 

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; 

Compelling Physician Economics . We believe that in an era of declining government and insurance reimbursement, many physicians are seeking to add effective and safe, self-pay procedures to their practices. The Viveve System can be easily adapted into many physician practices and offers compelling per-procedure economics for the physician, despite requiring a small capital equipment purchase. 

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; 

Ease of Use . The Viveve System offers an easy-to-use, straightforward user interface that allows a trained physician to perform the treatment in less than 30 minutes. The Viveve System provides real-time feedback and can be monitored during the treatment. The handpiece and single-use treatment tip are designed with a small profile for accurate placement during treatment, comfort and ease of use. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Our Technology 

&#160; 

The Viveve System uses a patented method of delivering monopolar RF energy for heating collagen. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Monopolar Radiofrequency Energy . Monopolar RF delivery uses two electrodes, with one active electrode being held in the device handpiece by the physician and the second, a passive return electrode, typically attached to the patient&#8217;s upper leg. Monopolar delivery allows for precise administration of energy because the electrical current is concentrated where the active electrode touches the body and disperses quickly as it travels towards the return electrode. The monopolar RF process is distinct from bipolar RF-based technology, which is superficial, relying on current passing through tissue located between two probes placed close together on the surface of the skin. We believe that our monopolar technology delivers energy more effectively and to a greater tissue depth than bipolar technology. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

The Capacitive Coupling Mechanism of Action for Collagen Heating . Our single-use Viveve treatment tip contains patented technology that uses monopolar RF energy as a controlled tissue heating source through the use of a non-conducting material, known as a dielectric. Capacitive coupling is the use of the dielectric to create an electric field in the area where the treatment tip touches the body. The electric field induces a current within the surrounding tissue, resulting in volumetric heating of the tissue due to the tissue&#8217;s natural resistance to electrical current flow. Collagen is an efficient conductor of electricity and therefore acts as a pathway for the electric current. This process results in heating of the fibrous septae, the strands of collagen fibers that permeate tissues and connect the outer mucosal layer to the underlying muscle. Delivery of heat to the fibrous septae located in deeper layers of the tissue shrinks and shortens them, resulting in tightening of the mucosal tissue. Over time, new collagen strands may grow as part of the body&#8217;s natural response to the activation of fibroblasts that results from the application of low-energy hyperthermic RF energy. These new strands may add strength and produce additional tissue tightening over the next one to three months. This tightening of the tissue has the potential to reduce vaginal laxity and increase sexual function. 

&#160; 

The Viveve System 

&#160; 

The Viveve System includes three major components: an RF generator housed in a table-top console, a reusable handpiece and a single-use treatment tip, as well as several other consumable accessories. Physicians attach the single-use treatment tip to the handpiece, which is connected to the console. The generator authenticates the treatment tip and programs the system for the desired treatment without further physician intervention. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Radiofrequency Generator . The generator produces a six-megahertz signal and is simple and efficient to operate. Controls are within easy reach, and important user information is clearly displayed on the console&#8217;s built-in display, including energy delivered, tissue impedance, duration and feedback on procedure technique. Cooling is achieved, in conjunction with the generator, though the delivery of a coolant that helps to cool and protect the mucosa during a procedure. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Handpiece . The reusable handpiece holds the treatment tip in place and processes information about temperature, contact, cooling system function and other important data. A precision control valve within the handpiece meters the delivery of coolant, which protects the mucosal surface. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Treatment Tip . The single-use treatment tip is available in one size and comes pre-sterilized. Each treatment tip contains a proprietary internal EPROM, or programmable memory chip, which stores treatment parameters and safety limits in order to optimize performance and safety. To enhance procedural safety, we have programmed the EPROM for single-use treatments. Using the same treatment tip to perform multiple procedures could result in injury, therefore, the EPROM disables the treatment tip after a pre-programmed number of pulses to ensure that the treatment tip is not reused. 

&#160; 

The Viveve System also includes other consumable components. The console houses a canister of coolant that can be used for approximately four to five procedures. Each procedure requires a new return pad, which is typically adhered to the patient&#8217;s upper leg to allow a path of travel for the RF current through the body and back to the generator. We also sell proprietary single-use bottles of coupling fluid, a viscous liquid that helps ensure electrical and thermal contact with the treatment tip. 

&#160; 

The Viveve Treatment 

&#160; 

The Viveve Treatment is conducted on an outpatient basis in a physician&#8217;s office. The procedure typically takes less than 30 minutes and does not require any form of anesthesia. To perform the procedure, a physician attaches the single-use treatment tip to the handpiece. The return pad is then adhered to the patient&#8217;s upper leg to allow a path of travel for the RF current back to the generator. Prior to treatment, the treatment area is bathed in coupling fluid, which is used for conduction and lubrication. The area from the 1:00 o&#8217;clock position to the 11:00 o&#8217;clock position just inside the hymenal ring is treated using the Viveve treatment tip by delivering a three-phased pulse: Phase 1 &#8211; cooling, Phase 2 &#8211; 90 Joules/cm2 of RF energy, and Phase 3 &#8211; cooling. Each pulse lasts approximately eight seconds. The Viveve treatment tip is then repositioned in an overlapping fashion clockwise and the three-phased treatment pulse is repeated. The entire circumferential treatment area from the 1:00 o&#8217;clock position to the 11:00 o&#8217;clock position is treated five times with overlapping pulses. Treatment of the urethral area is avoided. During the treatment procedure patients are expected to feel a sensation of warmth when the RF phase is delivered and a cooling sensation when the cooling phases are delivered. Based on our current clinical results, the Viveve Treatment is only required once, with efficacy lasting for at least 12 months. 

&#160; 

Our Customers 

&#160; 

To date, we have focused our initial commercial efforts in markets where we have received regulatory clearances for the Viveve System, or in the case of Japan, where we use a physician import license pathway to sell our product. Within each market, we target thought leaders in the OB/GYN specialty in order to increase awareness of vaginal laxity and accelerate patient acceptance of the Viveve Treatment. As our markets mature, we intend to target a broader number of physician specialties, including plastic surgeons, dermatologists, general surgeons, urologists, urogynecologists and family practitioners. 

&#160; 

Through our sales employees, consultants and distributors, we currently target physicians who have a demonstrated commitment to building a high-volume, non-invasive, treatment business within their practice. If distribution of our product expands globally, we intend to utilize sales consultants and distribution partners in all countries except the U.S. where we intend to hire a direct sales force. To date, we are heavily reliant on our relationships with distribution partners and sales employees and consultants for the sale of our products outside the U.S. 

&#160; 

Business Strategy 

&#160; 

Our goal is to become the leading provider of non-invasive solutions to treat vaginal laxity by: 

&#160;

Increasing the Installed Base of Viveve Systems . In our existing markets, we plan to expand the number of Viveve Systems from our initial base of early adopters by leveraging our current and future clinical study results and through innovative marketing programs directed at both physicians and patients. As a condition that has historically had no viable, non-invasive solutions, we intend to focus much of our marketing effort on physician and patient education. Further, we intend to expand the number of regulatory approvals both internationally and in the U.S., to further increase the areas in which we can market the Viveve System.

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Driving Increased Treatment Tip Usage . Unlike the capital equipment model of other businesses, we maintain an active, continuous relationship with our physician customer base because of the single-use, disposable nature of the treatment tips. We work collaboratively with our physician customer base to increase treatment tip usage by enhancing customer awareness and facilitating the marketing efforts of our physician customers to their patients. We believe that our customers&#8217; interests are closely aligned with our interests, and we plan to monitor the market to foster continued procedure growth for our customers and treatment tip sales for us. We intend to launch innovative marketing programs with physician customers to develop a profitable Viveve Treatment practice. 

&#160;

Broadening Our Physician Customer Base . While our initial focus is on marketing our procedure to the OB/GYN specialty, we intend to selectively expand our sales efforts into other physician specialties, such as plastic surgery, dermatology, urology, urogynecology, general surgery and family practice. Additionally, we intend to pursue sales from physician-directed medi-spas with track records of safe and successful aesthetic treatments.

&#160;

Developing New Treatment Tips and System Enhancements . We intend to continue to expand our line of treatment tips to allow for even shorter procedure times to benefit both physicians and patients. We also plan to pursue potential system modifications and next generation enhancements that will further increase the ease-of-use of the Viveve System.

&#160;

Investing in Intellectual Property and Patent Protection . We will continue to invest in expanding our intellectual property portfolio, and we intend to file for additional patents to strengthen our intellectual property rights. Areas in which we may pursue additional patent protection include, but are not limited to, redesign of certain system components, disposable components and software algorithms. We believe that our intellectual property rights protect our position as the exclusive provider of a vaginal laxity treatment using monopolar RF technology in the U.S. and in many other countries. ( See discussion under the heading &#8220; Patents and Proprietary Technology &#8221; .) 

&#160; 

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

International 

&#160; 

We currently market and sell the Viveve System, including the single-use treatment tips, in 22 countries outside the U.S. through trained sales employees, consultants, and distributors. As of the date of this report, we had four sales directors (Europe and Middle East, Asia Pacific, and Latin America), one sales consultant (Canada) and 17 sales distributors covering 51 countries throughout the world. 

&#160; 

By using a consultative sales process, we form strong relationships with our customers through frequent interactions. Beyond performing initial system installation and on-site training, which can occur within two weeks of a physician&#8217;s purchase decision, our sales consultants provide ongoing consultation to physicians on how to integrate the Viveve System into their practices and market procedures to their patients. 

&#160; 

We also provide comprehensive training and education to each physician upon delivery of the Viveve System. We require this initial training to assist physicians in safely and effectively performing the Viveve Treatment. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Our strategy to grow sales internationally is to: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

increase penetration of the Viveve System by targeting physicians and clinics that perform in-office procedures and by implementing direct-to-consumer marketing programs to increase patient awareness of the Viveve Treatment; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

expand into new international markets by gaining regulatory approval, and identifying and training qualified distributors; and 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

expand the scope of physicians who offer the Viveve Treatment in addition to OB/GYNs, including plastic surgeons, dermatologists, general surgeons, urologists, urogynecologists and primary care physicians. 

&#160; 

Further, we intend to actively engage in promotional opportunities through participation in industry tradeshows, clinical workshops and company-sponsored conferences with expert panelists, as well as through trade journals, brochures and our website. We intend to actively seek opportunities to obtain positive media exposure, and plan to engage in direct-to-consumer marketing of the Viveve Treatment, including extensive use of social media. 

&#160; 

United States 

&#160; 

In December 2008, Viveve received regulatory clearance from the FDA for a version of the device, no longer manufactured, for use in general surgical procedures for electrocoagulation and hemostasis. In March 2015, we submitted a Special 510(k) to the FDA for the Viveve System to take into account the design modifications to the original 510(k) cleared device, which include improved user interface capabilities and enhanced manufacturability. 

&#160;

We intend to seek regulatory clearance or approval from the FDA to allow us to begin to market the current Viveve System, for the treatment of vaginal tissue to improve sexual function, to physicians practicing in the U.S. and to build awareness of the Viveve Treatment in patients residing in the U.S. Because we do not have FDA clearance or approval for this indication, we have not generated any sales in the U.S. In June 2012, we submitted a pre-investigational device exemption, or IDE application, and requested an in-person meeting with the FDA to solicit feedback in advance of filing an IDE to conduct a clinical study of the Viveve System to support regulatory submission. In August 2012, we met with the FDA and received feedback on our pre-clinical data, historical clinical data, and a clinical protocol for a prospective randomized controlled trial. We had a second meeting with FDA on December 17, 2015 and received additional feedback on our clinical protocol design and indication for use. We plan to submit an IDE application in 2016. If approval is received, we intend to begin our U.S. clinical study. 

&#160; 

Clinical Studies 

&#160; 

We have completed several pre-clinical studies, as well as two human clinical studies and are currently conducting a third human clinical study outside of the US. We believe the completed studies have shown that the Viveve System has a very strong safety profile and is highly effective in the treatment of vaginal laxity and improvement of sexual function. 

&#160; 

Pre-clinical Studies 

&#160; 

In 2010, in collaboration with West Virginia University, we conducted an animal study in sheep to assess the safety, and further understand the mechanism of action, of the Viveve Treatment. The vaginal introitus of five parous sheep were treated once with the Viveve System using a variety of energy levels (75&#8722;90 Joules/cm2). Each sheep then underwent serial vaginal biopsies immediately after treatment, at approximately one week, and at one, three and six months (4-5 samples per occurrence). Control biopsies were also obtained from three untreated parous sheep. We examined the vaginal mucosa and underlying connective tissue for thermal changes and subsequent tissue responses over a six month period through light microscopic examination of haematoxylin and eosin (&#8220;H&#38;E&#8221;) stained slides that were reviewed by blinded pathologists. 

&#160; 

The results of the study indicated that the optimal level of RF energy delivered was 90 J/cm2 and the biopsies supported the hypothesis that the mechanism of action of our technology involves connective tissue remodeling with fibroblast activation and new collagen production. The post-treatment absence of ulcerations, regional necrosis or diffuse fibrosis, throughout the six month follow-up period, also underscores the strong safety profile of the Viveve Treatment. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

As part of our clinical studies, we have studied and continue to study, the interaction of RF energy and tissue to further understand the mechanism of action. We have used transmission electron microscopy on ovine biopsied tissue samples to corroborate that our product induces subtle collagen modification and the deposition of new collagen that leads to tissue tightening and restoration of tissue elasticity. We have developed histology techniques to investigate the depth of heat in tissue, fibroblast activation and collagen deposition that we believe is responsible for long-term improvement and tightening of tissue. We have also created three-dimensional computer models to study tissue heating with our product. Determining the effectiveness of this type of treatment is inherently a subjective evaluation. When performing our clinical studies, we attempt to utilize the most compelling measures we can in order to provide convincing evidence of efficacy. 

&#160; 

Clinical Studies 

&#160; 

To date, we have conducted two human clinical studies using the Viveve System, one in the U.S. and one in Japan. Both studies were designed to assess the safety and efficacy of the Viveve System for the treatment of vaginal laxity and improvement of sexual function and were submitted to regulatory authorities in Europe and Canada for the purpose of seeking regulatory approval for the use and distribution of the Viveve System in such locations. Each study resulted in patients reporting that the Viveve System restored vaginal tightness to pre-childbirth level and improved sexual function. The results of our clinical trials are based on information reported by clinical patients in various response questionnaires (referred to as patient reported outcomes), designed to measure vaginal laxity and sexual function, completed by each clinical patient prior to treatment with respect to pre and post childbirth levels and at various times following treatment. All patient reported scores for each questionnaire and at each time point are compared to those scores reported by the same patients at baseline (prior to treatment) in order to assess whether patients have experienced a change due to the treatment. This change in score is then tested for statistical relevance (i.e. whether or not the change measured is due to chance). It is widely accepted by clinical trial industry standards that if the probability is less than 5% (p&#60; .05) that this change is due to chance, than the results are deemed to be &#8220;Statistically Significant&#8221;. In other words, there is a 95% probability that the change in score measured is due to the treatment. Therefore, when we indicate that our clinical patients experienced a Statistically Significant result, we are referring to the change in responses as reported by such patients on the response questionnaires from the pre-treatment assessment (baseline) as compared to the post-treatment assessments at the various time points specified. 

&#160; 

United States 

&#160; 

We conducted our first human study of the Viveve System beginning in November 2008. The study was an open-label study (without a control group) conducted in 24 female subjects, ages 25-44 years old, each of whom had experienced at least one full-term vaginal delivery. The study was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of the procedure at three RF dosing levels. Each woman was treated once with the Viveve System, with no anesthesia &#8211; three patients received 60 joules/cm2, three patients received 75 joules/cm2, and 18 patients received 90 joules/cm2. Patient outcomes were measured at baseline, one month, three months, six months, and 12 months using several validated patient-reported outcome measures, including a company-designed vaginal laxity/tightness questionnaire, modified Female Sexual Function Index (&#8220;mFSFI&#8221;), Female Sexual Distress Scale-Revised (&#8220;FSDS-R&#8221;) and the Global Response Assessment. 

&#160; 

Within one month after the Viveve Treatment, patients reported a Statistically Significant improvement in vaginal laxity scores, sexual function and sexual satisfaction scores to pre-childbirth levels. These results continued throughout the 12 month follow-up period. Additionally, patients reported a Statistically Significant decrease at one month, and thereafter, in their personal distress scores from sexual activity. 

&#160; 

The Viveve System also demonstrated a strong safety profile throughout the study. The treatment was well tolerated and there were no procedure-related adverse events or serious adverse events through the 12 month follow-up period. 

&#160; 

Japan 

&#160; 

Our second human clinical study of the Viveve System began in March 2010. This study was an open-label study conducted in 30 female subjects, ages 21-55 years old, each of whom had experienced at least one full-term vaginal delivery. The study was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of the procedure. Each woman was treated once with the Viveve System, with no anesthesia, using 90 joules/cm2 of RF energy as the therapeutic dose. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Like the U.S. study, patient outcomes were measured at baseline, one month, three months, six months, and 12 months using several validated patient-reported outcome measures, including a company-designed vaginal laxity/tightness questionnaire, mFSFI, FSDS-R and the Global Response Assessment. 

&#160; 

Within one month after the Viveve Treatment, patients reported a Statistically Significant improvement in vaginal laxity scores, sexual function and sexual satisfaction scores to pre-childbirth levels. These results continued throughout the 12 month follow-up period. Additionally, patients reported a Statistically Significant decrease at one month, and thereafter, in their personal distress scores from sexual activity. 

&#160; 

Similar to the U.S. study, the Viveve Treatment continued to demonstrate a strong safety profile. The treatment was well tolerated and there were no procedure-related adverse events or serious adverse events through the 12 month follow-up period. 

&#160; 

Europe, Japan and Canada 

&#160; 

In the fourth quarter of 2014, we began the VIVEVE I clinical study, sometimes referred to in this report as the &#8220;OUS Clinical Trial,&#8221; a randomized, blinded and sham-controlled trial designed to further demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the Viveve Treatment versus a sham-control procedure for the treatment of vaginal laxity. The study is designed to demonstrate that the Viveve Treatment is superior to the sham treatment for the primary effectiveness and safety endpoints described below. It is currently anticipated that up to ten clinical sites will enroll approximately 113 patients, which will include pre-menopausal females 18 years of age or older who have experienced at least one full term vaginal delivery at least 12 months prior to enrollment date, randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either an active treatment group or sham-control group. Patients will be followed for six months post-treatment to assess the primary effectiveness and safety endpoints of the study with data being collected at one, three and six month intervals. The study will also include an interim data analysis at the 3 month endpoint of 50% of the patients enrolled. Patients initially randomized to the sham arm will be offered the opportunity to receive the active Viveve treatment once they have completed the 6-month evaluation following the sham intervention. 

&#160; 

The primary endpoint of the study is the proportion of subjects in the active arm as compared to the proportion of the subjects in the sham arm reporting no vaginal laxity at six months post-intervention. &#8220;No vaginal laxity&#8221; is operationally defined as a score &#62; 4 on the Viveve System Questionnaires, patient reported global assessment of vaginal laxity based on a 7 point scale. Additionally, the primary safety endpoint is the proportion of subjects in the active arm experiencing an adverse event (&#8220;AE&#8221;) by six months post-treatment as compared to the proportion of the subjects in the sham arm experiencing an AE by six months post-intervention. Secondary endpoints include the percent change in mean score on the FSFI, FSDS-R and the Vaginal Laxity Inventory (&#8220;VALI&#8221;). The VALI was created specifically for the assessment of vaginal laxity by external medical experts. Its use as a comprehensive patient reported outcome questionnaire is currently being scientifically validated by us to assess women&#8217;s vaginal laxity on a 7 point scale. 

&#160; 

We believe that the consistency of results, in both safety and efficacy, across these clinical study populations, is indicative of the cross-culture similarities in this medical condition and the positive impact that an effective treatment can have on the sexual health of women after vaginal childbirth. Notwithstanding the safety of the Viveve Treatment, patients may experience undesirable side-effects such as temporary swelling or reddening of the treated tissue. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

We intend to focus on various research and development efforts for the Viveve System, including but not limited to: 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#9679;

implementing a cost improvement program to further increase gross margins and gross profit opportunity;

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

developing a new cooling system to maintain compliance with potential changes in environmental regulations; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#9679; 

designing new treatment tips to further optimize ease-of-use and reduce procedure times for patients and physicians; and 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#9679;

increasing security to prevent counterfeiting and refurbishment.

&#160; 

We have formed strategic relationships with outside contractors for assistance on annualized projects, and we work closely with experts in the medical community to supplement our research and development resources. Research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $4,988,000 and $1,426,000, respectively. In the future, we expect to pursue further research and development initiatives to improve and extend our technological capabilities and to foster an environment of innovation and quality. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing 

&#160; 

Our manufacturing strategy involves the combined utilization of internal manufacturing resources and expertise, as well as approved suppliers and contract manufacturers. Our internal manufacturing activities include the testing and packaging of Viveve treatment tips and handpieces, as well as the final integration, system testing and packaging of the Viveve System. We outsource the manufacture of components, subassemblies and certain finished products that are produced to our specifications and shipped to our Sunnyvale facility for final assembly or inspection, testing and certification. Our finished products are stored at and distributed from our Sunnyvale facility. Quality control, risk management, efficiency and the ability to respond quickly to changing requirements are the primary goals of our manufacturing operations. 

&#160; 

We have arrangements with our suppliers that allow us to adjust the delivery quantities of components, subassemblies and finished products, as well as delivery schedules, to match our changing requirements. The forecasts we use are based on historical trends, current utilization patterns and sales forecasts of future demand. Lead times for components, subassemblies and finished products may vary significantly depending on the size of the order, specific supplier requirements and current market demand for the components and subassemblies. Most of our suppliers have no contractual obligations to supply us with, and we are not contractually obligated to purchase from them, the components used in our devices. 

&#160; 

We obtain programmable memory chips for our treatment tips and the coolant valve for the handpiece from single suppliers, for which we attempt to mitigate risks through inventory management and utilization of 12- to 18-month purchase orders, and sterilization services from a single vendor, for which we attempt to mitigate risks by using two sterilization chambers at each of two locations. Other products and components come from single suppliers, but alternate suppliers have been qualified or, we believe, can be readily identified and qualified. In addition, the availability of cryogen for our cooling module, which we can source from multiple suppliers, may fluctuate due to changes in the global supply of this material. To date, shipments of finished products to our customers have not been delayed due to material delays in obtaining any of our components, subassemblies or finished products. 

&#160; 

We are required to manufacture our product in compliance with Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 820 (&#8220;21 CFR 820&#8221;) enacted by the FDA. 21 CFR 820 regulates the methods and documentation relating to the design, testing, control, manufacturing, labeling, quality assurance, packaging, storage and shipping of our product. We maintain quality assurance and quality management certifications to enable us to market our product in the member states of the European Union, the European Free Trade Association and countries which have entered into Mutual Recognition Agreements with the European Union. These certifications include EN ISO 9001:2000 and CAN/CSA ISO 13485:2003. We are also required to maintain our product registration in a number of other foreign markets such as Canada. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

We use small quantities of common cleaning products in our manufacturing operations, which are lawfully disposed of through a routine waste management program. Except for costs that may be incurred in the future in connection with environmental regulations requiring the phase out of R134a, a hydrofluorocarbon, or HFC, upon which our cooling module relies, we do not anticipate any material costs due to compliance with environmental laws or regulations. In 2007, the European Union enacted directives aimed at the automotive industry for the removal of HFC&#39;s from air conditioning. As a result of these directives, we anticipate that similar directives may be imposed on the medical device industry over the next decade. While we do not anticipate that we will have to incur costs in the near future to develop an alternative cooling module for our device which is not dependent on HFCs, if and when we are required to do so, and if we do not do so in a timely or cost-effective manner, the Viveve System may not be in compliance with environmental regulations, which could result in fines, civil penalties and the inability to sell our products in certain major international markets. 

&#160; 

Given our limited commercial history, we only offer a one year warranty providing for the repair, rework or replacement (at the Company&#8217;s option) of products that fail to perform within stated specifications. To the extent that any of our components have performance related or technical issues in the field, we typically replace those components as necessary. 

&#160; 

Patents and Proprietary Technology 

&#160; 

We rely on patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our technology and the Viveve System. We have an exclusive license to or own 10 issued U.S. patents primarily covering the Viveve System and methods of use, 2 of which have expired. The remaining 8 will expire between 2016 and 2029. Additionally, we have 4 pending U.S. patent applications, 16 issued foreign patents, and 20 pending foreign patent applications, some of which foreign applications preserve an opportunity to pursue patent rights in multiple countries.

All of our employees and consultants are required to execute confidentiality agreements in connection with their employment and consulting relationships with us. We also require them to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived or made in connection with the employment or consulting relationship. We cannot provide any assurance that our employees and consultants will abide by the confidentiality or invention assignment terms of their agreements. Despite measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may copy aspects of our product or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. 

&#160; 

&#8220;Viveve,&#8221; is a registered trademark in the U.S. and several foreign countries. As of the date of this report, we have one registered trademark in the U.S., as well as various foreign registrations protecting the mark in 18 countries outside of the U.S. We may file for additional trademarks to strengthen our trademark rights, but we cannot be certain that our trademark applications will issue or that our trademarks will be enforceable. 

&#160; 

Edward Knowlton Licensed Patents 

&#160; 

On February 10, 2006, Viveve, Inc. entered into an Intellectual Property Assignment and License Agreement with Edward W. Knowlton (&#8220;Knowlton&#8221;), as amended on May 22, 2006 and July 20, 2007 (collectively, the &#8220;Knowlton IP Agreement&#8221;), pursuant to which Knowlton granted to Viveve, Inc. an exclusive, royalty-free and perpetual worldwide sublicense to certain intellectual property and technology licensed to Knowlton from a third party, including rights to several patents and patent applications owned by Thermage, Inc. outside the field of contraction, remodeling and ablation of the skin through and including (but not beyond) the subcutaneous fat layer below the skin (collectively, the &#8220;Knowlton Licensed IP&#8221;). The sublicense under the Knowlton Licensed IP is fully-paid, transferable, sublicensable and permits us to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale and import any product or technology solely for use in the field of transmucosal treatment of the vagina or vulva (the &#8220;Field&#8221;) and to practice any process, method, or procedure solely in the Field. The Knowlton IP Agreement also assigns to us all technology and related intellectual property rights owned by Knowlton for the development and commercialization of devices, including any improvements, in the Field (the &#8220;Knowlton Assigned IP&#8221;). We are obligated to file and reasonably prosecute any patent applications that include a description of the Knowlton Assigned IP as prior art and maintain all patents included in the Knowlton Assigned IP, at our expense. In consideration of the sale, assignment, transfer, release and conveyance and other obligations of Knowlton under the Knowlton IP Agreement, Viveve, Inc. issued 1,600,000 shares of our common stock to Knowlton and agreed to engage the consulting services of Knowlton. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

On February 10, 2006, Viveve, Inc. entered into a Consulting Agreement with Knowlton (&#8220;Knowlton `Consulting Agreement&#8221;), pursuant to which Knowlton assigned all rights to any inventions and intellectual property developed during the course of providing consulting services in the Field during the term of the agreement. Unless earlier terminated pursuant to the provisions described therein, the term of the Knowlton Consulting Agreement continued until the earlier to occur of (i) the date that is six months after the closing of an initial public offering of Viveve, Inc.&#8217;s stock; or (ii) the acquisition by a third party of all or substantially all of the business or assets of Viveve, Inc., whether by asset or stock acquisition, merger, consolidation or otherwise. The agreement could be renewed only upon the mutual written agreement of the parties prior to its expiration. The Knowlton Consulting Agreement expired by its terms on September 23, 2014, the effective date of the Merger. The assignment of the intellectual property developed during the term of the Knowlton Consulting Agreement survives termination. Under the Knowlton Consulting Agreement, Viveve, Inc. paid Knowlton $75,150 for consulting services during the year ended December 31, 2014. 

&#160; 

Agreement with Solta Medical 

&#160; 

Effective April 30, 2010, Viveve, Inc. entered into a Supply Agreement (the &#8220;Supply Agreement&#8221;) with Solta Medical, Inc. (&#8220;Solta&#8221;), pursuant to which Solta agreed to sell to Viveve, Inc. the cryogen cooling method and coupling fluid that Solta uses with its ThermaCool&#174; System (&#8220;TC3 System&#8221;) for use with our compatible radio frequency medical device for the purpose of conducting our initial clinical trials. The applicable term of the Supply Agreement is the later of the period through completion of our initial clinical trials or six months following the effective date. On October 14, 2010, the parties amended the term of the Supply Agreement to remain in effect for so long as Solta supports its TC3 System. In the event that Solta discontinues support of its TC3 System and terminates the Supply Agreement, Solta agrees to (i) provide us with information for Solta&#8217;s cryogen supplier, (ii) permit us to make any arrangement with such supplier for a continued supply of cryogen and (iii) grant us a royalty free, non-exclusive perpetual license under any Solta intellectual property directed to the design of the cryogen container in the field of treating vaginal tissue. 

&#160; 

The portion of the Supply Agreement relating to coupling fluid was subsequently superseded by the parties&#8217; Coupling Fluid License and Product Supply Agreement on September 30, 2010, pursuant to which Solta agreed to (i) grant to Viveve, Inc. a license for the coupling fluid and (ii) supply the coupling fluid at preferred pricing for two years and at non-preferred pricing after two years. The agreement grants to us a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, perpetual, exclusive license in the field of treating vaginal tissue, with a right to grant sublicenses in such field, to make, have made, use and sell coupling fluid for an aggregate license fee of $125,000. The agreement was for an initial term of three years, after which it continues to remain in effect unless and until terminated in accordance with the terms therein. In addition, while the terms of the original agreement permit the use of the cryogen cooling method for initial clinical trials, Viveve also purchases the cryogen cooling method and coupling fluid from Solta for commercial purposes. We currently do not have an alternative source of cryogen and if Solta refuses to sell to us for commercial reasons, or otherwise, our business could be materially adversely affected. 

&#160; 

Agreement with Stellartech Research Corporation 

&#160; 

On June 12, 2006, Viveve, Inc. entered into the Stellartech Agreement, as amended and restated on October 4, 2007, with Stellartech for an initial term of three years in connection with the performance of development and manufacturing services by Stellartech and the license of certain technology and intellectual property rights to each party. Under the Stellartech Agreement, we agreed to purchase 300 units of generators manufactured by Stellartech. In conjunction with the Agreement, Stellartech purchased 300,000 shares of Viveve, Inc.&#8217;s common stock at par value. Under the Stellartech Agreement, we paid Stellartech $3,446,000 and $484,000 for goods and services during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In addition, Stellartech granted to us a non-exclusive, nontransferable, worldwide, royalty-free license in the Field (defined above in the discussions titled &#8220;Edward Knowlton Licensed Patents&#8221;) to use Stellartech&#8217;s technology incorporated into deliverables or products developed, manufactured or sold by Stellartech to us pursuant to the Stellartech Agreement (the &#8220;Stellartech Products&#8221;) to use, sell, offer for sale, import and distribute the Stellartech Products within the Field, including the use of software object code incorporated into the Stellartech Products. The Stellartech technology consists of know-how applicable to the manufacturing and repair of the Viveve System, including any other intellectual property which Stellartech developed or acquired separate and apart from the Stellartech Agreement and all related derivative works. In addition, once we purchase a minimum commitment of 300 units of the RF generator component (the &#8220;Minimum Commitment&#8221;) and the Stellartech Agreement expires, Stellartech is to grant us a nonexclusive, nontransferable, worldwide, royalty-free, fully-paid license to use the Stellartech technology incorporated into the Stellartech Products to make and have made Stellartech Products in the Field. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Stellartech also granted (i) an exclusive (even as to Stellartech), nontransferable, worldwide, royalty-free license within the Field under those certain intellectual property rights licensed to Stellartech pursuant to a development and supply agreement between Stellartech and Thermage, dated October 1, 1997 (the &#8220;Thermage Technology&#8221;), to use any elements of the Thermage Technology incorporated into the Stellartech Products, solely for the use, sale, offer for sale, importation and distribution within the Field; (ii) upon our satisfaction of the Minimum Commitment and the expiration of the Stellartech Agreement, an exclusive, nontransferable, worldwide, royalty-free, fully-paid license within the Field under Stellartech&#8217;s license rights in the Thermage Technology to use any elements of the Thermage Technology which are incorporated into the Stellartech Products to make and have made Stellartech Products in the Field; and (iii) the exclusive right within the Field to prosecute infringers of the portion of Stellartech&#8217;s Thermage Technology rights exclusively licensed to us. Our license rights in Thermage Technology also include the use of software object code for Thermage Technology used in the Stellartech Products. As of the date of this report, the Stellartech Agreement has expired by its terms, however, the parties still continue to operate under the terms of the agreement. In addition, we have not yet met the Minimum Commitment requirement, and therefore we are not permitted to use the Stellartech technology with any other manufacturer. If Stellartech refuses or is unable to meet our delivery requirements for the Viveve System, our business could be materially adversely affected. 

&#160; 

In March 2012, Viveve, Inc. entered into a Quality and Regulatory Agreement with Stellartech, pursuant to which the parties clarified their respective quality and regulatory responsibilities under the Stellartech Agreement. The Quality and Regulatory Agreement provides that we will serve as the legal manufacturer for all Stellartech Products developed and sold to us thereunder and that we are obligated to maintain all relevant quality assurance and regulatory processes and requirements required by any regulatory authority and to comply with the processes and requirements set forth in the schedule of responsibilities provided in the agreement. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

The Viveve System is a medical device subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by international regulatory bodies as well as the FDA. These regulations govern the following activities that we perform, or that are performed on our behalf, to ensure that medical products exported internationally or distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses: 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#9679;

product design, development and manufacture;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679;

product safety, testing, labeling and storage;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#9679;

record keeping procedures;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#9679;

product marketing, sales and distribution; and

&#160;

&#160; 

&#9679;

post-marketing surveillance, complaint handling, medical device reporting, reporting of deaths, serious injuries or device malfunctions and repair or recall of products.

&#160; &#160; 

In addition to the regulatory approvals already received in connection with the sale of the Viveve System in the foreign jurisdictions described below and the approvals being sought in the U.S., we are currently seeking regulatory approval for the sale of our product in many other countries around the world. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

International 

&#160; 

Sales of our product outside the U.S. are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. In addition, exports of medical devices from the U.S. are regulated by the FDA. Complying with international regulatory requirements can be an expensive and time-consuming process and approval is not certain. The time required to obtain registrations or approvals, as required by other countries, may be longer than that required for FDA clearance, and requirements for such registrations or approvals may significantly differ from FDA requirements. We may be unable to obtain or maintain registrations or approvals in other countries. We may also incur significant costs in attempting to obtain and in maintaining foreign regulatory approvals. If we experience delays in receiving necessary registrations or approvals to market our product outside the U.S., or if we fail to receive those registrations or approvals, we may be unable to market our product or enhancements in international markets effectively, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and growth strategy. 

&#160; 

An entity that seeks to export an unapproved Class III medical device to a &#8220;non-Tier I&#8221; country is required to obtain export approval from the FDA. The Tier I countries are largely defined as industrialized countries with established regulatory infrastructure, such as, among others, Canada and the European Union. In January of 2011, we sought to obtain FDA approval to export the Viveve System to Mexico, Brazil and Korea (all non-Tier I countries). An export approval was obtained on March 7, 2011. Exportation of an unapproved Class III medical device to a Tier I country is permitted without FDA approval provided that certain conditions are met. Accordingly, we have exported the Viveve System to Canada and the European Union without FDA approval in accordance with Section 802 of the FDC Act. 

&#160; 

Once an entity has obtained a marketing authorization for the product in a Tier I country (e.g., a CE mark, etc.), the device can then be shipped from the U.S. to any country in the world without FDA approval. On December 7, 2010, we obtained a CE Mark for the Viveve System. As a result, we may now legally export the Viveve System to non-Tier I countries, such as China and Hong Kong without FDA approval. 

&#160; 

Entities legally exporting products from the U.S. are often asked by foreign customers or foreign governments to supply a certificate for products regulated by the FDA. To satisfy this request, an exporter may request that the FDA issue them an export certificate to accompany a device. An export certificate is a document prepared by the FDA containing information about a product&#8217;s regulatory or marketing status in the U.S. Although we have requested the issuance of export certificates to allow exports into many countries around the world, the FDA has not yet issued export certificates to us. 

&#160; 

Canada 

&#160; 

We are subject to the requirements of Health Canada and the regulations that govern medical devices in Canada. In Canada, certain devices must have a &#8220;medical device license&#8221; before they can be sold. Prior to selling a device in Canada, manufacturers of Class II, III and IV devices must submit a Medical Device Application which is reviewed by the Therapeutic Products Directorate (&#8220;TPD&#8221;), the Canadian authority that monitors and evaluates the safety, effectiveness and quality of diagnostic and therapeutic medical devices in Canada. All medical devices sold in Canada are categorized by the TPD into four different classes with Class I devices presenting the lowest potential risk (e.g. a thermometer) and Class IV devices presenting the greatest potential risk (e.g. pacemaker). Manufacturers of Class I devices do not need a medical device license to sell their product in Canada, but manufacturers of Class II, III and IV devices must receive a license. Once a medical device license has been granted, the TPD will continue to monitor medical devices to ensure they continue to be safe and effective. Medical device licenses granted by the TPD do not expire; however, the manufacturer is required to annually confirm that the information maintained by Health Canada with respect to the medical device is correct and accurate. The failure to do so may result in the cancellation of the license. 

&#160; 

Viveve, Inc. currently holds a medical device license in Canada for the Viveve System which has been categorized as a Class III device. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

European Union (EU) 

&#160; 

We are subject to the requirements of the Medical Device Directive (&#8220;MDD&#8221;), Council Directive 93/42/EEC of 14 June 14, 1993 which were made mandatory on March 21, 2010. The MDD harmonizes the laws relating to medical devices laws within the European Union. In order for a manufacturer to legally place a medical device on the European market the requirements of the MDD have to be met. Manufacturers&#8217; products meeting harmonized standards have a presumption of conformity to the MDD. Products conforming to the MDD must have a CE Mark applied. 

&#160; 

Medical devices are classified by the MDD into four categories as Class I, Class IIa, Class IIb, and III. Class I devices present the lowest potential risk (e.g. a thermometer) and Class III devices present the greatest potential risk (e.g. implant, pacemaker). The MDD stipulates that an authorized third party or notified body must be involved in the review and conformity of the product in order to gain CE Mark. Viveve, Inc. has a notified body that reviews the Viveve System for conformity on an annual basis. 

&#160; 

Viveve, Inc. currently holds a CE Mark in the European Union for the Viveve System which has been categorized as a Class IIb device. 

&#160; 

Turkey 

&#160; 

In January 2016, Viveve was notified that the Viveve System was registered in Turkey with the Turkish National Information Database for Medicines and Medical Devices. The effective date of the registration was December 24, 2015. The Viveve System is registered as a Class IIb device in Turkey which follows the classification for the EU countries. 

&#160; 

Hong Kong 

&#160; 

The Department of Health (&#8220;DOH&#8221;), is the main health authority in Hong Kong. Under the DOH, the Medical Device Control Office (&#8220;MDCO&#8221;), regulates medical devices. Similar to the Canadian classifications system described above, medical devices sold in Hong Kong are classified as I-IV according to the risk level associated with their intended use. Class I devices are low-risk medical devices, such as bandages and dressings. Class II devices are medium-low-risk devices, such as suction pumps and gastroscopes. Class III devices are medium-high-risk devices, such as orthopedic implants and medical lasers. Class IV devices are high-risk devices, such as prosthetic heart valves and implantable cardiac pacemakers. The main contact point with the MDCO is the Local Representative Person (&#8220;LRP&#8221;), who must be a locally-registered entity. The LRP must be either the manufacturer of the device or approved by the manufacturer to perform the duties of the LRP. The LRP submits the application for listing medical devices and fulfills any requests from the MDCO, such as making documents referenced in the application available for inspection. After the device is listed, the LRP is responsible for the marketing and post-market procedures, which include keeping distribution records, handling complaints, initiating product recalls, managing adverse incidents, and reporting changes. The manufacturer must issue an LRP appointment letter and attach it to each product registration application. Currently, market approval from one of the Global Harmonization Task Force (&#8220;GHTF&#8221;) founding members (U.S., Canada, Australia, the European Union, and Japan) is required for medical device registration in Hong Kong. 

&#160; 

The Viveve System is currently classified in Hong Kong as a Class II device. 

&#160; 

Philippines 

&#160; 

The Viveve System is not regulated in the Philippines by the Department of Health. In December 2015, Viveve was notified by the Philippines Department of Health that the Viveve System was not required to register with the Philippines Department of Health and could be sold freely within the Philippines. 

&#160; 

Japan 

&#160; 

We currently import the Viveve System into Japan in accordance with the physician import license pathway which allows a medical device to be used and sold in Japan. The physician import license pathway permits a device to be sold in Japan provided that such device was specifically requested from a physician in Japan; however, we are not permitted to market the product directly in the country.

FDA&#8217;s Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements 

&#160; 

Unless an exemption applies, any medical device we wish to commercially distribute in the U.S. will require either prior 510(k) clearance or premarket approval from the FDA. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Devices deemed to pose lower risks are placed in either Class I or II, which requires the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a premarket notification requesting clearance to commercially distribute the device. This process is generally known as 510(k) clearance. In certain instances, devices that would otherwise be subject to premarket approval can be brought to market via de novo reclassification (which is described below). Some low risk devices are exempted from this requirement. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device, are placed in Class III, requiring premarket approval. Low to moderate risk devices that are dissimilar from existing Class I or II devices can be brought to market via de novo reclassification. 

&#160; 

In December 2008, we received 510(k) clearance on our device. Since then, we have made design modifications to the original 510(k) cleared device. In March 2015, we submitted a Special 510(k) to the FDA for the Viveve System to take into account the design modifications, which include improved user interface capabilities and enhanced manufacturability. 

&#160; 

510(k) Clearance Pathway 

&#160; 

When a 510(k) clearance is required, we must submit a premarket notification to the FDA demonstrating that our proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared and legally marketed 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of premarket approval applications (&#8220;PMA&#8221;). By regulation, the FDA is required to clear or deny a 510(k) premarket notification within 90 days of submission of the application. As a practical matter, clearance often takes significantly longer. The FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. If the FDA determines that the device, or its intended use, is not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared device or use, the FDA will issue a not-substantially equivalent letter and place the device, or the particular use, into Class II. 

&#160; 

Any modification to a 510(k)-cleared device that would constitute a major change in its intended use, or any change that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, requires a new 510(k) clearance and may even, in some circumstances, require a PMA, if the change raises complex or novel scientific issues or the product has a new intended use. The FDA requires every manufacturer to make the determination regarding the need for a new 510(k) submission in the first instance, but the FDA may review any manufacturer&#8217;s decision. If the FDA were to disagree with a manufacturer&#8217;s determination that changes did not require a new 510(k), it could require the manufacturer to cease marketing and distribution and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained and the manufacturer could be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. 

&#160; 

De Novo Process 

&#160; 

If there is no known predicate for a device (i.e., a legally marketed Class I or II device with comparable indications for use and technological characteristics), a company can request a de novo classification of the product. De novo generally applies where there is no predicate device and the FDA believes the device is sufficiently safe so that no PMA should be required. The FDA&#8217;s de novo process has been streamlined to allow a company to request that a new product classification be established based on information provided by the requesting company. This process, known as the direct de novo process, must be discussed and agreed upon by the FDA prior to submission. The direct de novo process allows a company to submit a reclassification petition which includes information that would be included in a 510(k) notice for the subject device in addition to providing the FDA with a risk-benefit analysis demonstrating that the device presents a moderate risk thereby not requiring a PMA. The submitter also must provide a draft Annual Control document for the product. The Annual Control document specifies the scope of the device type and the recommendations for submission of subsequent devices for the same intended use. If a product is classified as Class II through the direct de novo review process, then that device may serve as a predicate device for subsequent 510(k) pre-market notifications. We intend to market the Viveve System by utilizing the direct de novo process. However, we cannot predict when or if approval of such a petition will be obtained, or whether the FDA will create a new product code. In addition, failure to approve a de novo petition, or establishment of a new product code, could require us to seek a PMA for the Viveve System. Delays in receipt or failure to receive clearances or approvals could reduce our sales, profitability and future growth prospects. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Premarket Approval (&#8220;PMA&#8221;) Pathway 

&#160; 

A PMA must be submitted to the FDA if the device cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process. A PMA must be supported by extensive data, including but not limited to, technical, pre-clinical, clinical trials, manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. The Viveve System, including the radiofrequency generator, reusable handpiece and single-use treatment tip have not required premarket approval. During the review period, the FDA will typically request additional information or clarification of the information already provided. Also, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The FDA may or may not accept the panel&#8217;s recommendation. In addition, the FDA will generally conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the FDA&#8217;s quality system regulations (&#8220;QSRs&#8221;). 

&#160; 

New PMAs or PMA supplements are required for modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, including, for example, certain types of modifications to the device&#8217;s indication for use, manufacturing process, labeling and design. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel. There is no guarantee that the FDA will grant PMA approval of our future products, if one is required, and failure to obtain necessary approvals for our future products would adversely affect our ability to grow our business. Delays in receipt or failure to receive approvals could reduce our sales, profitability and future growth prospects. 

&#160; 

Clinical Trials 

&#160; 

Clinical trials are almost always required to support an FDA premarket application or de novo reclassification, and are sometimes required for 510(k) clearance. With respect to the Viveve System, the FDA has asked us to conduct a clinical study under an Investigational Device Exemption (&#8220;IDE&#8221;), to support a future product submission. In the U.S., these clinical trials generally require submission of an application for an IDE to the FDA. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specific number of patients unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements. Clinical trials for significant risk devices may not begin until the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the appropriate institutional review boards (&#8220;IRBs&#8221;), at the clinical trial sites. Our clinical trials must be conducted under the oversight of an IRB at the relevant clinical trial sites and in accordance with FDA regulations, including but not limited to those relating to good clinical practices. We are also required to obtain the patients&#8217; informed consent that complies with both FDA requirements and state and federal privacy regulations. We, the FDA or the IRB at each site at which a clinical trial is being performed may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the benefits. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the device, may be equivocal or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain clearance or approval of the product. Similarly, in Europe and other regions, clinical study protocols must be approved by the local ethics committee and in some cases, including studies with high-risk devices, by the Ministry of Health in the applicable country. 

&#160; 

In June 2012, we submitted a pre-IDE application and requested an in-person meeting with the FDA to solicit feedback in advance of filing an IDE to conduct a clinical study of the Viveve System to support regulatory submission. In August 2012, we met with the FDA and received feedback on our pre-clinical data, historical clinical data, and a clinical protocol for a prospective randomized controlled trial. We had a second meeting with the FDA on December 17, 2015 and received additional feedback on our clinical protocol design and indication for use. We plan to re-submit our IDE application in 2016. If approval of the IDE application is received, we intend to begin our U.S. clinical study. 

&#160; &#160;

&#160; 

Continuing Regulation 

&#160; 

After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include: 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#9679;

product listing and establishment registration, which helps facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory action;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#9679;

QSRs, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#9679;

labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or &#8220;off-label&#8221; uses;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#9679;

Medical Device Reporting (&#8220;MDR&#8221;), regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if its device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#9679; 

post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device; and 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679;

regulations pertaining to voluntary recalls and notices of corrections or removals.

&#160; 

The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. We and our third-party manufacturers are subject to announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA and the Food and Drug Branch of the California Department of Health Services (&#8220;CDHS&#8221;), to determine compliance with the QSR and other regulations. In the past, our facility has been inspected, and observations were noted, including an April 2012 CDHS inspection that cited deficiencies related to signature authority of inspection documentation, incomplete corrective action responses, and labeling indicating that our product contained no latex without proper objective evidence. The FDA and CDHS have accepted our responses to these observations, and we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the QSR. 

&#160; 

Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following actions: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

repair, replacement, refunds, recall or seizure of our products; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

refusing our requests for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products or new intended uses; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

refusing to grant export approval for our product; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

withdrawing 510(k) clearance or premarket approvals that are already granted; and 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

criminal prosecution. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

If any of these events were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

&#160; 

We are also subject to a wide range of federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those related to the environment, health and safety, land use and quality assurance. We believe that compliance with these laws and regulations as currently in effect will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive and financial position. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The medical device industry is characterized by intense competition and rapid innovation. While we believe that our solution to treat vaginal laxity is unique and offers a more effective solution from that which is on the market currently, the market for the treatment of vaginal laxity and related decreases in women&#8217;s sexual function remains a tremendous, under-developed opportunity. Therefore, competition is expected to increase, particularly as the market becomes more developed with further solutions. Aside from Kegel exercises and invasive surgical procedures, such as LVR, there are many companies developing energy-based technologies for vaginal rejuvenation as well as others developing drug therapies and therapeutics for the treatment of various types of female sexual dysfunction. Further, the overall size and attractiveness of the market may compel larger companies focused in the OB/GYN, aesthetic or women&#8217;s health markets, and with much greater capital and other resources, to pursue development of or acquire technologies that may address these areas. Potential competitors include, but are not limited to Cynosure, Syneron Medical, Fotona, Thermi Aesthetics (acquired by Almirall, S.A.), Cutera, Apricus, and others. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of March 15, 2016, we had 21 full-time employees and we retain the services of several qualified consultants. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel. None of our employees is represented by a labor union, and we believe that our employee relations are good.
