 Item 1. Business. 

For over 30 years, Electronic Systems Technology, Inc. (&#147;EST&#148;, &#147;us&#148;, &#147;we&#148;, or the &#147;Company&#148;) has specialized in the development and manufacturing of digital data (non-voice) radio transceivers for use in industrial wireless networking applications. With reliance on wireless communication in the modern world, the global modernization of industrial control systems now require the benefits gained by use of wireless technology. EST designs and produces these specialized, hardened products to operate and survive in these difficult conditions. 

The Company designs, develops, manufactures and markets the ESTeem&#174; line of industrial wireless products and accessories. The Company&#146;s products provide innovative communication solutions for applications not served or underutilized by conventional, commercial grade communication systems. The Company&#146;s products are part of the ESTeem&#174; Industrial Wireless Solutions for commercial, industrial, and government arenas both domestically and internationally. The Company&#146;s products are marketed through direct sales, sales representatives, and resellers. 

The Company was incorporated in the State of Washington in February 1984, and was granted a United States Patent for the &#147;Wireless Computer Modem&#148; in May 1987, and Canadian patent in October 1988. The Company established a &#34;doing business as&#34; or &#34;DBA&#34; structure, based on the Company's registered trade name of ESTeem&#174; Wireless Modems in 2007. The Company continues to provide product improvements and enhancements to incorporate continuing technological developments, in response to customer needs and market opportunities. New opportunities may arise from changes in FCC regulations or technological developments, both of these are reviewed by management to identify both marketability and profitability.

Development efforts during 2015 were focused primarily on our new ESTeem&#174; Horizon Series. These next generation industrial wireless products will improve our networking capability with higher data rates, improved support features and updates to the latest wireless standards. The ESTeem&#174; Horizon Series will expand our market opportunities and be available for sale in 2016. 

In an effort to maintain and expand our customer base in the industrial control marketplace, we team with major automation hardware vendors such as Rockwell Automation. 2015 marks the 24 th anniversary of our relationship with Rockwell Automation through their Encompass Program. Rockwell Automation has the largest market share in the United States and is a major entity in the world wide automation and controls market place. The benefit of the Encompass program and similar partnering efforts is increased exposure to markets that would not otherwise be cost effective to have a direct marketing channel presence in.

PRODUCTS AND MARKETS

The Company&#146;s ESTeem&#174; industrial wireless products provide communication links between computer networks, network enabled devices and mobile devices without cables. The widespread use of networked computer systems in business, industry and public service and the adoption of mobile devices in all aspects of modern life has created an environment where the wireless network is no longer a convenience but a necessity. As wireless networking proliferates through the modernization of the industrial sector the need for products such as the ESTeem&#174; industrial wireless (specifically designed for rigors of operation in the industrial environment) will be increased dramatically. These wireless networks will be the backbone connections to the Internet for cloud based services such as the upcoming Internet of Things (&#147;IoT&#148;) and Industrial Internet of Things (&#147;IIoT&#148;).

All of the ESTeem&#174; models come with industry standard Ethernet (Internet) communications ports and legacy serial ports to provide the broadest range of connections for both new and legacy hardware. The combined features such as self-healing repeaters, Mesh networking, long range operation and outdoor weatherproof cases make the ESTeem&#174; products unique in our market space.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND NEW PRODUCTS

The Company&#146;s products compete in an environment of rapidly changing technology. This environment results in the necessity of the Company to be continually updating and enhancing existing products, as well as developing new products in order to remain competitive. Research and Development expenditures for new product development and improvements of existing products by the Company for 2015 and 2014 were $277,126 and $286,375. None of the Company&#146;s research and development expenses were paid directly by any of the Company&#146;s customers. During 2015, the Company contracted and will continue to contract with companies to provide software development and hardware design engineering expertise when required. 

Development efforts during 2015 were focused primarily on the ESTeem&#174; Horizon Series products due to obsolescence of components. The redesigned products will operate at higher speeds and increase data throughput. The Company plans continued research and development expenditures for development and improvement projects, as they are deemed necessary. 

MARKETING, CUSTOMERS AND SUPPORT

The majority of the Company&#146;s products sold during 2015 were through the reselling efforts of non-exclusive, non-stocking distributors and resellers of the Company&#146;s products, with the remainder of the Company&#146;s sales distributed directly from the Company&#146;s facility through direct sales to end-users of the ESTeem&#174; products. Customers generally place orders on an &#34;as needed basis&#34;. Shipping of products is generally completed 1 to 15 working days after receipt of a customer order, with the exception of ongoing, scheduled projects, and custom designed equipment for specific customer applications. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had a sales order backlog of $68,330.

During 2015, the Company continued advertising in trade publications specifically targeting industrial automation systems. There are approximately twenty major automation hardware manufacturers worldwide. The Company has maintained active attendance at tradeshows targeted toward the customers and markets in which it sells products. During 2015, the Company employed sales managers and product support personal to concentrate marketing efforts in both domestic and Latin American industrial automation markets. During 2016, the Company intends to continue targeting domestic and foreign industrial automation markets. The Company maintains an internet web site to provide access to product and technical information for both present and potential customers of the Company&#146;s products. Due to existing reseller relationships, the Company has not implemented an electronic commerce internet website. The Company provides technical support and service for ESTeem&#174; products through phone support, field technicians and internet sources. The Company believes high quality customer support is necessary and vital to differentiate ourselves in the industrial wireless modem market. To maintain a high level of customer support the Company has in the past, and will continue in the future, to make investments and expenditures in support of its customer service programs. 

During the year ended December 31, 2015, no one customer&#146;s sales accounted 10% or more of total sales revenues. See &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#148;, and &#147;Financial Statements&#148;.

COMPETITION

The Company&#146;s competition varies according to the market in which the Company's products are competing. All of the markets in which the Company&#146;s products are sold are highly competitive. Listed below are the markets in which the Company&#146;s products compete and major competitors in those markets:

Major Market

Major Competitors

Industrial Automation

FreeWave Technologies, GE/Microwave Data Systems, Prosoft Technology and Cal Amp.

&#160;

Computer networking, inter and intra building, and remote internet access.

Management believes the ESTeem&#174; products compete favorably in the market because of product choices, performance, price, and adaptability of the products to a wide range of applications. The Company's major limitation in competing with other manufacturers is its limited marketing budget, which currently limits the Company&#146;s nationwide advertising and sales force presence.

PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION

EST was granted a United States patent in 1987 for a &#34;Wireless Computer Modem&#34;. In 1988, EST was granted a Canadian patent for a &#34;Wireless Computer Modem&#34;. Both patents had lives of 17 years and have expired. The Company&#146;s rights to the ESTeem&#174; Wireless Modem trademark, in uninterrupted use by the Company since 1985, were renewed in 2014. To protect the Company against unauthorized disclosure of proprietary information belonging to the Company, all employees, dealers, distributors, original equipment manufacturers, sales representatives and other persons having access to confidential information regarding Company products or technology are bound by non-disclosure agreements.

On September 15, 2009, Wi-LAN, Inc, an Ontario, Canada Company (TSX: WIN)(&#147;Wi-LAN&#148;) notified the Company of alleged patent infringement. On November 17, 2009, we entered into a Licensing Agreement with Wi-LAN. Subject to confidentiality provisions, the agreement requires us to pay royalties and in return we are granted certain licensing rights and liability releases. The allegations by Wi-LAN relate to amendments to Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standard 802.11 wireless architecture, adopted in 1997. Approximately half of the Company&#146;s current products are subject to the alleged patent infringements from Wi-LAN. The cost of the licensing agreement to the Company is considered by Management to be insignificant.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

For operation in the United States, the ESTeem&#174; industrial wireless products require FCC type acceptance. The FCC type acceptance is granted for devices, which demonstrate operation within mandated and tested performance criteria. All of the Company&#146;s products requiring FCC type acceptance have been granted such acceptance. All of the Company&#146;s current ESTeem&#174; production models have also been granted type acceptance in Canada. 

The ESTeem&#174; industrial wireless products that operate in the FCC licensed frequency band require licensing under Part 90 of the FCC Rules and Regulations, which must be applied for by the end user of the Company&#146;s products. The Company cannot guarantee customers will receive FCC licenses in the frequency spectrum for any particular application. The Company provides information to customers to assist in the application for FCC consumer licenses. The ESTeem&#174; 195Ea, 195Eg, 195Es and 195Ed products operate in the non-licensed, 900 MHz, 2.4GHz, and 5.8 GHz spread spectrum frequency bands, respectively, which do not require licenses for users of those products.

At the time of this filing the Company is unaware of any existing or proposed FCC regulation that would have a materially adverse effect on the Company&#146;s operations, but there can be no assurance that future FCC regulations will not have materially adverse effects on the operations of the Company.

SOURCE OF SUPPLY AND MANUFACTURING

The Company purchases certain components necessary for the production of the ESTeem&#174; products from sole suppliers. Components including those manufactured by Hitachi, Motorola Corporation, Mitsubishi, Murata Corporation, Rakon, Toko America Inc. and Triquint, as purchased through a number of distributors, supply key components for the Company&#146;s products. The components provided by these and other companies could be replaced or substituted by other products, if it became necessary to do so. If this action occurred, a material interruption of production and material cost expenditures could take place during the process of locating and qualifying replacement components. 

Approximately 10% of the Company&#146;s inventory at December 31, 2015 consisted of parts having lead times ranging from 12 to 30 weeks. Some parts are maintained at high levels to assure availability to meet production requirements, and accordingly, account for a significant portion of the Company&#146;s inventory value. Based on past experience with component availability, distributor relationships, and inventory levels, the Company does not foresee shortages of materials used in production. However, developments in the electronic component marketplace, involving components used by the Company which are also used in cellular phones, personal technology devices and other technology devices, have the potential of creating negative availability and delivery issues for components used by the Company. The Company has been able to procure parts on a timely basis as of the date of this report, however procurement cannot be guaranteed in the future. If shortages were to occur, material interruption of production and product delivery to customers could occur. 

The Company contracts with multiple companies, for manufacturing of sub-assemblies and some engineering assistance services for the Company&#146;s products. Materials are provided by the Company. By contracting with these companies, the Company is able to avoid staff fluctuations associated with operating its own manufacturing operation and reduced capital investments in specialized manufacturing equipment. Management reviews the costs for the services provided by these companies and regularly submits Requests for Quotes (RFQ) to multiple suppliers of these operations. See &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#148;, and &#147;Financial Statements&#148;.
