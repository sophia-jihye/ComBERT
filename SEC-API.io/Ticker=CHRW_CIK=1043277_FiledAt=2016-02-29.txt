 ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS 

Overview 

C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (&#8220;C.H. Robinson,&#8221; &#8220;the company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221;) is one of the largest third party logistics companies in the world with 2015 &#32;consolidated total revenues of $ 13.5 billion . We are a service company. We provide freight transportation services and logistics solutions to companies of all sizes, in a wide variety of industries. During 2015 , we handled approximately 16.9 million shipments and worked with more than 110,000 &#32;active customers. We operate through a network of offices in North America, Europe, Asia, and South America. We have developed global transportation and distribution networks to provide transportation and supply chain services worldwide. As a result, we have the capability of facilitating most aspects of the supply chain on behalf of our customers. 

As a third party logistics provider, we enter into contractual relationships with a wide variety of transportation companies, and utilize those relationships to efficiently and cost-effectively transport our customers&#8217; freight. We have contractual relationships with approximately 68,000 &#32;transportation companies, including motor carriers, railroads (primarily intermodal service providers), and air freight and ocean carriers. Depending on the needs of our customer and their supply chain requirements, we select and hire the appropriate transportation for each shipment. Our model enables us to be flexible, provide solutions that optimize service for our customers, and minimize our asset utilization risk. As an integral part of our transportation services, we provide a wide range of value-added logistics services, such as freight consolidation, supply chain consulting and analysis, optimization, and reporting. 

In addition to transportation, we provide sourcing services (&#8220;Sourcing&#8221;) under the brand name Robinson Fresh (&#8220;Robinson Fresh&#8221;). Our Sourcing business is primarily the buying, selling, and/or marketing of fresh fruits, vegetables, and other value-added perishable items. It was our original business when we were founded in 1905. The foundation for much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling produce and temperature controlled commodities. We supply fresh produce through our network of independent produce growers and suppliers. Our customers include grocery retailers, restaurants, foodservice distributors, and produce wholesalers. In many cases, we also arrange the logistics and transportation of the products we sell and provide related supply chain services, such as replenishment, category management, and managed procurement services. We have developed proprietary brands of produce and have exclusive licensing agreements to distribute fresh, value-added produce under recognized consumer brand names. The produce for these brands is sourced through our preferred grower network and packed to order through contract packing agreements. We have instituted quality assurance and monitoring procedures with each of these preferred growers. 

Our flexible business model has been the main driver of our historical results and has positioned us for continued growth. One of our competitive advantages is our network of offices. Our employees are in close proximity to both customers and transportation providers, which gives them broad knowledge of their local markets and enables them to respond quickly to customers&#8217; and transportation providers&#8217; changing needs. Employees act as a team in their sales efforts, customer service, and operations. A significant portion of most employees&#8217; compensation is performance-oriented, based on the profitability and their contributions to the success of the company. We believe this makes our employees more service-oriented and focused on driving growth and maximizing office productivity. 

Our network offices work together to complete transactions and collectively meet the needs of our customers. For large, multi-location customers, we often coordinate our efforts in Global Account Centers or in one office and rely on multiple locations to deliver specific geographic or modal needs. As an example, approximately 49 percent &#32;of our truckload shipments are shared transactions between offices. The majority of our global network operates on a common technology platform that is used to match customer needs with supplier capabilities, to collaborate with other offices, and to utilize centralized support resources to complete all facets of the transaction. 

Historically, we have grown primarily through internal growth, by increasing market share through the addition of new customers and expanding relationships with our current customers, adding new services, expanding our market presence and operations globally, and hiring additional employees. We have augmented our growth through selective acquisitions. In January 2015, we completed our acquisition of Freightquote.com, Inc. (&#8220;Freightquote&#8221;), a privately held freight broker based in Kansas City, Missouri. Freightquote provides services throughout North America. The acquisition enhances and brings synergies to our less-than-truckload and truckload businesses, and expands our eCommerce capabilities. 

&#160; 

Our net revenues are our total revenues less purchased transportation and related services, including contracted motor carrier, rail, ocean, air, and other costs, and the purchase price and services related to the products we sell. Our net revenues are the primary indicator of our ability to source, add value, and sell services and products that are provided by third parties, and we consider them to be our primary performance measurement. Accordingly, the discussion of our results of operations focuses on the changes in our net revenues. 

Transportation and Logistics Services 

C.H. Robinson provides freight transportation and related logistics and supply chain services. Our services range from commitments on a specific shipment to much more comprehensive and integrated relationships. We execute these service commitments by hiring and training people, developing proprietary systems and processes, and utilizing our network of contracted transportation providers, including, but not limited to, contract motor carriers, railroads, air freight, and ocean carriers. We make a profit on the difference between what we charge to our customers for the totality of services provided to them and what we pay to the transportation providers to handle or transport the freight. While industry definitions vary, given our extensive contracting to create a flexible network of solutions, we are generally referred to in the industry as a third party logistics company. 

We provide all of the following transportation and logistics services: 

&#8226; 

Truckload-Through our contracts with motor carriers, we have access to dry vans, temperature controlled vans, flatbeds, and bulk capacity. We also offer time-definite and expedited truck transportation. 

&#8226; 

Less Than Truckload (&#8220;LTL&#8221;)-LTL transportation involves the shipment of single or multiple pallets of freight. We focus on shipments of a single pallet or larger, although we handle any size shipment. Through our contracts with motor carriers and our operating system, we consolidate freight and freight information to provide our customers with a single source of information on their freight. In many instances, we will consolidate partial shipments for several customers into full truckloads. 

&#8226; 

Intermodal-Our intermodal transportation service is the shipment of freight in trailers or containers by a combination of truck and rail. We have intermodal marketing agreements with container owners and all Class 1 railroads in North America, and we arrange local pickup and delivery (known as drayage) through local contracted motor carriers. In addition, we own approximately 1,000 intermodal containers. 

&#8226; 

Ocean-As a non-vessel ocean common carrier (&#8220;NVOCC&#8221;) or freight forwarder, we consolidate shipments, determine routing, select ocean carriers, contract for ocean shipments, and provide for local pickup and delivery of shipments. 

&#8226; 

Air-As a certified indirect air carrier (&#8220;Indirect Air Carrier&#8221;) or freight forwarder, we organize air shipments and provide door-to-door service. 

&#8226; 

Customs-Our customs brokers are licensed and regulated by U.S. Customs and Border Protection to assist importers and exporters in meeting federal requirements governing imports and exports. 

&#8226; 

Other Logistics Services-We provide fee-based managed services, warehousing services, small parcel, and other services. 

Customers communicate their freight needs, typically on a shipment-by-shipment basis, to the C.H. Robinson team responsible for their account. The team ensures that all appropriate information about each shipment is available in our proprietary operating system. This information is entered by our employees, by the customer through our web tools, or received electronically from the customers&#8217; systems. With the help of information provided by our operating system, employees then select a contracted carrier or carriers, based upon his or her knowledge of the carrier&#8217;s service capability, equipment availability, freight rates, and other relevant factors. Based on the information he or she has about the market and rates, the employee may either determine an appropriate price at that point or wait to communicate with a contracted carrier directly before setting a price. In many cases, employees from different offices within our network collaborate to hire the appropriate contracted carrier for our customers&#8217; freight, and the offices agree to an internal profit split. 

Once the contracted carrier is selected, the employee communicates with the contract carrier to agree on the cost for the transportation and the contract carrier&#8217;s commitment to provide the transportation. We are in contact with the contract carrier through numerous means of communication to meet our customers&#8217; requirements as well as track the status of the shipment from origin to delivery. 

&#160; 

For most of our transportation and logistics services, we are a service provider. By accepting the customer&#8217;s order, we accept certain responsibilities for transportation of the shipment from origin to destination. The carrier&#8217;s contract is with us, not the customer, and we are responsible for prompt payment of freight charges. In the cases where we have agreed (either contractually or otherwise) to pay for claims for damage to freight while in transit, we pursue reimbursement from the contracted carrier for the claims. In our managed services business, we are acting as the shipper&#8217;s agent. In those cases, the carrier&#8217;s contract is typically with the customer, and we collect a fee for our services. 

As a result of our logistics capabilities, some of our customers have us handle all, or a substantial portion, of their freight transportation requirements. Our employees price our services to provide a profit to us for the totality of services performed for the customer. In some cases, our services to the customer are priced on a spot market, or transactional, basis. In a number of instances, we have contracts with the customer in which we agree to handle an estimated number of shipments, usually to specified destinations, such as from the customer&#8217;s plant to a distribution center. Our commitments to handle the shipments are usually at pre-determined rates. Most of our rate commitments are for one year or less and allow for renegotiation. As is typical in the transportation industry, most of these contracts do not include specific volume commitments. When we enter into prearranged rate agreements for truckload services with our customers, we usually have fuel surcharge agreements, in addition to the underlying line-haul portion of the rate. 

We purchase the majority of our truckload services from our contract truckload carriers on a spot market or transactional basis, even when we are working with the customer on a contractual basis. When we enter into spot transactions with contract motor carriers, we generally negotiate a mutually agreed-upon total market rate that includes all costs, including any applicable fuel expense. However, if requested by the contract carrier, we will estimate and report fuel separately. In a small number of cases, we may get advance commitments from one or more contract carriers to transport contracted shipments for the length of our customer contract. In those cases, where we have prearranged rates with contract carriers, there is a calculated fuel surcharge based on a mutually agreed-upon formula. 

In the course of providing day-to-day transportation services, our employees often identify opportunities for additional logistics services as they become more familiar with our customers&#8217; daily operations and the nuances of our customers&#8217; supply chains. We offer a wide range of logistics services on a worldwide basis that reduce or eliminate supply chain inefficiencies. We will analyze the customers&#8217; current transportation rate structures, modes of shipping, and carrier selection. We can identify opportunities to consolidate shipments for cost savings. We will suggest ways to improve operating and shipping procedures and manage claims. We can help customers minimize storage through crossdocking and other flow-through operations. Many of these services are bundled with underlying transportation services and are not typically priced separately. They are usually included as a part of the cost of transportation services provided by us, based on the nature of the customer relationship. In addition to these transportation services, we may provide additional logistics services, such as contract warehousing, consulting, transportation management, and other services, for which we are usually paid separately. 

As we have emphasized integrated logistics solutions, our relationships with many customers have broadened, and we have become a key provider to them by managing a greater portion of their supply chains. We may serve our customers through specially created teams and through several locations. Our transportation services are provided to numerous international customers through our worldwide network. See Note 1 to our 2015 &#32;consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for an allocation of our total revenues from domestic and foreign customers for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 &#32;and our long-lived assets as of December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 &#32;in the United States and in foreign locations.

(1) We previously reported revenues from the fees we earn from our cash advance option offered to our contract carriers separately from Transportation revenues. Starting in the first quarter of 2015, on a retrospective basis, we are reporting these payment services revenues as a part of Transportation total and net revenues. 

Transportation services accounted for approximately 95 percent of net revenues in 2015, 94 percent of our net revenues in 2014, and 93 percent in 2013. The increase in LTL in 2015 was primarily due to the acquisition of Freightquote on January 1, 2015. The increases in ocean, air, and customs revenues in 2012 and 2013 were primarily related to our acquisition of Phoenix International Freight Services, Ltd., (&#8220;Phoenix&#8221;), on November 1, 2012. For additional information, see Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of Part II of this report. 

Sourcing 

Since we were founded in 1905, we have been in the business of sourcing fresh produce. Much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling produce and other perishable commodities. Because of its perishable nature, produce must be rapidly packaged, carefully transported within tight timetables, usually in temperature controlled equipment, and quickly distributed to replenish high-turnover inventories maintained by grocery retailers, restaurants, foodservice distributors, and produce wholesalers. In many instances, we consolidate individual customers&#8217; produce orders into truckload quantities at the point of origin and arrange for transportation of the truckloads, often to multiple destinations. 

Our Sourcing customer base includes grocery retailers and restaurants, produce wholesalers, and foodservice distributors. 

Our Sourcing services have expanded to include forecasting and replenishment, brand management, and category development services. We have various national and regional branded produce programs, including both proprietary brands and national licensed brands. These programs contain a wide variety of high quality, fresh bulk, and value added fruits and vegetables. These brands have expanded our market presence and relationships with many of our retail customers. We have also instituted quality assurance and monitoring programs as part of our branded and preferred grower programs. 

Sourcing accounted for approximately five percent of our net revenues in 2015, six percent of our net revenues in 2014, and seven percent of our net revenues in 2013. &#160; 

Organization 

Office Network. &#32;To keep us close to our customers and markets, we operate through a network of offices in North America, Europe, Asia, and South America. In 2015, we derived approximately 90 percent &#32;of our total revenues from customers in the United States. 

Each office is responsible for its own growth and profitability. Our employees are responsible for developing new business, negotiating and pricing services, receiving and processing service requests from customers, and negotiating with carriers to provide the transportation requested. In addition to routine transportation, employees are often called upon to handle customers&#8217; unusual, seasonal, and emergency needs. Shipments to be transported by truck are priced at the local level, and offices cooperate with each other to hire contract carriers to provide transportation. Employees often rely on expertise in other offices when contracting LTL, intermodal, ocean, and air shipments. Multiple network offices often also work together to service larger, global accounts where the expertise and resources of more than one office are required to meet the customer&#8217;s needs. Their efforts are usually coordinated by one &#8220;lead&#8221; office on the account. 

&#160; 

Employees both sell to and service their customers. Sales opportunities are identified through our internal database, referrals from current customers, leads generated by people through knowledge of their local and regional markets, and company marketing efforts. Employees are also responsible for recruiting new over the road contract carriers, who are referred to our centralized carrier services group to confirm they are properly licensed and insured and have acceptable Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (&#8220;FMCSA&#8221;) issued safety ratings. 

Network Employees. &#32;Each office is responsible for its hiring and headcount decisions, based on the needs of their office and to balance personnel resources with business requirements. Because the quality of our employees is essential to our success, we are highly selective in our recruiting and hiring. To support our hiring processes, we have a corporate recruiting group that develops a pipeline of qualified candidates that managers can draw from. Our applicants typically have college degrees, and some have business experience, although not necessarily within the transportation industry. 

Early in their tenure, most newly-hired employees go through centralized training that emphasizes development of the skills necessary to become productive members of a team, including technology training on our proprietary systems and our customer service philosophy. Centralized training is followed by ongoing, on-the-job training. We expect most new employees to start contributing in a matter of weeks. 

Employees operate and are compensated in large part on a team basis. The team structure is motivated by our performance-based compensation system, in which a significant portion of the cash compensation of most network office managers and many other employees is dependent on the profitability of their particular office. They are paid a performance-based bonus, which is a portion of the office&#8217;s earnings for that calendar year. The percentage they can potentially earn is predetermined in an annual bonus contract and is based on their productivity and contributions to the overall success of the office. Within our 401(k) plan, employees can also receive profit sharing contributions that depend on our overall profitability and other factors. 

All of our managers and certain other employees who have significant responsibilities are eligible to receive equity awards because we believe these awards are an effective tool for creating long-term ownership and alignment between employees and our shareholders. Generally, these awards are eligible to vest over five-year periods and may also include financial performance-based requirements for management employees. 

Employees benefit both through the growth and profitability of individual offices and by achieving individual goals. They are motivated by the opportunity to advance in a variety of career paths, including management, corporate sales, and customer and carrier account management. We have a &#8220;promote from within&#8221; philosophy and fill nearly all management positions with current employees. 

Shared Services. Our network offices are supported by our shared and centralized services. Approximately ten percent of our employees provide shared services in centralized centers. Approximately 44 percent of these shared services employees are information technology personnel who develop and maintain our proprietary operating system software and our wide area network.

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had a total of 13,159 &#32;employees, 11,800 of whom were located in our network offices. Our remaining employees centrally serve our network of offices in areas such as finance, information technology, legal, marketing, and human resources. 

Customer Relationships 

We work to establish long-term relationships with our customers and to increase the amount of business done with each customer by providing them with a full range of logistics services. During 2015 , we served over 110,000 &#32;active customers worldwide, ranging from Fortune 100 companies to small businesses in a wide variety of industries. 

During 2015 , our largest customer accounted for approximately two &#32;percent of total revenues. In recent years, we have grown by adding new customers and by increasing our volumes with, and providing more services to, our existing customers. 

We seek additional business from existing customers and pursue new customers based on our knowledge of the marketplace and the range of logistics services that we can provide. We believe that our account management disciplines and decentralized structure enable our employees to better serve our customers by combining a broad knowledge of logistics and market conditions with a deep understanding of the specific supply chain issues facing individual customers and certain vertical industries. With the guidance of our executive and shared services teams, offices are given significant latitude to pursue opportunities and to commit our resources to serve our customers. 

In 2015, we continued to expand our corporate sales, account management, and marketing support to enhance sales capabilities. The network also calls on our executives and our corporate sales staff to support them in the pursuit of new business with companies that have more complex logistics requirements. 

Relationships with Transportation Providers 

We continually work on establishing contractual relationships with qualified transportation providers that also meet our service requirements to provide dependable services, favorable pricing, and contract carrier availability during periods when demand for transportation equipment is greater than the supply. Because we own very little transportation equipment and do not employ the people directly involved with the delivery of our customers&#8217; freight, these relationships are critical to our success. 

In 2015 , we worked with approximately 68,000 &#32;transportation providers worldwide, of which the vast majority are contracted motor carriers. To strengthen and maintain our relationships with motor carriers, our employees regularly communicate with carriers and try to assist them by increasing their equipment utilization, reducing their empty miles, and repositioning their equipment. To make it easier for contract carriers to work with us, we have a policy of payment upon receipt of proof of delivery. For those contract carriers who would like a faster payment, we also offer payment within 48 hours of receipt of proof of delivery in exchange for a discount, along with offering in-trip cash advances. 

Contracted motor carriers provide access to dry vans, temperature controlled vans, and flatbeds. These contract carriers are of all sizes, including owner-operators of a single truck, small and midsize fleets, private fleets, and the largest national trucking companies. Consequently, we are not dependent on any one contract carrier. Our largest truck transportation provider was less than two &#32;percent of our total cost of transportation in 2015 . Motor carriers that had fewer than 100 tractors transported approximately 83 &#32;percent of our truckload shipments in 2015 . Every motor carrier with which we do business is required to execute a contract that establishes that the carrier is acting as an independent contractor. At the time the contract is executed, and daily, through subscriptions with a third party service, we confirm that each motor carrier is properly licensed and insured, 

&#160; 

has the necessary federally-issued authority to provide transportation services, and has the ability to provide the necessary level of service on a dependable basis. Our motor carrier contracts require that the motor carrier issue invoices only to and accept payment solely from us for the shipments that they transport under their contract with us, and allow us to withhold payment to satisfy previous claims or shortages. Our standard contracts do not include volume commitments, and the initial contract rate is modified each time we confirm an individual shipment with a carrier. 

We also have intermodal marketing agreements with container owners and all Class 1 railroads in North America, giving us access to additional trailers and containers. Our contracts with railroads specify the transportation services and payment terms by which our intermodal shipments are transported by rail. Intermodal transportation rates are typically negotiated between us and the railroad on a customer-specific basis. We own approximately 1,000 53-foot containers. We believe that these containers have helped us better serve our customers, and we will continue to analyze the strategy of controlling containers. 

In our NVOCC ocean transportation business, we have contracts with most of the major ocean carriers, which support a variety of service and rate needs for our customers. We negotiate annual contracts that establish the predetermined rates we agree to pay the ocean carriers. The rates are negotiated based on expected volumes from our customers in specific trade lanes. These contracts are often amended throughout the year to reflect changes in market conditions for our business, such as additional trade lanes. 

We operate both as a consolidator and as a transactional Indirect Air Carrier (&#8220;IAC&#8221;) internationally and in North America. We select air carriers and provide for local pickup and delivery of shipments. We execute our air freight services through our relationships with air carriers, through charter services, block space agreements, capacity space agreements, and transactional spot market negotiations. Through charter services, we contract part or all of an airplane to meet customer requirements. Our block space agreements and capacity space agreements are contracts for a defined time period. The contracts include fixed allocations for predetermined flights at agreed upon rates that are reviewed periodically throughout the year. The transactional negotiations afford us the ability to capture excess capacity at prevailing market rates for a specific shipment. 

Competition 

The transportation services industry is highly competitive and fragmented. We compete against a large number of logistics companies, trucking companies, property freight brokers, carriers offering logistics services, NVOCCs, IACs, and freight forwarders. We also buy from and sell transportation services to companies that compete with us. 

In our Sourcing business, we compete with produce brokers, produce growers, produce marketing companies, produce wholesalers, and foodservice buying groups. We also buy from and sell produce to companies that compete with us. 

We often compete with respect to price, scope of services, or a combination thereof, but believe that our most significant competitive advantages are: 

&#8226; 

People-Smart, dedicated, empowered people act as an extension of our customers&#8217; teams to innovate and execute their supply chain strategies; 

&#8226; 

Process-Proven processes and solutions combine strategy with practical experience for customized action plans that succeed in the real world; 

&#8226; 

Technology-Navisphere &#174; , our proprietary technology, provides flexibility, global visibility, customized solutions, easy integration, broad connectivity, and advanced security; 

&#8226; 

Network-Our customers gain local presence, regional expertise, and multiple global logistics options from one of the world&#8217;s largest providers of logistics services; 

&#8226; 

Relationships-A large number of unique, strong relationships provide global connections and valuable market knowledge; 

&#8226; 

Portfolio of Services-A wide selection of services and products help provide our customers with consistent capacity and service levels; 

&#8226; 

Scale-Our customers leverage our industry-leading capacity, broad procurement options, and substantial shipment volumes for better efficiency, service, and marketplace advantages; and 

&#8226; 

Stability-Our financial strength, discipline, and consistent track record of success for strategic support of our customers&#8217; supply chains. 

&#160; 

Seasonality 

Historically, our operating results have been subject to seasonal trends. In recent years, including 2015 and 2014, operating income and earnings have been lower in the first quarter than in the other three quarters. However, this was not our experience in 2013. We believe this pattern has been the result of, or influenced by, numerous factors, including national holidays, weather patterns, consumer demand, economic conditions, and other similar and subtle forces. Although seasonal changes in the transportation industry have not had a significant impact on our cash flow or results of operations, we expect this trend to continue and we cannot guarantee that it will not adversely impact us in the future. 

Proprietary Information Technology and Intellectual Property 

Our information systems are essential to efficiently communicate, service our customers and contracted carriers, and manage our business. In 2015 , we executed approximately 16.9 &#32;million shipments for more than 110,000 &#32;active customers with more than 68,000 &#32;contract carriers. 

We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and nondisclosure and non-competition agreements to establish and protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology. Additionally, we have numerous registered trademarks, trade names, and logos in the United States and international locations. 

Our operations use Navisphere &#174; , a single platform that allows customers to communicate worldwide with every party in their supply chain across languages, currencies, and continents. Navisphere &#174; &#32;offers sophisticated business analytics to help improve supply chain performance and meet increasing customer demands. 

The CHRWTrucks &#174; &#32;web-based platform provides contracted carriers additional access to our systems. Contract carriers can access available freight, perform online check calls, keep track of receivables, and upload scanned documentation. Many of our carriers&#8217; favorite features from CHRWTrucks &#174; &#32;are also available through our CHRWTrucks &#174; &#32;mobile application available for Android and IOS mobile operating systems. 

Our systems help our employees service customer orders, select the optimal mode of transportation, build and consolidate shipments, and identify appropriate carriers, all based on customer-specific service parameters. Our systems provide our vast organization the necessary business intelligence to allow for near real time scorecards and necessary decision support in all areas of our business. 

Government Regulation 

Our operations may be regulated and licensed by various federal, state, and local transportation agencies in the United States and similar governmental agencies in foreign countries in which we operate. 

We are subject to licensing and regulation as a property freight broker and are licensed by the U.S. Department of Transportation (&#8220;DOT&#8221;) to arrange for the transportation of property by motor vehicle. The DOT prescribes qualifications for acting in this capacity, including certain surety bonding requirements. We are also subject to regulation by the Federal Maritime Commission as an ocean freight forwarder and a NVOCC and we maintain separate bonds and licenses for each. We operate as a Department of Homeland Security certified Indirect Air Carrier, providing air freight services, subject to commercial standards set forth by the International Air Transport Association and federal regulations issued by the Transportation Security Administration. We provide customs brokerage services as a customs broker under a license issued by the Bureau of U.S. Customs and Border Protection. We also have and maintain other licenses as required by law. 

Although Congress enacted legislation in 1994 that substantially preempts the authority of states to exercise economic regulation of motor carriers and brokers of freight, some intrastate shipments for which we arrange transportation may be subject to additional licensing, registration, or permit requirements. We generally contractually require and/or rely on the carrier transporting the shipment to ensure compliance with these types of requirements. We, along with the contracted carriers that we rely on in arranging transportation services for our customers, are also subject to a variety of federal and state safety and environmental regulations. Although compliance with the regulations governing licensees in these areas has not had a materially adverse effect on our operations or financial condition in the past, there can be no assurance that such regulations or changes thereto will not adversely impact our operations in the future. Violation of these regulations could also subject us to fines, as well as increased claims liability. 

We buy and sell fresh produce under licenses issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture as required by the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (&#8220;PACA&#8221;). Other sourcing and distribution activities may be subject to various federal and state food and drug statutes and regulations. 

&#160; 

We are subject to a variety of other U.S. and foreign laws and regulations including, but not limited to, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption statutes. 

Risk Management and Insurance 

We contractually require all motor carriers we work with to carry at least $750,000 in automobile liability insurance and $25,000 in cargo insurance. We also require all motor carriers to maintain workers compensation and other insurance coverage as required by law. Many carriers have insurance exceeding these minimum requirements. Railroads, which are generally self-insured, provide limited common carrier liability protection, generally up to $250,000 per shipment. 

As a property freight broker, we are not legally liable for damage to our customers&#8217; cargo. In our customer contracts, we may agree to assume cargo liability up to a stated maximum. We typically do not assume cargo liability to our customers above minimum industry standards in our international freight forwarding, ocean transportation, air freight businesses on international shipments, and domestic air shipments. With regards to international freight forwarding, ocean transportation, international and domestic air freight shipments, and shipments transacted by Freightquote, we offer our customers the option to purchase shippers interest coverage to insure goods in transit. When we agree to store goods for our customers for longer terms, we provide limited warehouseman&#8217;s coverage to our customers and typically contract for warehousing services from companies that provide us the same degree of coverage. 

We maintain a broad cargo liability insurance policy to help protect us against catastrophic losses that may not be recovered from the responsible contracted carrier. We also carry various liability insurance policies, including automobile and general liability, with a $200 million umbrella. Our contingent automobile liability coverage has a retention of $5 million per incident. 

As a seller of produce, we may, under certain circumstances, have legal responsibility arising from produce sales. We carry product liability coverage under our general liability and umbrella policies to cover tort claims. The deductible on our general liability coverage is $250,000 per incident. In addition, in the event of a recall, we may be required to bear the costs of repurchasing, transporting, and destroying any allegedly contaminated product, as well as potential consequential damages which were generally not insured. Beginning in 2012, we carry product recall insurance coverage of $50 million. This policy has a retention of $5 million per incident.
