Overview 

&#160; 

We are focused on solving the challenging problems inherent in biological sample preparation, a crucial laboratory step performed by scientists worldwide working in biological life sciences research. Sample preparation is a term that refers to a wide range of activities that precede most forms of scientific analysis. Sample preparation is often complex, time-consuming and, in our belief, one of the most error-prone steps of scientific research. It is a widely-used laboratory undertaking &#8211; the requirements of which drive what we believe is a large and growing worldwide market. We have developed and patented a novel, enabling technology platform that can control the sample preparation process. It is based on harnessing the unique properties of high hydrostatic pressure. This process, called pressure cycling technology, or PCT, uses alternating cycles of hydrostatic pressure between ambient and ultra-high levels i.e., 35,000 pounds per square inch (&#8220; psi &#8221;) or greater to safely, conveniently and reproducibly control the actions of molecules in biological samples, such as cells and tissues from human, animal, plant and microbial sources. 

&#160; 

Our pressure cycling technology uses internally developed instrumentation that is capable of cycling pressure between ambient and ultra-high levels at controlled temperatures and specific time intervals, to rapidly and repeatedly control the interactions of bio-molecules, such as deoxyribonucleic acid (&#8220; DNA &#8221;), ribonucleic acid (&#8220; RNA &#8221;), proteins, lipids and small molecules. Our laboratory instrument, the Barocycler &#174; , and our internally developed consumables product line, which include our Pressure Used to Lyse Samples for Extraction (&#8220; PULSE &#8221;) tubes, and other processing tubes, and application specific kits such as consumable products and reagents, together make up our PCT Sample Preparation System (&#8220; PCT SPS &#8221;). 

&#160; 

We hold 14 United States and 10 foreign patents covering multiple applications of PCT in the life sciences field. Our pressure cycling technology employs a unique approach that we believe has the potential for broad use in a number of established and emerging life sciences areas, which include: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; biological sample preparation &#8211; including but not limited to sample extraction, homogenization, and digestion - in such study areas as genomic, proteomic, lipidomic, metabolomic and small molecule; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; pathogen inactivation; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; protein purification; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; control of chemical reactions, particularly enzymatic; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; immunodiagnostics. &#160; 

We are also the exclusive distributor throughout all of the Americas for the Constant Systems cell disruption equipment, parts, and consumables. Constant Systems, Ltd. (&#8220;CS&#8221;), a British company located about 90 minutes northwest of London, England, has been providing niche biomedical equipment, related consumable products, and services to a global client base since 1989. CS designs, develops, and manufactures high pressure cell disruption equipment required by life sciences laboratories worldwide, particularly disruption systems for the extraction of proteins. The CS equipment provides a constant and controlled cell disruptive environment, giving the user superior, constant, and reproducible results whatever the application. CS has over 900 units installed in over 40 countries worldwide. The CS cell disruption equipment has proven performance in the extraction of cellular components, such as protein from yeast, bacteria, mammalian cells, and other sample types. 

&#160; 

The CS pressure-based cell disruption equipment and the PBI PCT-based instrumentation complement each other in several important ways. While both the CS and PBI technologies are based on high pressure, each product line has fundamental scientific capabilities that the other does not offer. PBI&#8217;s PCT Platform uses certain patented pressure mechanisms to achieve small-scale, molecular level effects. CS&#8217;s technology uses different, proprietary pressure mechanisms for larger-scale, non-molecular level processing. In a number of routine laboratory applications, such as protein extraction, both effects can be critical to success. Therefore, for protein extraction and a number of other important scientific applications, we believe laboratories will benefit by using the CS and PBI products, either separately or together. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Within the broad field of biological sample preparation, we focus the majority of our PCT and constant pressure (&#8220;CP&#8221;) product development efforts in three specific areas: biomarker discovery (primarily through mass spectrometric analysis at the present time), forensics and histology. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Biomarker Discovery - Mass Spectrometry . A biomarker is any substance (e.g., protein, DNA) that can be used (i) as an indicator of the presence or absence of a particular disease-state or condition, (ii) to measure disease progression, and (iii) to measure the effects of therapy. Biomarkers can help in the diagnosis, prognosis, therapy, prevention, surveillance, control, and cure of diseases and medical conditions. 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; A mass spectrometer is one of the laboratory instruments used in the analysis of biological samples, primarily proteins, in life sciences research. It is frequently used to help discover biomarkers. According to a recently published market report by marketing firm Transparency Market Research (www.transparencymarketresearch.com) &#8220; Spectrometry Market (Atomic, Molecular and Mass Spectrometry) - Global Scenario, Trends, Industry Analysis, Size, Share &#38; Forecast 2011 &#8211; 2017 ,&#8221; the global spectrometry market was worth $10.2 billion in 2011 and is expected to reach $15.2 billion in 2017, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 6.9% from 2011 to 2017. In the overall global market, the North American market is expected to maintain its lead position in terms of revenue until 2017 and is expected to have approximately 36.2% of the market revenue share in 2017, followed by Europe. We believe that both PCT and CP-based products offer significant advantages in speed and quality compared to current techniques used in the preparation of samples for mass spectrometric analysis. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Forensics . The detection of DNA has become a part of the analysis of forensic samples by laboratories and criminal justice agencies worldwide in their efforts to identify the perpetrators of violent crimes and missing persons. Scientists from the University of North Texas and Florida International University have reported improvements in DNA yield from forensic samples e.g., bone, and hair, using PCT in the sample preparation process. We believe PCT may be capable of differentially extracting DNA from sperm and female epithelial cells in swabs collected from rape victims and stored in rape kits. According to the Joyful Arts Foundation&#8217;s website, an organization focused on bringing justice to all victims of rape cases that remain unsolved (http://endthebacklog.org/whatisthebacklog.htm), &#8220;Experts in the federal government estimate that there are hundreds of thousands of untested rape kits in police and crime lab storage facilities throughout the United States.&#8221; We believe this backlog exists for reasons such as cost, processing time, and quality of results. We further believe that the ability to differentially extract DNA from the sperm cells while not extracting DNA from the female epithelial cells could reduce the cost of such testing, while increasing the quality, safety and speed of the testing process. 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Histology . The most commonly used technique worldwide for the preservation of biopsies of cancer and other tissues for subsequent pathology evaluation is formalin-fixation followed by paraffin-embedding (&#8220; FFPE &#8221;). We believe that the quality and analysis of FFPE tissues is highly problematic. We believe PCT offers significant advantages over current processing methods. These advantages include standardization, speed, biomolecule recovery, and safety. 

&#160; 

Our customers include researchers at academic laboratories, government agencies, biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other life sciences companies in the United States, and distribution partners in foreign countries. 

&#160; 

We have experienced negative cash flows from operations with respect to our business since inception. As of December 31, 2015, we did not have adequate working capital resources to satisfy our current liabilities. Based on our current projections, including equity and debt financing subsequent to December 31, 2015, we believe our current and projected cash resources will enable us to extend our cash resources for the foreseeable future. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The audit report issued by our independent registered public accounting firm on our audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, contains an explanatory paragraph regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. The audit report issued by our independent registered public accounting firm for our financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 states that our auditing firm has substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern due to the risk that we may not have sufficient cash and liquid assets to cover our operating and capital requirements for the next twelve-month period; and, if sufficient cash cannot be obtained, we would have to substantially alter, or possibly even discontinue, operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

&#160; 

The conditions described above could adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, if at all, and may cause investors to have reservations about our long-term prospects, and may adversely affect our relationships with customers. There can be no assurance that our auditing firm will not issue the same opinion in the future. If we cannot successfully continue as a going concern, our stockholders may lose their entire investment in us. 

&#160; 

Developments 

&#160; 

We reported a number of accomplishments during 2015 including: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; December 31, we closed on two additional subscriptions totaling $155,000 in our $5 Million PIPE transaction, bringing the total to $4,910,000. 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; December 15, we reported the close of an additional $730,000 in our $5 Million PIPE transaction, bringing the total to $4,755,000. We also reported the repayment of 100% of the floorless loans previously owed by PBI. 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; November 12, we announced Q3 2015 financial results, including record revenue for the quarter and nine-month periods ended September 30, a 55% increase in total revenue compared to the same quarter in 2014, and a 13.4% decrease in operating loss for the third quarter of 2015. 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; October 16, the Company announced a collaboration agreement with Florida International University to co-develop an improved rape kit test method, based on the Company&#8217;s patented PCT platform. With a backlog of untested rape kits estimated at approximately 400,000, and with an estimated 180,000 new sexual assaults each year, an improved testing method is vitally needed. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; September 1, we announced that a recent publication in a peer-reviewed journal indicated that PBI&#8217;s PCT platform could play a significant role in personalized/precision medicine, including cancer tissue biopsies. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; August 17, we announced Q2 2015 financial results, including increases in all major revenue categories for the second quarter, and record total revenue for the six month period ended June 30, 2015. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; August 14, DM WDM, a small cap investment bank, announced the exchange of 1M shares of PBI (valued at $0.50/share) for 601,500 shares of Everest Investments Holdings, the formation of Pressure BioSciences Europe, and $250,000 of market support for PBI by WDM. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; July 23, we announced the close of a $2.18M initial tranche of a $5 Million Private Placement. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; July 15, we announced that PCT was a key workflow component in a study to discover potential biomarkers and underlying pathways in the emergence and progression of COPD-associated lung cancer. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; July 13, we reported that Chinese and Swiss researchers suggested a workflow that included the PCT platform that they believed could potentially accelerate the discovery of new biomarkers for the early diagnosis and prediction of complications in diabetes. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; July 7, we announced promising results when our PCT Platform was incorporated in a new method for improving the extraction of DNA from rape kits and other forensic samples. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; June 29, we announced that scientists from the Institute of Molecular Systems Biology in Zurich, Switzerland presented data on an improved method for the proteomic profiling and classification of prostate cancer tissue biopsy samples at an important international scientific conference. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; May 4, we announced the publication of three scientific articles that show key advantages of the PCT platform in drug discovery &#38; design, cancer detection, and in the analysis of microbial communities in soil. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; April 30, we announced that scientists from Northwestern University had successfully extracted cotinine (metabolite of nicotine) from dried blood spots and theorized that the Company&#8217;s new Barozyme High-throughput system might also improve the extraction of other chemical toxins and carcinogens as well. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; April 14, we announced a collaboration agreement with Southern University at New Orleans for improving and extending applications of the PCT platform for DNA detection in forensic samples. &#160; 

&#160; - 3 - &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; March 31, we announced FY 2014 financial results, including an almost 30% increase in products and services revenue compared to FY 2013. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; March 12, we released PCT-HD, &#8220;the Next Generation Protein Preparation System&#8221; in two separate presentations at a major international scientific meeting in Tempe, Arizona. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; February 19, we announced the award of a $1 million NIH SBIR Phase II Grant to develop a high-throughput, high pressure-based DNA Shearing System for Next Generation Sequencing (&#8220;NGS&#8221;). &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; February 10, we received the first Purchase Order for our Barozyme HT48 High-Throughput System. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; January 21, we announced the receipt of over $1.16 million during the past two months from equity investments, and that we planned to expand our marketing, sales, and operations capabilities. &#160; 

Liquidity 

&#160; 

Management has developed a plan to continue operations. This plan includes controlling expenses, streamlining operations, and obtaining capital through equity and/or debt financing. We have been successful in raising cash through debt and equity offerings in the past and as described in this annual report. We closed $4,910,000 of a $5 million PIPE through December 31, 2015, and have closed additional subscriptions subsequent to December 31, 2015. We have efforts in place to continue to raise cash through debt and equity offerings. 

&#160; 

Although we have successfully completed equity financings and reduced expenses in the past, we cannot assure our investors that our plans to address these matters in the future will be successful. Additional financing may not be available to us on a timely basis or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In the event we are unable to raise sufficient funds on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; severely limit or cease our operations or otherwise reduce planned expenditures and forego other business opportunities, which could harm our business. The accompanying financial statements do not include adjustments that may be required in the event of the disposal of assets or the discontinuation of the business; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; obtain financing with terms that may have the effect of diluting or adversely affecting the holdings or the rights of the holders of our capital stock; or &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; obtain funds through arrangements with future collaboration partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to some or all of our technologies or products. &#160; 

Corporate Information 

&#160; 

We were incorporated in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in August 1978 as Boston Biomedica, Inc. In September 2004, we completed the sale of Boston Biomedica&#8217;s core business units and began to focus exclusively on the development and commercialization of the PCT platform. Following this change in business strategy, we changed our legal name from Boston Biomedica, Inc. to Pressure BioSciences, Inc. (&#8220; PBI &#8221;). We began operations as PBI in February 2005, research and development activities in April 2006, early marketing and selling activities of our Barocycler instruments in late 2007, and marketing and selling of our PCT-based instrument platform in 2012.

Sample Preparation for Genomic, Proteomic, Lipidomic and Small Molecule Studies 

&#160; 

The Market 

&#160; 

Since February 2005, we have focused substantially all of our research and development and commercialization efforts on sample preparation for genomic, proteomic, lipidomic, and small molecule studies. This market is comprised of academic and government research institutions, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and other public and private laboratories that are engaged in studying genomic, proteomic and small molecule material within plant and animal cells and tissues. We elected to initially focus our resources in the market of genomic, proteomic and small molecule sample preparation because we believe it is an area that: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; is a rapidly growing market; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; has a large and immediate need for better technology; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; is comprised mostly of research laboratories, which are subject to minimal governmental regulation; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; is the least technically challenging application for the development of our products; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; is compatible with our technical core competency; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; we currently have strong patent protection. &#160; 

We believe that our existing PCT and CP-based instrumentation and related consumable products fill an important and growing need in the sample preparation market for the safe, rapid, versatile, reproducible and quality extraction of nucleic acids, proteins and small molecules from a wide variety of plant and animal cells and tissues. 

&#160; 

Biomarker Discovery - Mass Spectrometry 

&#160; 

A biomarker is any substance (e.g., protein, DNA) that can be used as an indicator of the presence or absence of a particular disease-state or condition, and to measure the progression and effects of therapy. Biomarkers can help in the diagnosis, prognosis, therapy, prevention, surveillance, control, and cure of diseases and medical conditions. 

&#160; 

A mass spectrometer is a laboratory instrument used in the analysis of biological samples, often focused on proteins, in life sciences research. It is frequently used to help discover biomarkers. According to a recently published market report by Transparency Market Research (www.transparencymarketresearch.com) &#8220;Spectrometry Market (Atomic, Molecular and Mass Spectrometry) - Global Scenario, Trends, Industry Analysis, Size, Share &#38; Forecast 2011 &#8211; 2017, &#8221; the global spectrometry market was worth $10.2 billion in 2011 and is expected to reach $15.2 billion in 2017, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 6.9% from 2011 to 2017. In the overall global market, the North American market is expected to maintain its lead position in terms of revenue till 2017 and is expected to have approximately 36.2% of the market revenue share in 2017, followed by Europe. We believe PCT and CP-based products offer significant advantages in speed and quality compared with current techniques used in the preparation of samples for mass spectrometry analysis. 

&#160; 

Our plan is to focus primarily on the application of PCT-enhanced protein extraction and CP-based digestion for the mass spectrometry market and the advantages of PCT and CP in this market, and on the use of PCT and CP in biomarker discovery, soil and plant biology, counter bio-terrorism and tissue pathology applications. 

&#160; 

Forensics 

&#160; 

The detection of DNA has become a part of the analysis of forensic samples by laboratories and criminal justice agencies worldwide in their efforts to identify the perpetrators of violent crimes and missing persons. Scientists from the University of North Texas and Florida International University have reported improvements in DNA yield from forensic samples (e.g., bone and hair) using PCT in the sample preparation process. We believe that PCT may be capable of differentially extracting DNA from sperm cells and female epithelial cells in swabs collected from rape victims and stored in rape kits. We also believe that there are many completed rape kits that remain untested for reasons such as cost, time and quality of results. We further believe that the ability to differentially extract DNA from sperm and not epithelial cells could reduce the cost of such testing, while increasing the quality, safety and speed of the testing process. 

&#160; 

Histology 

&#160; 

The most commonly used technique worldwide for the preservation of cancer and other tissues for subsequent pathology evaluation is formalin-fixation followed by paraffin-embedding, or FFPE. We believe that the quality and analysis of FFPE tissues is highly problematic, and that PCT offers significant advantages over current processing methods, including standardization, speed, biomolecule recovery, and safety. 

&#160; 

&#160; - 5 - &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Sample Extraction Process 

&#160; 

The process of preparing samples for genomic, proteomic and small molecule studies includes a crucial step called sample extraction or sample disruption. This is the process of extracting nucleic acid i.e., DNA and/or RNA, proteins or small molecules from the plant or animal cells and tissues that are being studied. Sample preparation is widely regarded as a significant impediment to research and discovery and sample extraction is generally regarded as one of the key parts of sample preparation. Our current commercialization efforts are based upon our belief that pressure cycling technology provides a superior solution to sample extraction compared with other available technologies or procedures and can thus significantly improve the quality of sample preparation, and thus the quality of the test result. 

&#160; 

Collaboration Program 

&#160; 

Our collaboration program is an important element of our business strategy. Initiating a collaboration with a researcher involves the installation of a Barocycler instrument for an agreed upon period of time of approximately three to twelve months, and the execution of an agreed upon work plan. Our primary objectives for entering into a collaboration agreement include: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; the development of a new application for PCT and CP in sample preparation; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; the advancement and validation of our understanding of PCT and CP within an area of life sciences in which we already offer products; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; the demonstration of the effectiveness of PCT and CP by specific research scientists, particularly Key Opinion Leaders (&#8220;KOLs&#8221;), who we believe can have a positive impact on market acceptance of PCT; and 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; the expectation of peer-reviewed publications and/or presentations at scientific meetings by a third party on the merits of PCT and CP. &#160; 

Since we initiated our collaboration program in June 2005, third party researchers have cited the use of our PCT platform in multiple publications and presentations. We believe that this program has provided and continues to provide us with independent and objective data about PCT from well-respected laboratories in the United States and throughout the rest of the world. 

&#160; 

Company Products 

&#160; 

We believe our PCT and CP products allow researchers to improve scientific research studies in the life sciences field. Our products are developed with the expectation of meeting or exceeding the needs of research scientists while enhancing the safety, speed and quality that is available to them with existing sample preparation methods. 

&#160; 

Barocycler Instrumentation 

&#160; 

Our Barocycler product line consists of laboratory instrumentation that subjects a sample to cycles of pressure from ambient (approximately 14.5 psi) to ultra-high levels (35,000 psi or greater) and then back to ambient; all in a precisely controlled manner. Our instruments (the Barocycler NEP3229, the Barocycler NEP2320, and the HUB440) use cycles of high, hydrostatic pressure to quickly and efficiently break up the cellular structures of a specimen to release nucleic acids, proteins, lipids and small molecules from the specimen into our consumable processing tube, referred to as our PULSE Tubes and MicroTubes. Our Barocycler instrumentation is designed to fit on a laboratory bench top, inside a biological safety cabinet, or on the shelf of a laboratory cold room. Our instruments have an external chiller hook-up (to control temperature during the PCT process), automatic fill and dispensing valves, and an integrated micro-processor keypad or a laptop computer. The microprocessor or laptop computer are capable of saving specific PCT protocols, so the researcher can achieve maximum reproducibility for the preparation of nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, or small molecules from various biological samples. Our Barocycler instruments and our consumable products make up our current PCT Sample Preparation System (see below). 

&#160; 

Barocycler NEP3229 &#8211; The Barocycler NEP3229 contains two units &#8211; a user interface and a power source &#8211; comprised primarily of a 1.5 horsepower motor and pump assembly (hydraulic). Combined, the two components of the NEP3229 weigh approximately 350 pounds. The Barocycler NEP3229 is capable of processing up to three samples simultaneously using our specially designed, single-use PULSE Tubes and up to 48 samples simultaneously using our specially-designed MicroTubes. 

&#160; 

&#160; - 6 - &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Barocycler NEP2320 &#8211; The Barocycler NEP2320 is a smaller, more compact version of our NEP3229 unit. It weighs approximately 80 pounds (with accessories) and works on compressed air (pneumatic) instead of hydraulics like the larger NEP3229 unit. Because this instrument is pneumatic, the NEP2320 can be easily attached by an air hose to a typical 85-psi air compressor found in most scientific laboratories, as well as to many consumer-sold portable compressors or even to bottled gas. This instrument is used by our sales staff as a demonstration instrument and is marketed as a second instrument alternative to our PCT SPS. The Barocycler NEP2320 is capable of processing one sample at a time using our specially designed, single-use PULSE Tubes and up to 16 samples simultaneously using our specially-designed MicroTubes. 

&#160; 

Barocycler HUB440 &#8211; The Barocycler HUB440 was introduced to collaborators in the electron paramagnetic resonance (&#8220;EPR&#8221;) market in 2011 for testing in a laboratory environment, and to elicit feedback from research scientists on performance and capabilities. The Barocycler HUB440 is capable of creating and controlling hydrostatic pressure from 500 psi to 58,000 psi. It is computer controlled, and runs on software that was specially-written by PBI in LabVIEW (software from National Instruments Corporation). PBI owns the rights and has a license to use the specialty LabVIEW software. The Barocycler HUB440 is the first portable, ready to use pressure generator for the laboratory bench. We believe that over the coming years, the Barocycler HUB440 may become the main instrument in the Company&#8217;s pressure-based instrument line. 

&#160; 

PCT MicroTube Adapter Kit &#8211; The PCT MicroTube Adapter Kit includes an ergonomically designed, space-saving Workstation, PCT MicroTubes and MicroCaps, and specialized tools to enable the user to process up to forty-eight samples simultaneously in our PCT SPS, as compared to three with the Barocycler NEP3229. 

&#160; 

The Shredder SG3 &#8211; The Shredder SG3 is a low shear mechanical homogenization system for use with tough, fibrous and other difficult-to-disrupt tissues and organisms. The Shredder SG3 System uses a variety of Shredder PULSE Tubes to directly and rapidly grind a biological sample which, when combined with selected buffers, can provide effective extraction of proteins, DNA, RNA, lipids and small molecules from tissues and organisms. The Shredder SG3 features a three position force setting lever, which enables the operator to select and apply reproducible force to the sample during the shredding process and eliminates the need for the operator to exert force for long periods when processing one or more samples.

Barocycler HUB880 - The Barocycler HUB880 is a new instrument expected to be available for sale during the second half of 2016. It is a compact, portable, bench-top, ultra-high pressure generator that uses an air pressure-to-liquid pressure intensifier allowing the user to generate fluid pressure as high as 90,000 psi with input air pressure of just 126 psi. The HUB880 can be operated through a simple front panel or controlled using an optional external Data Acquisition and Control Module for dynamic pressure control. We believe that the HUB880 will be well accepted by scientists that need to achieve super high pressure, such as those working in the food and vaccine industries. 

&#160; 

Barozyme HT48 - The Barozyme HT48 is a high throughput bench-top instrument designed for accelerated enzymatic digestion of proteins at high pressure. The Barozyme HT48 uses an air-pressure-to-liquid-pressure intensifier system, with a pressure amplification ratio of 160:1, to reach an output pressure of 20,000 psi. The Barozyme HT48 is capable of processing up to 48 samples at a time in six single-use BaroFlex 8-well Strips in the Barozyme Sample Carrier. Typical trypsin digestion times can be reduced from hours to minutes. 

&#160; 

BaroFlex 8-well Processing Strips - Baroflex 8-well Strips are used in the Barozyme HT48 (See Specification Sheet) for pressure-enhanced enzymatic digestion at 20,000 psi. BaroFlex 8-well Strips are made of special high density polyethylene (HDPE) and hold up to 140&#181;l when capped with the BaroFlex Cap Strips or Mats. BaroFlex 8-Cap Strips and BaroFlex 24-Cap Mats are made of silicone. These single-use caps are designed to seal BaroFlex 8-well Strips tightly and to prevent fluid exchange between the sample and the Barozyme chamber fluid during pressure cycling. The silicone caps are available as strips of 8, or mats of 24 caps. 

&#160; 

PCT-HD - The PCT-HD System combines two of the Company&#8217;s unique products: the recently released, patent-pending &#181;Pestle consumable with an enhanced Barocycler NEP2320 instrument. This combination enables faster, less cumbersome and higher quality homogenization, extraction, and digestion of proteins. PCT-HD was developed by the Company&#8217;s scientists and engineers in collaboration with Professor Ruedi Aebersold and Dr. Tiannan Guo of the Institute of Molecular Systems Biology, ETH Zurich, and the University of Zurich, both in Zurich, Switzerland. Drs. Aebersold and Guo combined PCT-HD with AB SCIEX&#8217;s SWATH-Mass Spectrometry &#8211; calling the resulting method &#8220;PCT-SWATH&#8221;. This protocol can yield analytical results within 12 hours from the start of processing tissue. Although Drs. Aebersold and Guo developed protocols for the combination of PCT-HD with SWATH-MS, the PCT-HD System is not limited to any specific mass spectrometer or method of data analysis. Subsequently, we believe the PCT-HD System can provide most researchers with unprecedented speed and reproducibility for biomarker discovery.

Cell Disruption Instrumentation 

&#160; 

We are also the exclusive distributor throughout all of the Americas for the Constant Systems cell disruption equipment, parts, and consumables. Constant Systems, Ltd (&#8220;CS&#8221;), a British company located about 90 minutes northwest of London, England, has been providing niche biomedical equipment, related consumable products, and services to a global client base since 1989. CS designs, develops, and manufactures high pressure cell disruption equipment required by life sciences laboratories worldwide, particularly disruption systems for the extraction of proteins. The CS equipment provides a constant and controlled cell disruptive environment, giving the user superior, constant, and reproducible results whatever the application. CS has over 900 units installed in over 40 countries worldwide. The CS cell disruption equipment has proven performance in the extraction of cellular components, such as protein from yeast, bacteria, mammalian cells, and other sample types. 

&#160; 

The CS pressure-based cell disruption equipment and the PBI PCT instrumentation complement each other in several important ways. While both the CS and PBI technologies are based on high pressure, each product line has fundamental scientific capabilities that the other does not offer. PBI&#8217;s PCT Platform uses certain patented pressure mechanisms to achieve small-scale, molecular level effects. CS&#8217;s technology uses different, proprietary pressure mechanisms for larger-scale, non-molecular level processing. In a number of routine laboratory applications, such as protein extraction, both effects can be critical to success. Therefore, for protein extraction and a number of other important scientific applications, we believe laboratories will benefit by using the CS and PBI products, either separately or together. 

&#160; 

Barocycler Consumable Products 

&#160; 

PULSE Tubes (FT500) &#8211; The FT500 PULSE Tube is a specially-designed, plastic, single-use, processing container with two chambers separated by a small disk with small holes. This small disk is referred to as a Lysis Disk. PULSE Tubes transmit the power of PCT from the Barocycler instrument to the sample. In sample extraction, the specimen is placed on the Lysis Disk. Buffers are added to the PULSE tube and the PULSE Tube is capped and placed in the pressure chamber of the Barocycler instrument. The pressure chamber fluid then is added and pressurization begins. As pressure increases, a small moveable piston pushes the specimen from the top (sample) chamber, through the Lysis Disk and into the bottom (fluid retention) chamber. When pressure is released, the sample, which is now partially homogenized, is pulled back through the Lysis Disk by the receding ram. The combination of physical passage through the Lysis Disk, rapid pressure changes and other biophysical mechanisms related to cycled pressure break up the cellular structures of the specimen to quickly and efficiently release nucleic acids, proteins, lipids and small molecules. 

&#160; 

Non-Disk PULSE Tubes (FT500-ND) &#8211; The FT500-ND PULSE Tube is a specially-designed, plastic, single-use, processing container with one chamber. The FT500-ND is similar to the FT500 in look and feel, except there is no Lysis Disk separating the body of the processing container into two chambers, as in the FT500. The design change was based on market demand for a PCT consumable for the rapid and reproducible processing of solutions and suspensions that do not require partial homogenization by passage through a Lysis Disk and for a consumable that could accept smaller sample volumes. The FT500-ND offers variable sample volumes with a range five times that of the existing FT500. 

&#160; 

ProteoSolve - SB &#8211; (ProteoSolve for Systems Biology) is a PCT-dependent method for the simultaneous extraction, isolation and fractionation of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), proteins and lipids from animal and plant samples routinely used in laboratory research. This patent-pending kit contains proprietary reagents, consumable processing containers (PULSE Tubes) and instructions for use. It is intended to be used with our patented PCT Sample Preparation System. The kit is based on an approach to a &#8220;systems biology&#8221; sample preparation method that was first unveiled during early 2008 in collaboration with Dr. Alexander Ivanov, who was then with the Harvard School of Public Health. 

&#160; 

ProteoSolve - CE &#8211; (ProteoSolve for Conventional Extraction) is a PCT-dependent kit for the extraction of proteins from a variety of samples using optimized detergent-based reagent system compatible with two-dimensional electrophoresis or two-dimensional chromatographic separation for proteomic analysis. The kit contains the reagents and instructions necessary for the extraction of either denatured or non-denatured proteins, which can then be used for the analysis of protein structure and function. 

&#160; 

Mitochondria Isolation Kits &#8211; These kits contain the chemical ingredients necessary for a scientist to extract mitochondria from skeletal muscle and lung tissue for subsequent analysis. Mitochondria play a major role in generating the energy required to power most cell processes and are involved in other important cell functions. Mitochondria have been implicated in several human diseases, including heart disease, stroke, Parkinson&#8217;s disease, cancer and other mitochondrial diseases.

&#160; 

Micro-Pestle (undefinedPestles) - PCT undefinedPestles, in conjunction with PCT MicroTubes, are designed to enhance the extraction of protein, DNA, RNA and small molecules from minute amounts (0.5 &#8211; 3.0 mg) of solid tissue in extraction reagent volumes as low as 20-30 undefinedL. PCT MicroTubes and PCT undefinedPestles use Pressure Cycling Technology (PCT) to effectively disrupt soft tissues and lyse their cells. As a result, the tissue sample trapped between the MicroTube end and the undefinedPestles tip is crushed on every pressure cycle. This mechanical action, combined with the extraction ability of the buffer under high pressure, result in effective homogenization and extraction. 

&#160; 

PCT undefinedPestles and PCT MicroTubes, together with a PBI Barocycler, comprise the PCT Micro-Pestle System, which provides a faster, safer, and more efficient means of extraction from extremely small amounts of solid samples such as soft animal tissues or biopsies. The PCT undefinedPestle System can be used in any PBI Barocycler. 

&#160; 

PCT undefinedPestles are made from Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), a synthetic fluoropolymer of tetrafluoroethylene, also known as Teflon (by DuPont Co). PTFE is practically inert; the only chemicals known to affect it are certain alkali metals and most highly-reactive fluorinating agents. 

&#160; 

We believe our development of these products has helped, and will continue to help, drive the adoption of PCT within the life sciences market.

&#160; 

Government Grants and Contracts 

&#160; 

We view federal agency grants to be an important part of our business plan. These types of grants allow us to bill the federal agency for work that we are planning to perform as part of the development and commercialization of our technology. We generally start by submitting initial grant requests that are in response to requests for proposals (&#8220; RFPs &#8221;) from the federal government through their Small Business Innovation Research (&#8220; SBIR &#8221;) program. Initial (&#8220; SBIR Phase I &#8221;) grants are meant to fund approved research projects for six months, and generally have budgets of approximately $100,000 to $150,000. Because our work in SBIR Phase I grants has been successful, we have applied, and may in the future apply for larger National Institutes of Health (&#8220;NIH&#8221;) SBIR Phase II grants. Such larger grants are typically for a two-year period and can offer as much as $1,000,000 to support significant research projects in areas we would otherwise expect to support with internal funds should SBIR Phase II grants not be awarded. To date, we have been awarded five NIH SBIR Phase I grants and three SBIR Phase II grants. The data on three of the NIH SBIR Phase I grants were the basis for the submission, and subsequent award. Of the three NIH SBIR Phase II grants awarded to us: one was in the approximate amount of $850,000 in August 2008, the second was in the approximate amount of $850,000 in September 2011, and the third award was in the approximate amount of $1,020,000 awarded in November 2014. All three of the NIH SBIR Phase I grants and the August 2008 and September 2011, NIH SBIR Phase II grants have been completed. 

&#160; 

The 2008 SBIR Phase II grant (2R44GM079059) was awarded to us by the NIH for work in the area of using PCT to extract protein biomarkers, sub-cellular molecular complexes, and organelles, with the expectation that these studies might ultimately lead to the release of a new, commercially available PCT-based system, with validated protocols, end-user kits, and other consumables intended for the extraction of clinically important protein biomarkers, sub-cellular molecular complexes, and organelles from human and animal tissues. The 2011 SBIR II contract (W81XWH-10-C-0-175) was awarded to us by the U.S. Army for the development of a universal method for the inactivation, extraction, and enrichment of pathogens in diagnostic samples, including arthropod hosts of military importance. The work covered by this grant was significant in helping us develop the recently released Barozyme HT48 High Throughput System. The 2014 SBIR Phase II grant (2R44HG007136) was awarded to us by the National Human Genome Research Institute of the National Institutes of Health (&#8220;NIH&#8221;). Entitled &#8220;High Pressure Sample Preparation Instrumentation for DNA Sequencing&#8221;, this grant will help fund the development of an automated, high-throughput, high pressure system (instrument and consumables), to enable significantly better control of DNA fragmentation - a critical step in the preparation of samples for Next Generation Sequencing platforms. This system will be based on significant technological advancements over the classic hydrodynamic DNA shearing approach that has been successfully and widely used in the field of DNA sequencing for many years.

Extended Service Contracts 

&#160; 

We offer extended service contracts on our laboratory instrumentation to all of our customers. These service contracts allow a customer who purchases a Barocycler instrument to receive on-site scheduled preventative maintenance, on-site repair and replacement of all worn or defective component parts, and telephone support, all at no incremental cost for the life of the service contract. We offer one-year and four-year extended service contracts to customers who purchase Barocycler instruments. 

&#160; 

Other Applications of Pressure Cycling Technology 

&#160; 

PCT is an enabling, platform technology based on a physical process that had not previously been used to control bio-molecular interactions. During its early development, under the legacy business of Boston Biomedica, Inc., our scientists were researching and developing applications of pressure cycling technology in many areas of the life sciences, including genomic, proteomic and small molecule sample preparation. The data generated during these early years, combined with the data generated since we began focusing on PCT operations in February 2005, form the basis of knowledge that we believe will allow us to successfully commercialize PCT both within and outside of the sample preparation market. 

&#160; 

Our research and development efforts have shown that, in addition to genomic, proteomic and small molecule sample preparation, PCT is potentially beneficial in a number of other areas of the life sciences, including pathogen inactivation, protein purification, control of chemical (particularly enzymatic) reactions, and immunodiagnostics. Other applications in the sample preparation market include forensics and histology, as we discuss above. Our pursuit of these markets, however, depends on a number of factors, including our success in commercializing PCT in the area of sample preparation, our judgment regarding the investment required to be successful in these areas, the value of these markets to our Company, and the availability of sufficient financial resources. Below is a brief explanation of each of these additional potential applications and a short description of why we believe PCT can be used to improve scientific studies in these areas. 

&#160; 

Pathogen Inactivation 

&#160; 

Biological products manufactured for human use, such as blood, vaccines and drugs, are put through rigorous processing protocols in an effort to minimize the potential of that product to transmit disease. These protocols may include methods to remove infectious materials such as pre-processing testing, filtration or chromatography, or methods to inactivate infectious materials that are not captured in the removal steps such as pasteurization, irradiation and solvent detergent inactivation. Notwithstanding current diligence in both the removal and inactivation steps, significant concern remains that some bacteria and viruses capable of transmitting infection to recipients may not be removed or inactivated with current procedures. In addition, some removal and inactivation methods may not be useful because of cost, safety, ease-of-use or other practical concerns. To that end, we believe that a new inactivation method is needed that can safely, rapidly and inexpensively inactivate pathogens in blood, vaccines and drugs without the need for chemical or other potentially toxic additives. We believe we have successfully generated proof-of-concept that PCT can satisfy this need. We believe that compared with current procedures, a process that uses PCT has the potential to increase safety and yield, lower cost and decrease the potential side effects of current methods. We have been issued U.S., European, and Japanese patents for this PCT-dependent inactivation technology. 

&#160; 

Protein Purification 

&#160; 

Many vaccines and drugs are comprised of proteins. These proteins need to be purified from complex mixtures as part of the manufacturing process. Current purification techniques often result in the loss of a significant amount of the protein. Therefore, any method that could increase the amount of protein being recovered in the purification step, could subsequently lead to a reduction in cost to the manufacturer. We believe we have successfully generated proof-of-concept that PCT can satisfy this need. We believe that compared with current purification procedures, a process that uses PCT has the potential to increase protein recovery, increase the quality of the product, and lower production costs. We have been issued U.S. and European patents in this area. 

&#160; 

Control of Chemical (Particularly Enzymatic) Reactions 

&#160; 

Chemical reactions encompass many important interactions in nature. Methods used to control chemical reactions could have a positive effect on the quality, speed, and overall result of the reaction. The control and detection of chemical reactions is particularly useful in the biotechnology field for synthesizing and characterizing such molecules as nucleic acids and polypeptides. We believe that PCT offers distinct advantages in controlling chemical reactions over current methods, since PCT can provide precise, automated control over the timing and synchronization of chemical reactions, particularly enzymatic reactions. We have been issued U.S. and European patents in this area. 

&#160; 

&#160; - 10 - &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Immunodiagnostics 

&#160; 

Many tests used in the clinical laboratory today are based on the formation of a complex between two proteins, such as an antigen and an antibody. Such &#8220;immunodiagnostic&#8221; methods are used for the detection of infectious agents such as the human immunodeficiency virus (&#8220; HIV &#8221;), hepatitis viruses, West Nile virus, and others, as well as for endocrine, drug testing and cancer diagnostics. We have generated proof-of-concept that PCT may be used to control biomolecular interactions between proteins, such as antigens and antibodies. We believe this capability may provide a greater degree of sensitivity and quantitative accuracy in immunodiagnostic testing than that offered by methods that are available today. We have been issued U.S. and European patents in this area. 

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160; 

Our customers include researchers at academic laboratories, government agencies, biotechnology companies, pharmaceutical companies and other life science institutions in the United States. Our customers also include a number of foreign distribution partners. Our goal is to continue our market penetration in these target groups and releasing products in our publicized product pipeline. We also believe that there is a significant opportunity to sell and/or lease additional Barocycler instrumentation to additional laboratories at current customer institutions. 

&#160; 

If we are successful in commercializing PCT in applications beyond our current focus area of genomic, proteomic, and small molecule sample preparation and if we are successful in our attempts to attract additional capital, our potential customer base could expand to include hospitals, reference laboratories, blood banks and transfusion centers, plasma collection centers, pharmaceutical manufacturing plants and other sites involved in each specific application. If we are successful in forensics, our potential customers could be laboratories, military and other government agencies. If we are successful in histology, our potential customers could be pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, and laboratories focused on drug discovery or correlation of disease states. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We compete with companies that have existing technologies for the extraction of nucleic acids, proteins and small molecules from cells and tissues, including methods such as mortar and pestle grinding, sonication, rotor-stator homogenization, French Press, bead beating, freezer milling, enzymatic digestion and chemical dissolution. We believe that there are a number of significant issues related to the use of these methods, including: complexity, sample containment, cross-contamination, shearing of biomolecules of interest, and limited applicability to different sample types, ease-of-use, reproducibility, and cost. We believe that our PCT Sample Preparation System offers a number of significant advantages over these methods, including: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; labor reduction &#9679; versatility &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; temperature control &#9679; efficiency &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; precision &#9679; simplicity &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; reproducibility &#9679; safety &#160; 

To be competitive in the industry, we believe we must be able to clearly and conclusively demonstrate to potential customers that our products provide these improved performance capabilities. We strongly believe that our PCT Sample Preparation System is a novel and enabling system for genomic, proteomic, and small molecule sample preparation. As such, many users of current manual techniques will need to be willing to challenge their existing methods of sample preparation and invest time to evaluate a method that could change their overall workflow in the sample preparation process, prior to adopting our technology. 

&#160; 

Further, we are aware that the cost of the PCT Sample Preparation System may be greater than the cost of many of the other methods currently employed. Consequently we are focusing our sales efforts on those product attributes that we believe will be most important and appealing to potential customers, namely versatility, reproducibility, quality and safety.

Manufacturing and Supply 

&#160; 

BIT Group USA, formerly Source Scientific, LLC, currently provides all of the manufacturing and assembly services for our Barocycler NEP2320 and Barocycler NEP3229 instrumentation products under an informal, unwritten understanding. We currently manufacture and assemble the Barocycler HUB440, the Shredder SG3, and the MicroTubes at our South Easton facility. We plan to continue to utilize BIT Group USA as our primary assembler and contract manufacturer of our current, and future, Barocycler NEP 2320 and 3229 instruments. Until we develop a broader network of manufacturers and subcontractors, obtaining alternative sources of supply or manufacturing services could involve significant delays and other costs and challenges, and may not be available to us on reasonable terms, if at all. The failure of a supplier or contract manufacturer to provide sufficient quantities, acceptable quality and timely products at an acceptable price, or an interruption of supplies from such a supplier could harm our business and prospects. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

Our research and development activities are split into two functional areas: Applications and Engineering. 

&#160; 

&#160; 1. Applications Research and Development : Our highly educated and trained staff has years of experience in molecular and cellular biology, virology, and proteomics. Our team of scientists focuses on the development of our PCT Sample Preparation System and further commercialization of PCT-dependent genomic, proteomic, and small molecule sample preparation methods. Dr. Alexander Lazarev, our vice president of Research &#38; Development, meets regularly with our sales, marketing, and engineering staff to discuss market needs and trends. Our applications research and development team is responsible for the technical review of all scientific collaborations, for the support of our marketing and sales departments through the generation of internal data in a number of areas of market interest, and in the development of commercially-viable PCT-dependent products. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2. Engineering Research and Development: Our engineering research and development team is focused on the design and development of new and improved instrumentation and consumable products to support the commercialization of PCT. Our engineering department is led by Dr. Edmund Ting, our senior vice president of engineering. The primary focus of our engineering group is to ensure seamless production processes, perform installations and field service, and work with our application scientists to complete the development of a high throughput sample processing system for the mass spectrometry market. &#160; 

Product Pipeline 

&#160; 

The following instruments are in our research and development pipeline: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Barocycler NEP2320 Extreme &#8211; we have designed a major upgrade to our number one selling Barocycler unit, the NEP2320. The NEP2320 Extreme will use a laptop computer (instead of the current microprocessor), will be able to reach 45,000 psi on a routine basis (compared to 35,000 psi for the NEP2320), will have a larger pressure chamber, better temperature and pressure control, and better ergonomics (compared to the NEP2320). 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Barocycler FFPE Protein Extraction Instrument System - A PCT-based system offering the enhanced extraction of proteins from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (&#8220; FFPE &#8221;) samples using a modified Barocycler instrument that combines the advantages of pressure cycling, high temperature and certain reagents. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; XstreamPCT&#8482; HPLC Digestion Module - For automated, in-line, on-demand PCT-enhanced protein digestion; the first module in PBI&#8217;s PCT-based HPLC platform. &#160; 

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

Our sales and marketing efforts are centered on using the independent data developed and disseminated by our collaboration partners to help drive the installed base of our PCT Sample Preparation System. The development of scientific data by our partners and our internal researchers provides our sales and marketing staff with additional tools that are essential in selling a new technology such as PCT. 

&#160; 

Sales 

&#160; 

Direct US Sales Force 

&#160; 

Our domestic sales force currently consists of one full-time sales director and one part-time salesperson. We believe that hiring seasoned sales professionals with significant industry experience will allow us to penetrate the market more effectively than with a small, focused sales force. We may increase the number of sales professionals if our financial resources permit and if we believe that doing so will accelerate our commercialization efforts. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Foreign Distributor Network 

&#160; 

Currently, we have multiple distribution arrangements covering countries in Europe, Asia and Australia. In June 2008, we entered into a distribution agreement with Veritas Corporation (&#8220; Veritas &#8221;) of Tokyo, Japan pursuant to which we granted Veritas exclusive distribution rights to all of our products in Japan. This agreement terminated on December 31, 2015. We are currently interviewing new companies who have indicated an interest in distributing our products in Japan. In October 2011, we entered into a distribution agreement with IUL Instruments GmbH (&#8220; IUL &#8221;) of Germany pursuant to which we granted IUL exclusive distribution rights to all of our products in Germany and Switzerland through March 31, 2014. IUL currently distributes PBI products through our agreement with Constant Systems. In November 2011, we entered into a distributor agreement with Oroboros Instruments Corp. (&#8220; Oroboros &#8221;) of Austria pursuant to which we granted Oroboros non-exclusive world-wide distribution rights to the PBI Shredder SG3 System and related products through December 31, 2015. We are currently negotiating an extension to the Oroboros agreement. In March and July 2012, we entered into a distribution agreement with six companies pursuant to which we granted non-exclusive distribution rights to certain PCT products in six European and Asian countries and Australia through December 2013. Currently all six companies distribute PBI products through our agreement with Constant Systems. In October 2012, we entered into a supply agreement with Cole Parmer Corporation pursuant to which we granted Cole Parmer non-exclusive, worldwide distribution rights to our PBI Shredder SG3 System and related consumables through December 2014. This supply agreement has now expired. In November 2012, we entered into a distribution agreement with UK-based Constant Systems (&#8220; CS &#8221;), pursuant to which we granted Constant Systems non-exclusive distribution rights to certain of our PCT SPS product line in 12 European and Asian countries. In June 2013, CS and PBI signed an expanded Distribution Agreement that made PBI the exclusive distributor of CS products throughout all of the Americas. Both of these agreements were extended to May 31, 2017. We expect these agreements will be extended for a minimum of two additional years. 

&#160; 

Marketing and Sales 

&#160; 

Our marketing and sales function is led by Dr. Nathan Lawrence, our vice president of Marketing and Sales. Dr. Lawrence oversees and directs marketing and sales activities such as trade show attendance and sponsorship, on-line advertising, website maintenance and improvement, search engine optimization, creation and dissemination of a PCT newsletter, market research initiatives, the arrangement of on-location seminars, lectures, and demonstrations of PCT capabilities, and the supervision of our two-person sales force. Dr. Lawrence is also responsible for the overall coordination of our collaboration programs, from initial set-up, research plan design, and training, service, and data analysis. Some of these responsibilities are shared with other PBI departments such as Research and Development, but marketing and sales drives the collaborative process. Dr. Lawrence is also responsible for the continued coordination and support of our foreign and domestic distribution partners. 

&#160; 

In January 2016, SCIEX, a global leader in life science analytical technologies, announced an exclusive two-year co-marketing agreement with PBI. In their press release, SCIEX stated that the relationship with PBI will uniquely position SCIEX to address a major challenge in complex sample preparation by marketing a complete solution to increase the depth, breadth, and reproducibility of protein extraction, digestion, and quantitation in all tissue types, including challenging samples like tumors. Under the agreement, PBI and SCIEX will promote PCT Sample Preparation Systems such as PCT-HD with SWATH&#174; Acquisition-based next generation proteomics, TripleTOF&#174; Systems, QTRAP&#174; Systems, and Triple Quad Systems. This focus on improved sample preparation, a crucial step performed in research laboratories worldwide, will enable scientists to extract more proteins reproducibly from complex sample types, potentially yielding superior biological insights and discoveries. 

&#160; 

In January and May 2012, we entered into co-marketing/selling and research and development agreements with Digilab, a provider of products for life sciences, analytical chemistry and diagnostic markets, and LEAP Technologies, a provider of automation equipment for the genomic and proteomic industries. These agreements have recently ended. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We believe that protection of our patents and other intellectual property is essential to our business. Subject to the availability of sufficient financial resources, our practice is to file patent applications to protect technology, inventions, and improvements to inventions that are important to our business development. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, and technological innovations to develop and maintain our potential competitive position. 

&#160; 

To date, we have been granted 14 United States and 10 foreign patents. Our issued patents expire between 2015 and 2027. Our failure to obtain and maintain adequate patent protection may adversely affect our ability to enter into, or affect the terms of, any arrangement for the marketing or sale of any of our PCT products. It may also allow our competitors to duplicate our products without our permission and without compensation. 

&#160; 

License Agreements Relating to Pressure Cycling Technology 

&#160; 

BioMolecular Assays, Inc. 

&#160; 

In 1996, we acquired our initial equity interest in BioSeq, Inc., which at the time was developing our original pressure cycling technology. BioSeq, Inc. acquired its pressure cycling technology from BioMolecular Assays, Inc. under a technology transfer and patent assignment agreement. In 1998, we purchased all of the remaining outstanding capital stock of BioSeq, Inc., and at such time, the technology transfer and patent assignment agreement was amended to require us to pay BioMolecular Assays, Inc., a 5% royalty on our sales of products or services that incorporate or utilize the original pressure cycling technology that BioSeq, Inc. acquired from BioMolecular Assays, Inc. We are also required to pay BioMolecular Assays, Inc. 5% of the proceeds from any sale, transfer or license of all or any portion of the original pressure cycling technology. These payment obligations terminate in 2016. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we incurred approximately $31,301 and $31,835, respectively, in royalty expense associated with our obligation to BioMolecular Assays, Inc.

&#160; 

In connection with our acquisition of BioSeq, Inc., we licensed certain limited rights to the original pressure cycling technology back to BioMolecular Assays, Inc. This license is non-exclusive and limits the use of the original pressure cycling technology by BioMolecular Assays, Inc. solely for molecular applications in scientific research and development and in scientific plant research and development. BioMolecular Assays, Inc. is required to pay us a royalty equal to 20% of any license or other fees and royalties, but not including research support and similar payments, it receives in connection with any sale, assignment, license or other transfer of any rights granted to BioMolecular Assays, Inc. under the license. BioMolecular Assays, Inc. must pay us these royalties until the expiration in 2016 of the patents held by BioSeq, Inc. since 1998. We have not received any royalty payments from BioMolecular Assays, Inc. under this license.

Battelle Memorial Institute 

&#160; 

In December 2008, we entered into an exclusive patent license agreement with the Battelle Memorial Institute (&#8220; Battelle &#8221;). The licensed technology is the subject of a patent application filed by Battelle in 2008 and relates to a method and a system for improving the analysis of protein samples, including through an automated system utilizing pressure and a pre-selected agent to obtain a digested sample in a significantly shorter period of time than current methods, while maintaining the integrity of the sample throughout the preparatory process. In addition to royalty payments on net sales on &#8220;licensed products,&#8221; we are obligated to make minimum royalty payments for each year that we retain the rights outlined in the patent license agreement and we are required to have our first commercial sale of the licensed products within one year following the issuance of the patent covered by the licensed technology. After re-negotiating the terms of the contract in 2013 the minimum annual royalty was $1,200 and $2,900 for the years ended 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Regulation 

&#160; 

Many of our activities are subject to regulation by governmental authorities within the United States and similar bodies outside of the United States. The regulatory authorities may govern the collection, testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, transportation, approval, advertising, and promotion of our products, as well as the training of our employees. 

&#160; 

All of our commercialization efforts to date are focused in the area of genomic, proteomic and small molecule sample preparation. We do not believe that our current Barocycler products used in sample preparation are considered &#8220;medical devices&#8221; under the United States Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the &#8220;FDA Act&#8221;) and we do not believe that we are subject to the law&#8217;s general control provisions that include requirements for registration, listing of devices, quality regulations, labeling and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. We also do not believe that we are subject to regulatory inspection and scrutiny. If, however, we are successful in commercializing PCT in applications beyond our current focus area of genomic, proteomic and small molecule sample preparation, such as protein purification, pathogen inactivation and immunodiagnostics, our products may be considered &#8220;medical devices&#8221; under the FDA Act, at which point we would be subject to the law&#8217;s general control provisions and regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the &#8220; FDA &#8221;) that include requirements for registration listing of devices, quality regulations, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. The process of obtaining approval to market these devices in the other potential applications of PCT would be costly and time consuming and could prohibit us from pursuing such markets. 

&#160; 

We may also become subject to the European Pressure Equipment Directive, which requires certain pressure equipment meet certain quality and safety standards. We do not believe that we are currently subject to this directive because our Barocycler instruments are below the threshold documented in the text of the directive. If our interpretation were to be challenged, we could incur significant costs defending the challenge, and we could face production and selling delays, all of which could harm our business. 

&#160; 

We self-certified that our Barocycler instrumentation was electromagnetically compatible, or &#8220;CE&#8221; compliant, which means that our Barocycler instruments meet the essential requirements of the relevant European health, safety and environmental protection legislation. In order to maintain our CE Marking, a requirement to sell equipment in many countries of the European Union, we are obligated to uphold certain safety and quality standards.

Employees 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, we had eleven (11) full-time employees and three (3) part-time employees. All employees enter into confidentiality agreements intended to protect our proprietary information. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. Our performance depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified professional, scientific and technical staff. The level of competition among employers for skilled personnel is high. Subject to our limited financial resources, we attempt to maintain employee benefit plans to enhance employee morale, professional commitment and work productivity and provide an incentive for employees to remain with us.
