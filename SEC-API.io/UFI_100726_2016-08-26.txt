 Item 1. Business 

&#160; 

Unifi, Inc., a New York corporation formed in 1969 (together with its subsidiaries, &#8220;we,&#8221; the &#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;Unifi&#8221;), is a multi-national manufacturing company that processes and sells high-volume commodity yarns, specialized yarns designed to meet certain customer specifications, and premium value-added (&#8220;PVA&#8221;) yarns with enhanced performance characteristics. The Company sells yarns made from polyester and nylon to other yarn manufacturers and knitters and weavers that produce fabric for the apparel, hosiery, home furnishings, automotive upholstery, industrial and other end-use markets. The Company&#8217;s polyester products include polyester polymer beads (&#8220;Chip&#8221;), partially oriented yarn (&#8220;POY&#8221;), textured, solution and package dyed, twisted, beamed and draw wound yarns. Each polyester product is available in virgin or recycled varieties, where the recycled is made from both pre-consumer yarn waste and post-consumer waste, including plastic bottles. The Company&#8217;s nylon products include textured, solution dyed and spandex covered products. 

&#160; 

The Company maintains one of the textile industry&#8217;s most comprehensive yarn product offerings, and has manufacturing operations in four countries and participates in joint ventures in Israel and the United States (&#8220;U.S.&#8221;). The Company&#8217;s principal geographic markets for its products are in North America, Central America, South America and Asia. 

&#160; 

The Company has three reportable segments. Operations and revenues for each segment are described below: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

The Polyester Segment manufactures Chip, POY, textured, dyed, twisted, beamed and draw wound yarns, both virgin and recycled, with sales primarily to other yarn manufacturers and knitters and weavers that produce yarn and/or fabric for the apparel, hosiery, home furnishings, automotive upholstery, industrial and other end-use markets. The Polyester Segment consists of sales and manufacturing operations in the U.S. and El Salvador. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

The Nylon Segment manufactures textured nylon yarns and spandex covered yarns, with sales to knitters and weavers that produce fabric primarily for the apparel and hosiery markets. The Nylon Segment consists of sales and manufacturing operations in the U.S. and Colombia. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

The International Segment&#8217;s products primarily include textured polyester and various types of resale yarns and staple fiber, both virgin and recycled. The International Segment sells its yarns and staple fiber to knitters and weavers that produce fabric for the apparel, automotive upholstery, home furnishings, industrial and other end-use markets primarily in the South American and Asian regions. The International Segment includes a manufacturing location and sales offices in Brazil and a sales office in China. 

&#160; 

Other information for the Company&#8217;s reportable segments is provided in Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to the Company&#8217;s reportable segments, the Company conducts certain revenue-producing activities outside of its core business, classified within an All Other category. The operations within All Other do not relate to the direct production or sale of yarn and are insignificant to the consolidated financial statements. 

&#160; 

In addition to the above consolidated operations, the Company maintains a 34% non-controlling partnership interest in Parkdale America, LLC (&#8220;PAL&#8221;), a significant unconsolidated affiliate. The investment in PAL provides diversity to the Company&#8217;s overall business in response to global textile trends. PAL is a producer of cotton and synthetic yarns for sale to the textile industry and apparel market, both foreign and domestic. PAL is a limited liability company treated as a partnership for income tax reporting purposes. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Principal Strategic and Operating Focus 

&#160; 

The Company reported net income of $34,415, or $1.93 per basic share, for fiscal 2016. Such results reflect (i) growth in sales of PVA products, especially in the International Segment, (ii) lower selling, general and administrative (&#8220;SG&#38;A&#8221;) expenses than in fiscal 2015 and (iii) lower polyester raw material costs than in fiscal 2015. The International Segment, which was resilient in a difficult economic environment, exhibited strength as the year progressed (especially with sales of PVA products), despite unfavorable impacts from devaluation of the Brazilian currency and soft economic conditions in China. Strong PVA sales are expected to continue to drive favorable results in the Americas and Asia. 

&#160; 

Core Business Strategies 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s successful performance reflects its core strategic focus: producing the highest quality, innovative and sustainable products for customers around the world. This strategic focus includes a number of supporting pillars, which include: continuously improving all operational and business processes; enriching the product mix by growing sales of higher-margin PVA products through all market opportunities; and deriving value from sustainability-based initiatives, including polyester and nylon recycling. The Company remains committed to these strategic initiatives, which it believes will increase profitability and generate improved cash flows from operations. 

&#160; 

PVA Products and REPREVE &#174; 

&#160; 

The Company remains committed to growing the business for its PVA products and believes its research and development work with brands and retailers continues to create new, world-wide sales opportunities. The Company believes it can continue to increase its global PVA sales by more than 10% per year to generate overall mix enrichment and margin gains. The Company&#8217;s PVA products now represent approximately 35% of consolidated net sales. The Company&#8217;s strategy of enhancing its product mix through a focus on PVA products has helped establish the Company as an innovation leader in its core markets and we believe provides insulation from the pressures of low-priced commodity yarn imports. 

&#160; 

REPREVE &#174; , the flagship brand in the Company&#8217;s PVA portfolio, continues to grow at a faster pace than other PVA products. As part of our efforts to expand consumer brand recognition of REPREVE &#174; , the Company has developed recycling-focused sponsorships with Marvel Universe LIVE!, the National Football League&#8217;s Detroit Lions, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and The North Face Endurance Challenge Series. The increasing success and consumer awareness of the REPREVE &#174; brand continues to provide new opportunities for growth, allowing us to expand into new end-uses and markets for REPREVE &#174; , as well as continuing to grow the brand with current customers. The Company continues to expand efforts toward consumer engagement, awareness and activation through the &#8220;REPREVE &#174; National Mobile Tour,&#8221; a custom truck and trailer designed to travel across the country educating consumers about the importance of recycling and the transformation process of REPREVE &#174; . Since October 2015, the REPREVE &#174; National Mobile Tour has appeared at sponsored events and retailers throughout the U.S. 

&#160; 

PVA Expansion and Capital Investments 

&#160; 

During fiscal 2016, we invested approximately $60,000 in capital projects, as we (i) neared completion of a bottle processing plant at an existing facility in Reidsville, North Carolina, (ii) commenced another expansion of our REPREVE &#174; Recycling Center which will allow the Company to increase its annual production capacity to approximately 100 million pounds, (iii) enhanced our automation systems in our Yadkinville, North Carolina POY facility to handle an increasingly-complex product mix, (iv) converted machinery to accommodate smaller production runs, and (v) further increased our air jet texturing capacity. These initiatives were designed to support our mix enrichment strategies, while also improving our ability to service customers. 

&#160; 

In fiscal 2017, the Company expects to invest approximately $40,000 in capital projects, which includes (i) completing the fourth REPREVE &#174; Recycling Center production line near the end of fiscal 2017, (ii) additional machinery modifications to meet the ever-changing demands of the market and (iii) investments in Asia to support growth as prominent brand and retail partners continue to respond well to our strategy to provide PVA products globally. As always, the Company will continue to ensure maintenance capital expenditures are sufficient to allow continued production at high efficiencies. As the bottle processing plant begins operating in August 2016, our goal is for continued support of REPREVE &#174; by securing a stream of high-quality raw materials. Our pursuit of high quality, combined with technology advancements in recycling that will be incorporated into the fiscal 2017 recycling expansion, will enhance our ability to continue to grow REPREVE &#174; into other markets such as nonwovens, carpet fiber and packaging. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

In addition to the Company&#8217;s primary capital investment plan, certain business combinations have occurred in fiscal 2015 and 2014. Although such acquisitions do not comprise material business combinations, each has been relevant to the Company&#8217;s recent performance, as described below: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

On December 2, 2013, the Company acquired certain draw winding assets and the associated business for $2,500. The acquisition increased the Company&#8217;s polyester production capacity and allowed the Company to expand its product offerings to include mid-tenacity flat yarns. 

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; 

On August 28, 2014, PAL paid $10,125 to acquire the remaining 50% ownership interest in a yarn manufacturer based in Mexico in which PAL was historically a 50% member. The acquisition increases PAL&#8217;s regional manufacturing capacity and expands its product offerings and customer base. PAL recorded acquired net assets of approximately $23,600. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

On February 27, 2015, PAL purchased two manufacturing facilities, plus inventory, for approximately $13,000 cash, and entered into a yarn supply agreement with the seller. The acquisition increases PAL&#8217;s regional manufacturing capacity and expands its product offerings and customer base. PAL recorded acquired assets of approximately $19,400. 

&#160; 

Developments in Principal Markets 

&#160; 

Apparel production is growing in the regions covered by the North American Free Trade Agreement (&#8220;NAFTA&#8221;) and the Central American Free Trade Agreement (&#8220;CAFTA&#8221;), which regions comprise the principal markets for the Company&#8217;s Polyester and Nylon Segments. The share of apparel production for these regions as a percentage of U.S. retail has stabilized at approximately 18%, while retail consumption has grown, especially for apparel made with synthetic yarns. The CAFTA region, which continues to be a competitive alternative to Asian supply chains for textile products, has maintained its share of synthetic apparel supply to U.S. retailers. The share of synthetic apparel versus cotton apparel has increased and provided growth for the consumption of synthetic yarns within the CAFTA region. The Company expects incremental growth in the CAFTA region for the foreseeable future, as retailers and brands maintain regional sourcing as part of their overall sourcing plans, retail sales grow, and consumer preferences continue to move from cotton to synthetic apparel. 

&#160; 

Our Brazilian subsidiary is primarily impacted by price pressures from imported fiber, fabric and finished goods; the inflation rate in Brazil; and devaluation of the Brazilian Real. The Company continues to work on (i) aggressively pursuing mix enrichment by working with customers to develop programs using our differentiated products as well as our branded PVA yarns, including REPREVE &#174; , and (ii) implementing process improvements and manufacturing efficiency gains that will help lower per-unit costs. 

&#160; 

In Asia, our Chinese subsidiary remains an important part of the Company&#8217;s global PVA strategy as it enhances our ability to service customers who have global supply chains. During fiscal 2016 and 2015, this subsidiary operated in soft market conditions with low capacity utilization rates throughout the Chinese textile industry. However, interest and demand for the Company&#8217;s PVA products in the region helped support strong sales volumes during this period. We are encouraged by projects undertaken with key brands and retailers, which include certain PVA programs that recently transitioned from the Company&#8217;s domestic operations. 

&#160; 

We expect the success of our Chinese subsidiary will provide a solid foundation for expansion into certain key markets in Asia, such as Sri Lanka and Vietnam, where customers have expressed additional interest in sourcing the Company&#8217;s products. As we expand our global operations, we will continue to evaluate the level of capital investment required to support the needs of our customers and appropriately allocate our resources accordingly. 

&#160; 

Stock Repurchases 

&#160; 

Pursuant to an initial stock repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors (the &#8220;Board&#8221;) in January 2013, the Company began periodic strategic repurchases of its common stock. That $50,000 repurchase program was completed in March of 2014. In April 2014, the Board approved a second $50,000 stock repurchase program. As of August 18, 2016, the Company has repurchased a total of 3,147 shares, at an average price of $23.01, under these repurchase programs. The Company will continue to evaluate opportunities to use excess cash flow from operations or existing borrowings to repurchase additional stock, while maintaining sufficient liquidity to support its operational needs and fund future strategic growth opportunities. 

&#160; 

Industry Overview 1 

&#160; 

The Company operates in the textile industry and, within that broad category, the respective markets for yarns, fabrics, fibers and end-use products such as apparel and hosiery, automotive upholstery, industrial products and home furnishings. Even though the textile industry is global, there are several distinctive regional or other geographic markets that often shape the business strategies and operations of participants in the industry. Because of free trade agreements and other trade regulations entered into by the U.S. government, the U.S. textile industry, which is otherwise a distinctive geographic market on its own, is often considered in conjunction with other geographic markets or regions in North, South and Central America, such as the regions covered by NAFTA and CAFTA. The Company&#8217;s principal markets for its domestic operations are in the regions covered by NAFTA and CAFTA, which together include the countries of Canada, Mexico, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic and the U.S.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

According to data compiled by PCI Xylenes &#38; Polyesters, a global leader in research and analysis for the polyester and raw materials markets, global demand for polyester yarns, which includes both filament and staple yarns, has grown steadily since 1980, and in calendar year 2003, polyester replaced cotton as the fiber with the largest percentage of worldwide sales. In calendar year 2015, global polyester consumption accounted for an estimated 55% of global fiber consumption, and global demand is projected to increase by approximately 4% annually through 2020. In calendar year 2015, global nylon consumption accounted for an estimated 5% of global fiber consumption. Softness in the U.S. retail market during fiscal 2016 had unfavorable impacts to the Company&#8217;s Nylon Segment. Additionally, there is a potential for focus on costs to drive the industry to transition from certain nylon-based products to polyester. The polyester and nylon fiber sectors together accounted for approximately 62% of North American textile consumption during calendar year 2015. 

&#160; 

According to the National Council of Textile Organizations, the U.S. textile industry&#8217;s total shipments were approximately $55.4 billion for calendar year 2015 as the U.S. textile and apparel industry exported nearly $23.7 billion of textile and apparel products, and the exports have grown by approximately 43% since 2009, an increase of over $7.1 billion. The U.S. textile industry remains a large manufacturing employer in the U.S. 

&#160; 

Trade Regulation and Rules of Origin 

&#160; 

The duty rate on imports into the U.S. of finished apparel categories that utilize polyester and nylon yarns generally range from 16% to 32%. For many years now, imports of fabric and finished goods into the U.S. have increased significantly from countries that do not participate in free trade agreements or trade preference programs, despite duties charged on those imports. The primary drivers for that growth were lower overseas operating costs, foreign government subsidization of textile industries, increased overseas sourcing by U.S. retailers, the entry of China into the World Trade Organization, and the staged elimination of all textile and apparel quotas. Although global apparel imports represent a significant percentage of the U.S. market, Regional FTAs (as described below), which follow general &#8220;yarn forward&#8221; rules of origin, provide duty free advantages for apparel made from regional fibers, yarns and fabrics, allowing the Company opportunities to participate in this growing market. 

&#160; 

A significant number of the Company&#8217;s customers in the apparel market produce finished goods that meet the eligibility requirements for duty-free treatment in the regions covered by NAFTA, CAFTA, and the Colombia and Peru free trade agreements (collectively, the &#8220;Regional FTAs&#8221;). These Regional FTAs contain rules of origin requirements in order for products covered by them to be eligible for duty-free treatment. In the case of textiles such as fabric, yarn (such as POY), fibers (filament and staple) and certain garments made from them, the products are generally required to be fully formed within the respective regions. The Company is the largest filament yarn manufacturer, and one of the few producers of qualifying synthetic yarns, in the regions covered by these agreements. 

&#160; 

U.S. legislation commonly referred to as the &#8220;Berry Amendment&#8221; stipulates that certain textile and apparel articles purchased by the U.S. Department of Defense must be manufactured in the U.S. and must consist of yarns and fibers produced in the U.S. The Company is the largest producer of synthetic yarns for Berry Amendment compliant programs. 

&#160; 

The Company refers to fibers sold with specific rules of origin requirements under the Regional FTAs and the Berry Amendment, as &#8220;Compliant Yarns.&#8221; Approximately two-thirds of the Company&#8217;s sales within the Polyester and Nylon Segments are sold as Compliant Yarns under the terms of the Regional FTAs or the Berry Amendment. 

&#160; 

The Company believes the requirements of the rules of origin and the associated duty-free cost advantages in the Regional FTAs, together with the Berry Amendment and the growing demand for supplier responsiveness and improved inventory turns, will ensure that a portion of the existing textile industry will remain based in the Americas. The Company expects that the NAFTA and CAFTA regions will continue to maintain their share of apparel production as a percentage of U.S. retail. The Company believes the remaining synthetic apparel production within these regional markets is more specialized and defensible, and, in some cases, apparel producers are bringing programs back to the regions as part of a balanced sourcing strategy for some retailers and brands. Because the Company is the largest of only a few significant producers of Compliant Yarns under these Regional FTAs, one of the Company&#8217;s business strategies is to continue to leverage its eligibility status for duty-free processing to increase its share of business with regional and domestic fabric producers who ship their products into these regions. 

&#160; 

Over the longer term, however, the textile industry in the U.S. and the NAFTA and CAFTA regions is likely to be impacted if and when the Trans-Pacific Partnership (&#8220;TPP&#8221;) trade agreement is implemented. Negotiations on the TPP were completed in October 2015 and the agreement was signed in February 2016. Signatory countries include Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Malaysia, Mexico, Japan, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, Vietnam and the U.S. The TPP includes a yarn forward rule of origin with limited exceptions and extended tariff phase-outs for sensitive textile and apparel products; initiatives that should help provide for the stability of the Western Hemisphere textile and apparel production chain in the initial stages of implementation. The U.S. and other TPP countries will need to ratify the agreement before it can be enacted. The Company&#8217;s long-term business strategies are also focused on ways to maintain the Company&#8217;s profitability if and when the TPP is implemented. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The industry in which the Company operates is global and highly competitive. The Company competes not only as a global yarn producer, but also as part of a regional supply chain for certain textile products. For sales of Compliant Yarns, the Company competes with a limited number of foreign and domestic producers of polyester and nylon yarns. For sales of non-Compliant Yarns, the Company competes with a larger number of foreign and domestic producers of polyester and nylon yarns, who can meet the required customer specifications of quality, reliability and timeliness. The Company is affected by imported textile, apparel and hosiery products, which adversely impact demand for the Company&#8217;s polyester and nylon products in certain of its markets. Several foreign competitors in the Company&#8217;s supply chain have significant competitive advantages, including lower wages, raw material costs and capital costs, and favorable currency exchange rates against the U.S. Dollar, any of which could make the Company&#8217;s products, or the related supply chains, less competitive. While competitors have traditionally focused on high-volume commodity products, they are now increasingly focused on specialty and value-added products for which the Company has been able to generate higher margins. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s major competitors for polyester yarns are O&#8217;Mara, Inc. and NanYa Plastics Corp. of America (&#8220;NanYa&#8221;) in the U.S.; AKRA, S.A. de C.V. in the NAFTA region; and C S Central America S.A. de C.V. in the CAFTA region. The Company&#8217;s major competitor in Brazil is Avanti Industria Comercio Importacao e Exportacao Ltda., among other traders of imported yarns and fibers. The Company&#8217;s major competitors for nylon yarns are Sapona Manufacturing Company, Inc. and McMichael Mills, Inc. in the U.S. 

&#160; 

Raw Materials, Suppliers and Sourcing 

&#160; 

The primary raw material supplier for the Polyester Segment for Chip and POY is NanYa. For the International Segment, Reliance Industries, Ltd (&#8220;Reliance&#8221;) is the main supplier for POY. The primary suppliers of POY to the Nylon Segment are HN Fibers, Ltd., U.N.F. Industries Ltd. (&#8220;UNF&#8221;), UNF America, LLC (&#8220;UNFA&#8221;), Invista S.a.r.l. (&#8220;INVISTA&#8221;), Universal Premier Fibers, LLC, and Nilit US (&#8220;Nilit&#8221;). Each of UNF and UNFA is a 50/50 joint venture between the Company and Nilit. Currently, there are multiple domestic and foreign suppliers available to fulfill the Company&#8217;s sourcing requirements for its recycled products. 

&#160; 

The Company produces and buys certain of its raw material fibers for Compliant Yarns from a variety of sources in both the U.S. and Israel. The Company produces a portion of its Chip requirements in its REPREVE &#174; Recycling Center and purchases the remainder of its requirements from external suppliers for use in its spinning facility. In addition, the Company purchases nylon and polyester products for resale from various suppliers. Although the Company does not generally have difficulty obtaining its raw material requirements, the Company has, in the past, experienced interruptions or limitations in the supply of certain raw materials. 

&#160; 

Among the expected benefits to the Company&#8217;s financial results, construction of its bottle processing facility is intended to secure a high-quality source of raw materials for the growing focus on recycled yarns. Therefore, in concert with the Company&#8217;s commitment to sustainability and highly-innovative products and processes, along with the REPREVE &#174; Recycling Center, the bottle processing facility is expected to provide a uniform, high-quality source of raw materials (i.e. plastic bottle flake) for internal consumption and potential sale to external parties. Combined with recent technology advancements in recycling, the bottle flake produced will enhance our ability to grow REPREVE &#174; into other markets such as nonwovens, carpet fiber and packaging. 

&#160; 

The price of the principal raw materials used by the Company fluctuates frequently, and it is difficult, and often impossible, to predict trends or upcoming developments. During the first three quarters of fiscal 2016, the Company operated under a predominantly declining polyester raw material cost environment. Polyester raw material prices increased slightly beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 due to a short-term increase in crude oil prices, and stayed at those levels through the end of fiscal 2016. The Company believes that polyester raw material costs during most of fiscal 2016 were impacted by lower crude oil values, a lack of major unplanned raw material capacity outages and soft global demand for polyester raw materials. The continuing softness in global crude oil prices is likely to impact the Company&#8217;s polyester and nylon raw material costs, but it is not possible to predict the timing or amount of the impact or whether the decline in crude oil prices will stabilize, continue or reverse. In any event, the Company monitors these dynamic factors closely. 

&#160; 

Products, Technologies and Related Markets 

&#160; 

The Company manufactures polyester yarn and related products in the U.S., El Salvador and Brazil, and nylon yarns in the U.S. and Colombia, for a wide range of end-uses. In addition, the Company purchases certain yarns and staple fiber for resale to its customers. The Company processes and sells POY, high-volume commodity yarns, and PVA and other specialty yarns in both domestic and international markets, with PVA yarns comprising approximately 35%, 30% and 27% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Company provides products to a variety of end-use markets, principally apparel, industrial, furnishings and automotive upholstery. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The domestic apparel market, which includes hosiery, represents approximately 65% of the Company&#8217;s sales. Apparel retail sales, supply chain inventory levels and strength of the regional supply base are vital to this market. Generally, synthetic apparel consumed in the U.S. grows 4% to 6% per year and, over the last five years, the Regional FTAs share of supply of U.S. synthetic apparel has remained constant at approximately 18%. 

&#160; 

The domestic industrial market represents approximately 16% of the Company&#8217;s sales. This market includes medical, belting, tapes, filtration, ropes, protective fabrics and awnings. 

&#160; 

The domestic furnishings market, which includes both contract and home furnishings, represents approximately 9% of the Company&#8217;s sales. Furnishings sales are largely dependent upon the housing market, which in turn is influenced by consumer confidence and credit availability. 

&#160; 

The domestic automotive upholstery market represents approximately 6% of the Company&#8217;s sales and has been less susceptible to import penetration because of the exacting specifications and quality requirements often imposed on manufacturers of automotive upholstery and the just-in-time delivery requirements. Effective customer service and prompt response to customer feedback are logistically more difficult for an importer to provide. 

&#160; 

The Company also adds value to the overall supply chain for textile products, and increases consumer demand for the Company&#8217;s own products, through the development and introduction of branded yarns and technologies that provide unique sustainability, performance, comfort and aesthetic advantages. The Company&#8217;s branded portion of its yarn portfolio continues to provide product differentiation to brands, retailers and consumers, and it includes products such as: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

REPREVE &#174; , a family of eco-friendly yarns made from recycled materials. Since its introduction in 2006, REPREVE &#174; has been the Company&#8217;s most successful branded product. The Company&#8217;s recycled fibers are manufactured to provide certain performance and/or functional properties to various types of fabrics and end products. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Sorbtek &#174; , a permanent moisture management yarn primarily used in performance base-layer applications, compression apparel, athletic bras, sports apparel, socks and other non-apparel related items. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Reflexx &#174; , a family of stretch yarns that can be found in a wide array of end-use applications, from home furnishings to performance wear and from hosiery and socks to work wear and denim. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

aio &#174; all-in-one performance yarns combine multiple performance properties into a single yarn. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Augusta &#174; , a cotton-like yarn with a soft, lofty hand that looks and feels like cotton, but offers the superior performance of synthetic and no fading. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

A.M.Y. &#174; , a yarn with permanent antimicrobial properties for odor control. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s branded yarns can be found in a variety of products of well-known brands, retailers and department stores including Ford, Haggar, Polartec, The North Face, Patagonia, Quiksilver, Roxy, Volcom, Perry Ellis, Greg Norman, Pottery Barn, adidas, Reebok, Nike, New Balance, MJ Soffe, Dockers, Levi&#8217;s, H&#38;M, TARGET, Walmart, Costco Wholesale, REI, Cabela&#8217;s, Sears, Macy&#8217;s, Kohl&#8217;s, Belk and more. 

&#160; 

In addition to the above brands and products, the Company combines its research and development efforts with the demands of customers and markets to develop innovative technologies that enhance yarn characteristics. Application of these technologies allows for various, separate benefits, including, among other things, water repellency, flame retardation, enhanced color-fastness achieved with less water use and protection from ultra-violet rays. 

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s Polyester Segment has approximately 350 customers, its Nylon Segment has approximately 150 customers and its International Segment has approximately 600 customers, all in a variety of geographic markets. The Company&#8217;s products are manufactured according to customer specifications and are shipped based upon customer order requirements. Customer payment terms are generally consistent across the segments and are based on prevailing industry practices for the sale of yarn domestically or internationally. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s consolidated net sales are not materially dependent on a single customer. No single customer accounts for ten percent or more of the Company&#8217;s consolidated net sales. The Company&#8217;s top ten customers accounted for approximately 33% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2016 and approximately 32% of receivables as of June 26, 2016. The Company&#8217;s net sales within its Nylon Segment are materially dependent upon a domestic customer that accounted for approximately 37% of the Nylon Segment&#8217;s net sales for fiscal 2016. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

The Company employs an internal sales force of approximately 40 persons operating out of sales offices in the U.S., Brazil, China, El Salvador, Colombia and Switzerland. The Company relies on independent sales agents for sales in several other countries. The Company seeks to create strong customer relationships and to build and strengthen those relationships throughout the supply chain. Through frequent communications with customers, partnering with customers in product development and engaging key downstream brands and retailers, the Company has created significant pull-through sales and brand recognition for its products. For example, the Company works with brands and retailers to educate and create demand for its PVA products. The Company then works with key fabric mill partners to develop specific fabrics for those brands and retailers utilizing its PVA products. In many of these regards, the Company draws upon and integrates the resources of its research and development personnel. In addition, the Company is enhancing co-branding activations with integrated point-of-sale and online marketing with popular brands and retailers to further enable consumers to find REPREVE &#174; and other PVA brands in multiple retail channels. Based on the establishment of many commercial and branded programs, this strategy has been successful for the Company. 

&#160; 

Product Customization and Manufacturing Processes 

&#160; 

The Company uses advanced production processes to manufacture its high quality yarns cost-effectively in North America, Central America and South America. The Company believes that its flexibility and know-how in producing specialty polyester and nylon yarns provides important development and commercialization advantages. 

&#160; 

The Company produces polyester POY and recycled polyester Chip for its commodity, PVA and other specialty yarns. Both the POY and Chip can be sold externally or further processed internally. Our REPREVE &#174; Recycling Center in North Carolina is our primary operation for producing recycled polyester Chip, a critical component in growing the market for REPREVE &#174; . 

&#160; 

Additional processing of the Company&#8217;s polyester yarn products includes texturing, package dyeing, twisting, beaming and draw winding. The texturing process, which is common to both polyester and nylon, involves the use of high-speed machines to draw, heat and false-twist POY to produce yarn with different physical characteristics, depending on its ultimate end-use. Texturing gives the yarn greater bulk, strength, stretch, consistent dye-ability and a softer feel, thereby making it suitable for use in the knitting and weaving of fabric. Package dyeing allows for matching of customer-specific color requirements for yarns sold into the automotive upholstery, home furnishings and apparel markets. Twisting incorporates real twist into filament yarns, which can be sold for a variety of uses, such as sewing thread, home furnishings and apparel. Beaming places both textured and covered yarns onto beams to be used by customers in warp knitting and weaving applications. The draw winding process utilizes heat and draws POY to produce mid-tenacity, flat yarns. 

&#160; 

Additional processing of the Company&#8217;s nylon yarn products primarily includes covering, which involves the wrapping or air entangling of filament or spun yarn around a core yarn, primarily spandex. This process enhances a fabric&#8217;s ability to stretch, recover its original shape and resist wrinkles while maintaining a softer feel. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s subsidiary in China offers the same high-quality and innovative PVA products and technologies to multiple of our international customers through contract manufacturing arrangements with trusted providers. This asset-light model currently in place in China allows for a seamless integration of our products into the global supply chain of our customers, especially as new yarns and technologies are adopted by major customers headquartered in the U.S. As we expand our Asian operations to meet the needs of our global customers, we will seek to continue to leverage the asset-light model where the existing Asian infrastructure can accommodate our highly-technical processes, but we will evaluate the need for additional Company assets in response to ever-changing market dynamics. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

The Company employs approximately 90 persons who work closely with the Company&#8217;s customers and others to develop a variety of yarns and improvements to the performance properties of existing yarns and fabrics. Among other things, the Company evaluates trends and uses the latest technology to create innovative specialty and PVA yarns that meet the needs of evolving consumer preferences. Most of the Company&#8217;s branded yarns discussed above, including its flagship REPREVE &#174; brand, were derived from its research and development initiatives. 

&#160; 

The Company also includes, as part of its research and development initiatives, the use of continuous improvement methodologies to increase its manufacturing and other operational efficiencies, both to enhance product quality and to derive cost savings. For fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company incurred $6,907, $8,113 and $7,921, respectively, for research and development (including salaries and benefits of the personnel involved in those efforts). In fiscal 2016, a portion of the activities traditionally attributed to research and development were allocated to certain of the significant, highly-technical capital projects discussed above. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

The Company has numerous U.S. registered trademarks. Due to its current brand recognition and potential growth opportunities, the Company believes that REPREVE &#174; is its most significant trademark. Ownership rights in U.S. registered trademarks do not expire if the trademarks are continued in use and properly protected. 

&#160; 

The Company licenses certain trademarks, including Dacron &#174; and Softec&#8482;, from INVISTA. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

The Company has approximately 2,700 employees, along with approximately 200 individuals working under temporary labor contracts. The number of employees in the Polyester Segment, Nylon Segment, International Segment and corporate office are approximately 1,500, 600, 500 and 100, respectively. While employees of the Company&#8217;s Brazilian operations are unionized, none of the labor force employed by the Company&#8217;s domestic or other foreign subsidiaries is currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement. 

&#160; 

Geographic Data 

&#160; 

Geographic information reported in conformance with generally accepted accounting principles is included in Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

The Company is not significantly impacted by seasonality; however, the Company typically experiences its (i) highest sales volumes in the third and fourth quarters and (ii) its lowest gross margins in the first quarter of its fiscal years. Excluding the effects of fiscal years with 53 weeks rather than 52 weeks, the most significant effects on the Company&#8217;s results of operations for particular periods during a year are due to planned manufacturing shutdowns by either the Company or its customers for certain holiday or traditional shutdown periods, which are not concentrated in any one particular season. 

&#160; 

Backlog 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s level of unfilled orders is affected by many factors, including the timing of specific orders and the delivery time for specific products, as well as the customer&#8217;s ability or inability to cancel the related order. As such, the Company does not consider the amount of unfilled orders, or backlog, to be a meaningful indicator of expected levels of future sales or to be material to an understanding of the Company&#8217;s business as a whole. 

&#160; 

Inflation 

&#160; 

The Company expects costs to continue to rise for certain consumables used to produce and ship its products, as well as for its utilities and certain employee costs and benefits. While the Company attempts to mitigate the impacts of such rising costs through its operational efficiencies and increased selling prices, inflation may become a factor that negatively impacts the Company&#8217;s profitability. 

&#160; 

Environmental Matters 

&#160; 

The Company is subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations limiting the use, storage, handling, release, discharge and disposal of a variety of hazardous substances and wastes used in or resulting from its operations (and to potential remediation obligations thereunder). These laws include the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the Clean Air Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (including provisions relating to underground storage tanks) and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly referred to as &#8220;Superfund&#8221; or &#8220;CERCLA,&#8221; and various state counterparts. The Company&#8217;s operations are also governed by laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health, principally the Occupational Safety and Health Act and regulations thereunder, which, among other things, establish exposure standards regarding hazardous materials and noise standards, and regulate the use of hazardous chemicals in the workplace. 

&#160; 

The Company believes that it has obtained, and is in compliance in all material respects with, all significant permits required to be issued by federal, state or local law in connection with the operation of its business. The Company also believes that the operation of its production facilities and the disposal of waste materials are substantially in compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations, and that there are no material ongoing or anticipated capital expenditures associated with environmental control facilities necessary to remain in compliance with such provisions. The Company incurs normal operating costs associated with the discharge of materials into the environment, but does not believe that these costs are material or inconsistent with its domestic competitors. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

On September 30, 2004, the Company completed its acquisition of the polyester filament manufacturing assets located in Kinston, North Carolina from INVISTA S.a.r.l (&#8220;Invista&#8221;). The land for the Kinston site was leased pursuant to a 99 year ground lease (&#8220;Ground Lease&#8221;) with E.I. DuPont de Nemours (&#8220;DuPont&#8221;). Since 1993, DuPont has been investigating and cleaning up the Kinston site under the supervision of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;) and the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources (&#8220;DENR&#8221;) pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Corrective Action program. The Corrective Action program requires DuPont to identify all potential areas of environmental concern (&#8220;AOCs&#8221;), to assess the extent of containment at the identified AOCs and to clean it up to comply with applicable regulatory standards. Effective March 20, 2008, the Company entered into a Lease Termination Agreement associated with conveyance of certain assets at Kinston to DuPont. This agreement terminated the Ground Lease and relieved the Company of any future responsibility for environmental remediation, other than participation with DuPont, if so called upon, with regard to the Company&#8217;s period of operation of the Kinston site, which was from 2004 to 2008. However, the Company continues to own a satellite service facility acquired in the INVISTA transaction that has contamination from DuPont&#8217;s operations and is monitored by DENR. This site has been remediated by DuPont, and DuPont has received authority from DENR to discontinue remediation, other than natural attenuation. DuPont&#8217;s duty to monitor and report to DENR will be transferred to the Company in the future, at which time DuPont must pay the Company for seven years of monitoring and reporting costs and the Company will assume responsibility for any future remediation and monitoring of the site. At this time, the Company has no basis to determine if or when it will have any responsibility or obligation with respect to the AOCs or the extent of any potential liability for the same. 

&#160; 

Repreve Renewables, LLC 

&#160; 

Repreve Renewables, LLC (&#8220;Renewables&#8221;), in which the Company has a 60% membership interest (and which is unrelated to the Company&#8217;s REPREVE&#174; products), is an agricultural company focused on the development, production and commercialization of miscanthus grass for use in the animal bedding, bio energy and bio-based products markets. Renewables&#8217; core crop is giant miscanthus. Renewables developed a proprietary suite of establishment (planting) technology marketed as ACCU YIELD System&#8482; which allows giant miscanthus rhizomes to be dug, processed and planted mechanically. 

&#160; 

Renewables was chosen to provide the agricultural and business development services for the University of Iowa&#8217;s Biomass Fuel Project. Renewables&#8217; primary focus, however, has been supplying THRIVEZ&#174;, a bedding product made from its proprietary varieties of giant miscanthus, to the U.S. poultry bedding market. Renewables has been trialing THRIVEZ&#174; in poultry houses for a number of the largest poultry integrators, as Renewables believes THRIVEZ&#174; offers competitive advantages to that potential market. Renewables has approximately 3,500 acres planted (on leased land and through contract grower agreements) across the U.S. 

&#160; 

During fiscal year 2016, Renewables entered into a secured debt financing arrangement, consisting of a master loan agreement and corresponding term loan supplement having a borrowing capacity of $4,000, with CoBank, ACB and Carolina Farm Credit, ACA. Renewables borrowed $4,000 against such arrangement, which provided liquidity in fiscal 2016 to (i) construct a new processing center in North Carolina, (ii) secure additional land leases and (iii) plant additional acreage, all intended to accommodate the demand for giant miscanthus. In connection with this arrangement, a subsidiary of the Company is subject to joint and several liability in the event of recourse by the lenders. 

&#160; &#160; 

Unconsolidated Affiliates 

&#160; 

The Company participates in two joint ventures that are suppliers to the Company&#8217;s Nylon Segment, with one located in the U.S. and one in Israel. The Company also participates in PAL, as discussed above. As of June 26, 2016, the Company had $117,412 recorded for these investments in unconsolidated affiliates. For fiscal 2016, $8,963 of the Company&#8217;s $48,243 of income before income taxes was generated from its investments in these unconsolidated affiliates, of which $6,074 was attributable to PAL. Other information regarding the Company&#8217;s unconsolidated affiliates is provided in &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; and in Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
