General 

&#160;

We are an international renewable fuels and biochemicals company focused on the production of advanced fuels and chemicals through the acquisition, development and commercialization of innovative technologies that replace traditional petroleum-based products by conversion of first-generation ethanol and biodiesel plants into advanced biorefineries. We operate in two reportable geographic segments: &#8220;North America&#8221; and &#8220;India.&#8221; For revenue and other information regarding our operating segments, see Note 13- Segment Information, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 

&#160;

We were incorporated in Nevada in 2006. 

&#160;

We own and operate a 60 million gallon per year ethanol production facility located in Keyes, California (the Keyes plant). The facility produces its own combined heat and power (CHP) through the use of a natural gas-powered steam turbine, and reuses 100% of its process water with zero water discharge. In addition to ethanol, the Keyes plant produces Wet Distillers Grains (WDG), corn oil, and Condensed Distillers Solubles (CDS), all of which are sold to local dairies and feedlots as animal feed. The primary feedstock for the production of low carbon fuel ethanol at the Keyes facility is Number Two yellow dent corn. The corn is procured from various Midwestern grain facilities and shipped, via Union Pacific Rail Road, to an unloading facility adjacent to the plant. 

&#160;

We own and operate a biodiesel production facility in Kakinada, India (the Kakinada plant) with a nameplate capacity of 150,000 metric tons per year, which is equal to 50 million gallons per year. We believe this facility is one of the largest biodiesel production facilities in India on a nameplate capacity basis. Our objective is to continue to capitalize on the substantial growth potential of the industry in India and established markets in the EU and U.S. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Strategy 

&#160;

Key elements of our strategy include: 

&#160;

North America 

&#160;

Leverage Approved Feedstock Pathways . Besides our use of corn as our primary feedstock, when economically advantageous, we will also utilize grain sorghum (&#8220;milo&#8221;) as an advanced feedstock for the production of biofuels. We have been approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) to use the milo pathway (in combination with landfill gas and CHP) for the production of advanced biofuels and associated higher value D5 Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs). The economics during 2014 and 2015 favored the use of corn over milo. This was largely due to the significant export demand for milo by China. During 2016, we anticipate processing milo as a feedstock. 

&#160;

Leverage the Keyes plant infrastructure and location . As milo becomes price-competitive with corn, the Keyes plant has the brokerage and infrastructure relationships in place to incorporate this feedstock into production without delay. Through its strategic location with adjacent access to the Union Pacific railroad and near the Port of Stockton, the Keyes plant can, and has, procured milo from both domestic and international sources. Additionally, the Keyes Plant has ready access to biogas through its existing infrastructure for the production of advanced biofuels under the approved EPA milo pathway. We have also entered into a multi-year contract with Chromatin, Inc., an advanced milo seed and technology provider, to establish a multi-thousand acre local milo growing program with farmers in California&#8217;s Central Valley. In 2014, we were awarded a $3 million dollar matching grant from the California Energy Commission for the acquisition of milo for the production of lower carbon fuel ethanol, and to fully develop the in-state milo growing program. We expect to receive proceeds from the grant in 2016. 

&#160;

&#160; Leverage technology for the development and production of additional advanced biofuels and renewable chemicals . In July 2011, we acquired Zymetis, Inc., a biochemical research and development firm, with several patents pending and in-process R&#38;D utilizing the Z-microbe&#8482; to produce renewable chemicals and advanced fuels from renewable feedstocks. We have been awarded ten patents for the production of advanced biofuels. Our objective is to continue to commercialize this technology and expand the production of advanced biofuel technologies and other bio-chemicals in the United States. 

&#160;

Diversify and expand revenue and cash flow by continuing to develop and adopt value-added byproduct processing systems . During April 2012, we installed a distillers corn oil extraction unit at the Keyes plant and began extracting corn oil for sale into the livestock feed market beginning in May 2012. During 2014, we installed a second oil extraction system to further improve corn oil yields from this process. We continue to evaluate and, as allowed by available financing and incremental profitability, adopt additional value-added processes that increase the value of the ethanol, distillers grain, corn oil and CO 2 produced at the Keyes plant, including adding liquefied CO 2 processing capability. 

&#160;

Joint venture or license our technologies to other ethanol and biodiesel plants . After developing and commercially demonstrating technologies at the Keyes and/or Kakinada plants, we plan to explore and evaluate opportunities for joint ventures or to license our technologies to the other approximately 200 ethanol plants and hundreds of biodiesel plants in the U.S., as well as plants in Brazil, Argentina, India and elsewhere. 

&#160;

Evaluate and pursue technology acquisition opportunities . We intend to evaluate and pursue opportunities to acquire technologies and processes that result in accretive value opportunities as financial resources and business prospects make the acquisition of these technologies advisable. In addition, we may also seek to acquire companies, or enter into licensing agreements or form joint ventures with companies that offer prospects for the adoption of accretive technologies. 

&#160;

Acquire additional biofuels production facilities . There are approximately 200 ethanol plants in the U.S. that could be upgraded to expand revenues and improve cash flow using technology commercially deployed or licensed by us. On an opportunistic basis, we will evaluate the benefit of acquiring ownership of a portion of or all of other biodiesel production facilities, or entering into joint-venture or licensing agreements with other ethanol, renewable diesel or renewable jet fuel facilities. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

India 

&#160;

Capitalize on recent policy changes by the Government of India, particularly those reducing the subsidies on diesel, reducing unfair taxation of feedstock and reducing restrictions on sales of fuel into the transportation markets . We plan to expand our marketing channels for the traditional bulk and transportation biodiesel markets, which are becoming more economically attractive as a result of reduced government subsidies on petroleum diesel (biodiesel is not subsidized in India) and policies to further open sales into the bulk fuel markets. 

&#160;

Expand alternative market demand for biodiesel and its byproducts . We plan to create additional demand for our biodiesel and its byproducts by developing additional alternative markets. In 2011, we began selling biodiesel to textile manufacturers for use as an anti-static chemical. In the first quarter of 2012, we completed glycerin refining and oil pre-treatment units and began selling refined glycerin to manufacturers of paints and adhesives. In 2012, our India subsidiary received an Indian Pharmacopeia license, which enables the sale of refined glycerin to the pharmaceutical industry in India. 

&#160;

Continue to develop international markets. We expect to increase sales by selling our biodiesel into international markets. During 2014, we completed the construction of a biodiesel distillation column, which allows us to produce a high-quality biodiesel product meeting European Union standards. We received the certifications necessary to meet the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) standard, allowing for further access to European markets for our biodiesel products. During 2015, we obtained the pathway certification permitting importation of biodiesel into California. 

&#160;

Diversify our feedstocks from India and international sources. We designed our Kakinada plant with the capability to produce biodiesel from multiple feedstocks. In 2009, we began to produce biodiesel from non- refined palm oil (NRPO). During 2014, we further diversified our feedstock with the introduction of animal oils and fats, which we used for the production of biodiesel to be sold into the European markets. The Kakinada plant is capable of producing biodiesel from used cooking oil (UCO), which can be supplied from China, the Middle East and other foreign markets, as well as domestic India suppliers. 

&#160;

Develop and commercially deploy technologies to produce high-margin products. The technology applicable to the Keyes plant for the upgrade of corn oil into valuable, high-margin products also applies to the Kakinada plant in India. By using the existing equipment, process controls, utilities and personnel at the Kakinada plant, we plan to produce high-value products more quickly and at a lower capital and operating cost than greenfield projects. 

&#160;

2015 Highlights 

&#160;

North America 

&#160;

During 2015, we produced four products at the Keyes plant: denatured ethanol, WDG, corn oil, and CDS. We sold 100% of the ethanol and WDG produced to J.D. Heiskell pursuant to a Purchase Agreement established with J.D. Heiskell. J.D. Heiskell in turn sells 100% of our ethanol to Kinergy Marketing LLC ("Kinergy") and 100% of our WDG to A.L. Gilbert Co. ("A.L.Gilbert"), a local feed and grain business. We sell corn oil to local animal feedlots (primarily poultry) through J.D. Heiskell as well as other feed mills in small amounts for use in various animal feed products. Small amounts of CDS were sold to various local third parties as an animal feed supplement. Ethanol pricing for sales to J.D. Heiskell is determined pursuant to a marketing agreement between Kinergy and us, and is generally based on daily and monthly pricing for ethanol delivered to the San Francisco Bay Area as published by the Oil Price Information Service (OPIS), as well as quarterly contracts negotiated by Kinergy with numerous fuel blenders. The price for WDG is determined monthly pursuant to a marketing agreement between A.L. Gilbert, and us, and is generally determined in reference to the local price of dry distillers grains (DDG), corn, and other protein feedstuffs. 

&#160;

The following table sets forth information about our production and sales of ethanol and WDG for 2015 compared with 2014:

&#160;

India 

&#160;

The market for biodiesel improved during early 2015 upon deregulation of the diesel market prices in India, the elimination of the inverted tax on feedstock, and the government approval to sell biodiesel to bulk customers. Our production of biodiesel in 2015 increased compared to 2014 due to these policy changes. During 2015, we secured a major fleet customer, who has demonstrated the viability of operating a fleet of vehicles using biodiesel. 

&#160;

In 2015, we produced two products at the Kakinada plant: biodiesel and refined glycerin. Crude glycerin produced as a by-product of the biodiesel production was further processed into refined glycerin. 

&#160;

The following table sets forth information about our production and sales of biodiesel and refined glycerin in 2015 and 2014:

1 metric ton is equal to 1,000 kilograms (approximately 2,204 pounds). 

&#160;

The Kakinada plant was originally designed to include four production units: biodiesel, refined glycerin, oil refining and fractionation. To date, the biodiesel, refined glycerin and oil refining units have been completed. In order to complete the fractionation unit, we will need to purchase and install additional equipment at an additional cost of approximately $2 million. 

&#160;

Biodiesel pricing in India is indexed to the price of petroleum diesel, and as such, the increase in the price of petroleum diesel is expected to favorably impact the profitability of our Indian operations. 

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

North America 

&#160;

According to the U.S. Energy Information Agency (EIA), there were approximately 195 operating commercial fuel ethanol production facilities in the U.S. with a combined nameplate production of approximately 14.75 billion gallons per year in 2015. The production of ethanol is a commodity-based business, and producers compete on the basis of price. We sell ethanol into the Northern California market; however, since insufficient production capacity exists in California to supply the state&#8217;s total fuel ethanol demand (in excess of one billion gallons), we compete with ethanol transported into California from Midwestern producers. Similarly, our co-products, principally WDG and corn oil, are sold into California markets and compete with WDG and corn oil transported into the California markets as well as alternative feed products. 

&#160;

India 

&#160;

With respect to biodiesel sold as fuel, we compete primarily with the producers of petroleum diesel, which are the three state-controlled oil companies: Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum, and two private oil companies: Reliance Petroleum and Essar Oil, all of whom have significantly larger market shares than we do and control a significant share of the distribution network. These competitors may also purchase our product for blending and further sales to their customers. We compete primarily on the basis of price. The price of biodiesel is indexed to the price of petroleum diesel, which, during 2015, was allowed to float to market pricing by the Indian government. Prior to 2015, the Indian government subsidized state-controlled oil companies, creating a disparity between the cost of oil on the open market and the price we could obtain from sales of biodiesel. In 2015, the Indian government allowed for the sale of biodiesel to bulk fuel customers. We believe the elimination of subsidies and the lifting of certain restrictions on the sale of bulk fuels will have a positive effect on our margins and will increase the business, operating results and financial condition of our India segment during 2016. With respect to international markets, principally the European markets, we compete with biodiesel from Europe, Argentina, Indonesia and Malaysia, some of which subsidize their biodiesel industry using government payment and taxation programs to promote the sales of their products into these markets. &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

With respect to biodiesel sold for manufacturing purposes, we compete with specialty chemical manufacturers selling products into the textile industries primarily on the basis of price. With respect to crude and refined glycerin, we compete with other glycerin producers and refiners selling products into the personal care, paints and adhesive markets primarily on the basis of price and product quality. 

&#160;

Customers 

&#160;

North America 

&#160;

All of our ethanol and WDG are sold to J.D. Heiskell pursuant to a purchase agreement. J.D. Heiskell in turn sells all of our ethanol to Kinergy and all of our WDG to A.L. Gilbert. Kinergy markets and sells our ethanol to petroleum refiners and blenders in Northern California. A.L. Gilbert markets and sells our WDG to approximately 200 dairy and feeding operators in Northern California. 

&#160;

India 

&#160;

During 2015, we derived 82% and 18% of our sales from biodiesel and refined glycerin respectively. Out of the 82% of biodiesel sales, only one customer accounted for more than 10% of our sales of biodiesel at 56%. None of our refined glycerin customers have accounted for more than 10% of our sales on the consolidated India segment revenues in 2015. During 2014, we derived 73%, 17%, and 10% of our sales from biodiesel, refined glycerin, and fees earned on processing biodiesel, respectively. Out of the 73% of biodiesel sales, two customers accounted for more than 10% of our sales of biodiesel, with 38% from an export customer and 16% from a domestic customer. None of the refined glycerin customers accounted for more than 10% of total sales of our India segment in 2014. 

&#160;

Pricing 

&#160;

North America 

&#160;

We sell 100% of the ethanol and WDG we produce to J.D. Heiskell. Ethanol pricing is determined pursuant to a marketing agreement between Kinergy and us, and is generally based on daily and monthly pricing for ethanol delivered to the San Francisco Bay Area in California, as published by the Oil Price Information Service (OPIS), as well as the terms of quarterly contracts negotiated by Kinergy with local fuel blenders and available premiums for fuel with low Carbon Intensity (CI) as provided by California&#8217;s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS). The price for WDG is determined monthly pursuant to a marketing agreement between A.L. Gilbert and us, and is generally determined in reference to the price of DDG, corn, and other protein feedstuffs, based on local pricing in California&#8217;s Central Valley. 

&#160;

India 

&#160;

In India, the price of biodiesel is based on the price of petroleum diesel, which floats with changes in the price determined by the international markets. Biodiesel sold into Europe is based on the spot market price. We sell our biodiesel primarily to resellers, distributors and refiners on an as-needed basis. We have no long-term sales contracts. Our biodiesel pricing is indexed to the price of petroleum diesel, and the increase in the price of petroleum diesel is expected to favorably impact the profitability of our India operations. 

&#160;

Raw Materials and Suppliers 

&#160;

North America 

&#160;

We entered into a Corn Procurement and Working Capital Agreement with J.D. Heiskell in March 2011, which we amended in May 2013 (the &#8220;Heiskell Agreement&#8221;). Under the Heiskell Agreement, we agreed to procure Number Two yellow dent corn from J.D. Heiskell. We have the ability to obtain corn from other sources subject to certain conditions, however, in 2015, all of our corn requirements were purchased from J.D. Heiskell. Title to the corn and risk of loss pass to us when the corn deposited into our weigh bin. We purchased no milo from J.D. Heiskell during 2015. The agreement is automatically renewed for additional one-year terms. The current term is set to expire on December 31, 2016. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

India 

&#160;

A number of edible oil processing facilities that produce NRPO as a byproduct surround the Kakinada plant. In 2015, all of our biodiesel was produced from animal oils and fats or NRPO. The receiving capabilities of the Kakinada plant allow for import of feedstock using the local port at Kakinada plant. During 2015 and 2014, we imported crude palm oil for further processing into refined palm oil and imported crude glycerin for further processing into refined glycerin. In addition to feedstock, the Kakinada plant requires quantities of methanol and chemical catalysts for use in the biodiesel production process. These chemicals are also readily available and sourced from a number of suppliers surrounding the Kakinada plant. We are not dependent on sole source or limited source suppliers for any of our raw materials or chemicals. 

&#160;

Sales and Marketing 

&#160;

North America 

&#160;

As part of our obligations under the Heiskell Agreement, we entered into a purchase agreement with J.D. Heiskell, pursuant to which we granted J.D. Heiskell exclusive rights to purchase 100% of the ethanol and WDG we produce at prices based upon the price established by the marketing agreements with Kinergy and A.L. Gilbert. In turn, J.D. Heiskell agreed to resell all the ethanol to Kinergy (or any other purchaser we designate) and all of the WDG to A.L. Gilbert. 

&#160;

In March 2011, we entered into a WDG Purchase and Sale Agreement with A.L. Gilbert, pursuant to which A.L. Gilbert agreed to market on an exclusive basis all of the WDG we produce. The agreement is automatically renewed for additional one-year terms. The current term is set to expire on December 31, 2016. 

&#160;

In October 2010, we entered into an exclusive marketing agreement with Kinergy to market and sell our ethanol. The agreement is automatically renewed for additional one-year terms. The current term is set to expire on August 31, 2016. 

&#160;

India 

&#160;

We sell our biodiesel and crude glycerin (i) to end-users utilizing our own sales force and independent sales agents and (ii) to brokers who resell the product to end-users. We pay a sales commission on sales arranged by independent sales agents. 

&#160;

Commodity Risk Management Practices 

&#160;

North America 

&#160;

The cost of corn and the price of ethanol are volatile and the correlation of these commodities form the basis for the profit margin at our Keyes plant. We are, therefore, exposed to commodity price risk. Our risk management strategy is to operate in the physical market by purchasing corn and selling ethanol on a daily basis at the then prevailing market price. We monitor these prices daily to test for an overall positive variable contribution margin. We periodically explore methods of mitigating the volatility of our commodity prices; however, during 2015 we did not engage in any specific programs. We intend to opportunistically purchase milo when market conditions present favorable conditions. Similarly, with the EPA certification received in August 2013, we intend to opportunistically purchase the combination of milo and biogas to generate advanced biofuel RIN credits, when market conditions present favorable margins. 

&#160;

India 

&#160;

The cost of NRPO and the price of biodiesel are volatile and are generally uncorrelated. We therefore are exposed to ongoing and substantial commodity price risk. Our risk management strategy is to produce biodiesel in India only when we believe we can generate positive gross margins and to idle the Kakinada plant during periods of low or negative gross margins. During 2014, we introduced animal oil and fats as a means of further diversifying our feedstock and improving margins. 

&#160;

In addition, to minimize our commodity risk, we modified the processes within our facility to utilize lower cost NRPO, which enables us to reduce our feedstock costs. Our ability to mitigate the risk of falling biodiesel prices is more limited. The price of our biodiesel is generally indexed to the price of petroleum diesel, which is set by the Indian government. During January 2015 the Indian government fully lifted subsidies for diesel by increasing the sales price of diesel to the market price. 

&#160;

We have in the past, and may in the future, use forward purchase contracts and other hedging strategies; however, the extent to which we engage in these risk management strategies may vary substantially from time to time depending on market conditions and other factors. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Research and Development 

&#160;

Our R&#38;D efforts consist of working to develop and commercialize our existing microbial technology, to evaluate third party technologies and to expand the production of ethanol and other renewable bio-chemicals in the United States. The primary objective of this development activity is to optimize the production of ethanol using either our proprietary, patent-pending enzyme technology for large-scale commercial production or the evaluation of third party technologies which have promise for large-scale commercial adoption at one of our operating facilities. Our innovations are protected by several issued or pending patents. We are in the process of filing additional patents that will further strengthen our portfolio. Some core intellectual property has been exclusively and indefinitely licensed from the University of Maryland. R&#38;D expense was $0.5 million in each of 2015 and 2014. 

&#160;

Patents and Trademarks 

&#160;

We have filed a number of trademark applications within the U.S. We do not consider the success of our business, as a whole, to be dependent on these trademarks. In addition, we hold ten awarded patents in the United States. We also hold related patents in major foreign jurisdictions. Our patents cover the Z-microbe TM and production of cellulosic ethanol. We intend to develop, maintain and secure further intellectual property rights and pursue new patents to expand upon our current patent base. 

We have acquired exclusive rights to patented technology in support of the development and commercialization of our products, and we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary technology in developing potential products. We continue to place significant emphasis on securing global intellectual property rights and we are pursuing new patents to expand upon our strong foundation for commercializing products in development. 

&#160;

We have received, and in the future may receive additional, claims of infringement of other parties&#8217; proprietary rights. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings, below. Infringement or other claims could be asserted or prosecuted against us in the future, and it is possible that future assertions or prosecutions could harm our business. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel, cause delays in the development of our products, or require us to develop non-infringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing arrangements. Such royalty or licensing arrangements, if required, may require us to license back our technology or may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. 

&#160;

Environmental and Regulatory Matters 

&#160;

North America 

&#160;

We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and permit conditions, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the air, water and ground, the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials, and the health and safety of our employees. These laws, regulations and permits require us to incur, on an annual basis, significant capital costs. These include, but are not limited to, testing and monitoring plant emissions, and where necessary, obtaining and maintaining mitigation processes to comply with regulations. They may also require us to make operational changes to limit actual or potential impacts to the environment. A significant violation of these laws, regulations, permits or license conditions could result in substantial fines, criminal sanctions, permit revocations and/or facility shutdowns. In addition, environmental laws and regulations change over time, and any such changes, more vigorous enforcement policies or the discovery of currently unknown conditions may require substantial additional environmental expenditures. 

&#160;

We are also subject to potential liability for the investigation and cleanup of environmental contamination at each of the properties that we own or operate and at off-site locations where we arrange for the disposal of hazardous wastes. If significant contamination is identified at our properties in the future, costs to investigate and remediate this contamination as well as costs to investigate or remediate associated damage could be significant. If any of these sites are subject to investigation and/or remediation requirements, we may be responsible under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (&#8220;CERCLA&#8221;) or other environmental laws for all or part of the costs of such investigation and/or remediation, and for damage to natural resources. We may also be subject to related claims by private parties alleging property damage or personal injury due to exposure to hazardous or other materials at or from such properties. While costs to address contamination or related third-party claims could be significant, based upon currently available information, we are not aware of any material contamination or any such third party claims. Based on our current assessment of the environmental and regulatory risks, we have not accrued any amounts for environmental matters as of December 31, 2015. The ultimate costs of any liabilities that may be identified or the discovery of additional contaminants could materially adversely impact our results of operation or financial condition. 

&#160;

In addition, the production and transportation of our products may result in spills or releases of hazardous substances, which could result in claims from governmental authorities or third parties relating to actual or alleged personal injury, property damage, or damage to natural resources. We maintain insurance coverage against some, but not all, potential losses caused by our operations. Our general and umbrella liability policy coverage includes, but is not limited to, physical damage to assets, employer&#8217;s liability, comprehensive general liability, automobile liability and workers&#8217; compensation. We do not carry environmental insurance. We believe that our insurance is adequate for our industry, but losses could occur for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage. The occurrence of events which result in significant personal injury or damage to our property, natural resources or third parties that is not covered by insurance could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Our air emissions are subject to the federal Clean Air Act, and similar state laws, which generally require us to obtain and maintain air emission permits for our ongoing operations as well as for any expansion of existing facilities or any new facilities. Obtaining and maintaining those permits requires us to incur costs, and any future more stringent standards may result in increased costs and may limit or interfere with our operating flexibility. These costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Because other ethanol manufacturers in the U.S. are and will continue to be subject to similar laws and restrictions, we do not currently believe that our costs to comply with current or future environmental laws and regulations will adversely affect our competitive position with other U.S. ethanol producers. However, because ethanol is produced and traded internationally, these costs could adversely affect us in our efforts to compete with foreign producers who are not subject to such stringent requirements. 

&#160;

New laws or regulations relating to the production, disposal or emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases may require us to incur significant additional costs with respect to ethanol plants that we build or acquire. For example, in 2007, Illinois and four other Midwestern states entered into the Midwestern Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord, which directs participating states to develop a multi-sector cap-and-trade mechanism to help achieve reductions in greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide. We currently conduct our North American commercial activities exclusively in California, however, it is possible that other states in which we plan to conduct business could join this accord or require other carbon dioxide emissions reductions. Climate change legislation is being considered in Washington, D.C. this year which may significantly impact the biofuels industry&#8217;s emissions regulations, as will the Renewable Fuel Standard, California&#8217;s Low Carbon Fuel Standard, and other potentially significant changes in existing transportation fuels regulations.

We are subject to national, state and local environmental laws, regulations and permits, including with respect to the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials, and the health and safety of our employees. These laws may require us to make operational changes to limit actual or potential impacts to the environment. A violation of these laws, regulations or permits can result in substantial fines, natural resource damages, criminal sanctions, permit revocations and/or facility shutdowns. In addition, environmental laws and regulations (and interpretations thereof) change over time, and any such changes, more vigorous enforcement policies or the discovery of currently unknown conditions may require substantial additional environmental expenditures.

Employees 

&#160;

At December 31, 2015, we had a total of 135 full-time equivalent employees, comprised of 13 full-time and three part-time equivalent employees in our corporate offices, 46 full-time equivalent employees at the Keyes plant, two full-time equivalent employees in our Maryland research and development facility and 71 full-time equivalent employees in India. 

&#160;

We believe that our employees are highly-skilled, and our success will depend in part upon our ability to retain our employees and attract new qualified employees, many of whom are in great demand. We have never had a work stoppage or strike, and no employees are presently represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe our relations with our employees are good.
