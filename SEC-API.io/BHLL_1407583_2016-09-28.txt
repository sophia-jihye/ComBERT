 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160;

The Corporation 

&#160;

Liberty Silver Corp. (&#8220;Liberty Silver&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221; or the &#8220;Corporation&#8221;) was incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada, U.S.A on February 20, 2007 under the name Lincoln Mining Corp. Pursuant to a Certificate of Amendment dated February 11, 2010, the Company changed its name to Liberty Silver Corp. The Company&#8217;s registered office is located at 1802 N. Carson Street, Suite 212, Carson City Nevada 89701, and its head office is located at 390 Bay Street, Suite 806, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, M5H 2Y2, and its telephone number is 888-749-4916.

&#160;

Current Operations 

&#160;

Overview 

&#160;

The Company was incorporated for the purpose of engaging in mineral exploration activities, and on May 24, 2007, purchased the Zone Lode mining claim located in Elko County, Nevada, for a purchase price of $10,000. The objective was to conduct mineral exploration activities on the Zone Lode claim to assess whether it contained economic reserves of copper, gold, silver, molybdenum or zinc. The Company was not able to determine whether this property contained reserves that were economically recoverable and as a result, ceased to explore this property. The Company&#8217;s current business operations are focused on exploring and developing the Trinity Silver property located in Pershing County, Nevada (the &#8220;Trinity Project&#8221;).

&#160;

The Trinity Project consists of a total of approximately 10,020 acres, including 5,676 acres of fee land and 253 unpatented mining claims located along the west flank of the Trinity Range in Pershing County, Nevada, about 25 miles by road northwest of Lovelock, NV, the county seat. The annual cost to maintain the 253 claims is approximately $35,420 per year ($140 per claim per year). As at June 30, 2016, due to the lack of funding available to the Company, exploration progress is not on schedule with the Company&#8217;s exploration and evaluation plan and as a result of these circumstances, the related carrying value of the properties may not be recoverable. The Company has therefore recorded an impairment charge related to the Trinity Project and reduced its carrying amount of the Trinity Project to $1 on the balance sheet for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. 

&#160;

On July 29, 2005, AuEx, Inc., a Nevada corporation, acquired a 100% leasehold interest in the Trinity Project pursuant to the terms of a Minerals Lease and Sublease Agreement entered into by and between AuEx, Inc., and Newmont Mining USA, Ltd (the &#8220;Minerals Lease and Sublease&#8221;). The Company acquired its interest in the Trinity Project on March 29, 2010, through execution of an Exploration Earn-In Agreement with AuEx, Inc (the &#8220;Earn-In Agreement&#8221;). The Earn-In Agreement is subject to the rights and obligations of AuEx, Inc. and its successors and assigns under the Minerals Lease and Sublease. The Minerals Lease and Sublease and the Earn-In Agreement are more fully described below (See Item 2 PROPERTIES &#8211; Trinity Project Agreements). 

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s business operations are currently focused on efforts to explore the Trinity Project. The Company has not yet commenced development stage activities, however, subject to the availability of adequate funding, the Company intends to engage in efforts to develop the Trinity Project in the future. The Company foresees future operations at the Trinity Project consisting of (i) an effort to expand the known mineralized material through drilling, (ii) permitting for operation, if deemed economically viable, (iii) metallurgical studies aimed at enhancing the recovery of the silver and by-product lead and zinc, and (iv) engineering design related to potential construction of a new mine. Exploration of the property would be conducted simultaneously with the mine development in order to locate additional mineralized materials.

Products 

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s anticipated product will be precious and base metal-bearing concentrates and/or precious metal bullion produced from ores from mineral deposits which it hopes to discover and exploit through exploration and acquisition. The Company anticipates such products will be silver, lead and zinc.

&#160;

Infrastructure 

&#160;

The Trinity Project is situated in western Nevada, a locale that is host to many metal mines, mining equipment companies, drilling companies, mining and metallurgical consulting expertise, and experienced mining personnel. Its location is accessible by all-weather road through an area of very sparse population. There is no infrastructure on the property. All buildings have been removed, all wells have been properly abandoned, and there is no equipment on site. The mine site has been totally reclaimed to the satisfaction of the State of Nevada. The need for power and water would be defined by a feasibility study and mine plan, both of which are premature at this point in time. 

&#160;

Government Regulation and Approval 

&#160;

The following permits will be necessary to put the Trinity Project into production.

&#160;

&#160;

All of the Company's drilling operations to date have been on private land and, as a result, have not been subject to U.S. Bureau of Land Management jurisdiction. On private land in Nevada, the Company's activities are regulated by The Nevada Division of Environmental Protection and the Nevada Bureau of Mining Regulation and Reclamation (&#8220;NBMRR&#8221;) and no permit is needed as long as the disturbance created is less than five acres. The total disturbance to date has been less than four acres, much of which has already been reclaimed, and as a result, the Company has not yet applied for a NBMRR permit. However, as a matter of courtesy, the Company has provided written correspondence to NBMRR to advise them of its activities.

&#160;

Environmental Regulations 

&#160;

The current exploration activities and any future mining operations (of which currently there are none planned), are subject to extensive laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, waste disposal, worker safety, mine construction, and protection of endangered and protected species. The Company has made, and expects to make in the future, significant expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations. Future changes in applicable laws, regulations and permits or changes in their enforcement or regulatory interpretation could have an adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition or results of operations. In the event that a mineral discovery is made and it is decided to proceed to production, the costs and delays associated with compliance with these laws and regulations could stop the Company from proceeding with a project or the operation or further improvement of a mine or increase the costs of improvement or production. 

&#160; &#160; 3 

&#160; 

&#160;

It is anticipated that it will be necessary to obtain the following environmental permits prior to commencement of operations: 

&#160;

&#183; Permit for Reclamation &#183; Water Pollution Control Permit &#183; Air Quality Operating Permit &#183; Industrial Artificial pond permit &#183; Water Rights 

&#160;

Subject to the availability of funds or financing, the Company anticipates that it will begin soliciting bids for the programs necessary to obtain these permits during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017. The cost, timing, and work schedules are not yet available.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The Company competes with other mining and exploration companies in connection with the acquisition of mining claims and leases on silver and other precious metals prospects and in connection with the recruitment and retention of qualified employees. Many of these companies are much larger than Liberty Silver, have greater financial resources and have been in the mining business for much longer than it has. As such, these competitors may be in a better position through size, finances and experience to acquire suitable exploration properties. Liberty Silver may not be able to compete against these companies in acquiring new properties and/or qualified people to work on its current Trinity Project, or any other properties that may be acquired in the future. 

&#160;

Given the size of the world market for precious metals such as silver and gold relative to the number of individual producers and consumers, it is believed that no single company has sufficient market influence to significantly affect the price or supply of precious metals such as silver and gold in the world market. 

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

The Company currently has three employees including Manish Z. Kshatriya, the President and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Director on the Board and, two independent directors serving on the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors. 

&#160;
