Overview 

We are a diversified real estate company engaged primarily in the acquisition, entitlement, development, management, operation and sale of commercial, hotel, entertainment, and multi- and single-family residential real estate properties, primarily located in the Austin, Texas area, but including projects in certain other select markets in Texas. 

We generate revenues from sales of developed properties, from our hotel and entertainment operations and from rental income from our commercial properties. Developed property sales can include an individual tract of land that has been developed and permitted for residential use, a developed lot with a home already built on it or condominium units at the W Austin Hotel &#38; Residences. We may sell properties under development, undeveloped properties or commercial properties, if opportunities arise that we believe will maximize overall asset values as part of our business plan. See Note 11 &#32;for further discussion of our operating segments. 

Our principal executive offices are located in Austin, Texas, and our company was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware on March 11, 1992. Stratus Properties Inc. was formed to hold, operate and develop the domestic real estate and oil and gas properties of our former parent company. We sold all of our oil and gas properties during the 1990s and have since focused solely on our real estate properties. Our overall strategy has been to enhance the value of our properties by securing and maintaining development entitlements and developing and building real estate projects on these properties for sale or investment. We have also pursued opportunities for new projects that offer the possibility of acceptable returns and risks. See "Business Strategy and Related Risks" in Part II, Items 7. and 7A. for further discussion. 

Operations 

A description of our operating segments follows. 

Hotel . The W Austin Hotel includes 251 luxury rooms and suites, a full service spa, gym, rooftop pool and 9,750 square feet of meeting space. We have an agreement with Starwood Hotels &#38; Resorts Worldwide, Inc. (Starwood) for the management of hotel operations at our W Austin Hotel &#38; Residences. Revenue per available room for the W Austin Hotel, which is calculated by dividing total room revenue by the average total rooms available during the year, was $279 &#32;for 2015 , $291 &#32;for 2014 , and $260 &#32;for 2013 . 

Revenue from our hotel segment accounted for 51 percent &#32;of our total revenue for 2015 , 45 percent &#32;for 2014 &#32;and 31 percent &#32;for 2013 . 

Entertainment . The entertainment space at the W Austin Hotel &#38; Residences is occupied by Austin City Limits Live at the Moody Theater (ACL Live) and includes a live music and entertainment venue and production studio with a maximum capacity of approximately 3,000 people. In addition to hosting concerts and private events, ACL Live is the home of Austin City Limits, a television program showcasing popular music legends. ACL Live hosted 210 &#32;events in 2015 &#32;with an estimated attendance of 245,000 , 207 &#32;events in 2014 &#32;with an estimated attendance of 

231,200 &#32;and 186 &#32;events in 2013 &#32;with an estimated attendance of 217,100 . As of February 29, 2016 , ACL Live has events booked through May 2017 . 

Our entertainment business also includes events hosted at other venues through our joint ventures (see "Properties - Unconsolidated Affiliates" below and Note 6). 

Revenue from our entertainment segment accounted for 24 percent &#32;of our total revenue for 2015 , 20 percent &#32;for 2014 &#32;and 12 percent &#32;for 2013 . 

Real Estate Operations . The number of developed lots/units, acreage under development and undeveloped acreage as of December 31, 2015 , that comprise our real estate operations are presented in the following table. 

A developed lot or unit is an individual tract of land or residential unit that has been developed and permitted for residential use. Acreage under development includes real estate for which infrastructure work over the entire property has been completed, is currently being completed or is able to be completed and for which necessary permits have been obtained. The undeveloped acreage shown in the table below is presented according to anticipated uses for multi- and single-family lots and commercial development based upon our understanding of the properties&#8217; existing entitlements. However, because of the nature and cost of the approval and development process and uncertainty regarding market demand for a particular use, there is no assurance that the undeveloped acreage will ever be developed. Undeveloped acreage includes real estate that can be sold &#8220;as is&#8221; (i.e., no infrastructure or development work has begun on such property).

The W Austin Hotel &#38; Residences 

In December 2006, we acquired a two-acre city block in downtown Austin for $15.1 million to develop a multi-use project. In 2008, we entered into a joint venture with Canyon-Johnson Urban Fund II, L.P. (Canyon-Johnson) for the development of the W Austin Hotel &#38; Residences.

We sold 32 &#32;condominium units during 2013 and 7 &#32;condominium units during 2014. There were no sales during 2015 &#32;and as of December 31, 2015 , only two &#32;condominium units remained unsold. The two unsold units are being marketed.

Circle C Community 

Effective August 2002, the City of Austin (the City) granted final approval of a development agreement (the Circle C settlement), which firmly established all essential municipal development regulations applicable to our Circle C properties until 2032. The City also provided us $15.0 million &#32;of cash incentives in connection with the future development of our Circle C and other Austin-area properties. These incentives, which are in the form of credit bank capacity, can be used for City fees and for reimbursement of certain infrastructure costs. Annually, we may elect to sell up to $1.5 million of the incentives to other developers for their use in paying City fees related to their projects as long as the projects are within the desired development zone, as defined within the Circle C settlement. As of December 31, 2015 , we have permanently used $11.7 million &#32;of the $15.0 million &#32;of cash incentives provided by the City, including cumulative sales of $5.1 million &#32;to other developers. We also have $1.4 million &#32;in credit bank capacity in use as temporary fiscal deposits. At December 31, 2015 , available credit bank capacity was $1.9 million . 

We are developing the Circle C community based on the entitlements secured in our Circle C settlement with the City. Our Circle C settlement, as amended in 2004, permits development of 1.16 million square feet of commercial space, 504 multi-family units and 830 single-family residential lots. Meridian is an 800-lot residential development at the Circle C community. Development of the final phase of Meridian, which consisted of 57 one-acre lots, was completed in first-quarter 2014.

As of February 29, 2016 , ten Meridian lots were under contract. 

On July 2, 2015 , we completed the sales of our Austin-area Parkside Village and 5700 Slaughter commercial properties, both located in the Circle C community. The Parkside Village retail project, which we owned in a joint venture with LCHM Holdings, LLC, consisted of 90,184 &#32;leasable square feet and was sold for $32.5 million . The project included a 33,650 -square-foot full-service movie theater and restaurant, a 13,890 -square-foot medical clinic and five other retail buildings, including a 14,926 -square-foot building, a 10,175 -square-foot building, a 8,043 -square-foot building, a 4,500 -square-foot building and a stand-alone 5,000 -square-foot building. The 5700 Slaughter retail project, which we wholly owned, consisted of 25,698 &#32;leasable square feet and was sold for $12.5 million . See Note 12 &#32;for further discussion.

Regional utility and road infrastructure is in place with capacity to serve Lantana at full build-out as permitted under our existing entitlements. 

The Oaks at Lakeway &#32; 

In 2013, we acquired 87 acres in the greater Austin area to develop The Oaks at Lakeway project, a HEB anchored retail project planned for 231,436 &#32;square feet of commercial space. As of December 31, 2015 , leases for 78 percent &#32;of the space, including the HEB store lease, have been executed and leasing for the remaining space is under way.

Construction is expected to begin in third-quarter 2016, and the HEB store is expected to open in March 2017. 

Unconsolidated Affiliates 

Crestview Station. In 2005, we formed a joint venture with Trammell Crow Central Texas Development, Inc. to acquire an approximate 74 -acre tract at the intersection of Airport Boulevard and Lamar Boulevard in Austin, Texas, for $7.7 million . The property, known as Crestview Station (the Crestview Station Joint Venture) is a single-family, multi-family, retail and office development, located on the site of a commuter rail line. As of December 31, 2015 , the Crestview Station Joint Venture has sold all of its properties except for one commercial site. We account for our 50 percent interest in the Crestview Station Joint Venture under the equity method. 

Stump Fluff. &#32;In April 2013, we formed a joint venture, Stump Fluff LLC (Stump Fluff), with Transmission Entertainment, LLC (Transmission) to own, operate, manage and sell live music and entertainment promotion, booking, production, merchandising, venue services and other related products and services. As of December 31, 2015 , Stratus' capital contributions to Stump Fluff totaled $1.5 million . Stratus will contribute additional capital to Stump Fluff as necessary to fund its working capital needs. Stratus and Transmission each have a 50 percent &#32;voting interest in Stump Fluff. After Stratus is repaid its original capital contributions and a preferred return ( 10 percent &#32;annually) on those contributions, Stratus will receive 33 percent &#32;of any distributions from Stump Fluff. We account for our investment in Stump Fluff under the equity method.

We account for our investment in Guapo under the equity method. 

See Note 6 &#32;for further discussion of our unconsolidated affiliates. 

Competition 

&#160; 

We operate in highly competitive industries, namely the real estate development, hotel, entertainment and commercial leasing industries. In the real estate development industry, we compete with numerous public and private developers of varying sizes, ranging from local to national in scope. As a result, we may be competing for investment opportunities, financing and potential buyers with developers that may possess greater financial, marketing or other resources than we have. Our prospective customers generally have a variety of choices of new and existing homes and homesites when considering a purchase. We attempt to differentiate our properties primarily on the basis of community design, quality, uniqueness, amenities, location and developer reputation. 

In the hotel industry, competition is generally based on quality and consistency of rooms, restaurant and meeting facilities and services, attractiveness of location, price and other factors. Management believes that we compete favorably in these areas. Our W Austin Hotel competes with other hotels and resorts in our geographic market, including facilities owned locally and facilities owned by national and international chains. 

In the entertainment industry, we compete with other venues in Austin, Texas, and venues in other markets for artists likely to perform in the Austin, Texas region. Consequently, touring artists have several alternatives to our venue in scheduling tours. Some of our competitors in venue management have a greater number of venues in certain markets and may have greater financial resources in those markets. We differentiate our entertainment businesses by providing a quality live music experience and promoting our entertainment space through KLRU's broadcast of Austin City Limits. 

The commercial leasing industry is highly fragmented among individuals, partnerships and public and private entities, with no dominant single entity or person. Although we may compete against large sophisticated owners and operators, owners and operators of any size can provide effective competition for prospective tenants. We compete for tenants primarily on the basis of property location, rent charged, and the design and condition of improvements. 

See Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" for further discussion. 

Discontinued Operations 

In 2012, we sold 7500 Rialto, an office building in Lantana. In connection with the sale, we recognized a gain of $5.1 million &#32;and deferred a gain of $5.0 million &#32;because of a guaranty provided to the lender in connection with the buyer's assumption of the loan related to 7500 Rialto. The guaranty was released in January 2015, and we recognized the deferred gain totaling $5.0 million &#32;( $3.2 million &#32;to net income attributable to common stock) in first-quarter 2015. 

Credit Facility and Other Financing Arrangements 

Obtaining and maintaining adequate financing is a critical component of our business. For information about our credit facility and other financing arrangements, see &#8220;Capital Resources and Liquidity - Credit Facility and Other Financing Arrangements&#8221; in Part II, Items 7. and 7A. and Note 7 . 

Regulation and Environmental Matters 

Our real estate investments are subject to extensive local, city, county and state rules and regulations regarding permitting, zoning, subdivision, utilities and water quality as well as federal rules and regulations regarding air and water quality and protection of endangered species and their habitats. Such regulation has delayed and may continue to delay development of our properties and may result in higher development and administrative costs. See Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" for further discussion. 

We have made, and will continue to make, expenditures for the protection of the environment with respect to our real estate development activities. Emphasis on environmental matters will result in additional costs in the future. Based on an analysis of our operations in relation to current and presently anticipated environmental requirements, we currently do not anticipate that these costs will have a material adverse effect on our future operations or financial condition. 

Employees 

At December 31, 2015 , we had a total of 114 employees, 39 of which were full-time employees, located at our Austin, Texas headquarters. We believe we have a good relationship with our employees, none of whom are represented by a union. Since January 1, 1996, certain services necessary for our business and operations, including certain administrative, financial reporting and other services, have been performed by FM Services Company (FM Services) pursuant to a services agreement. FM Services is a wholly owned subsidiary of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. Either party may terminate the services agreement at any time upon 60 days notice or earlier upon mutual written agreement.
