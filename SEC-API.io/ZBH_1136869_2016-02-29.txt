 Item 1. &#160; Business &#160; 

Overview 

&#160;

Zimmer Biomet is a global leader in musculoskeletal healthcare. We design, manufacture and market orthopaedic reconstructive products; sports medicine, biologics, extremities and trauma products; spine, bone healing, craniomaxillofacial and thoracic products; dental implants; and related surgical products. We collaborate with healthcare professionals around the globe to advance the pace of innovation. Our products and solutions help treat patients suffering from disorders of, or injuries to, bones, joints or supporting soft tissues. Together with healthcare professionals, we help millions of people live better lives. In this report, &#147;Zimmer Biomet,&#148; &#147;we,&#148; &#147;us,&#148; &#147;our,&#148; &#147;the Company&#148; and similar words refer collectively to Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries. &#147;Zimmer Biomet Holdings&#148; refers to the parent company only. 

Zimmer Biomet Holdings was incorporated in Delaware in 2001. Our history dates to 1927, when Zimmer Manufacturing Company, a predecessor, was founded in Warsaw, Indiana. On August 6, 2001, we were spun off from our former parent and became an independent public company. 

On June 24, 2015 (the &#147;Closing Date&#148;), we acquired LVB Acquisition, Inc. (&#147;LVB&#148;), the parent company of Biomet, Inc. (&#147;Biomet&#148;), and LVB and Biomet became our wholly-owned subsidiaries (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the &#147;Biomet merger&#148; or the &#147;merger&#148;). In connection with the merger, we changed our name from Zimmer Holdings, Inc. to Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. The Biomet merger is expected to be a transformational event for us and have significant effects on all aspects of our business. Throughout 2015 and entering 2016, a key focus of ours has been, and will continue to be, the successful integration of Biomet. 

&#147;Zimmer&#148; used alone refers to the business or information of us and our subsidiaries on a stand-alone basis without inclusion of the business or information of LVB or any of its subsidiaries. 

Customers, Sales and Marketing 

&#160;

Our primary customers include orthopaedic surgeons, neurosurgeons, oral surgeons, and other specialists, dentists, hospitals, stocking distributors, healthcare dealers and, in their capacity as agents, healthcare purchasing organizations or buying groups. These customers range from large multinational enterprises to independent clinicians and dentists. 

We have operations throughout the world. We manage our operations through three major geographic operating segments and four product category operating segments. Our three major geographic operating segments are the Americas, which is comprised principally of the U.S. and includes other North, Central and South American markets; EMEA, which is comprised principally of Europe and includes the Middle East and African markets; and Asia Pacific, which is comprised primarily of Japan and includes other Asian and Pacific 

markets. Our four product category operating segments, which are individually not as significant as our geographic operating segments, are as follows: 1) Americas Spine; 2) Bone Healing; 3) Craniomaxillofacial and Thoracic (&#147;CMF&#148;); and 4) Dental. 

We market and sell products through three principal channels: 1) direct to healthcare institutions, such as hospitals, referred to as direct channel accounts; 2) through stocking distributors and healthcare dealers; and 3) directly to dental practices and dental laboratories. With direct channel accounts, inventory is generally consigned to sales agents or customers. With sales to stocking distributors, healthcare dealers, dental practices and dental laboratories, title to product passes upon shipment or upon implantation of the product. Direct channel accounts represented approximately 80 percent of our net sales in 2015. No individual direct channel account, stocking distributor, healthcare dealer, dental practice or dental laboratory accounted for more than 1 percent of our net sales for 2015. 

We stock inventory in our warehouse facilities and retain title to consigned inventory in sufficient quantities so that products are available when needed for surgical procedures. Safety stock levels are determined based on a number of factors, including demand, manufacturing lead times and quantities required to maintain service levels. We also carry trade accounts receivable balances based on credit terms that are generally consistent with local market practices. 

We utilize a network of sales associates, sales managers and support personnel, some of whom are employed or contracted by independent distributors and sales agencies. We invest a significant amount of time and expense in training sales associates in how to use specific products and how to best inform surgeons of product features and uses. Sales force representatives must have strong technical selling skills and medical education to provide technical support for surgeons. 

In response to the different healthcare systems throughout the world, our sales and marketing strategies and organizational structures differ by region. We utilize a global approach to sales force training, marketing and medical education to provide consistent, high quality service. Additionally, we keep current with key surgical developments and other issues related to orthopaedic surgeons, neurosurgeons, other specialists, dentists and oral surgeons and the medical procedures they perform. 

Due to the Biomet merger, we changed our senior management organizational structure which has resulted in a change to our operating segments. We now allocate resources to achieve our operating profit goals through seven operating segments. Our operating segments are comprised of both geographic and product category business units. We are organized through a combination of geographic and product category operating segments for various reasons, including the distribution channels through which products are sold. Our product category operating segments generally have distribution channels focused specifically on those product 

&#160;

&#160; 

ZIMMER BIOMET HOLDINGS, INC. &#160; 2015 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT &#160; 

categories, whereas our geographic operating segments have distribution channels that sell multiple product categories. The following is a summary of our seven operating segments. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our segments. 

Americas. The Americas geographic operating segment is our largest operating segment. The U.S. accounts for 94 percent of net sales in this region. The U.S. sales force consists of a combination of employees and independent sales agents, most of whom sell products exclusively for Zimmer Biomet. The sales force in the U.S. receives a commission on product sales and is responsible for many operating decisions and costs. 

In this region, we contract with group purchasing organizations and managed care accounts and have promoted unit growth by offering volume discounts to customer healthcare institutions within a specified group. Generally, we are designated as one of several preferred purchasing sources for specified products, although members are not obligated to purchase our products. Contracts with group purchasing organizations generally have a term of three years, with extensions as warranted. 

In the Americas, we monitor and rank independent sales agents and our direct sales force across a range of performance metrics, including the achievement of sales targets and maintenance of efficient levels of working capital. 

EMEA. The EMEA geographic operating segment is our second largest operating segment. France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom collectively account for 62 percent of net sales in the region. This segment also includes other key markets, including Switzerland, Benelux, Nordic, Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Our sales force in this segment is comprised of direct sales associates, commissioned agents, independent distributors and sales support personnel. We emphasize the advantages of our clinically proven, established designs and innovative solutions and new and enhanced materials and surfaces. In most European countries, healthcare is sponsored by the government and therefore government budgets impact healthcare spending, which can affect our sales in this segment. 

Asia Pacific. The Asia Pacific geographic operating segment includes key markets such as Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Korea, China, Taiwan, India, Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong and Malaysia. Japan is the largest market within this segment, accounting for 40 percent of the region&#146;s sales. In Japan and most countries in the Asia Pacific region, we maintain a network of dealers, who act as order agents on behalf of hospitals in the region, and sales associates, who build and maintain relationships with orthopaedic surgeons and neurosurgeons in their markets. The knowledge and skills of these sales associates play a critical role in providing service, product information and support to surgeons. We have a research and development center in Beijing, China, which focuses on products and technologies designed to meet the unique needs of Asian patients and their healthcare providers. 

Americas Spine. The Americas Spine product category operating segment is comprised of our spine products division in the Americas, primarily in the U.S. market, but also in other North, Central and South American markets. The market dynamics of the Americas Spine business are similar to those described in the Americas geographic operating segment. However, the Americas Spine business maintains a separate sales force of employees and independent sales agents. 

Bone Healing . Our Bone Healing product category operating segment only sells to U.S. customers. In this product category, we market our products to doctors who prescribe them for use by patients. The products are mostly provided directly by Zimmer Biomet to patients and are paid for through patients&#146; insurance or by patients themselves. Products are also sold through wholesale channels on a limited basis. 

CMF . Our CMF product category operating segment competes across the world through a combination of direct and independent sales agents. The U.S. sales force consists of a combination of employees and independent sales agents. Internationally, our primary customers are independent stocking distributors who market our products to their customers. 

Dental . Our Dental product category operating segment competes across the world. Our sales force is primarily composed of employees who market our products to customers. We sell directly to dental practices or dental laboratories, or to independent stocking distributors depending on the market. 

Seasonality 

&#160;

Our business is seasonal in nature to some extent, as many of our products are used in elective procedures, which typically decline during the summer months and can increase at the end of the year once annual deductibles have been met on health insurance plans. 

Distribution 

&#160;

We distribute our products both through large, centralized warehouses and through smaller, market specific facilities, depending on the needs of the market. We maintain large, centralized warehouses in the U.S. and Europe to be able to efficiently distribute our products to customers in those regions. In addition to these centralized warehouses, we maintain smaller distribution facilities within each of the countries where we have a direct sales presence. In many locations, our inventory is consigned to the healthcare institution. 

We generally ship our orders via expedited courier. We do not consider our backlog of firm orders to be material to an understanding of our business. 

Products 

&#160;

Our products include orthopaedic reconstructive products; sports medicine, biologics, extremities and trauma products; spine, bone healing and CMF products; dental implants; and related surgical products. 

&#160;

KNEES 

Total knee replacement surgeries typically include a femoral component, a patella (knee cap), a tibial tray and an articular surface (placed on the tibial tray). Knee replacement surgeries include first-time, or primary, joint replacement procedures and revision procedures for the replacement, repair or enhancement of an implant or component from a previous procedure. There are also procedures for partial reconstruction of the knee, which treat limited knee degeneration and involve the replacement of only one side, or compartment, of the knee with a unicompartmental knee prosthesis. Our knee portfolio also includes early intervention and joint preservation products, which seek to preserve the joint by repairing or regenerating damaged tissues and by treating osteoarthritis. 

Our significant knee brands include the following: 

&#149; &#160; Persona &#174; The Personalized Knee System 

&#149; &#160; NexGen &#174; Complete Knee Solution

&#149; &#160; Oxford &#174; Partial Knee 

HIPS 

Total hip replacement surgeries replace both the head of the femur and the socket portion of the pelvis (acetabulum) of the natural hip. Hip procedures include first-time, or primary, joint replacement as well as revision procedures. Hip implant procedures involve the use of bone cement to attach or affix the prosthetic components to the surrounding bone, or are press-fit into bone, which means that they have a surface that bone affixes to through either ongrowth or ingrowth technologies. 

Our significant hip brands include the following:

ZIMMER BIOMET HOLDINGS, INC. &#160; 2015 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT &#160; 

We are broadening our offerings in each of our product categories and exploring new technologies with possible applications in multiple areas. Our primary research and development facility is located in Warsaw, Indiana. We have other research and development personnel based in, among other places, Canada, China, France, Switzerland and other U.S. locations. As of December 31, 2015, we employed approximately 1,700 research and development employees worldwide. 

We expect to continue to identify innovative technologies, which may include acquiring complementary products or businesses, establishing technology licensing arrangements or strategic alliances. 

Government Regulation and Compliance 

&#160;

We are subject to government regulation in the countries in which we conduct business. In the U.S., numerous laws and regulations govern all the processes by which medical devices are brought to market. These include, among others, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations issued or promulgated thereunder. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#147;FDA&#148;) has enacted regulations that control all aspects of the development, manufacture, advertising, promotion and postmarket surveillance of medical products, including medical devices. In addition, the FDA controls the access of products to market through processes designed to ensure that only products that are safe and effective are made available to the public. 

Most of our new products fall into an FDA classification that requires the submission of a Premarket Notification (510(k)) to the FDA. This process requires us to demonstrate that the device to be marketed is at least as safe and effective as, that is, substantially equivalent to, a legally marketed device. We must submit information that supports our substantial equivalency claims. Before we can market the new device, we must receive an order from the FDA finding substantial equivalence and clearing the new device for commercial distribution in the U.S. 

Other devices we develop and market are in a category (class) for which the FDA has implemented stringent clinical investigation and Premarket Approval (&#147;PMA&#148;) requirements. The PMA process requires us to provide clinical and laboratory data that establishes that the new medical device is safe and effective. The FDA will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the PMA application constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s). 

All of our devices marketed in the U.S. have been cleared or approved by the FDA, with the exception of some devices which are exempt or were in commercial distribution prior to May 28, 1976. The FDA has grandfathered these devices, so new FDA submissions are not required. 

Both before and after a product is commercially released, we have ongoing responsibilities under FDA regulations. The FDA reviews design and manufacturing practices, labeling and record keeping, and manufacturers&#146; required reports of 

adverse experiences and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices. We are also subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA&#146;s Quality System regulations among other FDA requirements, such as restrictions on advertising and promotion. The Quality System regulations govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging and servicing of all finished medical devices intended for human use. If the FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the FDA could require us to notify healthcare professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund payment of such devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, or ban such medical devices. 

The FDA may also impose operating restrictions, enjoin and/or restrain certain conduct resulting in violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices, and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers, employees or us. The FDA may also recommend prosecution to the U.S. Department of Justice (&#147;DOJ&#148;). 

The FDA, in cooperation with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (&#147;CBP&#148;), administers controls over the import of medical devices into the U.S. The CBP imposes its own regulatory requirements on the import of our products, including inspection and possible sanctions for noncompliance. We are also subject to foreign trade controls administered by certain U.S. government agencies, including the Bureau of Industry and Security within the Commerce Department and the Office of Foreign Assets Control within the Treasury Department. 

There are also requirements of state, local and foreign governments that we must comply with in the manufacture and marketing of our products. 

In many of the foreign countries in which we market our products, we are subject to local regulations affecting, among other things, design and product standards, packaging requirements and labeling requirements. Many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in these countries are similar to those of the FDA. The member countries of the European Union have adopted the European Medical Device Directive, which creates a single set of medical device regulations for products marketed in all member countries. Compliance with the Medical Device Directive and certification to a quality system enable the manufacturer to place a CE mark on its products. To obtain authorization to affix the CE mark to a product, a recognized European Notified Body must assess a manufacturer&#146;s quality systems and the product&#146;s conformity to the requirements of the Medical Device Directive. We are subject to inspection by the Notified Bodies for compliance with these requirements. 

Further, we are subject to various federal, state and foreign laws concerning healthcare fraud and abuse, including false claims and anti-kickback laws, as well as the U.S. Physician Payments Sunshine Act and similar state and foreign healthcare professional payment transparency laws. These 

&#160;

&#160; 

ZIMMER BIOMET HOLDINGS, INC. &#160; 2015 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT &#160; 

laws are administered by, among others, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, state attorneys general and various foreign government agencies. Many of these agencies have increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical device manufacturers in recent years. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, fines, imprisonment and, within the U.S., exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Administration (&#147;VA&#148;) health programs. 

Our operations in foreign countries are subject to the extraterritorial application of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Our global operations are also subject to foreign anti-corruption laws, such as the UK Bribery Act, among others. As part of our global compliance program, we seek to address anti-corruption risks proactively. 

Our facilities and operations are also subject to complex federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational safety laws and regulations, including those relating to discharges of substances in the air, water and land, the handling, storage and disposal of wastes and the clean-up of properties by pollutants. We do not expect that the ongoing costs of compliance with these environmental requirements will have a material impact on our consolidated earnings, capital expenditures or competitive position. 

Competition 

&#160;

The orthopaedics and broader musculoskeletal care industry is highly competitive. In the global markets for our knees, hips, and S.E.T. products, our major competitors include: the DePuy Synthes Companies of Johnson &#38; Johnson; Stryker Corporation; and Smith &#38; Nephew plc. There are smaller competitors in these product categories as well who have success by focusing on smaller subsegments of the industry. 

In the spine and CMF categories, we compete globally primarily with the spinal and biologic business of Medtronic, Inc., the DePuy Synthes Companies, Stryker Corporation, NuVasive, Inc. and Globus Medical, Inc. 

In the dental implant category, we compete primarily with Nobel Biocare Holding AG (part of the Danaher Corporation), Straumann Holding AG and Dentsply International. 

Competition within the industry is primarily based on pricing, technology, innovation, quality, reputation and customer service. A key factor in our continuing success in the future will be our ability to develop new products and improve existing products and technologies. 

Manufacturing and Raw Materials 

&#160;

We manufacture our products at various sites. We also strategically outsource some manufacturing to qualified suppliers who are highly capable of producing components. 

The manufacturing operations at our facilities are designed to incorporate the cellular concept for production and to implement tenets of a manufacturing philosophy 

focused on continuous improvement efforts in product quality, lead time reduction and capacity optimization. Our continuous improvement efforts are driven by Lean and Six Sigma methodologies. In addition, at certain of our manufacturing facilities, many of the employees are cross-trained to perform a broad array of operations. 

We generally target operating our manufacturing facilities at optimal levels of total capacity. We continually evaluate the potential to in-source and outsource production as part of our manufacturing strategy to provide value to our stakeholders. 

We have improved our manufacturing processes to protect our profitability and offset the impact of inflationary costs. We have, for example, employed computer-assisted robots and multi-axis grinders to precision polish medical devices; automated certain manufacturing and inspection processes, including on-machine inspection and process controls; purchased state-of-the-art equipment; in-sourced core products and processes; and negotiated cost reductions from third-party suppliers. 

We use a diverse and broad range of raw materials in the manufacturing of our products. We purchase all of our raw materials and select components used in manufacturing our products from external suppliers. In addition, we purchase some supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance, sole source availability, cost effectiveness or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements. We work closely with our suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability. To date, we have not experienced any significant difficulty in locating and obtaining the materials necessary to fulfill our production schedules. 

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

Patents and other proprietary rights are important to the continued success of our business. We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position. We protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with vendors, employees, consultants and others who may have access to proprietary information. We own or control through licensing arrangements approximately 7,000 issued patents and patent applications throughout the world that relate to aspects of the technology incorporated in many of our products. 

Employees 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we employed approximately 17,500 employees worldwide, including approximately 1,700 employees dedicated to research and development. Approximately 8,400 employees are located within the U.S. and approximately 9,100 employees are located outside of the U.S., primarily throughout Europe and in Japan. We have approximately 7,700 employees dedicated to manufacturing our products worldwide. The Warsaw, Indiana production facilities employ approximately 2,800 employees in the aggregate. 

&#160;

&#160; 

ZIMMER BIOMET HOLDINGS, INC. &#160; 2015 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT &#160; 

We have production employees represented by a labor union in Dover, Ohio and Bridgend, South Wales. We have other
