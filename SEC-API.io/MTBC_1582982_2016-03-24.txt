Our Company 

&#160; 

Medical Transcription Billing, Corp. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a healthcare information technology company that provides a fully integrated suite of proprietary web-based solutions, together with related business services, to healthcare providers practicing in ambulatory care settings. Our integrated Software-as-a-Service (or SaaS) platform helps our customers increase revenues, streamline workflows and make better business and clinical decisions, while reducing administrative burdens and operating costs. In addition to our experienced team in the United States, we employ a highly educated workforce of more than 1,500 people in Pakistan, where we believe labor costs are approximately one-half the cost of comparable India-based employees and one-tenth the cost of comparable U.S. employees, thus enabling us to deliver our solutions at competitive prices.

&#160;

Our flagship offering, PracticePro, empowers healthcare practices with the core software and business services they need to address industry challenges, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (&#8220;Affordable Care Act&#8221;), on one unified SaaS platform. We deliver powerful, integrated and easy-to-use &#8216;big practice solutions&#8217; to small and medium practices, which enable them to efficiently operate their businesses, manage clinical workflows and receive timely payment for their services. PracticePro includes:

&#160;

&#183; Practice management solutions and related tools, which facilitate the day-to-day operation of a medical practice; &#183; Electronic health records (or EHR), which is easy to use, highly ranked, and allows our customers to reduce paperwork and qualify for government incentives; &#183; Revenue cycle management (or RCM) services, which include end-to-end medical billing, analytics, and related services; and &#183; Mobile Health (or mHealth) solutions, including smartphone applications that assist patients and healthcare providers in the provision of healthcare services. &#160;

As a result of an acquisition in 2015, the Company offers a clearinghouse service which allows clients to track claim status and includes services such as batch electronic claim and payment transaction clearing and web access for claim corrections. Also as result of this acquisition, the Company has an EDI service which provides a centralized electronic data interchange management system to audit, manage and control the exchange of information.

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we served approximately 1,100 customers, of which 340 utilized our clearinghouse and EDI services. We provided medical billing to approximately 730 medical practices representing approximately 1,500 providers, (which we define as physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and other clinical staff that render bills for their services) practicing in approximately 60 specialties and subspecialties, in 44 states. As of December 31, 2014, we served approximately 980 medical practices representing approximately 2,200 providers, practicing in approximately 60 specialties and subspecialties, in 43 states. Approximately 98% of the practices we serve consist of one to ten providers, with the majority of the practices we serve being primary care providers. However, our solutions are scalable and are appropriate for larger healthcare practices across a wide range of specialty areas. In fact, our customer with the largest number of providers is a hospital-based group with more than 120 providers.

&#160;

On July 23, 2014, the Company completed its initial public offering (&#8220;IPO&#8221;) of common stock. The Company sold approximately 4 million shares at a price to the public of $5.00 per share.

&#160;

On July 28, 2014, the Company purchased the assets of three medical billing companies, Omni Medical Billing Services, LLC, (&#8220;Omni&#8221;), Practicare Medical Management, Inc. (&#8220;Practicare&#8221;) and CastleRock Solutions, Inc. (&#8220;CastleRock,&#8221; and collectively with Omni and Practicare, the &#8220;2014 Acquisitions&#8221;), for a combination of cash and stock.

&#160;

During the year 2015, the Company purchased the assets of Jesjam Holdings, LLC, a medical billing company doing business as Med Tech Professional Billing (&#8220;MedTech&#8221;) and those assets of SoftCare Solutions, Inc., a Nevada corporation, the U.S. subsidiary of QHR Technologies, Inc. which represented SoftCare Solutions Inc.&#8217;s clearinghouse, electronic data interchange (&#8220;EDI&#8221;) and billing divisions (&#8220;SoftCare&#8221; and collectively with MedTech, the &#8220;2015 Acquisitions&#8221;). The Company also purchased customer relationships during the year. The SoftCare acquisition expanded the Company&#8217;s operations to include EDI and clearinghouse services.

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

During November 2015, the Company completed a preferred stock offering selling Series A preferred stock. The Company sold approximately 230,000 shares at a price of $25.00 per share.

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

Including the employees of our subsidiaries, as of February 2016 we employed approximately 1,600 people worldwide on a full-time basis. We also use the services of a number of part time employees. In addition, all officers work on a full-time basis. Over the next twelve months, we anticipate increasing our total number of employees only if our revenues increase or our operating requirements warrant such hiring, or for specific functions where we place additional emphasis, such as marketing and sales.

&#160; 

Our Growth Strategy 

&#160;

Our growth strategy includes acquiring smaller revenue cycle management companies and then migrating the customers of those companies to our solutions. The revenue cycle management service industry is highly fragmented, with many local and regional revenue cycle management companies serving small medical practices. We believe that the industry is ripe for consolidation and that we can achieve significant growth through acquisitions. We estimate that there are more than 1,500 companies in the United States providing revenue cycle management services and that no one company has more than a 5% share of the market. We further believe that it is becoming increasingly difficult for traditional revenue cycle management companies to meet the growing technology and business service needs of healthcare providers without a significant investment in information technology infrastructure.

&#160;

In addition, our growth strategy includes strategic partnerships with other industry participants, including electronic health records vendors, in which the vendors refer customers to our services. While we offer our own electronic health records, our strategy includes providing integrated offerings utilizing third party electronic health records while offering customers MTBC&#8217;s revenue cycle management, practice management and mobile health capabilities. We have recently hired additional sales and marketing executives and moved existing personnel into sales roles to spearhead our customer acquisition initiative, which will include growing existing and developing new strategic partnerships. We believe that these new team members will also be able to successfully leverage the network of relationships of the medical billing companies and the clearinghouse entity that we acquired and our existing network. By devoting greater resources to sales and marketing, we expect that our organic growth will increase more rapidly, as our current organic growth is driven primarily by customer referrals and internet search engine optimization techniques.

&#160; 

Industry Overview 

&#160; 

According to Health Affairs magazine, in 2014, U.S. health care spending increased 5.3% following growth of 2.9% in 2013 to reach $3 trillion, or $9,500 per person. The faster growth experienced in 2014 was primarily due to the major coverage expansions under the Affordable Care Act, particularly for Medicaid and private health insurance. The share of the economy devoted to health care spending was 17.5%, up from 17.3% in 2013.

&#160;

Medicare spending grew 5.5% to $619 billion in 2014, an acceleration from 3% growth in 2013. Total Medicaid spending, which accounted for 16% of total national health expenditures, increased 11% in 2014 after growing 5.9% in 2013. Total private health insurance expenditures increased 4.4% (33% of total health care spending) to $991 billion in 2014, faster than the 1.6% growth in 2013 which was the slowest rate since 1967. Out-of-pocket spending grew 1.3% in 2014 to $330 billion which was slightly slower than annual growth of 2.1% in 2013.

&#160;

Increasingly complex reimbursement processes. New laws and payer requirements have further complicated insurance reimbursement processes. For example, Medicare, Medicaid and commercial insurances are increasingly requiring proof of adherence to best practices and improved patient health outcomes to support full reimbursement. Moreover, the recent shift to a new generation of insurance codes will dramatically increase the complexity associated with selecting appropriate procedure and diagnosis codes needed to support proper claim reimbursement.

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Movement toward healthcare information technology. Since 2011, the federal government has offered financial incentives to eligible healthcare providers who adopt and meaningfully use electronic health records technology. Beginning in 2015, providers who are not meaningfully using this technology incurred penalties and these penalties will increase every year through 2019. While these incentives and looming penalties have encouraged many providers to adopt and meaningfully use electronic health records software, we believe that most providers are not utilizing an integrated platform that combines practice management, business intelligence, and revenue cycle management. The lack of an integrated platform leaves them ill-equipped to address the multitude of rapidly growing industry challenges.

&#160;

Shift in Focus to Preventive Care. In an effort to avoid the negative health effects and increased costs associated with undetected and untreated chronic conditions, the Affordable Care Act requires most health insurance plans to provide co-payment and deductible-free coverage for preventive health services, such as annual well visits. Many believe that this shift in focus will, in the long-term, reduce costs and improve patient health.

&#160; 

Inaccessibility of critical data. To thrive in the emerging healthcare landscape, healthcare practices need timely information, such as health insurance plan eligibility and coverage details, provider performance and productivity data and clinical and reimbursement benchmarking. However, we believe that most small and medium size practices do not have access to this type of real-time data, business intelligence and analytical tools and thus struggle to efficiently operate their practices and make optimal decisions.

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160;

The market for practice management, EHR and RCM information solutions and related services is highly competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future. We face competition from other providers of both integrated and stand-alone practice management, EHR and RCM solutions, including competitors who utilize a web-based platform and providers of locally installed software systems. Our competitors include larger healthcare IT companies, such as athenahealth, Inc., eClinicalWorks, Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc. and Greenway Medical Technologies, Inc.

&#160;

Many of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition and greater financial, marketing and other resources than us. We also compete with various regional RCM companies, some of which may continue to consolidate and expand into broader markets. We expect that competition will continue to increase as a result of incentives provided by the HITECH Act, and consolidation in both the information technology and healthcare industries. In addition, our competitive edge could be diminished or completely lost if our competition develops similar offshore operations in Pakistan or other countries, such as India and the Philippines, where labor costs are lower than those in the U.S. (although higher than in Pakistan). Pricing pressures could negatively impact our margins, growth rate and market share.

Our Solution 

&#160; 

We believe that our fully integrated solutions uniquely address the challenges in the industry, including those presented by the Affordable Care Act. Our solutions dramatically simplify the complexities inherent in the reimbursement process and thereby deliver objectively superior results, such as reduced claim denial rates, improved customer days in accounts receivable, reduced patient no-shows, increased well visit encounters and reimbursement. Our solutions empower our customers with the real-time data they need to be efficient and make better decisions, such as real-time insurance eligibility and deductible details, provider productivity details and payer benchmarking.

&#160;

Our fully integrated suite of technology and business service solutions is designed to enable healthcare practices to thrive in the midst of a rapidly changing environment in which managing reimbursement, clinical workflows and day-to-day administrative tasks is becoming increasingly complex, costly and time-consuming. Moreover, the standard offering fee for our complete, integrated, end-to-end solution ranges from 2.5% to 5% of a practice&#8217;s healthcare-related revenues, with a monthly minimum fee, plus a nominal one-time setup fee, and is among the lowest in the industry.

&#160; 

Our Business Strategy 

&#160; 

Our objective is to become the leading provider of integrated, end-to-end software and business service solutions to healthcare providers practicing in an ambulatory setting. To achieve this objective, we employ the following strategies:

&#160;

&#183; Provide comprehensive practice management, electronic health records, revenue cycle management and mobile health solutions to small and medium size healthcare practices . We believe that physician practices are in need of an integrated, end-to-end solution, such as the solution that MTBC provides, to manage the different facets of their businesses, from clinical documentation to claim submission and financial reporting. &#160;

&#183; Provide exceptional customer service . We realize that our success is tied directly to our customers&#8217; success. Accordingly, a substantial portion of our highly trained and educated workforce is devoted to customer service activities. &#160;

&#183; Leverage significant cost advantages provided by our skilled offshore workforce . Our unique business model includes our web-based software and a cost-effective offshore workforce primarily based in Pakistan. We believe that this operating model provides us with significant cost advantages compared to other revenue cycle management companies and it allows us to significantly reduce the operational costs of the companies we acquire. &#160;

&#183; Pursue strategic acquisitions . Approximately 56% of our current practices and 69% of our current year&#8217;s revenue were obtained through strategic transactions with revenue cycle management companies including the 2015 and 2014 Acquisitions. With most of our acquisition transactions, our goal is to retain the acquired customers over the long-term and migrate those customers to our platform soon after closing. For the three acquisitions completed in 2014, Omni, CastleRock and Practicare, we successfully migrated 94% of acquired customers to PracticePro as of December 31, 2015, and retained 48% of acquired customers seventeen months following the acquisition. Over time, we intend to integrate SoftCare&#8217;s clearinghouse and electronic data interchange technology with our own, but we have not migrated these customers to our platform. Since the August 2015 acquisition of MedTech, 100% of the former MedTech customers have been migrated to our platform. &#160;

&#183; Leverage strategic partnerships. A portion of our current customers were initially referred to MTBC by one of our existing or former channel partners. In conjunction with these partnerships, we help &#8216;round-out&#8217; our partners&#8217; service offerings, while receiving referrals and sharing a portion of our revenues with these partners. During the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 we recorded approximately $1.5 million and $262,000 respectively of revenue from the customers serviced under this revenue sharing agreement and has recorded a liability at December 31, 2015 and 2014 of approximately $18,000 and $43,000, respectively to partners representing their share of the revenue billed. &#160;

Our Service Offerings 

&#160; 

We offer a suite of fully-integrated, web-based SaaS platform and business services designed for healthcare providers. Our products and services offer healthcare providers a unified solution designed to meet the healthcare industry&#8217;s demand for the delivery of cost-efficient, quality care with measureable outcomes. The four primary components of our proprietary web-based suite of services are: (i) practice management applications, (ii) a certified electronic health records solution, (iii) revenue cycle management services and (iv) mobile health applications.

&#160;

Our flagship product, PracticePro, provides our clients with a seamlessly-integrated, end-to-end solution. Our web-based electronic health records are also available to customers as a standalone product. We regularly update our software platform with the goal of staying on the leading edge of industry developments, payer reimbursements trends and new regulations. 

&#160;

As a result of the 2015 SoftCare acquisition, the Company also offers clearinghouse services which allows clients to track claim status and includes services such as batch electronic claim and payment transaction clearing and web access for claim corrections. Also as result of this acquisition, the Company has an EDI service which provides a centralized electronic data interchange management system to audit, manage and control the exchange of information.

&#160; 

Web-based Practice Management Application 

&#160; 

Our proprietary, web-based practice management application automates the labor-intensive workflow of a medical office in a unified and streamlined SaaS platform. The various functions of the platform collectively support the entire workflow of the day-to-day operations of a medical office in an intuitive and user-friendly format. For example, our platform provides office staff with real-time insurance details to allow them to more efficiently collect patient payments; its automated appointment reminders reduce patient no-show rates, and scheduling functionality results in increased reimbursable patient well visit appointments. A simple, individual and secure login to our web-based platform gives physicians, other healthcare providers and staff members&#8217; access to a vast array of real time practice management data which they can access at the office or from any other location where they can access the Internet. Users can customize the &#8220;Practice Dashboard&#8221; to display only the most useful and relevant information needed to carry out their particular functions. We believe that this streamlined and centralized automated workflow allows providers to focus on delivering quality patient care rather than office administration.

&#160;

Electronic Health Records 

&#160; 

Our web-based electronic health records solution is one of the approximately 400 unique ambulatory electronic health record products that, as of February, 2016, has received 2014 Edition ONC-ACB certification as a Complete Ambulatory electronic health records solution. Moreover, in a previous study, KLAS, a leading independent industry assessor of healthcare information technology products, issued its annual electronic health records ranking and MTBC placed number five in our target market of one to ten providers, outperforming most leading electronic health records. A healthcare provider can use our solution to demonstrate &#8220;meaningful use&#8221; under federal law to earn incentives and avoid penalties. Our web-based electronic health records allow a provider to view all patient information in one online location, thus avoiding the need for numerous charts and records for each patient. Utilizing our web-based electronic health records solution, providers can track patients from their initial appointments; chart clinical data, history, and other personal information; enter and submit claims for medical services; and review and respond to queries for additional information regarding the billing process. Additionally, the electronic health record software delivers a robust document management system to enable providers to transition to paperless environments. The document management function makes available electronic connectivity between practitioners and patients, thereby streamlining patient care coordination and communications. In 2015, we introduced a tablet -based EHR, leveraging our web-based platform in a form that many providers find more convenient.

&#160;

Revenue Cycle Management and other Technology-driven Business Services 

&#160;

Our proprietary revenue cycle management offering is designed to improve the medical billing reimbursement process, allowing healthcare providers to accelerate and increase collections, reduce errors in submission and streamline workflow to free up practitioners to focus on patient care. Customers using PracticePro will generally see an improvement in their collections, as illustrated by the following for 2015:

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; Our first pass acceptance rate is approximately 95% &#183; Our first pass resolution rate is approximately 93% &#183; Our clients&#8217; median days in accounts receivable is 35 days for primary care and 39 days for combined specialties. &#160;

These rates are among the most competitive in the industry and compare favorably with the performance of our largest competitor. Our revenue cycle management service employs a proprietary rules-based system designed and constantly updated by our knowledgeable workforce, who screens and scrubs claims prior to submission for payment.

&#160; 

Mobile Health Solutions 

&#160;

The functionality of our cloud-based platform is extended to mobile devices through our integrated suite of mobile health applications. These mobile health applications include physician end-user tools that support, among other things, electronic prescribing, the capture of billing charges in the current medical coding formats, and the creation and secure transfer of clinical audio notes that are converted into text and billing charges. In 2015 we introduced an ICD-10 mHealth app for iOS and Android, which has emerged as the most popular ICD-10 app among U.S. healthcare providers. We also offer iCheckIn, a patient check-in app for iOS and Android-based tablet devices. Our patient applications allow patients to access their medical information, securely communicate with their doctors&#8217; office, schedule appointments, request prescription refills, pay balances and check-in for office appointments.

&#160; 

Voting Rights of Our Directors, Executive Officers, and Principal Stockholders 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015 45.8% of both the shares of our common stock and voting power of our common stock are held by our directors and executive officers.
