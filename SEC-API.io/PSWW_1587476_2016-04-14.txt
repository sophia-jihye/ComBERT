Corporate Information 

&#160; 

Principal Solar, Inc. is the successor company to Kupper Parker Communications, Inc. (&#8220;KPCG&#8221;), having been created in March 2011 through a reverse merger undertaken pursuant to an Exchange Agreement dated as of March 7, 2011, between Principal Solar, Inc. (a Texas corporation, &#8220;Principal Solar Texas&#8221;) and KPCG. 

&#160; 

Business 

&#160; 

Historically, our business plan has been to acquire, build, own, and operate profitable, large-scale solar generation facilities (collectively, "solar development"). The Company has failed to secure sufficient project financing to build large-scale solar generation facilities as planned, and is not considering any new large utility-scale solar projects at this time. Currently, the Company is negotiating to assign its interest in its Sunrise V (IS 42) project in order to create liquidity or otherwise remove obligations of the Company regarding current projects. The consummation of any agreement is subject to entering into a separate construction contract, and final closing is subject to the buyer securing financing and other conditions, some of which may be beyond the Company&#8217;s control. If all of the conditions are satisfied, the consummation of the assignment is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2016. See discussion below under "Disposition of Principal Sunrise V". The Company is also considering disposition of its remaining development projects acquired in partnership with Arowana International Limited ("Arowana"). See discussion below under &#8220;Additional Projects&#8221;. Successful disposition of one or more of the Company&#39;s projects is necessary to the Company&#39;s ability to meet its obligations coming due during 2016. Failure to complete the dispositions, or complete them on expected terms, could cause the Company to lose its cumulative investment in one or more of the projects and cause it to cease operations. 

&#160; 

Resulting from the expected and considered dispositions, the Company expects to make changes to its leadership team, including the expected departure concurrent with this filing of its Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, and Chief Technology Officer whose services may remain available to us for a time through a transition services agreement with their new employer, VivoPower USA, LLC, an affiliate of Arowana.

&#160; Disposition of Principal Sunrise V (aka IS 42) 

&#160; 

The Company is negotiating to assign its interest in Principal Sunrise V to a buyer contingent upon the assignee&#39;s ability to secure the necessary tax equity and debt financing (approximately $108 million combined) to build and operate the project. Tax equity is defined as temporary equity invested whose primary source of return is monetizing the tax attributes of the underlying investment ("tax equity"). The parties have selected a date of June 30, 2016, to secure the financing and close the transaction, and such date may be extended by the parties. If completed, under the assignment agreement the Company would be repaid its cumulative investment through the closing date ($5.1 million at March 31, 2016) and a separate development fee up to $4.0 million. As a part of the assignment, the Company guaranteed the assignee a 10% after-tax rate of return, with any deficit being deducted from the development fee to be received by the Company. Due to its variable nature, the ultimate development fee received by the Company is expected to range between $0 and $4 million to be paid incrementally between closing and commercial operation date ("COD") as the costs to construct the project become more certain. As a part of the transaction, the assignee has agreed to fund a portion of the development costs between signing and closing through a loan to the Company of up to $333 thousand, and the project seller has agreed to be paid their balance due at closing, both lessening the monthly cash burden to the Company. 

&#160; 

There can be no assurance the assignment of Principal Sunrise V will be closed or closed upon the terms described above, and failure to close or to close timely would result in a loss of the Company&#39;s investment to date. 

&#160; 

Additional Projects 

&#160; 

On August 20, 2015, the Company issued a promissory note and security agreement to Arowana in the original principal amount of $1,600,000. The note matures on December 31, 2016, and bears simple interest at the rate of 6% per annum (the "Arowana Note"). The note is convertible, at the option of the holder, into membership interests in our Principal Sunrise V project based upon a valuation not yet determinable. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The Company used the proceeds from the Arowana Note to make investments in two additional projects totaling 68MW AC ("Additional Projects"). The first of the two projects, 34.2MW AC in North Carolina, should begin construction in the second quarter of 2016 and is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2016. The second of the two projects, 33.8 MW AC also in North Carolina, is approximately 6 weeks behind the first. The Additional Projects serve as collateral for the Company&#8217;s obligations under the Arowana Note, which is otherwise unsecured and non-recourse to the Company. 

&#160; 

Arowana continues to fund the development costs of the Additional Projects and, at March 31, 2016, the cumulative investment in the Additional Projects totaled $7.9 million, and the balance of the Arowana Note was $8.0 million, including interest. There can be no assurance Arowana will continue funding the two projects and failing to do so could, depending upon the completion, timing, and proceeds from the assignment of Principal Sunrise V, cause the related power purchase agreements to be in default, resulting in a loss of all amounts invested to date.

White Papers, Standards, and Thought Leadership 

&#160; 

Over the past four years, via the acquisition and expansion of the Principal Solar Institute ( www.PrincipalSolarInstitute.org ) (the Company&#8217;s industry website), the Company has become one of the most prolific authors in the solar industry. The Company has produced multiple white papers and dozens of articles on solar and solar-related topics. The Institute also regularly hosts industry experts to conduct valuable and relevant webinars. The long-term goal is to publish an authoritative library of papers and webinars, which will represent a single source and resource for understanding the solar industry. In the fall of 2012, the Company launched the Principal Solar Ratings System, an industry-first ratings system that allows easy, unbiased, comprehensive analysis and comparison of PV modules and solar power generation systems. The Institute built the Ratings system by bringing together a standards committee consisting, in the view of our management, of some of the best known and highly regarded individuals in the sector.

Emerging Growth Company 

&#160; 

We are and we will remain an "emerging growth company" as defined under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the &#8220;JOBS Act&#8221;), until the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which our total annual revenues equal or exceed $1 billion (subject to adjustment for inflation), (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt securities, or (iv) the date on which we are deemed a "large accelerated filer" (with at least $700 million in public float) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;). Please refer to discussions under &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; below concerning how and when we may lose emerging growth company status and the various exemptions that are available to us. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to Section 102 of the JOBS Act, we have provided reduced executive compensation disclosure and have omitted a compensation discussion and analysis from this report. 

&#160; 

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#8220;Securities Act&#8221;) for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, we are choosing to &#8220;opt out&#8221; of such extended transition period and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.
