 Item 1. Business 

GENERAL INFORMATION 

O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. and its subsidiaries, collectively "we," "us," "our," the "Company," or "O'Reilly," is one of the largest specialty retailers of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment and accessories in the United States, selling our products to both do-it-yourself ("DIY") and professional service provider customers, our "dual market strategy." The business was founded in 1957 by Charles F. O'Reilly and his son, Charles H. ''Chub'' O'Reilly, Sr., and initially operated from a single store in Springfield, Missouri. Our common stock has traded on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol "ORLY" since April 22, 1993.

See the "Risk Factors" section of Item 1A of this annual report on Form 10-K for a description of certain risks relevant to our business. These risk factors include, among others, deteriorating economic conditions, competition in the automotive aftermarket business, our sensitivity to regional economic and weather conditions, future growth assurance, our dependence upon key and other personnel, our relationships with key suppliers and availability of key products, our acquisition strategies, complications in our distribution centers ("DCs"), failure to achieve high levels of service and product quality, unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly results, the volatility of the market price of our common stock, our increased debt levels, a downgrade in our credit ratings, data security, and environmental legislation and other regulations. 

OUR BUSINESS 

Our goal is to continue to achieve growth in sales and profitability by capitalizing on our competitive advantages and executing our growth strategy. We remain confident in our ability to continue to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core O'Reilly values, including superior customer service and expense control. Our intent is to be the dominant auto parts provider in all the markets we serve, by providing a higher level of customer service and a better value position than our competitors to both DIY and professional service provider customers. 

Competitive Advantages 

We believe our effective dual market strategy, superior customer service, technically proficient store personnel, strategic distribution network and experienced management team make up our key competitive advantages, which cannot be easily duplicated. 

Proven Ability to Execute Our Dual Market Strategy: 

For more than 35 &#32;years, we have established a track record of effectively serving, at a high level, both DIY and professional service provider customers. We believe our proven ability to effectively execute a dual market strategy is a unique competitive advantage. The execution of this strategy enables us to better compete by targeting a larger base of consumers of automotive aftermarket parts, capitalizing on our existing retail and distribution infrastructure, operating profitably in both large markets and less densely populated geographic areas that typically attract fewer competitors, and enhancing service levels offered to DIY customers through the offering of a broad inventory and the extensive product knowledge required by professional service providers. 

In 2015 , we derived approximately 58% &#32;of our sales from our DIY customers and approximately 42% &#32;of our sales from our professional service provider customers. Historically, we have increased our sales to professional service provider customers at a faster pace than the increase in our sales to DIY customers due to the more fragmented nature of the professional service provider business, which offers a greater opportunity for consolidation. We believe we will continue to have a competitive advantage on the professional service provider portion of our business, due to our systems, knowledge and experience serving the professional service provider side of the automotive aftermarket, supported by our approximately 700 &#32;full-time sales staff dedicated solely to calling upon and servicing the professional service provider customer. We will also continue to expand and enhance the level of offerings focused on growing our DIY business and will continue to execute our proven dual market strategy in both existing and new markets. 

Superior Customer Service: 

We seek to provide our customers with an efficient and pleasant in-store experience by maintaining attractive stores in convenient locations with a wide selection of automotive products. We believe that the satisfaction of DIY and professional service provider customers is substantially dependent upon our ability to provide, in a timely fashion, the specific automotive products needed to complete their repairs. Accordingly, each O'Reilly store carries, or has same or next day availability to, a broad selection of automotive products designed to cover a wide range of vehicle applications. We continuously refine the inventory levels and assortments carried in each of our stores and within our network, based in large part on the sales movement tracked by our inventory control system, market vehicle registration data, failure rates and management's assessment of the changes and trends in the marketplace. We have no material backorders for the products we sell. 

We seek to attract new DIY and professional service provider customers and to retain existing customers by offering superior customer service, the key elements of which are identified below: 

&#8226; 

superior in-store service through highly-motivated, technically-proficient store personnel ("Professional Parts People"); 

&#8226; 

an extensive selection and availability of products; 

&#8226; 

attractive stores in convenient locations; 

&#8226; 

competitive pricing, supported by a good, better, best product assortment designed to meet all of our customers' quality and value preferences; and 

&#8226; 

a robust point-of-sale system integrated with our proprietary electronic catalog, which contains a wide variety of product images, schematics and technical specifications, equips our Team Members with highly effective tools to source products in our extensive supply network. 

Technically Proficient Professional Parts People: 

Our highly-motivated, technically-proficient Professional Parts People provide us with a significant competitive advantage, particularly over less specialized retail operators. We require our Professional Parts People to undergo extensive and ongoing training and to be knowledgeable, particularly with respect to hard part repairs, in order to better serve the technically-oriented professional service provider customers with whom they interact on a daily basis. Such technical proficiency also enhances the customer service we provide to our DIY customers who value the expert assistance provided by our Professional Parts People. 

Strategic Regional Tiered Distribution Network: 

We believe our commitment to a robust, regional, tiered distribution network provides superior replenishment and access to hard-to-find parts and enables us to optimize product availability and inventory levels throughout our store network. Our strategic, regional, tiered distribution network includes DCs and Hub stores. Our inventory management and distribution systems electronically link each of our stores to one or more DCs, which provides for efficient inventory control and management. We currently operate 26 &#32;regional DCs, which provide our stores with same-day or overnight access to an average of 146,000 &#32;stock keeping units ("SKUs"), many of which are hard-to-find items not typically stocked by other auto parts retailers. To augment our robust DC network, we operate 297 &#32;Hub stores that also provide delivery service and same-day access to an average of 44,000 &#32;SKUs to other stores within the surrounding area. We believe this timely access to a broad range of products is a key competitive advantage in satisfying customer demand and generating repeat business. 

Experienced Management Team: 

Our Company philosophy is to "promote from within" and the vast majority of our senior management, district managers and store managers have been promoted from within the Company. We augment this promote from within philosophy by pursuing strategic hires with a strong emphasis on automotive aftermarket experience. We have a strong management team comprised of senior management with 174 &#32;professionals who average 18 &#32;years of service; 236 &#32;corporate managers who average 16 &#32;years of service; and 444 &#32;district managers who average 12 &#32;years of service. Our management team has demonstrated the consistent ability to successfully execute our business plan and growth strategy by generating 23 &#32;consecutive years of record revenues and earnings and positive comparable store sales results since becoming a public company in April of 1993. 

Growth Strategy 

Aggressively Open New Stores: 

We intend to continue to consolidate the fragmented automotive aftermarket. During 2015 , we opened 205 &#32;net, new stores and we plan to open approximately 210 &#32;net, new stores in 2016 , which will increase our penetration in existing markets and allow for expansion into new, contiguous markets. The sites for these new stores have been identified, and to date, we have not experienced significant difficulties in locating suitable sites for construction of new stores or identifying suitable acquisition targets for conversion to O'Reilly stores. We typically open new stores by (i) constructing a new facility or renovating an existing one on property we purchase or lease and stocking the new store with fixtures and inventory; (ii) acquiring an independently owned auto parts store, typically by the purchase of substantially all of the inventory and other assets (other than realty) of such store; or (iii) purchasing multi-store chains. New store sites are strategically located in clusters within geographic areas that complement our distribution network in order to achieve economies of scale in management, advertising and distribution. Other key factors we consider in the site selection process include population density and growth patterns, demographic lifestyle segmentation, age and per capita income, vehicle traffic counts, number and type of existing automotive repair facilities, competing auto parts stores within a predetermined radius, and the number of competitors. 

We target both small and large markets for expansion of our store network. While we have faced, and expect to continue to face, aggressive competition in the more densely populated markets, we believe we have competed effectively, and are well positioned to continue to compete effectively, in such markets and to achieve our goal of continued profitable sales growth within these markets. We also believe that with our dual market strategy, we are better able to operate stores in less densely populated areas, which would not otherwise support a national chain store selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket. Therefore, we continue to pursue opening new stores in less densely populated market areas as part of our growth strategy. 

Grow Sales in Existing Stores: 

Profitable comparable store sales growth is also an important part of our growth strategy. To achieve improved sales and profitability at existing O'Reilly stores, we continually strive to improve the service provided to our customers. We believe that while competitive pricing is an essential component of successful growth in the automotive aftermarket business, it is customer satisfaction, whether of the DIY consumer or professional service provider, resulting from superior customer service that generates increased sales and profitability. 

Selectively Pursue Strategic Acquisitions: 

The automotive aftermarket industry is still highly fragmented, and we believe the ability of national auto parts chains, such as ourselves, to operate more efficiently and effectively than smaller independent operators will result in continued industry consolidation. Our intention is to continue to selectively pursue strategic acquisition targets that will strengthen our position as a leading automotive aftermarket parts supplier in existing markets and provide a springboard for expansion into new markets. 

Continually Enhance Store Design and Location: 

Our current prototype store design features optimized square footage, high ceilings, convenient interior store layouts, improved in-store signage, bright lighting, convenient ingress and egress and parking, and dedicated counters to serve professional service providers, each designed to increase sales and operating efficiencies and enhance overall customer service. We continually update the location and condition of our store network through systematic renovation and relocation of our existing stores to enhance store performance. During 

2015 , we relocated 24 &#32;stores and renovated 41 &#32;stores. We believe that our ability to consistently achieve growth in comparable store sales is due in part to our commitment to maintaining an attractive store network, which is strategically located to best serve our customers. 

Continually Enhance the Growth and Functionality of Our E-Commerce Website: 

Our user-friendly website, www.oreillyauto.com , allows our customers to search product and repair content, check the in-store availability of our products, and place orders for either home delivery or in-store pickup. We continue to enhance the functionality of our website to provide our customers with a friendly and convenient shopping experience, as well as a robust product and repair content information resource, which will continue to build the O'Reilly Brand. 

Team Members 

As of January 31, 2016 , we employed 71,943 &#32;Team Members ( 37,879 &#32;full-time Team Members and 34,064 &#32;part-time Team Members), of whom 61,411 &#32;were employed at our stores, 7,612 &#32;were employed at our DCs and 2,920 &#32;were employed at our corporate and regional offices. A union represents 50 &#32;stores ( 538 &#32;Team Members) in the Greater Bay Area in California and has for many years. In addition, approximately 108 &#32;Team Members who drive over-the-road trucks in three &#32;of our DCs are represented by a labor union. Except for these Team Members, our Team Members are not represented by labor unions. Our tradition for 59 &#32;years has been to treat all of our Team Members with honesty and respect and to commit significant resources to instill in them our "Live Green" culture, which emphasizes the importance of each Team Member's contribution to the success of O'Reilly. This focus on professionalism and respect has created an industry-leading team, and we consider our relations with our Team Members to be excellent. 

Store Network 

New Store Site Selection: 

In selecting sites for new stores, we seek to strategically locate store sites in clusters within geographic areas in order to achieve economies of scale in management, advertising and distribution. Other key factors we consider in the site selection process are 

&#8226; 

population density; 

&#8226; 

demographics including age, ethnicity, life style and per capita income; 

&#8226; 

market economic strength, retail draw and growth patterns; 

&#8226; 

number, age and percent of makes and models of registered vehicles; 

&#8226; 

the number, type and sales potential of existing automotive repair facilities; 

&#8226; 

the number of auto parts stores and other competitors within a predetermined radius; 

&#8226; 

physical location, traffic count, size, economics and presentation of the site; 

&#8226; 

financial review of adjacent existing locations; and 

&#8226; 

the type and size of store that should be developed. 

When entering new, more densely populated markets, we generally seek to initially open several stores within a short span of time in order to maximize the effect of initial promotional programs and achieve economies of scale. After opening this initial cluster of new stores, we seek to begin penetrating the less densely populated surrounding areas. As these store clusters mature, we evaluate the need to open additional locations in the more densely populated markets where we believe opportunities exist to expand our market share or to improve the level of service provided in high volume areas. This strategy enables us to achieve additional distribution and advertising efficiencies in each market. 

Store Locations and Size: 

As a result of our dual market strategy, we are able to profitably operate in both large, densely populated markets and small, less densely populated areas that would not otherwise support a national chain selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket. Our stores, on average, carry approximately 23,000 &#32;SKUs and average approximately 7,200 &#32;total square feet in size. At December 31, 2015 , we had a total of approximately 33 million &#32;square feet in our 4,571 &#32;stores. Our stores are served primarily by the nearest DC, which averages 146,000 &#32;SKUs, but also have same-day access to the broad selection of inventory available at one of our 297 &#32;Hub stores, which, on average, carry approximately 44,000 &#32;SKUs and average approximately 10,000 &#32;square feet in size. 

We believe that our stores are ''destination stores'' generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by the presence of other stores in the immediate vicinity. Consequently, most of our stores are freestanding buildings or prominent end caps situated on or near major traffic thoroughfares and offer ample parking, easy customer access and are generally located in close proximity to our professional service provider customers. 

The following table sets forth the geographic distribution and activity of our stores as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 :

Store Layout: 

We utilize a computer-assisted store layout system to provide a uniform and consistent front room retail merchandise presentation and customize our hard-parts inventory assortment to meet the specific needs of a particular market area. Front room merchandise is arranged to provide easy customer access, maximum selling space and to prominently display high-turnover products and accessories to customers. To ensure the best customer experience possible, we have selectively implemented bilingual, in-store signage based on the demographics in each store's geographic area. Aisle displays and end caps are used to feature high-demand, seasonal merchandise, new items and advertised specials. 

Store Automation: 

To enhance store-level operations, customer service and reliability, we use Linux servers and IBM I-Series computer systems in our stores. These systems are linked with the I-Series computers located in each of our DCs. Our point-of-sale system provides immediate access to our electronic catalog, part images and schematics and pricing information by make, model and year of vehicle. This system speeds transaction times, reduces the customer's checkout time, ensures accuracy and provides enhanced customer service. Moreover, our store automation systems capture detailed sales information, which assists in store management, strategic planning, inventory control and distribution efficiency. 

Management Structure 

Each of our stores is staffed with a store manager and one or more assistant managers, in addition to parts specialists, retail and/or installer service specialists and other positions required to meet the specific needs of each store. Each of our 444 &#32;district managers has general supervisory responsibility for an average of ten &#32;stores, which provides our stores with a strong operational support. 

Store and district managers complete a comprehensive training program to ensure each has a thorough understanding of customer service, leadership, inventory management and store profitability, as well as all other sales and operational aspects of our business model. Store and district managers are also required to complete a structured training program that is specific to their position, including attending a week-long manager development program at the corporate headquarters in Springfield, Missouri. Store and district managers also receive continuous training through online assignments, field workshops, regional meetings and our annual managers' conference. 

We provide financial incentives to all store Team Members through incentive compensation programs. Under our incentive compensation programs, base salary is augmented by incentive compensation based on individual and store sales and profitability. In addition, each of our district managers participates in our stock option and bonus programs, and store managers participate in bonus programs based on their store's performance. We believe our incentive compensation programs significantly increase the motivation and overall performance of our store Team Members and enhance our ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel. 

Professional Parts People 

We believe our highly trained team of Professional Parts People is essential in providing superior customer service to both DIY and professional service provider customers. A significant portion of our business is from professional service provider customers; therefore, our Professional Parts People are required to be highly technically proficient in automotive products. In addition, we have found that the typical DIY customer often seeks assistance from Professional Parts People, particularly when purchasing hard parts. The ability of our Professional Parts People to provide such assistance to the DIY customer creates a favorable impression and is a significant factor in generating repeat DIY business. 

We screen prospective Team Members to identify highly motivated individuals who either have experience with automotive parts or repairs, or automotive aptitude. New store Team Members go through a comprehensive orientation focused on the culture of our Company, as well as the requirements for their specific job position. Additionally, during their first year of employment, our parts specialists go through extensive automotive systems and product knowledge training to ensure they are able to provide high levels of service to our customers. Once all of the required training has been satisfied, our parts specialists become eligible to take the O'Reilly Certified Parts Professional test. Passing the O'Reilly test helps prepare them to become certified by the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence (ASE). 

All of our stores have the ability to service professional service provider customers. For this reason, select Team Members in each store complete extensive sales call training with a regional field sales manager. Afterward, these Team Members spend at least one day per week calling on existing and potential professional service provider customers. Additionally, each Team Member engaged in such sales activities participates in quarterly advanced training programs for sales and business development. 

Distribution Systems 

We believe that our tiered distribution model provides industry-leading parts availability and store in-stock positions, while lowering our inventory carrying costs by controlling the depth of our inventory. Moreover, we believe our ongoing, significant capital investments made in our DC network allows us to efficiently service new stores that are planned to open in contiguous market areas as well as servicing our existing store network. Our distribution expansion strategy complements our new store opening strategy by supporting newly established clusters of stores and additional penetration into existing markets in the regions surrounding each DC. 

Distribution Centers: 

As of December 31, 2015 , we operated 26 &#32;DCs comprised of approximately 10.0 million &#32;operating square feet (see the "Properties" table in Item 2 of this Form 10-K for a detailed listing of DC operating square footages). Our DCs stock an average of 146,000 &#32;SKUs and most DCs are linked to and have the ability to access multiple other regional DCs' on-hand inventory. Our DCs provide five-night-a-week delivery, primarily via a Company-owned fleet, to all of our stores in the continental United States. In addition, stores within an individual DC's metropolitan area receive multiple daily deliveries from the DC's "city counter," most of which receive this service seven days per week. Our DCs also provide weekend service not only to stores they service via their city counters but also to strategic Hub locations, which redistribute products to surrounding stores. Our national Hub store network provides additional service throughout the week, and on weekends, to surrounding stores. 

As part of our continuing efforts to enhance our distribution network in 2016 , we plan to 

&#8226; 

finish implementing voice picking technology in our last remaining DC in Billings, Montana; 

&#8226; 

continue to implement enhanced routing software to further enhance logistics efficiencies; 

&#8226; 

continue to implement labor management software to improve DC productivity and overall operating efficiency; 

&#8226; continue to define and implement best practices in all DCs; 

&#8226; 

make proven, return-on-investment based capital enhancements to material handling equipment in DCs, including conveyor systems, picking modules and lift equipment; and 

&#8226; 

enhance our distribution network by adding one &#32;additional new DC in Texas and expanding one existing DC in North Carolina. 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had a total growth capacity of over 600 &#32;stores in our existing distribution center network. In 2016, we plan to open one additional DC, which will be located in Selma, near San Antonio, Texas. This new DC will have the capacity to service 250 &#32;stores and, taking into account this new DC and 210 &#32;planned, net, new store openings in 2016, we expect to end the year in 2016 with a total growth capacity in our distribution network of over 600 &#32;stores. 

Hub stores: 

We currently operate 297 &#32;strategically located Hub stores. In addition to serving DIY and professional service provider customers in their markets, Hub stores also provide delivery service to our other stores within the surrounding area and access to an expanded selection of SKUs on a same-day basis. Our Hub stores average approximately 10,000 &#32;square feet and carry an average of 44,000 &#32;SKUs. 

Products and Purchasing 

Our stores offer DIY and professional service provider customers a wide selection of products for domestic and imported automobiles, vans and trucks. Our merchandise generally consists of nationally recognized, well-advertised, premium name brand products, such as AC Delco, Armor All, Bosch, BWD, Cardone, Castrol, Gates Rubber, Monroe, Moog, Pennzoil, Prestone, Quaker State, STP, Turtle Wax, Valvoline, Wagner, and Wix, and a wide selection of quality proprietary private label products, which span the entire good, better and best value spectrum, under our BestTest&#174;, BrakeBest&#174;, Import Direct&#174;, Master Pro&#174;, Micro-Gard&#174;, Murray&#174;, Omnispark&#174;, O'Reilly Auto Parts&#174;, Precision&#174;, Power Torque&#174;, Super Start&#174;, and Ultima&#174; brands. Our proprietary private label products are produced by nationally recognized manufacturers, meet or exceed original equipment manufacturer specifications and consist of house brands and nationally recognized proprietary bands, which we have acquired or developed over time. Our "good" house brands provide a great combination of quality and value, a characteristic important to our DIY customers, while our proprietary national brands offer "better" and "best" options for our more heavy-duty DIY customers, as well as our professional service provider customers, who require high quality products that can be relied upon to support and grow their businesses. 

We have no &#32;long-term contracts with material purchase commitments with any of our suppliers, nor have we experienced difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative supply sources for automotive parts. We believe that alternative supply sources exist at competitive costs, for substantially all of the automotive products that we sell. It is our policy to take advantage of payment and seasonal purchasing discounts offered by our suppliers and to utilize extended dating terms available from suppliers. We have entered into various programs and arrangements with certain suppliers that provided for extended dating and payment terms for inventory purchases. As a whole, we consider our relationships with our suppliers to be very good. 

We purchase automotive products in substantial quantities from over 900 &#32;suppliers, the five largest of which accounted for approximately 22% &#32;of our total purchases in 2015 . Our largest supplier in 2015 &#32;accounted for approximately 6% &#32;of our total purchases and the next four largest suppliers each accounted for approximately 3% &#32;to 5% &#32;of our total purchases. 

Marketing 

Marketing to the DIY Customer: 

We use an integrated marketing program, which includes radio, direct mail and newspaper distribution, in-store, online, and social media promotions, and sports and event sponsorships, to aggressively attract DIY customers. The marketing strategy we employ is highly effective and has led to a measurable increase in awareness of the O'Reilly Brand across our geographic footprint. We utilize a combination of brand, product and price messaging to drive retail traffic and purchases, which frequently coincide with key sales events. We also utilize a problem-resolution communication strategy, which encourages vehicle owners to perform regular maintenance on their vehicles, protecting their long-term automotive investment and establishing O'Reilly as their partner for auto parts needs. 

To stimulate sales among racing enthusiasts, who we believe individually spend more on automotive products than the general public, we sponsored multiple nationally-televised races and over 1,300 &#32;grassroots, local and regional motorsports events throughout 43 &#32;states during 2015 . We were the title sponsor of two &#32;National Association for Stock Car Racing (NASCAR) National series events and one &#32;National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) race. 

During the fall and winter months, we strategically sponsor National Collegiate Athletic Association ("NCAA") basketball. Our relationships with over 30 &#32;NCAA teams and tournaments have resulted in prominently displayed O'Reilly logos on TV-visible signs throughout the season. 

We target Spanish speaking auto parts customers through marketing efforts that include the use of Spanish language radio, print, and outdoor advertising, as well as sponsorships of over 45 &#32;local and regional festivals and events. 

As consumers increasingly turn to the Internet for information and offers, we continue to invest in digital channels to expand the O'Reilly brand presence online and through mobile devices. Search engine optimization strategies are used to drive traffic to our website, and popular social media platforms are used to provide excellent customer service through interaction and dialogue with our customers. 

To show appreciation for our DIY customers for their continued business, we maintain our O'Reilly O'Rewards customer loyalty program. The program provides members with the opportunity to earn points through purchases and other special events and allows members to redeem those points toward coupons, which provide discounts on future merchandise purchases in our stores. The programs allow us to reward our customers for their continued business, as well as enhance engagement with our customers to earn more of their business with targeted promotions tailored to their specific needs and purchasing patterns. 

Marketing to the Professional Service Provider Customer: 

We have approximately 700 &#32;full-time O'Reilly sales representatives strategically located across our market areas as part of our First Call program. Each sales representative is dedicated solely to calling upon, selling to and servicing our professional service provider customers. Targeted marketing materials such as flyers, quick reference guides and catalogs are produced and distributed on a regular basis to professional service providers, paint and body shops and fleet customers. Our industry-leading First Call program enables our sales representatives, district managers, and store managers to provide excellent customer service to each of our professional service provider accounts by providing the products and services identified below: 

&#8226; 

broad selection of merchandise at competitive prices; 

&#8226; 

dedicated Professional Service Specialists in our stores; 

&#8226; 

multiple, daily deliveries from our stores; 

&#8226; 

same-day or overnight access to an average of 146,000 &#32;SKUs through seven day store inventory replenishments; 

&#8226; 

separate service counter and phone line in our stores dedicated exclusively to service professional service providers; 

&#8226; 

trade credit for qualified accounts; 

&#8226; 

First Call Online, a dedicated proprietary Internet based catalog and ordering system designed specifically to connect professional service providers directly to our inventory system; 

&#8226; 

Mitchell shop management systems; 

&#8226; 

training and seminars covering topics of interest, such as technical updates, safety and general business management; 

&#8226; 

access to a comprehensive inventory of products and equipment needed to operate and maintain their shop; and 

&#8226; 

Certified Auto Repair Center Program, a program that provides professional service providers with business tools they can utilize to profitably grow and market their shops. 

Marketing to the Independently Owned Parts Store: 

We also sell automotive products directly to independently owned parts stores ("jobber stores") in certain market areas. These jobber stores are generally located in areas not directly serviced by an O'Reilly store. We administer a proprietary, dedicated and distinct marketing program specifically targeted to jobber stores called Parts City Auto Parts that currently provides automotive products to approximately 190 &#32;jobber stores, with total annual sales of approximately $60 million . As a participant in this program, a jobber store, which meets certain financial and operational standards, is permitted to indicate its Parts City Auto Parts membership through the display of a trademarked logo owned by us. In return for a commitment to purchase automotive products from us, we provide computer software for business management, competitive pricing, advertising, marketing and sales assistance to Parts City Auto Parts affiliate stores. 

Pricing 

We believe that competitive pricing is essential to successfully operate in the automotive aftermarket business. Product pricing is generally established to compete with the pricing of competitors in the market area served by each store. Most products that we sell are priced based upon a combination of internal gross margin targets and competitive reviews, with additional savings offered on some items through special promotional pricing and volume discounts. Consistent with our low price guarantee, each of our stores will match any verifiable price on any in-stock product of the same or comparable quality offered by our competitors in the same market area. 

Customer Payments and Returns Policy 

Our stores accept cash, checks, debit and credit cards. We also grant credit to many professional service provider customers who meet our pre-established credit requirements. Some of the factors considered in our pre-established credit requirements include customer creditworthiness, past transaction history with the customer, current economic and industry trends and changes in customer payment terms. No customer accounted for greater than one &#32;percent of our consolidated net sales, nor do we have any dependence on any single customer. 

We accept product returns for new products, core products and warranty/defective products. 

INDUSTRY ENVIRONMENT 

The automotive aftermarket industry includes all products and services purchased for light and heavy-duty vehicles after the original sale. The total size of the automotive aftermarket is estimated to be approximately $256 billion , according to The Auto Care Association. This market is made up of four segments: labor share of professional service provider sales, auto parts share of professional service provider sales, DIY sales and tire sales. O'Reilly's addressable market within this industry is approximately $146 billion , which includes the auto parts share of professional service provider sales and DIY sales. We do not sell tires or perform for-fee automotive repairs or installations. 

Competition 

The sale of automotive aftermarket items is highly competitive in many areas, including customer service, product availability, store location, brand recognition and price. We compete in both the DIY and professional service provider portions of the automotive aftermarket and are one of the largest specialty retailers within that market. We compete primarily with 

&#8226; 

national retail and wholesale automotive parts chains (such as AutoZone, Inc., Advance Auto Parts, CARQUEST, NAPA and the Pep Boys - Manny, Moe and Jack, Inc.); 

&#8226; 

regional retail and wholesale automotive parts chains; 

&#8226; 

wholesalers or jobber stores (some of which are associated with national automotive parts distributors or associations such as NAPA, CARQUEST, Bumper to Bumper and Auto Value); 

&#8226; 

automobile dealers; and 

&#8226; 

mass merchandisers that carry automotive replacement parts, maintenance items and accessories (such as Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.). 

We compete on the basis of customer service, which includes merchandise selection and availability, technical proficiency and helpfulness of store personnel, price, store layout and convenient and accessible store locations. Our dual market strategy requires significant capital, such as the capital expenditures required for our distribution and store networks and working capital needed to maintain inventory levels necessary for providing products to both the DIY and professional service provider portions of the automotive aftermarket. 

Inflation and Seasonality 

We have been successful, in many cases, in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of supplier incentive programs, economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying. To the extent our acquisition costs increase due to base commodity price increases industry wide, we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products. As a result, we do not believe our operations have been materially, adversely affected by inflation. 

To some extent our business is seasonal, primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns. Store sales, profits and inventory levels have historically been higher in the second and third quarters (April through September) than in the first and fourth quarters (October through March) of the year. 

Regulations 

We are subject to federal, state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to our business, including those related to the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous substances, the recycling of batteries and used lubricants, and the ownership and operation of real property. 

As part of our operations, we handle hazardous materials in the ordinary course of business and our customers may bring hazardous materials onto our property in connection with, for example, our oil and battery recycling programs. We currently provide a recycling program for batteries and the collection of used lubricants at certain stores as a service to our customers pursuant to agreements with third-party suppliers. The batteries and used lubricants are collected by our Team Members, deposited into supplier-provided containers and pallets, and then disposed of by the third-party suppliers. In general, our agreements with such suppliers contain provisions that are designed to limit our potential liability under applicable environmental regulations for any damage or contamination, which may be caused by the batteries and lubricants to off-site properties (including as a result of waste disposal) and to our properties, when caused by the supplier. 

Compliance with any such laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our operations to date. However, we cannot give any assurance that we will not incur significant expenses in the future in order to comply with any such laws or regulations.
