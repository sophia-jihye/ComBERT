AMC Networks Inc. was incorporated on March 9, 2011 as an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Cablevision Systems Corporation (Cablevision Systems Corporation and its subsidiaries are referred to as &#8220;Cablevision&#8221;). On June 30, 2011, Cablevision spun off the Company (the &#8220;Distribution&#8221;), and AMC Networks Inc. became an independent public company. In connection with the Distribution, Cablevision contributed all of the membership interests of Rainbow Media Holdings LLC (&#8220;RMH&#8221;) to the Company. RMH owned, directly or indirectly, the businesses included in Cablevision&#8217;s Rainbow Media segment. Both Cablevision and AMC Networks continue to be controlled by Charles F. Dolan, certain members of his immediate family and certain family-related entities (collectively the &#8220;Dolan Family&#8221;). 

Our Company 

AMC Networks owns and operates several of the most recognized brands in television, delivering high quality content to audiences and a valuable platform to distributors and advertisers. We have operated in the cable programming industry for more than 30 years, and, over this time, we have continually enhanced the value of our network portfolio. Our programming networks are well known and well regarded by our key constituents &#8212; our viewers, distributors and advertisers &#8212; and have developed strong followings within their respective targeted demographics, increasing their value to distributors and advertisers. 

In the United States (&#8220;U.S.&#8221;), our programming channels are AMC, WE tv, BBC AMERICA (our joint venture with BBC Worldwide Americas, Inc.), IFC and SundanceTV. Each of our programming channels have established themselves within their respective markets. Our deep and established presence in the industry and the recognition we have received for our brands through industry awards and other honors lend us a high degree of credibility with distributors and content producers, and help provide us with stable affiliate and studio relationships, advantageous channel placements and heightened viewer engagement. Over the past several years, we have begun to produce some of our own original programming. Our ability to produce owned high quality content has provided us with the opportunity to distribute such content on platforms other than our domestic networks. We have principally licensed content for linear distribution internationally, digital distribution, home video and syndication. 

Internationally, we deliver programming that reaches subscribers in more than 140 countries and territories, including countries and territories in Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and parts of Asia and Africa. The global division of the Company, AMC Networks International (&#8220;AMCNI&#8221;) consists of global brands, including Sundance Channel and AMC, in the movie and entertainment programming genres, as well as popular, locally recognized channels in various other programming genres. 

Our Strategy 

Our strategy is to maintain and improve our position as a leading programming and entertainment company by owning and operating several of the most popular and award-winning brands in cable television that create engagement with audiences globally across multiple media and distribution platforms. The key focuses of our strategy are: 

Continued Development of High-Quality Original Programming . We intend to continue developing strong original programming across all of our programming networks to enhance our brands, strengthen our relationships with our viewers, distributors and advertisers, and increase distribution and audience ratings. We intend to continue to seek increased distribution of our national networks to grow affiliate and advertising revenues. We believe that our continued investment in original programming supports future growth in distribution and advertising revenue. We also intend to continue to expand the exploitation of our original programming across multiple media and distribution platforms. 

Increased Global Distribution . We are expanding the distribution of our programming networks around the globe. We first expanded beyond the U.S. market with the launch in Canada of IFC (in 2001) and AMC (in 2006), and Sundance Channel in Europe (in 2010). In 2014, AMC was launched internationally and is now available in over 120 countries, replacing the 

MGM channel in certain territories. Additionally, Sundance Channel has expanded its distribution to over 70 countries. AMC Networks International's channels are available in over 390 million homes worldwide. 

Continued Growth of Advertising Revenue . We have a proven track record of significantly increasing revenue by introducing advertising on networks that were previously not advertiser-supported. We first accomplished this in 2002, when we moved AMC and WE tv to an advertiser-supported model, followed by IFC in December 2010, and SundanceTV in September 2013. Prior to September 2013, SundanceTV principally sold sponsorships. We seek to continue to evolve the programming on each of our networks to achieve even stronger viewer engagement within their respective core targeted demographics, thereby increasing the value of our programming to advertisers and allowing us to obtain higher advertising rates. We are continuing to seek additional advertising revenue through higher Nielsen ratings in desirable demographics. 

Increased Control of Content . We believe that control (including long-term contract arrangements) and ownership of content is becoming increasingly important, and we intend to increase our control position over our programming content. We currently control, own or have long-term license agreements covering significant portions of our content across our programming networks as well as in our independent film distribution business operated by IFC Films. We intend to continue to focus on obtaining the broadest possible control rights (both as to territory and platforms) for our content. 

Exploitation of Other Media Platforms . The technological landscape surrounding the distribution of entertainment content has expanded to include other digital platforms. We distribute our content across many of these platforms, when it makes business sense to do so, so that our viewers can access our content where, when and how they want it. To that end, our programming networks are allowing many of our distributors to offer our content to subscribers on computers and other digital devices, and on video-on-demand platforms, all of which permit subscribers to access programs at their convenience. We also make our IFC Films library and certain of our other content available on third-party digital platforms such as Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime and iTunes. We recently launched two subscription based, digital video-on-demand services called SundanceNow DocClub TM , featuring independent films and documentaries, and Shudder TM , dedicated to the horror genre. In addition to amc.com, which delivers approximately 5 million unique browsers each month, our networks each host dedicated websites that promote their brands, provide programming information and provide access to content. 

Revenue 

We earn revenue principally from the distribution of our programming and the sale of advertising. Distribution revenues primarily include affiliation fees paid by distributors to carry our programming networks as well as revenue earned from the licensing of original programming for digital, foreign and home video distribution. In 2015 , distribution revenues and advertising sales accounted for 60% &#32;and 40% &#32;of our consolidated revenues, net, respectively. No customer accounted for more than 10% of consolidated revenues, net for the year ended December 31, 2015 . 

Distribution Revenue 

Affiliation Agreements . Our programming networks are distributed to our viewing audience throughout the U.S. and around the world via cable and other multichannel video programming distribution platforms, including direct broadcast satellite (&#8220;DBS&#8221;) and platforms operated by telecommunications providers (collectively &#8220;distributors&#8221;) pursuant to affiliation agreements with the distributors. These agreements, which typically have durations of several years, require us to deliver programming that meets certain standards set forth in the agreement. We earn affiliation fees under these agreements, generally based upon the number of each distributor&#8217;s subscribers or, in some cases, based on a fixed contractual monthly fee. Our affiliation agreements also give us the right to sell a specific amount of advertising time on our programming networks. Our programming networks&#8217; existing affiliation agreements expire at various dates through 2024 . 

We frequently negotiate with distributors in an effort to increase the subscriber base for our networks. We have in some instances made upfront payments to distributors in exchange for these additional subscribers or agreed to waive or accept lower subscriber fees if certain numbers of additional subscribers are provided. We also may help fund the distributors&#8217; efforts to market our programming networks or we may permit distributors to offer limited promotional periods without payment of subscriber fees. As we continue our efforts to add subscribers, our subscriber revenue may be negatively affected by such deferred carriage fee arrangements, discounted subscriber fees and other payments; however, we believe that these transactions generate a positive return on investment over the contract period. 

Licensing Agreements: Our programming businesses sell rights to our owned original programming and related brands for distribution in a variety of forms including television markets worldwide, subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) services, such as Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime and physical (DVD and Blu-ray) formats. 

Advertising Revenue 

We earn advertising revenue by selling advertising time on our programming networks. In the U.S., we sell advertising time in both the upfront and scatter markets. In the upfront market, advertisers buy advertising time for the upcoming season, and by purchasing in advance, often receive discounted rates. In the scatter market, advertisers buy advertising time close to 

the time when the commercials will be run, and often pay a premium. The mix between the upfront and scatter markets is based upon a number of factors, such as pricing, demand for advertising time and economic conditions. Internationally, advertising markets vary by jurisdiction. The majority of international advertising is sold close to the time when the commercials will be run (similar to the U.S. scatter market) and we are represented by third-party sales agents in a number of markets. 

Our arrangements with advertisers provide for a set number of advertising units to air over a specific period of time at a negotiated price per unit. In most domestic advertising sales arrangements, our programming networks guarantee specified viewer ratings for their programming. If these guaranteed viewer ratings are not met, we are generally required to provide additional advertising units to the advertiser at no charge. For these types of arrangements, a portion of the related revenue is deferred if the guaranteed viewer ratings are not met and is subsequently recognized either when we provide the required additional advertising time, the guarantee obligation contractually expires or performance requirements become remote. In the U.S., most of our advertising revenues vary based upon the popularity of our programming as measured by Nielsen. In addition to the Nielsen rating, our advertising rates are also influenced by the demographic mix of our viewing audiences, since advertisers tend to pay premium rates for more desirable demographic groups of viewers. 

Our programming networks have advertisers representing companies in a broad range of sectors, including the health, automotive, food, insurance and entertainment industries. All of our National Networks use a traditional advertising sales model. 

Programming 

We obtain programming through a combination of development, production and licensing; and we distribute programming directly to consumers in the U.S. and throughout the world through our programming networks as well as theatrical release. Our programming includes original programming that we control, either through outright ownership or through long-term licensing arrangements, as well as acquired programming that we license from studios and other rights holders. Since our founding in 1980, we have been a pioneer in the cable television programming industry, having created or developed some of the industry&#8217;s leading programming networks, with a focus on programming of film and original productions. AMC, which was created in 1984, features original programming that includes critically-acclaimed original scripted dramatic series. 

Original Programming 

We contract with some of the industry&#8217;s leading production companies to produce most of the original programming that appears on our programming networks. These contractual arrangements either provide us with outright ownership of the programming, in which case we hold all programming and other rights to the content, or they consist of long-term licensing arrangements, which provide us with exclusive rights to exhibit the content on our programming networks, but may be limited in terms of specific geographic markets or distribution platforms. The license agreements are typically of multi-season duration and provide us with a right of first negotiation or a right of first refusal on the renewal of the license for additional programming seasons. 

We also produce certain original programming through our AMC Studios operation, which we license to third-parties as well as amongst our operating segments for distribution. Decisions as to how to distribute programming are made on the basis of a variety of factors including the relative value of any particular alternative. 

Acquired Programming 

The majority of the content on our programming networks consists of films, episodic series and specials that we acquire pursuant to rights agreements with film studios, production companies or other rights holders. This acquired programming includes episodic series such as Law and Order, CSI: Miami , Will &#38; Grace , Roseanne, Malcolm in the Middle &#32;and Batman , as well as an extensive film library. The rights agreements for this content are of varying duration and generally permit our programming networks to carry these series, films and other programming during certain window periods. 

Segments 

We manage our business through the following two operating segments: 

&#8226; 

National Networks: &#32;Principally includes activities of our programming businesses which include our five &#32;programming networks distributed in the U.S. and Canada. These programming networks are AMC, WE tv, BBC AMERICA, IFC, and SundanceTV in the U.S.; and AMC, IFC and Sundance Channel in Canada. Our programming businesses within the National Networks segment may also sell rights worldwide to their owned original programming. The National Networks operating segment also includes AMC Networks Broadcasting &#38; Technology, the technical services business, which primarily services most of the programming networks included in the National Networks segment. 

&#8226; 

International and Other : Principally includes AMC Networks International, the Company&#8217;s international programming businesses consisting of a portfolio of channels in Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and parts

Regulation 

Our businesses are subject to and affected by regulations of U.S. federal, state and local government authorities, and our international operations are subject to laws and regulations of the countries in which they operate, as well as international bodies, such as the European Union. The Federal Communications Commission (the &#8220;FCC&#8221;) regulates U.S. programming networks in some respects and in certain other respects when they are affiliated with a cable television operator, as we currently are with Cablevision. Other FCC regulations, although imposed on cable television operators and satellite operators, affect programming networks indirectly. The rules, regulations, policies and procedures affecting our businesses are constantly subject to change. The descriptions below are summary in nature and do not purport to describe all present and proposed laws and regulations affecting our businesses. 

Closed Captioning 

Certain of our networks must provide closed-captioning of programming for the hearing impaired. The 21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010 also requires us to provide closed captioning on certain video content that we offer on the Internet or through other Internet Protocol distribution. 

CALM Act 

FCC rules require multichannel video programming distributors to ensure that all commercials comply with specified volume standards, and our affiliation agreements generally require us to certify compliance with such standards. 

Obscenity Restrictions 

Cable operators and other distributors are prohibited from transmitting obscene programming, and our affiliation agreements generally require us to refrain from including such programming on our networks. 

Violent Programming 

In 2007, the FCC issued a report on violence in programming that recommended that the United States Congress prohibit the availability of violent programming, including cable programming, during the hours when children are likely to be watching. Some members of the United States Congress continue to be interested in the alleged effects of violent programming, which could lead to a renewal of interest in limiting the availability of such programming or prohibiting it. 

Program Access 

The &#8220;program access&#8221; provisions of the Federal Cable Act generally require satellite delivered video programming in which a cable operator holds an attributable interest, as that term is defined by the FCC, to be made available to all multichannel video programming distributors, including DBS providers and telephone companies, on nondiscriminatory prices, terms and conditions, subject to certain exceptions specified in the statute and the FCC&#8217;s rules. FCC rules provide that the FCC may order a cable-affiliated programmer to continue to make a programming service available to a multichannel video programming distributor during the pendency of a program access complaint, under the terms of the existing contract. For purposes of these rules, the common directors and five percent or greater voting stockholders of Cablevision and AMC Networks are deemed to be cable operators with attributable interests in us. As long as we continue to have common directors and major stockholders with Cablevision, our satellite-delivered video programming services will remain subject to the program access provisions. The FCC allowed a previous blanket prohibition on exclusive arrangements with cable operators to expire in October 2012, but will consider case-by-case complaints that exclusive contracts between cable operators and cable-affiliated programmers significantly hinder or prevent a competing distributor from providing satellite cable programming. 

The FCC has also extended the program access rules to terrestrially-delivered programming created by cable operator-affiliated programmers such as us when a showing can be made that the lack of such programming significantly hinders or prevents the distributor from providing satellite cable programming. The rules authorize the FCC to compel the licensing of such programming in response to a complaint by a multichannel video programming distributor. These rules could require us to make any terrestrial programming services we create available to multichannel video programming distributors on nondiscriminatory prices, terms and conditions. The FCC is considering expanding the definition of &#8220;multichannel video programming distributor&#8221; to include certain distributors of video programming over the Internet. This change could expand our program access obligations. 

Program Carriage 

The FCC has sought comment on proposed changes to the rules governing carriage agreements between cable programming networks and cable operators or other multichannel video programming distributors. The FCC also has launched a new proceeding examining how programming networks not affiliated with any distributor gain access to distribution, including online distribution. Any changes could give an advantage to cable programming networks that are not affiliated with any distributor and make it easier for those programming networks to challenge a distributor&#8217;s decision to terminate a carriage agreement or to decline to carry a network in the first place. 

Packaging Programming and Volume Discounts 

The FCC periodically considers opening a rulemaking proceeding to examine whether to adopt rules restricting how programmers package and price their networks. We do not currently require distributors to carry more than one of our national programming networks in order to obtain the right to carry a particular national programming network. However, we generally negotiate with a distributor for the carriage of all of our national networks concurrently, and we offer volume discounts to distributors who make our programming available to larger numbers of subscribers or who carry more of our programming networks. 

The FCC has launched a proceeding to consider allowing third party set-top box providers access to the content in multichannel video programming distributors programming line-up. The proposal could allow those third parties to dismantle those line-ups and repackage content like ours as they choose, without regard to the contractual restrictions we have negotiated with multichannel video programming distributors. 

Effect of &#8220;Must-Carry&#8221; Requirements 

The FCC&#8217;s implementation of the statutory &#8220;must-carry&#8221; obligations requires cable and DBS operators to give broadcasters preferential access to channel space, and FCC rules allow broadcasters to require cable and DBS operators to carry broadcast-affiliated networks as a condition of access to the local broadcast station. In contrast, programming networks, such as ours, have no guaranteed right of carriage on cable television or DBS systems. This may reduce the amount of channel space that is available for carriage of our networks by cable television systems and DBS operators. 

Satellite Carriage 

All satellite carriers must under federal law offer their service to deliver our and our competitor&#8217;s programming networks on a nondiscriminatory basis (including by means of a lottery). A satellite carrier cannot unreasonably discriminate against any customer in its charges or conditions of carriage. 

Media Ownership Restrictions 

FCC rules set media ownership limits that restrict, among other things, the number of daily newspapers and radio and television stations in which a single entity may hold an attributable interest as that term is defined by the FCC. Pursuant to a Congressional mandate, the FCC must review these rules every four years. Such a review is currently underway. Cablevision currently owns Newsday, a daily newspaper published on Long Island, New York. The fact that the common directors and five 

percent or greater voting stockholders of Cablevision and AMC Networks currently hold attributable interests in each of the companies for purposes of these rules means that these cross-ownership rules may have the effect of limiting the activities or strategic business alternatives available to us, at least for as long as we continue to have common directors and major stockholders with Cablevision. Although we have no plans or intentions to become involved in the businesses affected by these restrictions, we would need to be mindful of these rules if we were to consider engaging in any such business in the future. 

Website Requirements 

We maintain various websites that provide information regarding our businesses and offer content for sale. The operation of these websites may be subject to a range of federal, state and local laws such as privacy, data security, accessibility, child safety and consumer protection regulations. 

Other Regulation 

The FCC also imposes rules regarding political broadcasts and telemarketing. Programming businesses are subject to regulation of the country in which they operate, as well as international bodies, such as the European Union. These regulations may include restrictions on types of advertising that can be sold on our networks, programming content requirements, requirements to make programming available on non-discriminatory terms, and local content quotas. 

Competition 

Our programming networks operate in two highly competitive markets. First, our programming networks compete with other programming networks to obtain distribution on cable television systems and other multichannel video programming distribution systems, such as DBS, and ultimately for viewing by each system&#8217;s subscribers. Second, our programming networks compete with other programming networks and other sources of video content, including broadcast networks, to secure desired entertainment programming. Additionally, video content delivered directly or through online video distributors to viewers over the Internet competes with our programming networks for viewership. The success of our businesses depends on our ability to license and produce content for our programming networks that is adequate in quantity and quality and will generate satisfactory viewer ratings. In each of these cases, some of our competitors are large publicly held companies that have greater financial resources than we do. In addition, we compete with these entities for advertising revenue. 

Distribution of Programming Networks 

The business of distributing programming networks to cable television systems and other multichannel video programming distributors is highly competitive. Our programming networks face competition from other programming networks&#8217; carriage by a particular multichannel video programming distributor, and for the carriage on the service tier that will attract the most subscribers. Once our programming network is selected by a distributor for carriage, that network competes for viewers not only with the other programming networks available on the distributor&#8217;s system, but also with over-the-air broadcast television, Internet-based video and other online services, mobile services, radio, print media, motion picture theaters, DVDs, and other sources of information and entertainment. 

Important to our success in each area of competition we face are the prices we charge for our programming networks, the quantity, quality and variety of the programming offered on our networks, and the effectiveness of our networks&#8217; marketing efforts. The competition for viewers among advertiser supported networks is directly correlated with the competition for advertising revenues with each of our competitors. 

Our ability to successfully compete with other networks may be hampered because the cable television systems or other multichannel video programming distributors through which we seek distribution may be affiliated with other programming networks. In addition, because such distributors may have a substantial number of subscribers, the ability of such programming networks to obtain distribution on the systems of affiliated distributors may lead to increased affiliation and advertising revenue for such programming networks because of their increased penetration compared to our programming networks. Even if such affiliated distributors carry our programming networks, such distributors may place their affiliated programming network on a more desirable tier, thereby giving the affiliated programming network a competitive advantage over our own. 

New or existing programming networks that are affiliated with broadcasting networks like NBC, ABC, CBS or Fox may also have a competitive advantage over our programming networks in obtaining distribution through the &#8220;bundling&#8221; of agreements to carry those programming networks with agreements giving the distributor the right to carry a broadcast station affiliated with the broadcasting network. 

An important part of our strategy involves exploiting identified markets of the cable television viewing audience that are generally well defined and limited in size. Our networks have faced and will continue to face increasing competition as other programming networks and online or other services seek to serve the same or similar niches. 

Sources of Programming 

We also compete with other programming networks to secure desired programming. Most of our original programming and all of our acquired programming is obtained through agreements with other parties that have produced or own the rights to such programming. Competition for this programming will increase as the number of programming networks increases. Other programming networks that are affiliated with programming sources such as movie or television studios or film libraries may have a competitive advantage over us in this area. 

With respect to the acquisition of entertainment programming, such as syndicated programs and movies that are not produced by or specifically for networks, our competitors include national broadcast television networks, local broadcast television stations, other cable programming networks, Internet-based video content distributors, and video-on-demand programs. Some of these competitors have exclusive contracts with motion picture studios or independent motion picture distributors or own film libraries. 

Competition for Advertising Revenue 

Our programming networks must compete with other sellers of advertising time and space, including other cable programming networks, radio, newspapers, outdoor media and, increasingly, Internet sites. We compete for advertisers on the basis of rates we charge and also on the number and demographic nature of viewers who watch our programming. Advertisers will often seek to target their advertising content to those demographic categories they consider most likely to purchase the product or service they advertise. Accordingly, the demographic make-up of our viewership can be equally or more important than the number of viewers watching our programming. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 &#32;we had 2,175 &#32;full-time employees and 331 part-time employees. In addition, certain of our U.S. subsidiaries engage the services of writers who are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. Approximately 287 &#32;of our employees outside of the U.S. are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils. We believe that our relations with the labor unions and our employees are generally good.
