&#160;

Corporate History and Overview 

We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 3, 2008 under the name &#8220;Multiplayer Online Dragon, Inc.&#8221; Effective November 5, 2010, we effected an 8 for 1 forward stock split, increasing the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock from 12,000,000 shares to 96,000,000 shares. On October 29, 2014, we effected a 1 for 10 reverse stock split, decreasing the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock from 97,000,000 to 9,700,000. 

On November 26, 2014, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;) with NaturalShrimp Holdings, Inc. a Delaware corporation (&#8220;NSH&#8221;), pursuant to which we agreed to acquire substantially all of the assets of NSH which assets consisted primarily of all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of NaturalShrimp Corporation (&#8220;NSC&#8221;), a Delaware corporation, and NaturalShrimp Global, Inc. (&#8220;NS Global&#8221;), a Delaware corporation, and certain real property located outside of San Antonio, Texas (the &#8220;Assets&#8221;). 

On January 30, 2015, we consummated the acquisition of the Assets pursuant to the Agreement. In accordance with the terms of the Agreement, we issued 75,520,240 shares of our common stock to NSH as consideration for the Assets. As a result of the transaction, NSH acquired 88.62% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock, NSC and NS Global became our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and we changed our principal business to a global shrimp farming company. 

In connection with our receipt of approval from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&#8220;FINRA&#8221;), effective March 3, 2015, we amended our Articles of Incorporation to change our name to &#8220;NaturalShrimp Incorporated&#8221;. 

We are a biotechnology company and have developed a proprietary technology that allows us to grow Pacific White shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei, formerly Penaeus vannamei) in an ecologically controlled, high-density, low-cost environment, and in fully contained and independent production facilities. Our system uses technology which allows us to produce a naturally-grown shrimp &#8220;crop&#8221; weekly, and accomplishes this without the use of antibiotics or toxic chemicals. We have developed several proprietary technology assets, including a knowledge base that allows us to produce commercial quantities of shrimp in a closed system with a computer monitoring system that automates, monitors and maintains proper levels of oxygen, salinity and temperature for optimal shrimp production. Our initial production facility is located outside of San Antonio, Texas. 

NS Global, a wholly owned subsidiary of NaturalShrimp Incorporated., owns 10% of NaturalShrimp International A.S. in Europe. Our European-based partner, NaturalShrimp International A.S., Oslo, Norway is responsible for the construction cost of their facility and initial operating capital. 

The first facility built in Spain for NaturalShrimp International A.S. is GambaNatural de Espa&#241;a, S.L. The land for the first facility was purchased in Medina del Campo, Spain and construction of the 75,000 sq. ft. facility and was completed in 2015. Medina del Campo is approximately seventy-five miles northwest of Madrid, Spain. 

On June 15, 2015, we announced the expansion of our indoor shrimp operations. Since that time, we have continued to develop our indoor shrimp production system and expect to begin commercial shrimp sales in late 2016. Wholesale prices for the shrimp produced by the Company are expected to be between $9.00 to $12.00 per pound F.O.B, based on discussion with interested buyers. 

On October 16, 2015, we formed Natural Aquatic Systems, Inc. (&#8220;NAS&#8221;). The purpose of the NAS is to formalize the business relationship between NaturalShrimp Incorporated and F&#38;T Water Solutions LLC for the joint development of certain water technologies. The technologies shall include, but are not limited to, any and all inventions, patents, intellectual property and know-how dealing with enclosed aquatic production systems worldwide. This includes construction, operation, and management of enclosed aquatic production, other than shrimp, facilities throughout the world, co-developed by both parties at our facility located outside of La Coste, Texas. 

Overview of Industry 

Shrimp is a well-known and globally-consumed commodity, constituting one of the most important types of seafood and a staple protein source for much of the world. According to the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service, the world consumes approximately 9 billion pounds of shrimp annually with over 1.3 billion pounds consumed in the United States alone. Approximately 65% of the global supply of shrimp is caught by ocean trawlers and the other 35% is produced by open-air shrimp farms, mostly in developing countries. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Shrimp boats catch shrimp through the use of large, boat-towed nets. These nets are quite toxic to the undersea environment as they disturb and destroy ocean-bottom ecosystems; these nets also catch a variety of non-shrimp sea life, which is typically killed and discarded as part of the shrimp harvesting process. Additionally, the world&#8217;s oceans can only supply a finite amount of shrimp each year, and in fact, single-boat shrimp yields have fallen by approximately 20% since 2010 and continue to decrease. The shrimping industry&#8217;s answer to this problem has been to deploy more (and bigger) boats that deploy ever-larger nets, which has in the short-term been successful at maintaining global shrimp yields. However, this benefit cannot continue forever, as eventually global demand has the potential of outstripping the oceans&#8217; ability to maintain the natural ecosystem&#8217;s balance, resulting in a permanent decline in yields. When taken in light of global population growth and the ever-increasing demand for nutrient-rich foods such as shrimp, this is clearly an unsustainable production paradigm. 

Shrimp farming, known in the industry as &#8220;aquaculture,&#8221; has ostensibly stepped in to fill this demand/supply imbalance. Shrimp farming is typically done in open-air lagoons and man-made shrimp ponds connected to the open ocean. Because these ponds constantly exchange water with the adjacent sea, the farmers are able to maintain the water chemistry that allows the shrimp to prosper. However, this method of cultivating shrimp also carries severe ecological peril. First of all, most shrimp farming is primarily conducted in developing countries, where poor shrimp farmers have little regard for the global ecosystem. Because of this, these farmers use large quantities of antibiotics and other chemicals that maximize each farm&#8217;s chance of producing a crop, putting the entire system at risk. For example, a viral infection that crops up in one farm can spread to all nearby farms, quite literally wiping out an entire region&#8217;s production. In 1999, the White Spot virus invaded shrimp farms in at least five Latin American countries: Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Panama and Ecuador and in 2013-14 EMS (Early Mortality Syndrome) wiped out most of the Asia Pacific region and Mexico. Secondly, there is also a finite amount of coastline that can be used for shrimp production &#8211; eventually shrimp farms that are dependent on the open ocean will have nowhere to expand. Again, this is an ecologically damaging and ultimately unsustainable system for producing shrimp. 

In both the cases, the current method of shrimp production is unsustainable. As global populations rise and the demand for shrimp continues to grow, the current system is bound to fall short. Shrimp trawling cannot continue to increase production without completely depleting the oceans&#8217; natural shrimp population. Trends in per-boat yield confirm that this industry has already crossed the overfishing threshold, putting the global open-ocean shrimp population in decline. While open-air shrimp aquaculture may seem to address this problem, it is also an unsustainable system that destroys coastal ecological systems and produces shrimp with very high chemical contamination levels. Closed-system shrimp farming is clearly a superior alternative, but its unique challenges have prevented it from becoming a widely-available alternative &#8211; until now. 

Of the 1.7 billion pounds of shrimp consumed annually in the United States, over 1.3 billion pounds are imported &#8211; much of this from developing countries&#8217; shrimp farms. These farms are typically located in developing countries and use high levels of antibiotics and pesticides that are not allowed under USDA regulations. As a result, these shrimp farms produce chemical-laden shrimp in an ecologically unsustainable way. 

Unfortunately, most consumers here in the United States are not aware of the origin of their store-bought shrimp or worse, that which they consume in restaurants. This is due to a USDA rule that states that only bulk-packaged shrimp must state the shrimp&#8217;s country of origin; any &#8220;prepared&#8221; shrimp, which includes arrangements sold in grocery stores and seafood markets, as well as all shrimp served in restaurants, can simply be sold &#8220;as is.&#8221; Essentially, this means that most U.S. consumers may be eating shrimp laden with chemicals and antibiotics. NaturalShrimp&#8217;s product is free of pesticide chemicals and antibiotics, a fact that we believe is highly attractive and beneficial in terms of our eventual marketing success. 

Our Business 

NaturalShrimp Incorporated is a global shrimp farming and biotechnology company that has developed a technology to produce shrimp in an indoor, re-circulating, saltwater facility. Our eco-friendly, bio-secure design does not rely on ocean water; it recreates the natural ocean environment allowing for high-density production which can be replicated anywhere in the world. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Our self-contained shrimp aquiculture system allows for the production of Pacific White (Litopenaeus vannamei, formerly Penaeus vannamei) shrimp in an ecologically controlled fully contained and independent production system without the use of antibiotics or toxic chemicals. 

The Company has developed several proprietary technology assets, including a knowledge base that allows the production of commercial quantities of shrimp in a closed system with a computer monitoring system that automates, monitors and maintains proper levels of oxygen, salinity and temperature for optimal shrimp production. 

Our research and development facilities are located outside of San Antonio, Texas, and we hold a minority interest in a Norwegian company that owns and operates a similar shrimp production facility in Medina del Campo, Spain. 

Technology 

Intensive, Indoor, Closed-System Shrimp Production Technology 

Historically, efforts to raise shrimp in a high-density, closed system at the commercial level have been met with either modest success or outright failure through &#8220;BioFloc Technology&#8221;. Infectious agents such as parasites, bacteria and viruses are the most damaging and most difficult to control. Bacterial infection can in some cases be combated through the use of antibiotics (although not always), and in general the use of antibiotics is considered undesirable and counter to &#8220;green&#8221; cultivation practices. Viruses can be even worse in that they are immune to antibiotics. Once introduced to a shrimp population, viruses can wipe out entire farms and shrimp populations, even with intense probiotic applications. 

Our primary solution against infectious agents is our &#8220;Vibrio Suppression Technology&#8221;. We believe this system creates higher sustainable densities, consistent production, improved growth and survival rates and improved food conversion without the use of antibiotics, probiotics or unhealthy anti-microbial chemicals. Vibrio Suppression Technology helps to exclude and suppress harmful organisms that usually destroy &#8220;BioFloc&#8221; and other enclosed technologies. 

Automated Monitoring and Control System 

The Company&#8217;s &#8220;Automated Monitoring and Control System&#8221; uses individual tank monitors to automatically control the feeding, oxygenation, and temperature of each of the facility tanks independently. In addition, a facility computer running custom software communicates with each of the controllers and performs additional data acquisition functions that can report back to a supervisory computer from anywhere in the world. These computer automated water controls optimize the growing conditions for the shrimp as they mature to harvest size, providing a disease-resistant production environment. 

The principle theories behind the the Company&#8217;s system are characterized as: 

&#9679; 

High-density shrimp production 

&#9679; 

Weekly production 

&#9679; 

Natural ecology system 

&#9679; 

Regional production 

&#9679; 

Regional distribution 

These principles form the foundation for the Company and our potential distributors so that consumers can be provided with continuous volumes of live and fresh shrimp at competitive prices. 

Research and Development 

In 2001, the Company began research and development (R&#38;D) of a high density, natural aquaculture system that is not dependent on ocean water to provide quality, fresh shrimp every week, fifty-two weeks a year. The initial NaturalShrimp system was successful but the Company determined that it would not be economically feasible due to high operating costs. Over the next several years, using the knowledge we gained from the first R&#38;D system, we developed a shrimp production system that eliminated the high costs associated with the previous system. We have continued to refine this technology, eliminating bacterial and other problems that affect enclosed systems and now have a successful shrimp growing process. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

We have produced thousands of pounds of shrimp over the last few years in order to develop a design that will consistently produce quality shrimp that grow to a large size at a specific rate of growth. This included experimenting with various types of natural live and synthesized feed supplies before selecting the most appropriate nutritious and reliable combination. It also included utilizing monitoring and control automation equipment to minimize labor costs and to provide the necessary oversight for proper regulation of the shrimp environment. 

After the implementation of the first R&#38;D facility in La Coste, Texas, the Company has also made significant improvements that minimize the transfer of shrimp, which will reduce shrimp stress and labor costs. Our current system consists of a reception tank where the shrimp are acclimated, then moved to a larger grow-out tank for the rest of the twenty-week cycle. 

Target Markets and Sales Price 

Our goal is to establish production systems and distribution centers in metropolitan areas of the United States, as well as international distribution networks through joint venture partnerships throughout the world. This should allow the Company to capture a significant portion of world shrimp sales by offering locally grown, environmentally &#8220;green,&#8221; naturally grown, fresh shrimp at competitive wholesale prices. 

The United States population is approximately 313 million people with an annual shrimp consumption of 1.3 billion pounds, of which less than 400 million pounds are domestically produced. According to IndexMundi.com, the wholesale price for frozen, commodity grade shrimp has risen 15% since January 2015 (shell-on headless, 26-30 count; which is comparable to our target growth size). With world shrimp problems, this price is expected to rise more in the next few years. 

Additionally, from 2011 to 2013, we had two successful North Texas test markets that distributed fresh product to customers within 24 hours following harvest. The fresh product was priced from $8.40 to $12.00 per pound wholesale, heads on, net price to the Company. 

We strive to build a profitable global shrimp production company. We believe our foundational advantage is that we can deliver fresh, organically grown, gourmet-grade shrimp, 52 weeks a year to retail and wholesale buyers in major market areas at competitive, yet premium prices. By locating regional production and distribution centers in close proximity to consumer demand, we can provide a fresh product to customers within 24 hours after harvest, which is unique in the shrimp industry. We can be the &#8220;first to market&#8221; and perhaps &#8220;sole weekly provider&#8221; of fresh shrimp and capture as much market share as production capacity can support. 

For those customers that want a frozen product, we may be able to provide this in the near future and the product will still be differentiated as a &#8220;naturally grown, sustainable seafood&#8221; that will meet the increasing demand of socially conscious consumers. 

Our patented technology and eco-friendly, bio-secure production processes enable the delivery of a chemical and antibiotic free, locally grown product that lives up to the Company&#8217;s mantra: &#8220;Always Fresh, Always Natural,&#8221; thereby solving the issue of &#8220;unsafe&#8221; imported seafood. 

Product Description 

Nearly all of the shrimp consumed today are shipped frozen. Shrimp are typically frozen from six to twenty-four months before consumption. Our system is designed to harvest a different tank each week, which provides for fresh shrimp throughout the year. We strive to create a niche market of &#8220;Always Fresh, Always Natural&#8221; shrimp. As opposed to many of the foreign shrimp farms, we can also claim that our product is 100% free of antibiotics. The ability to grow shrimp locally, year round allows us to provide this high-end product to specialty grocery stores and upscale restaurants throughout the world. We rotate the stocking and harvesting of our tanks each week, which allows for weekly shrimp harvests. Our product is free of all pollutants and is fed only all natural feeds. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

The seafood industry lacks a consistent &#8220;Source Verification&#8221; method to track seafood products as they move through countries and customs procedures. With worldwide overfishing leading to declining shrimp freshness and sustainability around the world, it is vital for shrimp providers to be able to realistically identify the source of their product. We have well-managed, sustainable facilities that are able to track shrimp from hatchery to plate using environmentally responsible methods. 

Shrimp Growth Period 

Our production system is designed to produce shrimp at a harvest size of twenty-one to twenty-five shrimp per pound in a period of twenty-four weeks. The Company currently purchases post-larva shrimp that are approximately ten days old (PL 10). In the future, we plan to build our own hatcheries to control the supply of shrimp to each of our facilities. Our full-scale production systems include grow-out and nursery tanks, projected to produce fresh shrimp fifty-two weeks per year. 

Distribution and Marketing 

We plan to build these environmentally &#8220;green&#8221; production systems near major metropolitan areas of the United States. Today, we have one pilot production facility in La Coste, Texas (near San Antonio) and plan to begin construction of a full-scale production facility in La Coste and plans for Nevada and New York. Over the next five years, our plan is to increase construction of new facilities each year. In the fifth year, we plan for a new system to be completed each month, expanding first into the largest shrimp consumption markets of the United States. 

Unique Product 

We plan to sell and distribute the vast majority of our shrimp production through distributors which have established customers and sufficient capacity to deliver a fresh product within hours following harvest. We believe we have the added advantage of being able to market our shrimp as fresh, natural and locally grown using sustainable, eco-friendly technology, a key differentiation from all existing shrimp producers. Furthermore, we believe that our ability to advertise our product in this manner along with the fact that it is a locally grown product, provides us with a marketing advantage over the competition. 

Harvesting, Packaging and Shipment 

Each location is projected to include production, harvesting/processing and general shipping and receiving area, in addition to warehousing space for storage of necessary supplies and products required to grow, harvest, package and otherwise make ready for delivery, a fresh shrimp crop on a weekly basis to consumers in each individual market area within 24 hours following harvest. 

The seafood industry lacks a consistent source verification method to track seafood products as they move through countries and customs procedures. With worldwide overfishing leading to declining shrimp freshness and sustainability around the world, it is vital for shrimp providers to be able to realistically identify the source of their product. Our future facilities will be designed to track shrimp from hatchery to plate using environmentally responsible methods. 

International 

We own one hundred percent of NaturalShrimp Global, Inc. which was formed to create international partnerships. Each international partnership is expected to use the Company&#8217;s proprietary technology to penetrate shrimp markets throughout the world utilizing existing food service distribution channels. 

Because our system is enclosed and also indoors, it is not affected by weather or climate and does not depend on ocean proximity. As such we believe we will be able to provide, naturally grown, high-quality, fresh shrimp to major market customers each week. This will allow distribution companies to leverage their existing customer relationships by offering an uninterrupted supply of high quality, fresh and locally grown shrimp. We will utilize distributors that currently supply fresh seafood to upscale restaurants, country clubs, specialty super markets and retail stores whose clientele expect and appreciate fresh, natural products. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

NaturalShrimp Global, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of NaturalShrimp Incorporated., owns a percentage of NaturalShrimp International A.S. in Europe. Our European-based partner, NaturalShrimp International A.S., Oslo, Norway is responsible for the construction cost of their facility and initial operating capital. 

The first facility built in Spain for NaturalShrimp International A.S. is GambaNatural de Espa&#241;a, S.L. The land for the first facility was purchased in Medina del Campo, Spain and construction of the 75,000 sq. ft. facility should be completed in 2016. Medina del Campo is approximately seventy-five miles northwest of Madrid, Spain. 

We will seek potential partners throughout open territories as we are able to obtain the adequate funding to complete the first two facilities at the La Coste location. 

Go to Market Strategy and Execution 

Our strategy is to develop regional production and distribution centers near major metropolitan areas throughout the United States and internationally. Today, we have 53,000 sq. ft. of R&#38;D facilities, which includes, a pilot production system, greenhouse/reservoirs and utility buildings in La Coste, TX (near San Antonio). We intend to begin construction of a new free-standing facility with the next generation shrimp production system in place, on the property, in 2016. 

The reasoning behind building additional shrimp production systems in La Coste is availability of trained production personnel, our research and development team, and an opportunity to develop the footprint and model for additional facilities. Our current plan is to develop six regional production and distribution centers near major markets in 2016 and adding one system per month in a selected production center depending on market demand. 

We have sold product to restaurants at $12.00 per pound and to retail consumers at $16.50 to $21.00 per pound, depending on size which helps to validate our pricing strategy. Additionally, from 2011 to 2013, we had two successful North Texas test markets which distributed thousands of pounds of fresh product to customers within 24 hours following harvest. The fresh product was priced from $8.40 to $12.00 per pound wholesale, heads on, net price to the Company. 

Current Systems and Expansion 

The pilot system is near completion in La Coste, Texas and is projected to produce approximately 6,000 pounds every month. The next facility in La Coste will be substantially larger than the current system. The target yield of shrimp for the new facility will be approximately 6,000 pounds per week. Both facilities combined are projected to produce over 7,000 pounds of shrimp per week in La Coste. By staging the stocking and harvests from tank to tank, it enables us to produce weekly and therefore deliver fresh shrimp every week. 

After the completion of the next system in La Coste, our long-term plan is to build additional production systems in Las Vegas, Chicago and New York. These locations are targeted to begin construction in 2017 and the funding for these plans are projected to come from profits, agricultural guaranty programs, and investors. These cities are not surrounded by commercial shrimp production and we believe there will be a high demand for fresh shrimp in all of these locations. In addition, the Company will continue to use the land it owns in La Coste to build as many systems as the Texas market demands. 

Competition 

There are a number of companies conducting research and development projects in their attempt to develop closed-system technologies in the U.S., some with reported production and sales. Florida Organic Aquaculture uses a Bio-Floc Raceway System to intensify shrimp growth, while Marvesta Shrimp Farms tanks in water from the Atlantic and use in their indoor system. Since these are privately-held companies, it is not possible to know, with certainty, their state of technical development, production capacity, need for water exchange, location requirements, financial status and other matters. To the best of our knowledge, none are producing significant quantities of shrimp relative to their local markets, and such fresh shrimp sales are likely confined to an area near the production facility. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Additionally, any new competitor would face significant barriers for entry into the market and would likely need years of research and development to develop the proprietary technology necessary to produce similar shrimp at a commercially viable level. We believe our technology and business model sets us apart from any current competition. It is possible that additional competitors will arise in the future, but with the size and growth of the worldwide shrimp market, many competitors could co-exist and thrive in the fresh shrimp industry. 

Intellectual Property 

We intend to take appropriate steps to protect our intellectual property. We have registered the trademark &#8220;NATURALSHRIMP&#8221; which had been approved and was published in the Official Gazette on June 5, 2012. There are potential technical processes for which the Company may be able to file a patent. However, there are no assurances that such applications, if filed, would be issued and no right of enforcement is granted to a patent application. Therefore, the Company has filed a provisional patent with the U.S. Patent Office and plans to use a variety of other methods, including copyright registrations as appropriate, trade secret protection, and confidentiality and non-compete agreements to protect its intellectual property portfolio. 

Source and Availability of Raw Materials 

Raw materials are received in a timely manner from established suppliers. Currently, we buy our feed from Zeigler, a leading producer of aquatic feed. Post larvae (&#8220;PL&#8221;) shrimp are purchased from Shrimp Improvement Systems (SIS) in Florida and Global Blue Technologies in Texas. 

There have not been any issues regarding the availability of our raw materials. We have favorable contacts and past business dealings with other major shrimp feed producers if current suppliers are not available. 

Government Approvals and Regulations 

We are subject to government regulation and require certain licenses. Following are regulations to which we are subject and/or the permits and licenses we currently hold: 

&#160;&#9679; 

Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) - &#8220;Exotic species permit&#8221; to raise exotic shrimp (non-native to Texas). The La Coste facility is north of the coastal shrimp exclusion zone (east and south of H-35, where it intersects Hwy 21 down to Laredo) and therefore outside of TPWD&#8217;s major area of concern for exotic shrimp. Currently Active - Expires 12/31/17. 

&#9679; 

Texas Department of Agriculture (TDA) - &#8220;Aquaculture License&#8221; for aquaculture production facilities. License to &#8220;operate a fish farm or cultured fish processing plant.&#8221; Currently Active &#8211; Expires 4/30/17.

We are subject to certain regulations regarding the need for field employees to be certified. We strictly adhere to these regulations. The cost of certification is an accepted part of expenses. Regulations may change and become a cost burden but compliance and safety are our main concern. 

Market Advantages and Corporate Drivers 

The following are what we consider to be our advantages in the marketplace: 

&#9679; 

Early-mover Advantage: Commercialized technology in a large growing market with no significant competition yet identified. Most are early stage start-ups or early stage companies with limited production and distribution. 

&#9679; 

Locally Produced: This has significant advantages including reduced transportation costs and a product that is more attractive to local consumers. 

&#9679; 

Bio-secured Building: Our process is a re-circulating, highly-filtered water technology in an indoor-regulated environment. External pathogens are excluded. 

&#9679; 

Eco-friendly &#8220;Green&#8221; Technology: Our closed-loop, re-circulating system has no ocean water exchange requirements, does not use chemical or antibiotics and therefore is sustainable, eco-friendly, environmentally sound and produces a superior quality shrimp that is totally natural. 

&#9679; 

Availability of Weekly Fresh Shrimp: Assures consumers of optimal freshness, taste, and texture of product which will command premium prices. 

&#9679; 

Sustainability: Our naturally grown product does not deplete wild supplies, has no by-catch kill of marine life, does not damage sensitive ecological environments and avoids potential risks of imported seafood. 

Subsidiaries 

The Company has three wholly-owned subsidiaries including NaturalShrimp Corporation, NaturalShrimp Global, Inc. and Natural Aquatic Systems, Inc.
