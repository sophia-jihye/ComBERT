 Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties 

General 

Gran Tierra Energy Inc. together with its subsidiaries (&#8220;Gran Tierra&#8221;, "us", "our", or &#8220;we&#8221;) is an independent international energy company engaged in oil and gas acquisition, exploration, development and production. We are strategically focused on onshore oil and gas properties in Colombia and also own the rights to oil and gas properties in Brazil and Peru. Our Colombian properties represented 87% &#32;of our proved reserves NAR at December 31, 2015 . The remainder of our proved reserves were attributable to our Brazilian properties. 

Our company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on June 6, 2003, originally under the name Goldstrike Inc. We have acquired oil and gas producing and non-producing assets in Colombia, Peru, and Brazil, with our largest acquisitions being the acquisitions of Argosy Energy International L.P. in 2006, Solana Resources Limited in 2008 and Petrolifera Petroleum Limited in 2011. 

All dollar ($) amounts referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are United States (U.S.) dollars, unless otherwise indicated. 

2015 Overview 

During early 2015, largely as a result of the low commodity price environment and drilling results in Peru, we ceased all development expenditures in the Breta&#241;a Field on Block 95 in Peru other than what is necessary to maintain tangible asset integrity and security. As a result, all probable and possible reserves associated with the field were reclassified as contingent resources. 

On May 7, 2015, we entered into an agreement (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;) with West Face SPV (Cayman) I L.P. (&#8220;West Face&#8221;) pursuant to which we settled a proxy contest. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, Gary Guidry was appointed as our President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Guidry replaced Duncan Nightingale in that role, who was serving as interim Chief Executive Officer since February 2015 and, with the appointment of Mr. Guidry as Chief Executive Officer, was designated as Executive Vice President. Additionally, effective May 11, 2015, Ryan Ellson was appointed as Chief Financial Officer. In connection with our entry into the Agreement, the size of our Board of Directors was expanded, new directors were appointed to fill the newly created vacancies and certain existing directors agreed not to stand for re-election at the 2015 annual meeting of stockholders. In June 2015, our Board of Directors approved a new capital program focusing on development activities in Colombia. 

On January 13, 2016, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Petroamerica Oil Corp ("Petroamerica") for cash consideration of $70.6 million &#32;and the issuance of 13,656,719 &#32;shares of Gran Tierra common stock. The net purchase price of Petroamerica was $70.4 million , after giving consideration to estimated net working capital of $26.0 million . On January 25, 2016 , we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of PetroGranada Colombia Limited ("PGC"). The net purchase price of PGC was $19.0 million , after giving consideration to estimated net working capital of $18.7 million . In addition, we agreed to pay an additional $4.0 million &#32;if cumulative production from the Putumayo-7 Block plus gross proved plus probable reserves under the Putumayo-7 Block meet or exceed 8 MMbbl in any year prior to January 2021 . Combined proved NAR oil and gas reserves of Petroamerica and PGC as at December 31, 2015, were 3.9 &#32;MMBOE calculated in compliance with the SEC rules. 

2015 Operational Highlights 

In the year ended December 31, 2015 , we incurred capital expenditures of $159.2 million , including $87.7 million &#32;in Colombia, $20.0 million &#32;in Brazil, $50.4 million &#32;in Peru and $1.1 million &#32;in Corporate. In the second half of 2015, after the change in management and substantial change of the board of directors, the majority of capital expenditures ( 86% ) were incurred in Colombia. 

The significant elements of our 2015 &#32;capital program in Colombia were: 

&#8226; 

On the Chaza Block (100% working interest ("WI"), operated), we drilled and completed the Costayaco-25D and Costayaco-26D development wells in the Costayaco Field, and the Moqueta-17 and Moqueta-21D development wells in the Moqueta Field, as oil producers. The Moqueta-19i well was completed as a water injector as planned. We commenced drilling the Costayaco-24D and Costayaco-27i development well and started pre-drilling activities for the 

Moqueta-20, 22 and 23 development wells. We also drilled the Moqueta-18i development well and encountered mechanical difficulties. This well is currently suspended. 

&#8226; 

On the Garibay Block ( 50% &#32;WI, non-operated) and Tiple Block (owned by two other parties), the unitization of the Jilguero Field was completed and we became a 38.5% WI owner in the newly unitized field. Together with our partners, we drilled and completed three development wells, Jilguero Sur-2, Jilguero-3 and Jilguero-4 as oil producing wells. 

&#8226; 

We completed the acquisition of 2-D seismic on the Cauca-7 (100% WI, operated), Sinu-1 (60% WI, operated) and Sinu-3 (51% WI, operated) Blocks and continued activities in preparation for the acquisition of 2-D seismic on the Putumayo-10 Block (100% WI, operated). We also commenced environmental impact assessments ("EIA"s) for future drilling on the Sinu-3 Block. 

&#8226; 

We also continued facilities work at the Costayaco and Moqueta Fields on the Chaza Block, and on the Jilguero unitized Field within the Garibay Block. 

In Brazil: 

&#8226; 

On Blocks REC-T-86, Block REC-T-117 and Block REC-T-118 (100% WI, operated)), we completed the acquisition, processing and interpretation of 3-D seismic. 

&#8226; 

On Block REC-T-155 (100% WI, operated), we initiated construction of an infield gas pipeline between the Ti&#234; facilities and 3-GTE-03-BA. 

In Peru: 

&#8226; 

On Block 95 (100% WI, operated), we completed drilling operations on the Breta&#241;a Sur 95-3-4-1X appraisal well on the L4 lobe in the Breta&#241;a Field, which satisfied our work obligation for the fifth exploration period. We encountered approximately six feet of oil pay above the oil-water contact in the Vivian Sandstone Reservoir. This oil column was less than what we had estimated prior to drilling. As previously discussed, in February 2015, we ceased all further development expenditures in the Breta&#241;a Field on Block 95 other than what is necessary to maintain tangible asset integrity and security. 

&#8226; 

On Blocks 107 and 133 (100% WI, operated), we continued the environmental permitting process. On Block 107, we completed the acquisition, interpretation and processing of 2-D seismic and commenced planning activities for the Osheki-1 exploration well and the refurbishment of the base camp and well location. Both of these planning activities were suspended at the end of February 2015. 

2016 Outlook 

In January 2016, we announced our 2016 &#32;capital budget. Our base 2016 &#32;capital program of $107 million &#32;consists of: $76 million &#32;for Colombia; $8 million &#32;for Brazil; $6 million &#32;for Peru; and $17 million &#32;for other. 

In Colombia, our base 2016 &#32;capital program includes two water injector wells in the Costayaco Field and three development wells in the Moqueta Field, both on the Chaza Block (100% WI, operated), two exploration wells and a development well in the Putumayo-7 Block (subject to regulatory approval, 100% WI, operated) and an exploration well on the Llanos-10 Block (50% WI, non-operated) with the costs being carried by a third party. Facilities work is also planned for the Chaza Block. 

In Peru, the 2016 &#32;capital program includes only those activities required for retention of lands and security of assets. In Brazil, the capital program includes only minimal activity to implement water injection for reservoir pressure maintenance and to preserve current production levels. In both Peru and Brazil, operations have been scaled back significantly, with the aim of allowing time to explore and execute on options to maximize shareholder value. 

In addition to our base 2016 capital budget, we have a discretionary capital budget of $61 million &#32;that we may utilize during 2016 in the event of an increase in commodity prices. If deployed, we expect that our discretionary capital budget would target six exploration wells, five development wells and seismic activities in Colombia. 

We expect to finance our 2016 &#32;capital program through cash flows from operations and cash on hand, while retaining financial flexibility to undertake further development opportunities and opportunistically pursue acquisitions. 

Business Strategy 

The Company&#8217;s strategy is to efficiently grow and diversify its portfolio of exploration, development and production opportunities in Colombia. We are taking steps to maintain cash flows from existing assets, and seeking opportunities to leverage our financial strength to expand our Colombian operations and asset base. 

Oil and Gas Properties 

Colombia 

On January 13, 2016, and January 25, 2016 , respectively, we completed the acquisitions of all of the issued and outstanding shares of Petroamerica and PGC. 

Excluding blocks subject to relinquishment, we have interests in 29 &#32;blocks in Colombia and are the operator on 16 &#32;of these blocks, including 14 &#32;blocks acquired through the acquisitions of Petroamerica and PGC ( three &#32;operated). These blocks include interests in the Putumayo-7 Block for which assignment of WI is subject to approval, or final approval, by the Agencia Nacional de Hidrocarburos (National Hydrocarbons Agency) (&#8220;ANH&#8221;). Relinquishments of our interests in four blocks in Colombia are subject to receipt of final documentation from the ANH. During 2015 , unitization of the Jilguero Field on the Garibay and Tiple Block was completed and we became a 38.5% WI owner in the newly unitized field, we executed an Exploration and Production Contract for the Putumayo-4 Block farm-in, received final documentation from the ANH for relinquishment of our interest in the Magangu&#233; Block, and our contract on the Santana Block expired. 

The following table provides a summary of selected data for our blocks in Colombia as at December 31, 2015 , as well as a summary of selected combined data for Petroamerica and PGC as at December 31, 2015:

Status of Exploration Phases 

During 2015, the ANH introduced a number of programs which are intended to assist oil and gas companies operating in Colombia during the current low commodity price environment. One program provides an option for companies to apply for a nine month extension to fulfill different commitments and exercise rights during the exploration period (exploration, evaluation, among others). Another program provides an option for companies to apply requesting approval to transfer certain work obligations between blocks. We requested and were granted nine month extensions of the exploration phase on some of our blocks and are considering applying to request approval to transfer certain of our work obligations to other blocks. 

Chaza Block ( 100% &#32;WI, operated) 

The second additional exploration program ended on January 30, 2016 . This exploration phase required one exploration well to be drilled, which was satisfied by the Eslab&#243;n Sur Deep-1 exploration well. The exploration period in the Chaza Block has ended and we retain the Moqueta and Costayaco Fields.

Azar, Magdalena and Sierra Nevada Blocks 

We have applied to the ANH to relinquish our interest in these blocks. These relinquishments are subject to receipt of final documentation from ANH. 

Blocks acquired in the Petroamerica and PGC Acquisitions 

We acquired interests in the following blocks through the acquisitions of Petroamerica and PGC on January 13, 2016, and January 25, 2016 , respectively. 

Putumayo-7 Block (subject to regulatory approval, 100% WI, operator) 

Petroamerica and PGC have each entered into agreements to acquire 50% WI in this block, for a total combined WI of 100%. These WI assignments are subject to regulatory approval. This block is in phase one of two exploration phases, which will end on July 31, 2016. This phase requires the acquisition of 167 square kilometers of 3-D seismic and two explorations well to be drilled. 

Putumayo-2 Block (100% WI, operator) 

We are in the second exploration phase, which is currently suspended. This phase requires two exploration wells to be drilled and the acquisition of 10 square kilometers of 3-D seismic. The seismic work obligation was satisfied prior to our acquisition of Petroamerica. 

Llanos-10 (50% WI, non-operated) 

We are in the first of two exploration phases. This phase will end on June 18, 2016, and requires the acquisition of 127 square kilometers of 3-D seismic and one exploration well to be drilled. The seismic work obligation was satisfied prior to our acquisition of Petroamerica. 

Llanos-19 (50% WI, non-operated) 

We are in the second exploration phase. This phase will end on June 12, 2016, and requires two exploration wells to be drilled. One exploration well was drilled in this exploration phase prior to our acquisition of Petroamerica, which resulted in an oil discovery. 

Los Ocarros (50% WI, non-operated) 

We are in the second additional exploration program which will end on November 12, 2017. The second additional exploration program required one exploration well to be drilled. This work obligation was satisfied prior to our acquisition of Petroamerica. 

CPO-7 (20% WI, non-operated) 

We are in the second exploration phase. This phase will end on April 13, 2017, and requires the acquisition of 100 kilometers of 2-D seismic and two explorations well to be drilled. The seismic work obligation was satisfied and one of the two work obligation wells was drilled prior to our acquisition of Petroamerica. We are also in an evaluation program which will end January 1, 2017, and requires the recompletion of a well. 

CPO-13 (20% WI, non-operated) 

We are in the second exploration phase. This phase will end on July 13, 2017, and requires three exploration wells to be drilled. All of the work obligations in this phase were satisfied prior to our acquisition of Petroamerica. We are also in an evaluation program which will end on September 27, 2016, and requires the interpretation of 106 square kilometers of 3-D seismic inversion processing and a long-term test on a well that was drilled prior to the Petroamerica acquisition. 

El Porton (25% WI, non-operated) 

Prior to our acquisition of Petroamerica, Petroamerica's two other partners on this block withdrew from the exploration phase of the contract and decided not to continue into the fifth exploration phase. As a result, Petroamerica retains 100% WI of the exploration phase of this block. The fifth exploration phase of the contract ended on January 2, 2016, however, we have applied for an extension of this phase. This phase requires one exploration well to be drilled. 

Tinigua (50% WI, operator) 

We are in the second of six exploration phases which will end on October 20, 2016. This phase requires one exploration well to be drilled. 

Alea 1848-A (50% WI, non-operated) 

We are in the unified three and four of five exploration phases, which is currently suspended. This phase requires the reprocessing of 52 kilometers of 2-D seismic, the acquisition of 70 kilometers of 2-D seismic, the acquisition of 52 square kilometers of 3-D seismic and one exploration well to be drilled. The work obligation for the reprocessing of 2-D seismic was satisfied prior to our acquisition of Petroamerica. 

Alea 1947-C (49.5% WI, non-operated) 

We are in phase two of five exploration phases, which is currently suspended. This phase requires one exploration well to be drilled. 

El Eden Block (40% WI, non-operated) 

The exploration period in the El Eden Block has ended. We retain the La Casona Evaluation Area. The evaluation period for this area will end on April 17, 2016. All work obligations in relation to this contract were completed prior to our acquisition of Petroamerica. 

Suroriente Block (15.8% WI, non-operated) 

All work obligations in relation to this contract were completed prior to our acquisition of Petroamerica. This is a &#8220;Crude Incremental Production Contract&#8221; with Ecopetrol. Under the terms of the contract, the working interests are subject to an &#8220;R&#8221; factor which can reduce the net WI depending on future investment and cash flow ratios. Although the contract is described as an incremental production contract, in this particular case, the working interest parties share in the entire amount of the crude production with Ecopetrol, due to the base production level being set at zero over the life of the contract, which expires in 2023. 

Arjona Block (50% WI, non-operated) 

This is a contract for the operation of Ecopetrol undeveloped discovered fields. The evaluation period in the Arjona Block has ended. All work obligations in relation to such evaluation period were completed prior to our acquisition of Petroamerica. We entered into an agreement to transfer our working interest in this block to a third party, but this assignment is subject to Ecopetrol approval. 

El Balay 

Prior to our acquisition of Petroamerica, Petroamerica applied to the ANH to relinquish its interest in this block. This relinquishment is subject to receipt of final documentation from ANH. 

Royalties 

Colombian royalties are regulated under laws 756 of 2002 and 1530 of 2012. All discoveries made subsequent to the enactment of law 756 of 2002 have the sliding scale royalty described below. Discoveries made before the enactment of this law have a royalty of 20%. The ANH contracts to which we are a party all have royalties that are based on a sliding scale described in law 756. This royalty works on an individual oil field basis starting with a base royalty rate of 8% for gross production of less than 5,000 bopd. The royalty increases in a linear fashion from 8% to 20% for gross production between 5,000 and 125,000 bopd and is stable at 20% for gross production between 125,000 and 400,000 bopd. For gross production between 400,000 and 600,000 bopd the rate increases in a linear fashion from 20% to 25%. For gross production in excess of 600,000 bopd the royalty rate is fixed at 25%. In addition to the sliding scale royalty, the following blocks have additional x-factor royalties: Llanos-22 and Putumayo-7: 1%; Sinu-1 and Llanos-10: 3%; Putumayo-31: 12%; Sinu-3:17%; CPO-13: 32% and CPO-7: 47%. 

For gas fields, the royalty is on an individual gas field basis starting with a base royalty rate of 6.4% for gross production of less than 28.5 MMcf of gas per day. The royalty increases in a linear fashion from 6.4% to 20% for gross production between 28.5 MMcf of gas per day and 3.42 Bcf of gas per day and is stable at 16% for gross production between 712.5 to 2,280 MMcf of gas per day. For gross production between 2.28 to 3.42 Bcf of gas per day the rate increases in a linear fashion from 16% to 20%. For gross production in excess of 3.42 Bcf of gas per day the royalty rate is fixed at 20%. 

Pursuant to the Chaza Block exploration and production contract (the "Chaza Contract") between the ANH and Gran Tierra, our production from the Costayaco Exploitation Area is also subject to an additional royalty (the "HPR royalty") that applies when cumulative gross production from an Exploitation Area is greater than five MMbbl. The HPR royalty is calculated on the difference between a trigger price defined in the Chaza Contract and the sales price. Pursuant to the Chaza Contract, any new Exploitation Area on the Chaza Block will also be subject to the HPR royalty once the production on such Exploitation Area exceeds five MMbbl of cumulative production. The Jilguero Exploitation Area in the Garibay Block will be subject to the HPR royalty once production from such Exploitation Area has reached five MMbbl. 

There is a dispute with the ANH as to whether the HPR royalty must be paid with respect to all production from the Moqueta Exploitation Area or only after production from the Moqueta Exploitation Area has reached five MMbbl (see Item 3. &#8220; Legal Proceedings&#8221; and Item 8. " Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" , below) . On April 30, 2015, total cumulative production from the Moqueta Exploitation Area reached 5.0 MMbbl and Gran Tierra commenced paying the HPR royalty payable on production over that threshold. The estimated compensation which would be payable on cumulative production if the ANH's claims are accepted in the arbitration is $66.3 million &#32;plus related interest of $26.5 million . We also disagree with the interest rate that the ANH has used in calculating the interest cost. We assert that since the HPR royalty is denominated in the U.S. dollar, the contract requires the interest rate to be three-month LIBOR plus 4%, whereas the ANH has applied the highest legally authorized interest rate on Colombian peso liabilities, which during the period of production to date has averaged approximately 29% per annum. At December 31, 2015 , based on an interest rate of three-month LIBOR plus 4% related interest would be $6.4 million . 

For exploration and production contracts awarded in the 2010, 2012 and 2014 Colombia Bid Rounds, the HPR royalty will apply once the production from the area governed by the contract, rather than any particular Exploitation Area designated under the contract, exceeds five MMbbl of cumulative production. We expect that this criterion for the HPR royalty will apply for subsequent bid rounds. 

The Guayuyaco Block has the sliding scale royalty but does not have the additional royalty. 

In addition to these government royalties, our original interests in the Santana, Guayuyaco, Chaza and Azar Blocks acquired on our entry into Colombia in 2006 are subject to a third party royalty. The additional interests in Guayuyaco and Chaza that we 

acquired on the acquisition of Solana in 2008 are not subject to this third party royalty. On June 20, 2006, we entered into a participation agreement that would effectively compensate Crosby Capital, LLC ("Crosby") for its share in certain Colombian properties. The compensation is in the form of overriding royalty rights that apply to our original interests in production from the Santana, Guayuyaco, Chaza and Azar Blocks. The overriding royalty rights start with a 2% rate on working interest production less government royalties. For new commercial fields discovered within 10 years of the agreement date and after a prescribed threshold is reached, Crosby reserves the right to convert the overriding royalty rights to a net profit interest ("NPI"). This NPI ranges from 7.5% to 10% of working interest production less sliding scale government royalties, as described above, and operating and overhead costs. No adjustment is made for the HPR royalty. On certain pre-existing fields, Crosby does not have the right to convert its overriding royalty rights to an NPI. In addition, there are conditional overriding royalty rights that apply only to the pre-existing fields. Currently, we are subject to a 10% NPI on 50% of our working interest production from the Costayaco and Moqueta Fields in the Chaza Block and 35% of our working interest production from the Juanambu Field in the Guayuyaco Block, and overriding royalties on our working interest production from the Santana Block and the Guayuyaco Field in the Guayuyaco Block. 

The Putumayo-7 Block is also subject to a third party royalty in addition to the government royalties. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement by which the interests in the Putumayo-7 Block were acquired, a 10% royalty on production from the Putumayo-7 Block is payable to Petro Caribbean Resources Ltd. ("PCR"). The terms of the royalty allow for transportation costs, marketing and handling fees, government royalties (including royalties payable to the ANH pursuant to Section 39 of the contract for the Putumayo-7 Block - the "Rights Due to High Prices") and taxes (other than taxes measured by the income of any party, and other than VAT or any equivalent) to be paid in cash or kind to the Government of Colombia (or any federal, state, regional or local government agency) and ANH, and the 1% &#8217;X&#8217; factor payment to be deducted from production revenue prior to the royalty being paid to PCR. 

Oil and Gas Properties - Brazil 

We have interests in seven blocks in Brazil and are the operator in all of these blocks. Our Brazilian properties are located in the Rec&#244;ncavo Basin in Eastern Brazil in the State of Bahia. 

All of our blocks in Brazil are subject to an 11% royalty, which consists of a 10% crown royalty and a 1% landowner royalty. 

Blocks REC-T-129, REC-T-142, REC-T-155 and REC-T-224 (100% WI, operated) 

Blocks REC-T-129, REC-T-142, REC-T-155 and REC-T-224 are located approximately 70 kilometers northeast of Salvador, Brazil in the Rec&#244;ncavo Basin and cover 27,076 &#32;gross acres. The Ti&#234; Field on Block 155 includes two &#32;productive wells. 

In December 2014, the Ag&#234;ncia Nacional de Petr&#243;leo, G&#225;s Natural e Biocombust&#237;veis ("ANP") issued an injunction specifically related to properties in the Rec&#244;ncavo Basin covered by Bid Round 12. This injunction placed a moratorium on unconventional activities on the Bid Round 12 blocks, all of which were unconventional exploration targets, until such a time as policies governing unconventional activities are finalized. Blocks REC-T-129, REC-T-142, REC-T-155 and REC-T-224 were granted in Bid Round 9, for which there has not been a similar injunction; however, we expect that the ANP&#8217;s injunction may limit our ability to receive permits in the short-term for our blocks with unconventional exploration targets. 

The First Appraisal Plan ("PAD") phase for Blocks REC-T-129, REC-T-142 and REC-T-155 ended on May 24, 2015, however we requested and were granted a suspension of the PAD phase until regulatory policies governing unconventional activities are finalized. 

The exploration phase of the concession agreement on Block REC-T-224 was due to expire on December 11, 2013; however, we requested and were granted a suspension of the exploration phase of this block. The exploration phase on Block REC-T-224 will end one year after the date an environmental permit is granted. This phase requires one exploration well to be drilled. 

Blocks REC-T-86, REC-T-117 and REC-T-118 (100% WI, operated) 

Blocks REC-T-86, REC-T-117 and REC-T-118 are located north of our other blocks in the Rec&#244;ncavo Basin and cover 20,658 &#32;gross acres. All three blocks are in the first &#32; exploration &#32;phase which will end in August 2016 . This phase requires the acquisition of a total of 120 square kilometers of 3-D seismic on the three blocks and two exploration wells to be drilled on Block REC-T-117 and three exploration wells on Block REC-T-118. We have satisfied the work obligation for the acquisition, processing and interpretation of 3-D seismic on Block 86. We have requested a rephasing of the work obligations for the exploration commitments on Blocks 117 and 118 that would move the obligations to 2017. 

Oil and Gas Properties - Peru 

We have a 100% WI in five blocks in Peru and we are the operator in each of the blocks. The following table provides summary information for our blocks in Peru:

&#160; 

5,732,274 

All blocks in Peru are subject to a license agreement with PeruPetro. There is a 5-20% sliding scale royalty rate on the lands, dependent on production levels. Production less than 5,000 bopd is assessed a royalty of 5%. For production between 5,000 and 100,000 bopd there is a linear sliding scale between 5% and 20%. Production over 100,000 bopd has a flat royalty of 20%. This royalty structure applies to all blocks in Peru in which we have an interest. Block 133 has an additional royalty 'X' factor of 15%. 

Status of Exploration Phases 

Block 95 (100% WI, operated) 

As previously discussed, in February 2015, we ceased all further development expenditures in the Breta&#241;a Field on Block 95 other than what is necessary to maintain tangible asset integrity and security. We applied for and were granted a three year retention period from December 28, 2015, to ring-fence the Breta&#241;a Structure. The obligation during this retention period is to evaluate the economics of the project in order to decide whether to declare commerciality by December 27, 2018. Additionally, we were granted an extension of the exploration period to December 27, 2017. This additional exploration period requires the completion of 176 units of work to move to the next phase or forfeiture with no penalty or commitment. 

Block 123 and Block 129 (100% WI, operated) 

Both blocks are in the third &#32; exploration &#32;period of five and are under force majeure. On Block 123, the current exploration period required one exploration well to be drilled or the completion of 300 units of work. This work obligation was satisfied by the acquisition of 318 kilometers of 2-D seismic prior to assuming operatorship. On Block 129, the current exploration period required one exploration well to be drilled or the completion of 204 units of work. This work obligation was satisfied by the acquisition of 252 kilometers of 2-D seismic by our former partners on this block. 

Block 107 (100% WI, operated) 

We are in the fifth &#32;and final exploration period, which is suspended due to delays in the permitting process. A 3-year extension of the fifth exploration phase was granted in April 30th, 2015. This period requires two exploration wells to be drilled. During 2015, we completed the acquisition of 311 kilometers of 2-D seismic as part of the obligation for the fourth exploration period. 

Block 133 (100% WI, operated) 

We are in the third &#32; exploration &#32;period of four, which is in force majeure pending the approval of 2-D seismic and drilling EIAs. This period requires one exploration well to be drilled or the completion of 200 units of work . 

Administrative Facilities 

Our principal executive offices are located in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The Calgary office lease will expire on December 30, 2018. We also have office space in Colombia, Peru and Brazil. 

Estimated Reserves 

Our 2015 reserves w ere independently prepared by McDaniel International Inc. ("McDaniel"), a wholly owned subsidiary of McDaniel &#38; Associates. McDaniel &#38; Associates was established in 1955 as an independent Canadian consulting firm and has been providing oil and gas reserves evaluation services to the world's petroleum industry for the past 60 years. They have internationally recognized expertise in reserves evaluations, resource assessments, geological studies, and acquisition and disposition advisory services. McDaniel&#8217;s has offices in Calgary, Canada and Guildford, United Kingdom, The technical person primarily responsible for the preparation of our reserves estimates at McDaniel meets the requirements regarding qualifications, independence, objectivity, and confidentiality set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. 

The primary internal technical person in charge of overseeing the preparation of our reserve estimates is the Vice President, Asset Management. He has a B. Eng (Hons) degree in mechanical engineering and is a professional engineer and member of the Association of Professional Engineers, Geologists and Geophysicists of Alberta. He is responsible for our engineering activities including reserves reporting, asset evaluation, reservoir management and field development. He has over 20 years of experience working internationally in the oil and gas industry. 

We have developed internal controls for estimating and evaluating reserves. Our internal controls over reserve estimates include: 100% of our reserves are evaluated by an independent reservoir engineering firm, at least annually; and review controls are followed, including an independent internal review of assumptions used in the reserve estimates and presentation of the results of this internal review to our reserves committee. Calculations and data are reviewed at several levels of the organization to ensure consistent and appropriate standards and procedures. Our policies are applied by all staff involved in generating and reporting reserve estimates including geological, engineering and finance personnel. 

The process of estimating oil and gas reserves is complex and requires significant judgment, as discussed in Item 1A. &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221;. The reserve estimation process requires us to use significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data for each property. Therefore, the accuracy of the reserve estimate is dependent on the quality of the data, the accuracy of the assumptions based on the data and the interpretations and judgment related to the data. 

Proved reserves are reserves which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expires, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. The term &#8220;reasonable certainty&#8221; implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil or natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. To achieve reasonable certainty, we and the independent reserve engineers employed technologies that have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability. Estimates of proved reserves are generated through the integration of relevant geological, engineering, and production data, utilizing technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield repeatable and consistent results as defined in the SEC regulations. Data used in these integrated assessments included information obtained directly from the subsurface through wellbores, such as well logs, reservoir core samples, fluid samples, static and dynamic pressure information, production test data, and surveillance and performance information. The data utilized also included subsurface information obtained through indirect measurements such as seismic data. The tools used to interpret the data included proprietary and commercially available seismic processing software and commercially available reservoir modeling and simulation software. Reservoir parameters from analogous reservoirs were used to increase the quality of and confidence in the reserves estimates when available. The method or combination of methods used to estimate the reserves of each reservoir was based on the unique circumstances of each reservoir and the dataset available at the time of the estimate. Probable reserves are reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered. Estimates of probable reserves which may potentially be recoverable through additional drilling or recovery techniques are by nature more uncertain than estimates of proved reserves and accordingly are subject to substantially greater risk of not actually being realized by us. 

Possible reserves are reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves. Estimates of possible reserves are also inherently imprecise. Estimates of probable and possible reserves are also continually subject to revisions based on production history, results of additional exploration and development, price changes and other factors. 

The following table sets forth our estimated reserves NAR as of December 31, 2015 .

Proved Undeveloped Reserves 

At December 31, 2015 , we had total proved undeveloped reserves NAR of 7.6 &#32;MMBOE ( December 31, 2014 &#32;- 7.7 &#32;MMBOE), including 5.0 &#32;MMBOE in Colombia ( December 31, 2014 &#32;&#8211; 6.2 &#32;MMBOE) and 2.6 &#32;MMBOE in Brazil ( December 31, 2014 &#32;&#8211; 

1.5 &#32;MMBOE). Approximately 53% , 7% &#32;and 5% &#32;of proved undeveloped reserves, respectively, are located in our Moqueta, Costayaco and Ramiriqui Fields in Colombia and 35% &#32;are in the Ti&#234; Field in Brazil. None of our proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2015 , have remained undeveloped for five years or more since initial disclosure as proved reserves and we have adopted a development plan which indicates that the proved undeveloped reserves are scheduled to be drilled within five years of initial disclosure as proved reserves. 

Material changes in proved undeveloped reserves are summarized in the table below:

In 2015 , we converted 1.3 &#32;MMBOE, or 17% &#32;of year-end 2014 &#32;proved undeveloped reserves, to developed status. In 2015 , we made investments, consisting solely of capital expenditures, of $34.6 million &#32;in Colombia and $0.1 million &#32;in Brazil, associated with the development of proved undeveloped reserves. 

All of the proved undeveloped reserves conversions occurred in the Costayaco, Moqueta and Jilguero Fields in Colombia. &#32; In Colombia, the majority of proved undeveloped conversions occurred as a result of ongoing development activities in the Moqueta and Costayaco Fields, including infill drilling and a pressure maintenance projects in both of these fields. 

Discoveries and extensions include proved undeveloped reserves additions in Brazil as a result of the signing of a gas contract and proved undeveloped reserves additions in Colombia at one location in the Ramiriqui Field. Technical revisions include positive revisions resulting from better than expected production performance in the Costayaco and Moqueta Fields. In Brazil, no new wells were drilled, however, our current development plan includes a water injection project and the updated reservoir modeling resulted in a large technical revision to the proved ultimate recovery volumes of the existing wells.

Marketing and Major Customers 

Colombia 

Our oil in Colombia is light oil, with 93% &#32;of 2015 production coming from the Putumayo Basin with an average API of approximately 29&#176; . 

We have entered into agreements to sell to Ecopetrol the volume of crude oil production produced in the Chaza and Guayuyaco Blocks (the &#8220;Putumayo production&#8221;). The volume of crude oil does not include the volume of oil corresponding to royalties taken in kind, but does include volumes relating to HPR royalties. These agreements are subject to renegotiation annually and generally contain mutual termination provisions with 30 days notice. These agreements will expire November 30, 2016. We may, but are not obligated to, sell up to 100% of our Putumayo production to Ecopetrol. We deliver our oil to Ecopetrol through our transportation facilities which include pipelines, gathering systems and trucking and through the transportation and logistics assets of Ecopetrol and CENIT Transporte y Logistica de Hidrocarburos S.A.S ("CENIT"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ecopetrol. 

The point of sale of our Putumayo production to Ecopetrol is the Port of Tumaco on the Pacific coast of Colombia. 

We have entered into transportation agreements (the &#8220;Transportation Agreements&#8221;) with CENIT. These agreements will expire November 30, 2016. Pursuant to the Transportation Agreements we pay a transportation tariff and transportation tax for the transportation of the Putumayo production from the Putumayo Basin to the Port of Tumaco. Pursuant to the Transportation Agreements, each of Gran Tierra Energy Colombia Ltd. and Petrolifera Petroleum (Colombia) Limited have the right to transport up to 10,000 bopd, subject to availability of capacity, of crude oil production from the Chaza and Guayuyaco Blocks in Colombia: (1) from Santana Station to CENIT&#8217;s facility at Orito through CENIT&#8217;s Mansoya &#8211; Orito Pipeline, and (2) from CENIT&#8217;s facility at Orito to the Port of Tumaco through CENIT&#8217;s Orito &#8211; Tumaco Pipeline. We can request that CENIT transport additional crude oil in excess of 20,000 bopd through the pipelines on the same terms, which CENIT may do at its sole discretion. 

Generally, under these agreements, CENIT is liable (subject to specified limitations) for pollution clean up costs resulting from incidents during transportation. The cost of oil lost during transportation is shared by the parties that ship oil on the pipeline, in proportion to their share of total volumes shipped. 

Currently we have Firm Capacity Transportation Agreements for 6,000 bopd, of which 3,000 bopd are under ship or pay agreements and 3,000 bopd are under ship and pay agreements. These agreements will expire October 31, 2020. The remainder of our Putumayo production is transported through the Transportation Agreements. 

In the event that we do not sell all of our production to Ecopetrol, we sell to numerous alternative purchasers. We are under no obligation to sell any oil to our alternative purchasers until we specify for a particular day the amount of oil we wish to sell to them. Oil can be delivered and sold at the Costayaco battery where oil is loaded into trucks, delivered to facilities at Babillas Station and the sales point is the Port of Cove&#241;as upon oil export, or delivered via pipeline to the Port of Esmeraldas, Ecuador and the sales point is when oil is loaded into an export tanker. 

The majority of the oil produced is transported by pipeline. Varying amounts of oil are trucked: (1) from Santana Station to Ecopetrol&#8217;s storage terminal at Orito, a distance of approximately 46 kilometers; (2) from the Costayaco Field to Ecopetrol&#8217;s storage terminal at Neiva (Dina Station), approximately 350 kilometers north of the Chaza Block; (3) from the Costayaco Field to Hocol&#180;s unloading facilities at Neiva (Babillas Station), approximately 350 kilometers north of the Chaza Block; (4) from the Costayaco Field to the Atl&#225;ntico Oil Terminal in Barranquilla, a distance of approximately 1,500 kilometers; (5) from the Garibay Jilguero Field to facilities at Cusiana Station, a distance of approximately 75 kilometers; and; (6) from the Llanos 22 Ramiriqui Field to facilities at Cusiana Station, a distance of approximately 35 kilometers. 

We receive revenues for our Colombian oil sales in U.S. dollars. Oil prices for sales of our crude oil are defined by agreements with the purchasers of the oil and are based generally on an average price for crude oil, such as West Texas Intermediate ("WTI") or Brent, with adjustments such as for quality, specified fees, transportation fees and transportation tax. 

Brazil 

Petr&#243;leo Brasileiro S.A (&#8220;Petrobras&#8221;) is the main purchaser of our oil production from Block 155 in Brazil. Oil is trucked 26 miles to the Petrobras Carmo Oil Treatment Station. Oil prices for sales to Petrobras are based on the monthly average Dated Brent price less a refining and quality discount. 

Competition 

The oil and gas industry is highly competitive. We face competition from both local and international companies in acquiring properties, contracting for drilling and other oil field equipment and securing trained personnel. Many of these competitors, such as Ecopetrol, have financial and technical resources that exceed ours. Others are smaller and we believe our technical and financial capabilities give us a competitive advantage over these companies. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. In addition, there is substantial competition for prospects and resources in the oil and gas industry. 

Geographic Information 

Information regarding our geographic segments, including information on revenues, assets, expenses and net income, can be found in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Segment and Geographic Reporting, in Item 8 &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221;, which information is incorporated by reference here. Long lived assets are Property, Plant and Equipment, which includes all oil and gas assets, furniture and fixtures, automobiles and computer equipment. No long lived assets are held in our country of domicile, which is the United States of America. "All Other" assets include assets held by our corporate head office in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Because all of our exploration and development operations are in South America, we face many risks associated with these operations. See Item 1A &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; for risks associated with our foreign operations. 

Regulation 

The oil and gas industry in Colombia, Peru and Brazil is heavily regulated. Rights and obligations with regard to exploration, development and production activities are explicit for each project; economics are governed by a royalty/tax regime. Various government approvals are required for property acquisitions and transfers, including, but not limited to, meeting financial and technical qualification criteria in order to be certified as an oil and gas company in the country. Oil and gas concessions are typically granted for fixed terms with opportunity for extension. 

Colombia 

In Colombia, prior to 2004, Ecopetrol was the administrator of all hydrocarbons and therefore executed contracts with oil companies under different contractual types such as Association Contracts and Shared Risk Contracts. Under an Association Contract, the oil company (&#8220;Associate&#8221;) assumed all risk during the exploration phase and Ecopetrol had the obligation to reimburse the Associate, if the commerciality was accepted by Ecopetrol, the direct exploration costs which the Associate incurred in proportion to Ecopetrol's working interest. If Ecopetrol did not accept the initial commerciality of a field, the Associate could continue the activities at its sole risk and Ecopetrol would retain the right to back-in later, after Ecopetrol reimbursed the Associate for the initial exploitation work and exploration costs plus certain penalties, depending upon at what stage Ecopetrol later declared commerciality of the field. 

Effective June 2003, the regulatory regime in Colombia underwent a significant change with the formation of the ANH. The ANH is now the administrator of the hydrocarbons in the country and therefore is responsible for regulating the Colombian oil and gas industry, including managing all exploration lands. Ecopetrol became a public company owned in majority by the state with the main purpose of exploring and producing hydrocarbons similar to any other oil company. However, Ecopetrol continues to have rights under the existing contracts executed with oil companies before the ANH was created. Ecopetrol continues to be the major purchaser and marketer of oil in Colombia and operates the majority of the oil transportation infrastructure in the country. 

In conjunction with this change, the ANH developed a new exploration risk contract that took effect as of June 2004. This Exploration and Production Contract has significantly changed the way the industry views Colombia. In place of the earlier association contracts, the new agreement provides full risk/reward benefits for the contractor. Under the terms of the contract the successful operator retains the rights to all reserves, production and income from any new exploration block, subject to existing royalty and tax regulations. Each contract contains an exploration phase and a production phase. The exploration phase will contain a number of exploration periods and each period will have an associated work commitment. The production phase will last a number of years (usually 24) from the declaration of a commercial hydrocarbon discovery. 

&#32;We operate in Colombia through the following branches - Gran Tierra Energy Colombia Ltd., Petrolifera Petroleum (Colombia) Limited, Petroamerica International Colombia Corp. Sucursal, Petroamerica Energy Colombia Sucursal, 

Petroamerica P&#38;G Corp Colombia, Southeast Investment Corporation, Petroamerica Colombia, and PetroGranada Colombia Limited Sucursal Colombia. The home offices of Gran Tierra Energy Colombia Ltd., Petrolifera Petroleum (Colombia) Limited, Petroamerica Colombia and Petroamerica Energy Colombia Sucursal are qualified as operators of oil and gas properties by the ANH. 

When operating under a contract, the contractor is the owner of the hydrocarbons extracted from the contract area during the performance of operations, except for royalty volumes which are collected by the ANH (or its designee), depending on the type of contract. The contractor can market the hydrocarbons in any manner whatsoever, subject to a limitation in the case of natural emergencies where the law specifies the manner of sale. 

Peru 

Peru&#8217;s hydrocarbon legislation, which includes the Organic Hydrocarbon Law No. 26221 enacted in 1993 and the regulations thereunder (the &#8220;Organic Hydrocarbon Law&#8221;), governs our operations in Peru. This legislation covers the entire range of petroleum operations, defines the roles of Peruvian government agencies which regulate and interact with the oil and gas industry, provides that private investors (either national or foreign) may also make investments in the petroleum sector and provides for the promotion of the development of hydrocarbon activities based on free competition and free access to all economic activities. This law provides that pipeline transportation and natural gas distribution must be handled via concession contracts with the appropriate governmental authorities. All other petroleum activities are to be freely operated subject to complying with applicable regulation, including local safety and environment standards. 

Under the Peruvian legal system, Peru is the owner of the hydrocarbons located below the surface in its national territory. However, Peru has given the ownership right to extracted hydrocarbons to PeruPetro S.A. ("PeruPetro"), a state company responsible for promoting and overseeing the investment of hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation activities in Peru. PeruPetro is empowered to enter into contracts for either the exploration and exploitation or just the exploitation of petroleum and natural gas on behalf of Peru, the nature of which are described further below. The Peruvian government also plays an active role in petroleum operations through various entities and agencies, including through the involvement of the Ministry of Energy and Mines(the specialized government department in charge of establishing energy, mining and environmental protection policies, enacting the rules applicable to all these sectors and supervising compliance with such policies and rules),OSINERGMIN (an agency in charge of checking compliance with hydrocarbon regulations) and OEFA (the entity of supervising environmental compliance). We are subject to the laws and regulations of all of these entities and agencies. 

The Peruvian Constitution and the Organic Hydrocarbon Law states that a license contract does not provide for a transfer or lease of property over the area of the exploration or exploitation. In accordance with a license contract, a third party acquires the right to explore for or exploit hydrocarbons in a specified area and PeruPetro (the entity that holds the Peruvian state interest) transfers the property right in the extracted hydrocarbons to the third party, who must pay a royalty to the state. 

PeruPetro enters into either license contracts or service contracts for hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation. Peruvian law also allows for other contract models, but the investor must propose contract terms compatible with Peru&#8217;s interests. We only operate under license contracts and do not foresee operating under any service contracts. License and service contracts are approved by supreme decree issued by the Peruvian Ministry of Economy and Finance and the Peruvian Ministry of Energy and Mining, and can only be modified by written agreement signed by the parties. A company must be qualified by PeruPetro to enter into negotiations for hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation contracts in Peru. In order to qualify, the company must meet the standards under the Regulations Governing the Qualifications of Oil Companies. These qualifications generally require the company to have the technical, legal, economic and financial capacity to comply with all obligations it will assume under the contract based on the characteristics of the area requested, the possible investments and the environmental protection rules governing the performance of its operations. When a contractor is a foreign investor, it is required to incorporate a subsidiary company or registered branch in accordance with Peruvian corporate law and appoint Peruvian representatives in accordance with the Organic Hydrocarbon Law who will interact with PeruPetro. 

We operate in Peru through Gran Tierra Energy Peru S.R.L. and Petrolifera Petroleum del Peru S.R.L. Gran Tierra Energy Peru S.R.L. has been qualified by PeruPetro with respect to its contracts for Blocks 95, 123 and 129 and Petrolifera has been qualified by PeruPetro with respect to its contracts for Blocks 107 and 133. 

When operating under a license contract, the licensee is the owner of the hydrocarbons extracted from the contract area during the performance of operations and pays royalties which are collected by PeruPetro. The licensee can market or export the hydrocarbons in any manner whatsoever, subject to a limitation in the case of national emergency where the law stipulates such manner. 

Brazil 

In Brazil, Law No. 2004 enacted in 1953 created the state monopoly of the petroleum industry and Petrobras, a state-owned legal entity, which was the sole company conducting exploration and production activities in Brazil. The Brazilian Federal Constitution enacted on October 5, 1988, continued this state monopoly of the petroleum industry. 

Amendment No. 9 to the Brazilian Constitution, enacted on November 9, 1995, relaxed the state monopoly and authorized the Brazilian government to contract with state and private companies, with head offices and management located in Brazil, for the exploration and production of oil and natural gas, as well as to grant authorizations for the refining, transportation, import and export of oil, natural gas and its by-products. 

The regulatory model is governed by Law No. 9478 of August 6, 1997 (the &#8220;Petroleum Law&#8221;), as amended, which controls the granting of concessions for carrying out exploration and production activities to Brazilian companies. The Petroleum Law, as amended, also established a legal framework for pre-salt layer areas and strategic areas to be defined by the Brazilian government and which will be subject to the Production Sharing Regime. 

In accordance with the Petroleum Law, the acquisition of oil and natural gas property and oil and gas operations by state and private companies is subject to legal, technical and economic standards and regulations issued by the Ag&#234;ncia Nacional de Petr&#243;leo, G&#225;s Natural e Biocombust&#237;veis ("ANP"), the agency created by the Petroleum Law and vested with regulatory and inspection authority to ensure adequate operational procedures with respect to industry activities and the supply of fuels throughout the national territory. 

The ANP has authority for the implementation of the national oil and natural gas policy in accordance with the National Council of Energy Policy. The ANP conducts bid rounds to award exploration, development and production contracts, as well as to authorize the construction and operation of refineries and gas processing units, transportation facilities (including port terminals), import and export of oil and natural gas, as well as supervision of the activities which integrate the petroleum industry and the general enforcement of the Petroleum Law. 

During a public bid procedure, any company evidencing technical, financial and legal standards under the applicable bidding requirements may qualify and apply for particular blocks made available for concession contracts. Qualified companies may compete alone or in association with other companies, including through the formation of &#8220;consortia&#8221; (unincorporated joint-ventures), provided they agree to comply with all the applicable requirements of Brazilian Corporate Law. Blocks awarded and the duration of the exploration and production periods are defined in the contracts which, besides the usual covenants that can be found in oil concessions, such as exploration and development programs, relinquishment of areas, and unitization, include reversion to the state of certain assets at the end of the concession. Contracts may be assigned or transferred to other Brazilian companies that comply with the technical, financial and legal requirements established by the ANP. 

Oil and natural gas resources in Brazil, whether onshore or offshore, belong to the Brazilian government. However, under the Concession Regime, after the discovery of oil and gas reserves, ownership is assigned to the concessionaire. Under the principles of the Federal Constitution, the national territory comprises all land and the continental shelf. Brazil is a signatory of the conventions regulating the economic use of the sea and its subsoil. Brazil is thus entitled to the enjoyment of the resources over the territorial sea and marine platform up to the limits indicated in the pertinent treaties. 

Concessionaires are required under Law No. 9,478/97 to pay the government dues and fees, in addition to the charges for sale of pre-bid data and information. The ANP has the power to determine the criteria under which the Government Take will be assessed within the limits established by Federal Decree No. 2,705/98. Government Take comprises (i) signature bonus, (ii) royalties, (iii) special participation and (iv) area rentals. Part of the Government Take is passed on to States and Municipalities and other government branches according to law. 

We operate in Brazil through Gran Tierra Energy Brasil Ltda. (&#8220;Gran Tierra Brazil&#8221;). Gran Tierra Brazil received approval from the ANP as a Class B operator permitting Grant Tierra Brazil to act as an operator both onshore and in the shallow water offshore Brazil. 

Environmental Compliance 

Our activities are subject to existing laws and regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control in the countries where we maintain operations. Our activities with respect to exploration, drilling, production and facilities, including the operation and construction of pipelines, plants and other facilities for transporting, processing, treating or storing oil and other products, are subject to stringent environmental regulation by local, provincial, state and federal authorities in Colombia, 

Peru and Brazil. Such regulations relate to environmental impact studies, the discharge of pollutants into air and water, management of hazardous waste, including its transportation, storage, and disposal, permitting for the construction of facilities, recycling requirements and reclamation standards, and the protection of certain plants and animal species, among others. Risks are inherent in oil and gas exploration, development and production operations, such as blowouts, fires, or spills, and significant costs and liabilities may be incurred in connection with environmental compliance issues. Licenses and permits required for our exploration and production activities may not be obtainable on reasonable terms or on a timely basis, which could result in delays and have an adverse effect on our operations. Spills and releases into the environment of petroleum products can result in investigatory and remedial liabilities. Moreover, violations of environmental laws and regulations can result in the issuance of administrative, civil, or criminal fines and penalties, as well as orders or injunctions prohibiting some or all of our operations in affected areas. In addition, indigenous groups or other local organizations could oppose our operations in their communities, potentially resulting in delays which could adversely affect our operations. 

We do not expect that the cost of compliance with local, provincial, state and federal provisions which have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment will be material to us. 

We have implemented a company wide web-based reporting system which allows us to better track incidents and respective corrective actions and associated costs. We have a Corporate Health, Safety, and Environmental Management System and follow environmental best practices. We have also implemented an environmental risk management program in place as well as waste management procedures. Air and water testing occur regularly and environmental contingency plans have been prepared for all sites and ground transportation of oil. We have a regular quarterly comprehensive reporting system with a schedule of internal audits and routine checking of practices and procedures. Emergency response exercises were conducted in Colombia, Peru and Brazil. However, despite these measures, we cannot guarantee that our operations will always be able to maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. 

Employees 

At December 31, 2015 , we had 301 &#32;full-time employees (December 31, 2014 - 473): 58 &#32;located in the Calgary corporate office, 193 &#32;in Colombia ( 101 &#32;staff in Bogota and 92 &#32;field personnel), 28 &#32;in Peru ( 19 &#32;office staff in Lima and 9 &#32;field staff) and 22 &#32;in Brazil ( 9 &#32;office staff in Rio de Janeiro and Salvador and 13 &#32;field staff). None of our employees are represented by labor unions and we consider our employee relations to be good.
