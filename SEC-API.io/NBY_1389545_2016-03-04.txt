 ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Overview&#160; 

&#160; 

We are a biopharmaceutical company developing products for the eye care market. We are currently focused primarily on commercializing prescription Avenova &#174; for managing hygiene of the eyelids and lashes in the United States. 

&#160; 

Avenova is the only eye care product formulated with a proprietary, stable and pure form of hypochlorous acid called Neutrox&#8482;. By replicating the anti-microbial chemicals used by white blood cells to fight infection, Neutrox has proven in laboratory testing to have broad antimicrobial properties. Avenova with Neutrox removes debris from the skin on the eyelids and lashes without burning or stinging. 

&#160; 

In November 2015, we introduced a new business strategy to focus on growing sales of Avenova in the U.S. market and to restructure our business with the goal of achieving profitability from operations by the end of 2016. Our three-part business strategy is comprised of: (1) focusing our resources on growing the commercial sales of Avenova in the U.S. eye care market, including the implementation of an innovative sales and marketing strategy to increase product margin and profitability; (2) significantly reducing expenses through the restructuring of our operations and other cost reduction measures; and (3) seeking additional sources of revenue through partnering, divesting and/or other means of monetizing non-core assets in urology, dermatology, and wound care. 

&#160; 

We have developed additional commercial products containing Neutrox, including our NeutroPhase &#174; Skin and Wound Cleanser for wound care and CelleRx &#174; for the dermatology market. We have partnerships for NeutroPhase in the U.S. as well as select overseas markets, most notably China. 

&#160; 

In addition to our Neutrox family of products, we have also synthesized and developed a second category of novel compounds aimed at harnessing the power of white blood cell chemistry to address the global, topical anti-infective market. This second product category includes auriclosene, our lead clinical-stage Aganocide &#174; compound, which is a patented, synthetic molecule with a broad spectrum of activity against bacteria, viruses and fungi. 

&#160; 

We were incorporated under the laws of the State of California on January 19, 2000, as NovaCal Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and subsequently changed our name to NovaBay Pharmaceuticals, Inc. In June 2010, we changed the state in which we are incorporated (the &#8220;Reincorporation&#8221;) to the State of Delaware. All references to &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;the Company,&#8221; or NovaBay&#8221; herein refer to the California corporation prior to the date of the Reincorporation, and to the Delaware corporation on and after the date of the Reincorporation.

Avenova 

&#160; 

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

Prescription Avenova (0.01% Neutrox) is well-suited for daily eyelid and eyelash hygiene by approximately 30 million Americans who suffer from blepharitis and dry eye. Additionally, we estimate that an additional 11 million patients suffering from other conditions could potentially benefit from the use of Avenova, bringing the total potential market to approximately 41 million patients. 

&#160; 

A growing number of patients have found Avenova, which is used twice daily, to be soothing and effective in removing microorganisms and debris that can cause inflammation, itching and other painful symptoms of the eyelids and lashes. As described below, many key opinion leaders in the field of ophthalmology and optometry have embraced Avenova as a tool in the management of lid and lash hygiene. 

&#160; 

We are targeting a customer base of prescribers that includes the approximately 17,000 ophthalmologists and approximately 37,000 optometrists in the U.S. In August 2014, we launched a dedicated Avenova sales force of 10 direct medical sales representatives in 10 major metropolitan areas across the United States. This sales and marketing campaign initially targeted major urban areas where large numbers of individuals suffer from problems with their eyelids and lashes. These markets included New York, Los Angeles, Boston, Atlanta, and San Francisco. 

&#160; 

In January 2015, we rebranded our product originally known as i-Lid Cleanser as Avenova in order to more clearly differentiate this prescription product from over-the-counter (OTC) detergent-based lid wipes. Our prescription-only Avenova offers advantages as a part of the regimen for managing these disorders compared with alternative regimens that contain soaps, bleach and other impurities. Avenova removes micro-organisms from the skin without the use of harmful ingredients like detergents and bleach. 

&#160; 

Based on positive sales performance, we expanded our sales force to 35 direct medical sales representatives in February 2015 and to 43 direct medical sales representatives in August 2015. The sales representatives recruited for this effort have extensive experience with eye care products and medical devices&#8212;a skill set critical for rapid adoption of Avenova. Based on extensive market research, we have assigned our sales representatives to the markets across the U.S. representing the highest sales potential. These direct medical sales representatives are calling on targeted ophthalmologists and optometrists in those markets. These targeted doctors treat large numbers of blepharitis and dry eye patients. Avenova is a natural addition to their existing lid hygiene regimens. 

&#160; 

We have distribution agreements with McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen Corporation that make Avenova accessible in 90% of the approximate 67,000 retail pharmacies across the U.S. Avenova also is marketed through the top ophthalmology and optometry networks. These include Vision Source Independent Optometry Network, the largest independent optometry network in the country representing 2,800 independent optometrist offices, and ALLDocs Optometry Group (also known as The Association of LensCrafters Leaseholding Doctors), the second largest independent optometry group in the U.S., which works closely with its LensCrafters partners. Through a partnership with ALPHAEON, Avenova is available to member ophthalmologists on the ShoutMD &#174; Store, the first social commerce store for lifestyle healthcare products. Avenova is also available for order online with a prescription, and we provide an online pharmacy locator to assist patients with filling prescriptions. 

&#160; 

We expect continued benefit from the support of the key opinion leaders on our Ophthalmic and Optometry Advisory Boards, our active schedule of educational and marketing programs and strong presence at major eye care conferences in the coming months, including the American Academy of Ophthalmology, the American Optometric Association, the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery Conferences and the South Eastern Congress of Optometry, as well as numerous Vision Expo meetings held around the U.S. We also plan to continue advertising in leading ophthalmic and optometric trade journals. At meetings, in professional publications and in surveys, nationally prominent ophthalmologists and optometrists are reporting on improvements in eye care from the use of Avenova. 

&#160; 

We reported increases in key metrics throughout 2015, including the number of optometrists and ophthalmologists purchasing Avenova for their practices. We also reported growth in prescription volume as reported by distributors and the number of retail pharmacies ordering Avenova, both of which have been confirmed by third-party prescription data providers. Increases in Avenova volume include growth of both Avenova product reorders and new prescriptions. 

&#160; 

We expect that our prescription business will be the main driver of long-term Avenova sales growth. Reimbursement under insurance coverage continues to grow with 68% of Avenova prescriptions covered by insurance plans at the end of 2015. Supported by the high percentage rate of insurance reimbursement, we are focusing our primary sales efforts on building our prescription business under a new value pricing model. We are working to improve insurance reimbursement coverage for Avenova and aligning our product pricing accordingly. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Although we are focusing on our prescription sales, we expect continued growth in the doctor to patient direct sales channel. We also expect to invest in systems that support prescribing physicians&#8217; efforts to educate their patients. We have made it easy for doctors to get Avenova into the hands of patients by providing availability through well-known national pharmacy chains, specialty pharmacies, or directly through the practitioners&#8217; office. Furthermore, in order to ensure consistent pricing, we have instituted rebate cards to ensure the best price for the patient at the pharmacy. This sales model combined with the prospect for further increases in reimbursement under insurance plans has the potential to provide us with additional revenue upside. 

&#160; &#160;

Competition 

&#160; 

Our Avenova product is competing in the lid and lash hygiene market. Avenova has the distinct competitive advantage of being the only product for the management of eye conditions that contains our proprietary Neutrox, which is pure hypochlorous acid. Neutrox was cleared by the U.S. FDA as a prescription medical device for the cleansing and removal of microorganisms from wounds and skin. 

&#160; 

There are many companies that sell lid and lash scrubs, most of these are surfactant (soap) based, such as lid scrubs or baby shampoos. Prescription Avenova has been shown to neutralize bacterial toxins in vitro and is designed for continuous daily eyelid hygiene. Unlike its competitors, Avenova consists of saline and 0.01% pure hypochlorous acid, without the bleach impurities included in competitive offerings. Newer prescription products have more recently been commercially launched; however, all include bleach or other impurities. We believe that physicians and their patients will choose Avenova over competitive prescription products or diluted soap, such as some OTC products. 

&#160; 

Partnerships to Monetize Other Assets 

&#160; 

We intend to seek additional sources of revenue and reduce expenses by licensing or selling select non-core assets, possibly including intelli-Case, NeutroPhase, CelleRx and our Aganocide compounds, including auriclosene. 

&#160; 

Currently, the program with the most potential is our urology program. Statistically-significant and clinically-meaningful results from a Phase 2 clinical study of our Auriclosene Irrigation Solution (AIS) used to reduce urinary catheter blockage and encrustation (UCBE), were announced in September 2013. This study, comparing AIS to saline solution, achieved its primary endpoints and showed clear benefits for patients with long-term indwelling catheters. We initiated the next Phase 2 study in the fourth quarter of 2014, and in the fourth quarter of 2015, we announced completion of that study. Patients with long-term indwelling urinary catheters were treated with AIS or its Vehicle. The results of this more demanding study showed that AIS was better than its Vehicle in preventing the reduction of flow through catheters due to encrustation, the primary efficacy measure, by a statistically-significant margin. Furthermore, there were no cases of clinical catheter blockage in the AIS arm of the study; all cases of clinical blockage requiring catheter removal occurred only in the Vehicle arm. 

&#160; &#160;

NovaClear intelli-Case 

&#160; 

In June 2015, we received FDA-clearance for the NovaClear intelli-Case, a highly innovative, easy-to-use device for use with hydrogen peroxide disinfection solutions for soft and rigid gas permeable contact lenses. More than 24 million Americans disinfect their contact lenses with a multipurpose disinfection system to prevent potentially serious infections. Approximately two million use hydrogen peroxide as a disinfection solution. Many ophthalmologists and optometrists favor the disinfection and lens material compatibility peroxide systems provide, yet side effects associated with misuse and non-compliance minimize peroxide system use. Hydrogen peroxide in too low of a concentration does not fully disinfect lenses and in too high of a concentration can irritate the eye. 

&#160; 

The intelli-Case monitors the neutralization of hydrogen peroxide during the disinfection cycle with sophisticated microprocessor electronics embedded in the cap of what otherwise looks like a standard peroxide lens case. The LED indicators on the lid inform the user if the lenses are safe to insert into the eyes, resulting in a disinfection system that is safe yet simple to use. We are seeking potential partners with the resources to make this break-through device available to the largest number of contact lens wearers as soon as possible. 

&#160; 

Additional Neutrox-based Products 

&#160; 

Although Avenova with Neutrox is NovaBay&#8217;s primary commercial focus, over the past ten years NovaBay has developed additional Neutrox-related products. In addition to Avenova, the Neutrox branded products currently being commercialized as prescription medical devices are NeutroPhase and CelleRx. Similar to Avenova, we believe the principal competitive advantage of these products in our target markets is the fact that in-vitro studies show their effectiveness in killing bacteria, fungi and viruses, including bacteria in biofilm; very low potential for the development of resistance; fast time to kill bacteria; a wide safety margin; a low side-effect profile and cost effectiveness. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

NeutroPhase (Wound Care). Since its launch in the U.S. in 2013, NeutroPhase has impacted how wound care is administered. Consisting of 0.03% Neutrox, NeutroPhase is used to cleanse and remove microorganisms from any type of acute or chronic wound, and can be used with any type of wound care modality. Recently, NeutroPhase has been found to be an effective irrigation solution as part of the adjunct treatment for Necrotizing Fasciitis (&#8220;NF&#8221;). Also known as flesh-eating disease, NF typically has a high mortality and amputation rate (30% and 70%, respectively) even with aggressive debridement and antibiotic treatment. In vitro studies have shown that in solution, NeutroPhase both kills the microorganisms implicated in NF and neutralizes the toxins secreted by the microorganisms. Success using NeutroPhase as an irrigation solution has established it as an effective part of the adjunct treatment for this deadly disease. 

&#160; 

We believe that NeutroPhase is a well-suited product to treat the six million patients in the U.S. who suffer from chronic non-healing wounds, such as pressure, venous stasis and diabetic ulcers. In the U.S. and internationally, NeutroPhase is distributed through commercial partners. In January 2012, we entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with Pioneer Pharma Company Limited, or &#8220;Pioneer,&#8221; a Shanghai-based company, for the distribution of NeutroPhase throughout Southeast Asia and mainland China. We subsequently expanded the agreement with Pioneer so that it includes the licensing rights to CelleRx and Avenova. In September 2014, China&#8217;s Food and Drug Administration cleared our NeutroPhase Skin and Wound Cleanser for sale throughout mainland China. In November 2014, Taiwan&#8217;s Food and Drug Administration cleared our NeutroPhase Skin and Wound Cleanser for sale in Taiwan. We began shipping NeutroPhase to China and Taiwan in the fourth quarter of 2014 to support our launch of NeutroPhase Skin and Wound Cleanser by Pioneer. In the U.S., NeutroPhase is distributed through our partner, Principle Business Enterprise (&#8220;PBE&#8221;). 

&#160; 

In March 2015, the National Necrotizing Fasciitis Foundation (&#8220;NNFF&#8221;) named NeutroPhase its official &#8220;Flesh Eating Disease&#8221; wound cleanser. The NNFF is a non-profit organization established in 1997 by two survivors of the disease. NNFF has evolved to become the world&#8217;s leading resource for information regarding necrotizing fasciitis, as well as a repository of cases reported worldwide. 

&#160; 

NeutroPhase is competing in a crowded skin and wound cleanser market with many old and low priced products with similar uses. However, we believe NeutroPhase has distinct competitive advantages in a market where there is currently no dominant product. 

&#160; 

CelleRx (Dermatology). Created for cosmetic procedures, CelleRx&#8482; (0.015% Neutrox) is a gentle cleansing solution that is effective for post-laser resurfacing, chemical peels and other cosmetic surgery procedures. Cosmetic surgeons and aesthetic dermatologists have found that CelleRx results in less pain, erythema, and exudate compared to Dakin solution, which contains bleach impurities. CelleRx is a non-alcohol formulation that doesn&#8217;t dry or stain the skin, and most importantly, has been shown to reduce the patient&#8217;s downtime post procedure. 

&#160; 

CelleRx is competing in the cosmetic surgery and aesthetic dermatology space as an adjunct therapy for the pre/post procedural phase of chemical and laser facial skin peels. Currently many generic creams and salves, as well as home-mixed acetic acid potions, are used for this purpose. We believe that CelleRx is clearly differentiated in this field. CelleRx is the only Rx product with 510(k) clearance for use as a skin and wound cleanser that is safe, soothing and has broad spectrum antimicrobial action in solution. Many clinicians have used the product clinically and have reported excellent results. 

&#160; 

U.S. FDA Regulatory Clearance of Neutrox-based Products. We are marketing Avenova, NeutroPhase, and CelleRx as medical devices regulated under the FDA 510(k) process. Avenova and CelleRx fall under the general intended use of skin and wound cleansers. NeutroPhase was cleared by the U.S. FDA &#8220; for use under the supervision of healthcare professionals for cleansing and removal of foreign material, including microorganisms and debris from wounds, and for moistening absorbent wound dressings and cleaning minor cuts, minor burns, superficial abrasions, and minor irritations of the skin. It is also intended for moistening and debriding acute and chronic dermal lesions, such as Stage I to IV pressure ulcers, stasis ulcers, leg ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers, post-surgical wounds, first and second degree burns, and grafted and donor sites .&#8221; 

&#160; 

Aganocide Compounds 

&#160; 

Our first-in-class Aganocide compounds, led by auriclosene (NVC-422), are patented, synthetic molecules with a broad spectrum of activity against bacteria, viruses and fungi. Mimicking the mechanism of action that human white blood cells use against infections, Aganocides possess a reduced likelihood of bacteria or viruses developing resistance, which is critical for advanced anti-infectives. The World Health Organization (WHO) approved a new generic nomenclature by which our novel compound NVC-422 is identified&#8212; auriclosene . 

&#160; 

We believe that our Aganocide compounds may, if approved by the regulatory authorities, have significant advantages over existing compounds and compounds in development because the Aganocide compounds could be used to prevent infections or to treat infections with bacterial and viral components, such as conjunctivitis. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Recent Events 

&#160;
