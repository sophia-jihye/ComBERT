 Item 1. Business. 

Overview 

Newcastle Investment Corp. (&#8220;Newcastle&#8221; or the "Company") is a real estate investment trust (&#8220;REIT&#8221;) that focuses on opportunistically investing in, and actively managing, a variety of real estate related and other investments. Newcastle is externally managed and advised by an affiliate of Fortress Investment Group LLC, or Fortress (the &#8220;Manager&#8221;). Newcastle&#8217;s common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol &#8220;NCT.&#8221; 

We currently invest in real estate related debt and golf related real estate and operations. Our investment guidelines are purposefully broad to enable us to make investments in a wide array of assets, and we actively explore new business opportunities and asset categories as part of our business strategy. &#32; Our objective is to leverage our longstanding investment expertise to drive attractive risk-adjusted returns. We target stable long-term cash flows and seek to employ appropriate capital structures to generate returns throughout different interest rate environments. We take an active approach centered around identifying and executing on opportunities, responding to the changing market environment, and dynamically managing our investment portfolio to grow investments organically and through acquisitions into standalone businesses to enhance returns. 

Our debt business consists of assets of $46.4 million &#32;financed in collateralized debt obligations ("CDOs") whereby Newcastle is the manager, as well as $669.7 million &#32;of other real estate related securities and assets. 

&#160; 

Our Golf business includes 86 &#32;properties in the United States that we lease, own or manage. Since the acquisition of our Golf business in December 2013, we have sought to enhance the value of our Golf business by hiring a new senior management team to optimize the portfolio and focus on revenues and earnings growth. We may also be able to grow the revenues and earnings of our portfolio through new investments to upgrade, reposition and repurpose some of our properties. In addition, we believe our golf portfolio and operations are highly scalable and we could potentially grow the portfolio through acquisitions of other golf properties and related businesses. 

We report our business through the following segments: (i) debt investments financed with collateralized debt obligations (&#8220;CDOs&#8221;), (ii) other debt investments (&#8220;Other Debt&#8221;), (iii) investments in golf properties and facilities (&#8220;Golf&#8221;), and (iv) corporate.

(A) 

Assets held within non-recourse structures, including all of the assets in the CDO segment, are not available to satisfy obligations outside of such financings, except to the extent net cash flow distributions are received from such structures. Creditors or beneficial interest holders of these structures generally have no recourse to the general credit of Newcastle. Therefore, our exposure to the economic losses from such structures generally is limited to our invested equity in them, and economically their book value cannot be less than zero. Therefore, impairment recorded in excess of our investment, which results in negative equity attributable to common stockholders for a given non-recourse financing structure, cannot economically be incurred and will eventually be reversed through amortization, sales at gains, or as gains at the deconsolidation or termination of such non-recourse financing structure.

WA- Weighted average, in all tables. 

NR - Not rated, in all tables. 

(A) 

Net of impairment. 

(B) 

Credit represents the weighted average of minimum ratings for rated assets, the loan-to-value ratio (based on the appraised value at the time of purchase or refinancing) for non-rated commercial assets, or the FICO score for non-rated residential assets. Ratings provided above were determined by third party rating agencies, represent the most recent credit ratings available as of the reporting date and may not be current. 

(C) 

Weighted average life is based on the timing of expected principal reduction on the asset. 

(D) 

Represents non-consolidated CDO securities, excluding eight &#32;securities with zero value, which had an aggregate face amount of $ 116.0 million . 

(E) 

Represents an equity investment in a real estate owned property. 

(F) 

Face amount of the golf investment represents the gross carrying amount, including intangibles, and excludes accumulated depreciation and amortization. Basis amount of the golf investments represents carrying value including intangibles. 

(G) 

Our subprime mortgage loans subject to call option are excluded from the statistics because they result from an option, not an obligation, to repurchase such loans, are noneconomic until such option is exercised, and are offset by an equal liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Debt Investments 

The following table reflects the spread between the yield and the cost of financing on our portfolio of debt investments at December 31, 2015 : 

Weighted average asset yield 

8.50 

% 

Weighted average funding cost 

1.14 

% 

Net interest spread 

7.36 

% 

The net interest spread increased from 6.14% at December 31, 2014 &#32;to 7.36% &#32;at December 31, 2015 &#32;primarily due to (i) the sale and paydown of lower yielding assets, (ii) the pay down of debt obligations with higher funding costs, and (iii) the reduction in funding costs associated with the maturity of one interest rate swap and termination of two interest rate swaps during 2015 . 

The net interest spread of our portfolio of debt investments can be impacted by (i) the timing and extent of changes in the composition of our portfolio as a result of purchases and sales of assets or the repayment of debt, including our CDO debt, repurchase agreements and other bonds, and the incurrence of new debt, (ii) the yields on new investments, which vary depending on the credit quality of the issuer and (iii) changes in our estimates of the yields on securities acquired at a discount or premium for credit quality, which management assesses on a quarterly basis. For instance, the net interest spread of our debt investments increases if we sell assets with lower yields relative to other assets in our portfolio or repay debt (such as in connection with an asset sale or refinancing) that has a higher interest rate relative to other financing on our portfolio, assuming no other changes to the composition of our portfolio. Conversely, the net interest spread of our portfolio decreases if we sell assets with higher yields relative to other assets in our portfolio or repay debt (such as in connection with an asset sale) that has a lower interest rate relative to other financing on our portfolio, assuming no other changes to the composition of our portfolio. Management continually monitors market conditions to opportunistically effect purchases and sales of debt investments.

Intrawest Loan (included in the Resorts section of the table above) 

In April 2010, we made a cash investment of $75.0 million through two of our CDOs in a new loan to Intrawest Cayman L.P. and its subsidiaries (&#8220;Intrawest&#8221;), which is a portfolio company of a private equity fund managed by an affiliate of our Manager. In addition, Mr. Edens is a director of Intrawest and has an indirect ownership interest in Intrawest. Interest on the loan is accrued and deferred until maturity in 2019. As of December 31, 2013, the face amount of this investment was $185.6 million. In December 2013, we consented to a modification of the loan for our investment in order to facilitate an initial public offering of Intrawest. In January 2014, Intrawest completed a $37.5 million primary offering and a $150.0 million secondary offering. Following Intrawest&#8217;s public offerings, we received total cash of $83.3 million, which reduced the face amount of our loan to $99.4 million. In accordance with the loan agreement, as of April 24, 2015, the accrued and deferred interest rate stepped-up from 15.55% to 22.50%. As a result of the accrued and deferred interest, the face amount of the loan has increased to $141.9 million as of December 31, 2015 . 

Credit Risk Management &#8211; Debt Investments 

Credit risk refers to the ability of each individual borrower under our loans and securities to make required interest and principal payments on the scheduled due dates. We strive to reduce credit risk by actively monitoring our asset portfolio and the underlying credit quality of our holdings and, where feasible and appropriate, repositioning our investments to upgrade their credit quality and yield. A portion of our investments are financed with collateralized debt obligations, known as CDOs. Our CDO financings offer us the structural flexibility to currently sell certain investments to manage risk and, subject to certain limitations, to optimize returns. 

Further, while the expected yield on our real estate securities is sensitive to the performance of the underlying loans, the first risk of default and loss&#8211;referred to as a &#8220;first loss&#8221; position&#8211;is borne by the more subordinated securities or other features of the securitization transaction, in the case of commercial mortgage and asset backed securities, and the issuer&#8217;s underlying equity and subordinated debt, in the case of senior unsecured REIT debt securities. 

We also invest in loans and securities which represent &#8220;first loss&#8221; positions; in other words, these positions do not benefit from credit support although we believe at acquisition these positions predominantly benefit from underlying collateral value in excess of their carrying amounts. 

Golf Investments 

In December 2013, we restructured an investment in mezzanine debt issued by NGP Mezzanine, LLC (&#8220;NGP&#8221;), the indirect parent of NGP Realty Sub, L.P. (&#8220;National Golf&#8221;). National Golf owns 27 &#32;golf properties across 8 states, and leases these properties to American Golf Corporation (&#8220;American Golf&#8221;), an affiliated operating company. As of December 31, 2015 , American Golf also leased an additional 49 &#32;golf properties and managed 10 &#32;golf properties owned by third parties. As part of the transaction, we acquired the equity of NGP and American Golf&#8217;s indirect parent, AGC Mezzanine Pledge LLC (&#8220;AGC&#8221;), and therefore consolidated these entities as of December 31, 2013. We categorize our owned and leased golf properties as public or private. Set forth below is additional information about our golf properties. 

&#160; 

Public Properties. Public properties generate revenues principally through daily green fees, golf cart rentals and food, beverage and merchandise sales. Amenities at these properties generally include practice facilities and pro shops with food and beverage facilities. In some cases, our public properties have small clubhouses with banquet facilities. In addition, The Players Club is a monthly membership program offered at most of our public properties, with membership benefits ranging from daily range access to ability to participate in golf clinics, in return for a monthly membership fee. 

&#160; 

Private Properties. Private properties are open to members only and generate revenues principally through initiation fees, membership dues, guest fees, and food, beverage and merchandise sales. Amenities at these courses typically include practice facilities, full service clubhouses with a pro shop, locker room facilities and multiple food and beverage outlets, including grills, restaurants and banquet facilities. 

&#160; 

Managed Properties . Our 10 &#32;managed properties are properties that American Golf manages pursuant to a management agreement with the owner. We recognize revenue from these properties in an amount equal to the respective management fee. 

In March 2015, our Golf business entered into a lease for a 27-hole municipal golf property owned by Los Angeles County, California. The lease is for a term of 21 years and encompasses the golf course, a driving range, food and beverage facilities and a pro shop. In August 2015, the lease on a golf property in Hawaii expired and the lease was not renewed for such property. In October 2015, the owner of a managed golf property in Oregon sold it to a third party who terminated the management agreement on such property. 

The following table summarizes certain information about our golf properties as of December 31, 2015 .

Our Financing And Hedging Activities 

We employ leverage as part of our investment strategy. We do not have a predetermined target debt to equity ratio as we believe the appropriate leverage for the particular assets we are financing depends on the credit quality of those assets. As of December 31, 2015 &#32;and as of the date of this Annual Report, we have complied with the general investment guidelines adopted by our board of directors that limit total leverage. We utilize leverage for the sole purpose of financing our portfolio and not for the purpose of speculating on changes in interest rates. 

We strive to maintain access to a broad array of capital resources in an effort to insulate our business from potential fluctuations in the availability of capital. We utilize multiple forms of financing, including common and preferred stock offerings, CDOs, other securitizations, term loans, and trust preferred securities, as well as short-term financing in the form of loans and repurchase agreements. Additionally, the Manager as defined in "&#8211; The Management Agreement" may elect for us to bear a level of refinancing risk on a short-term or longer term basis, such as is the case with investments financed with repurchase agreements, when, based on all of the relevant factors, the Manager determines that bearing such risk is advisable or unavoidable. Further details regarding the forms of financing that are currently utilized are presented in Part II, Item 7. &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Liquidity and Capital Resources.&#8221; 

We attempt to reduce refinancing and interest rate risks through the use of match funded financing structures, when appropriate and available, whereby we seek (i) to match the maturities of our debt obligations with the maturities of our assets and (ii) to match 

the interest rates on our investments with like-kind debt financing (i.e., floating rate assets are financed with floating rate debt and fixed rate assets are financed with fixed rate debt), directly or through the use of interest rate swaps, interest rate caps or other financial instruments, or through a combination of these strategies. We believe this allows us to reduce the risk that we have to refinance our liabilities prior to the maturities of our assets and to reduce the impact of changing interest rates on our earnings. 

We enter into hedging transactions to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and other changes in market conditions, and we may continue to do so, when feasible and appropriate. These transactions predominantly include interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and may include the purchase or sale of To Be Announced MBS ("TBA") contracts, interest rate collars, caps or floors, options, mortgage derivatives and other hedging instruments that may be subject to margin calls. These instruments may be used to hedge as much of the interest rate risk as our Manager determines is in the best interest of our stockholders, given the cost of such hedges and the need to maintain our status as a REIT. Our Manager elects to have us bear a level of interest rate risk that could otherwise be hedged when our Manager believes, based on its analysis, that bearing such risks is advisable or unavoidable. We engage in hedging for the purpose of protecting against interest rate risk and not for the purpose of speculating on changes in interest rates. We note that new hedging transactions with respect to many types of hedging instruments may impose liquidity constraints on us or may be uneconomical for us to obtain. 

Further details regarding our hedging activities are presented in Part II, Item 7A. &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk &#8211; Interest Rate and Credit Spread Sensitive Instruments and Fair Value.&#8221;

Our Investment Guidelines 

Our investment guidelines are purposefully broad to enable us to make investments in a wide array of assets, including, but not limited to, any assets that can be held by REITs. Our investment guidelines state: 

&#8226; 

no investment is to be made which would cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT; 

&#8226; 

no investment is to be made which would cause us to be regulated as an investment company; 

&#8226; 

no more than 20% of our total equity, determined as of the date of such investment, is to be invested in any single asset; 

&#8226; 

our leverage (as defined in our governing documents) is not to exceed 90% of the sum of our total debt and our total equity; and 

&#8226; 

we are not to co-invest with the Manager or any of its affiliates unless (i) our co-investment is otherwise in accordance with these guidelines and (ii) the terms of such co-investment are at least as favorable to us as to the Manager or such affiliate (as applicable) making such co-investment. 

These investment guidelines may be changed by our board of directors without the approval of our stockholders. We do not have specific policies as to the allocation among type of real estate related assets or investment categories since our investment decisions depend on changing market conditions. Instead, we focus on relative value and in-depth risk/reward analysis. Our focus on relative value means that assets which may be unattractive under particular market conditions may, if priced appropriately to compensate for risks such as projected defaults and prepayments, become attractive relative to other available investments. We generally utilize a match funded financing strategy, when appropriate and available, and active management as part of our investment strategy. 

The Management Agreement 

We are party to an amended and restated management agreement with FIG LLC, our Manager and an affiliate of Fortress Investment Group LLC, dated April 25, 2013 (the &#8220;Management Agreement&#8221;), pursuant to which our Manager provides for a management team and other professionals who are responsible for implementing our business strategy, subject to the supervision of our board of directors. Our Manager is responsible for, among other things, (i) setting investment criteria in accordance with broad investment guidelines adopted by our board of directors, (ii) sourcing, analyzing and executing acquisitions, (iii) providing financial and accounting management services and (iv) performing other duties as specified in the Management Agreement. 

The Management Agreement provides for automatic one year extensions. Our independent directors review our Manager&#8217;s performance annually and the management agreement may be terminated annually upon the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of our independent directors, or by a vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock, based upon unsatisfactory performance that is materially detrimental to us or a determination by our independent directors that the management fee earned by our Manager is not fair, subject to our Manager&#8217;s right to prevent such a management fee compensation termination by accepting a mutually acceptable reduction of fees. Our Manager must be provided with 60 days&#8217; prior notice of any such termination and would be paid a termination fee equal to the amount of the management fee earned by our Manager during the twelve month period preceding such termination, which may make it difficult and costly for us to terminate the management agreement. Following any termination of the Management Agreement, we shall be entitled to purchase our Manager&#8217;s right to receive the Incentive Compensation at a price determined as if our assets were sold for cash at their then current fair market value (as determined by an appraisal, taking into account, among other things, the expected future value of the underlying investments) or otherwise we may continue to pay the Incentive Compensation to our Manager. In addition, if we do not purchase our Manager&#8217;s Incentive Compensation, our Manager may require us to purchase the same at the price discussed above. In addition, the Management Agreement may be terminated by us at any time for cause. 

See Note 13 to Part II, Item 8. &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; for further information related to the terms of the management agreement. 

Policies with Respect to Certain Other Activities 

Subject to the approval of our board of directors, we have the authority to offer our common stock or other equity or debt securities in exchange for property and to repurchase or otherwise reacquire our shares or any other securities and may engage in such activities in the future. 

We also may make loans to, or provide guarantees of certain obligations of, our subsidiaries. 

Subject to the percentage ownership and gross income and asset tests necessary for REIT qualification, we may invest in securities of other REITs, other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers, including for the purpose of exercising control over such entities. 

We may engage in the purchase and sale of investments. 

Our officers and directors may change any of these policies and our investment guidelines without a vote of our stockholders. 

In the event that we determine to raise additional equity capital, our board of directors has the authority, without stockholder approval (subject to certain NYSE requirements), to issue additional common stock or preferred stock in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration it deems appropriate, including in exchange for property. 

Decisions regarding the form and other characteristics of the financing for our investments are made by our Manager subject to the general investment guidelines adopted by our board of directors. 

Competition 

We operate in a highly competitive industry, and compete primarily on the basis of reputation, location and the perceived value of our product offering. Our ability to compete with other golf facilities directly affects our ability to succeed. 

In addition, we are subject to significant competition in seeking investments. We compete with other companies, including publicly traded golf and leisure companies, REITs, private equity firms and other investors including funds and companies affiliated with our Manager. Some of our competitors have greater resources than we possess, or have greater access to capital or various types of financing than are available to us, and we may not be able to compete successfully for investments or provide attractive investments returns relative to our competitors. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify opportunities or complete transactions on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that we will actually realize any targeted benefits from such acquisitions, investments or alliances. 

For more information about the competition we face generally and in our Golf business specifically, see Part I, Item 1A. &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business&#8212;We are subject to significant competition, and we may not compete successfully.&#8221; 

Government Regulation of Our Golf Business 

Our golf facilities and operations are subject to a number of environmental laws. As a result, we may be required to incur costs to comply with the requirements of these laws, such as those relating to water resources, discharges to air, water and land, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, and the cleanup of properties affected by regulated materials. Under these and other environmental requirements, we may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases from currently owned, formerly owned or operated facilities. 

Environmental laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the relevant entity knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. We may use certain substances and generate certain wastes that may be deemed hazardous or toxic under such laws, and from time to time have incurred, and in the future may incur, costs related to cleaning up contamination resulting from historic uses of certain of our current or former properties or our treatment, storage or disposal of wastes at facilities owned by others. Our facilities are also subject to risks associated with mold, asbestos and other indoor building contaminants. The costs of investigation, remediation or removal of regulated materials may be substantial, and the presence of those substances, or the failure to remediate a property properly, may impair our ability to use, transfer or obtain financing for our property. We may be required to incur costs to remediate potential environmental hazards, mitigate environmental risks in the future, or comply with other environmental requirements. 

In addition, in order to improve, upgrade or expand some of our facilities, we may be subject to environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act and, for projects in California, the California Environmental Quality Act. Both acts require that a specified government agency study any proposal for potential environmental impacts and include in its analysis various alternatives. Any improvement proposal may not be approved or may be approved with modifications that substantially increase the cost or decrease the desirability of implementing the project. 

We are also subject to regulation by the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration and similar health and safety laws in other jurisdictions. These regulations impact a number of aspects of operations, including golf course maintenance and food handling and preparation. 

The ownership and operation of our facilities subjects us to federal, state and local laws regulating zoning, land development, land use, building design and construction, and other real estate-related laws and regulations. 

Our facilities and operations are subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended by the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 (the "ADA"). The rules implementing the ADA have been further revised by the ADA Amendments Act of 2008, which included additional compliance requirements for golf facilities and recreational areas. The ADA generally requires that we remove architectural barriers when readily achievable so that our facilities are made accessible to people with disabilities. Noncompliance could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. Federal legislation or regulations may further amend the ADA to impose more stringent requirements with which we would have to comply. 

We are also subject to various local, state and federal laws, regulations and administrative practices affecting our business. For instance, we must comply with provisions regulating equal employment, minimum wages, and licensing requirements and regulations for the sale of food and alcoholic beverages. 

Taxation 

We have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;). Our current and continuing qualification as a REIT depends on our ability to meet various tax law requirements, including, among others, requirements relating to the sources of our income, the nature of our assets, the composition of our stockholders, and the timing and amount of distributions that we make. A portion of the REIT distribution requirements may be able to be satisfied through stock dividends rather than cash, subject to limitations based on the value of the stock. 

As a REIT, we will generally not be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on that portion of our income that is distributed to stockholders if we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders by prescribed dates and comply with various other requirements. We may, however, nevertheless be subject to certain state, local and foreign income and other taxes, and to U.S. federal income and excise taxes and penalties in certain situations, including taxes on our undistributed income. In addition, our stockholders may be subject to state, local or foreign taxation in various jurisdictions, including those in which they transact business or reside. The state, local and foreign tax treatment of us and our stockholders may not conform to the U.S. federal income tax treatment. Taxable income generated by our taxable REIT subsidiaries (&#8220;TRS&#8221;) is generally subject to regular corporate income tax. 

If, in any taxable year, we fail to satisfy one or more of the various tax law requirements, we could fail to qualify as a REIT. If we fail to qualify as a REIT for a particular tax year, our income in that year would be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax), and we may need to borrow funds or liquidate certain investments in order to pay the applicable tax, or we may not be able to pay it. Unless entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, we would also be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost. Moreover, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, we would be delisted from the NYSE. 

Although we currently intend to operate in a manner designed to qualify as a REIT, it is possible that economic, market, legal, tax or other developments may cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT, or may cause our board of directors to revoke the REIT election, including certain potential developments discussed in Part I, Item 1A. &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; 

Employees 

As described above under &#8220;&#8211; The Management Agreement,&#8221; we are managed by FIG LLC, an affiliate of Fortress Investment Group LLC. As a result, except in our golf operations which are discussed below, we have no employees. The employees of FIG LLC are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements. 

Golf 

As of December 31, 2015 , there were approximately 4,400 employees at our golf facilities, consisting primarily of hourly employees. Other than a small group of golf course maintenance staff at one of our clubs, our employees are not unionized. We believe we have a good working relationship with our employees, and the Golf business has not experienced interruptions as a result of labor disputes. 

Corporate Governance and Internet Address; Where Readers Can Find Additional Information 

We emphasize the importance of professional business conduct and ethics through our corporate governance initiatives. Our board of directors consists of a majority of independent directors; the Audit, Compensation and Nominating and Corporate Governance committees of our board of directors are composed exclusively of independent directors. We have adopted corporate governance guidelines, and our Manager has adopted a code of business conduct and ethics, which delineate our standards for our officers and directors, and employees of our Manager.
