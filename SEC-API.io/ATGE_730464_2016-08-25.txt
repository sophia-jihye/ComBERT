Unless indicated, or the context requires otherwise, references to years refer to DeVry Group&#8217;s fiscal years then ended. These segments are highlighted below.

&#160; 

Medical and Healthcare 

&#160; 

DeVry Medical International (&#8220;DMI&#8221;) operates three institutions:

&#183; American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine (&#8220;AUC&#8221;) confers the Doctor of Medicine (&#8220;M.D.&#8221;) degree; &#183; Ross University School of Medicine (&#8220;RUSM&#8221;) confers the M.D. degree; and &#183; Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine (&#8220;RUSVM&#8221;) confers the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (&#8220;D.V.M.&#8221;) degree. &#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Together, the three schools along with the Medical Education Readiness Program (&#8220;MERP&#8221;) and the Veterinary Preparation Program (&#8220;Vet Prep&#8221;) had 5,850 students enrolled in the May 2016 semester.

&#160;

AUC was founded in 1978 and acquired by DeVry Group in August 2011. AUC is located in the country of St. Maarten and has graduated over 6,000 physicians now licensed and practicing medicine throughout the world. The mission of AUC is to provide an excellent medical education to qualified students of diverse backgrounds. This is to be accomplished within an atmosphere of academic integrity and scholarship, which fosters the highest standards in professional ethics and competence.

&#160;

RUSM, which was founded in 1978, and acquired by DeVry Group in May 2003, is one of the world&#8217;s largest providers of medical education. RUSM is located in the Caribbean country of Dominica with the Internal Medicine Foundation program residing in Miramar, Florida. RUSM has graduated more than 12,000 physicians who practice medicine in the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico. The mission of RUSM is to prepare highly dedicated students to become effective, successful physicians. RUSM accomplishes this by focusing on imparting the knowledge, skills and values required for its students to establish a successful and satisfying career as a physician.

&#160;

AUC&#8217;s and RUSM&#8217;s respective medical education programs are comparable to the educational programs offered at U.S. medical schools. AUC&#8217;s and RUSM&#8217;s programs consist of three academic semesters per year &#8212; beginning in January, May and September &#8212; which allows students to complete their basic science instruction in less time than they would at a U.S. medical school. The programs prepare students for general medical practice and provide the foundation for postgraduate specialty training, which is primarily received in the U.S.

&#160;

Initially, AUC and RUSM students complete a program of concentrated study of medical sciences in modern classrooms and laboratories at campuses located in St. Maarten and Dominica, respectively. AUC&#8217;s program runs five semesters and RUSM&#8217;s runs either four or five-semesters (depending on the designated curriculum track). After students sit for Step 1 of the U.S. Medical Licensing Examination tm (&#8220;USMLE&#8221;), which assesses whether medical school students understand and can apply scientific concepts that are basic to the practice of medicine, they complete the remainder of their program by participating in clinical rotations under AUC and RUSM direction, and conducted at approximately 50 affiliated teaching hospitals or medical centers affiliated with accredited medical education programs in the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom.

&#160;

MERP assists prospective RUSM and AUC students in building the academic foundation they need to be successful in medical school and to achieve their goals of becoming physicians.

&#160;

RUSVM, which was founded in 1982 and acquired by DeVry Group in May 2003, is one of the largest providers of veterinary education. RUSVM is located in the country of St. Kitts and has graduated more than 4,000 veterinarians who practice principally in the U.S.

&#160;

The RUSVM program is structured to provide a veterinary education that is comparable to educational programs at U.S. veterinary schools. RUSVM students complete a seven-semester pre-clinical curriculum at a campus in St. Kitts. After completing their pre-clinical curriculum, RUSVM students enter a clinical clerkship lasting approximately 48 weeks under RUSVM direction at one of more than 20 affiliated U.S. Colleges of Veterinary Medicine as well as international affiliates in Canada, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.

&#160;

The RUSVM Vet Prep Program is designed to enhance the preclinical science knowledge and study skills that are critical to success in veterinary school. It is structured to prepare students for success at RUSVM.

&#160; 

Chamberlain College of Nursing (&#8220;Chamberlain&#8221;) , formerly Deaconess College of Nursing, was founded in 1889 and acquired by DeVry Group in 2005. Chamberlain offers programs in nursing education leading to one of four degrees: Associate Degree in Nursing (&#8220;ADN&#8221;) (no longer accepting new enrollment and available only at the Columbus, Ohio campus), Bachelor of Science in Nursing (&#8220;BSN&#8221;) degree (including both the onsite three-year BSN and the online Registered Nurse (&#8220;RN&#8221;) to BSN Degree Completion Option (&#8220;RN to BSN&#8221;)), Master of Science in Nursing (&#8220;MSN&#8221;) degree, including Family Nurse Practitioner (&#8220;FNP&#8221;), which is offered online, or the Doctor of Nursing Practice (&#8220;DNP&#8221;) degree which is also offered online. Eleven of Chamberlain&#8217;s 20 campuses are co-located with DeVry University locations, which allows for efficiencies in shared resources. Chamberlain had 25,229 students enrolled in the July 2016 term, an increase of 15.9% over the prior year.

&#160;

Chamberlain provides a nursing education experience distinguished by a high level of care for students, academic excellence, innovation and integrity. Chamberlain is committed to graduating nurses who are empowered to transform healthcare worldwide.

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Chamberlain&#8217;s degree programs integrate theoretical knowledge of general education and nursing content, psychomotor skills development and development of clinical judgment/reasoning to help students develop the education and skills necessary for a lifetime of personal and professional growth. Pre-licensure students apply theoretical knowledge through clinical training at hospitals or other healthcare facilities. Chamberlain has developed numerous partnerships with hospitals and other healthcare facilities for this purpose. In addition, Chamberlain provides robust, hands-on instruction utilizing high-fidelity human simulators and medical scenarios enacted in a simulated hospital environment.

&#160;

Chamberlain&#8217;s pre-licensure BSN degree is an onsite baccalaureate program. The BSN program enables students to complete their BSN degree in three years of full-time study as opposed to typical four-year BSN programs containing summer breaks. Students who already have achieved RN designation through a diploma or associate degree can complete their BSN degree online through Chamberlain&#8217;s RN to BSN completion program in three semesters of full-time study. The ADN program, which is currently in teach-out and is no longer accepting new students, is a six-semester year-round program offered onsite at the Columbus, Ohio, campus only.

&#160;

The online master&#8217;s degree program offers four non direct-care specialty tracks: Educator Specialty track, Executive Specialty track, Informatics Specialty track and Healthcare Policy Specialty track. These programs require 36 credit hours and are designed to be completed in approximately two years of part-time study. In September 2013, Chamberlain launched a direct-care master&#8217;s degree FNP program. This program requires 45 credit hours along with 650 lab and clinical hours and is designed to be completed in 2-1/2 years of part-time study.

&#160;

The online DNP degree program is based on the eight essentials of doctoral education outlined by the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (&#8220;AACN&#8221;). The DNP is designed for nurses seeking a terminal degree in nursing and offers an alternative to research-focused PhD programs. Chamberlain offers two DNP specialty tracks: Advanced Practice Leadership (no longer accepting new students) and Healthcare Systems Leadership (launched in January 2014). The programs require 30 to 40 credit hours along with 500 to 1,000 clinical practicum hours. The programs can be completed in five to six semesters of study.

&#160;

During calendar year 2015, Chamberlain students that completed the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX) had an overall pass rate of 82 percent, which was 5 percentage points lower than the national BSN average pass rate.

&#160;

In June 2016, Chamberlain received approval from the Illinois Board of Higher Education to offer a Masters of Public Health (&#8220;MPH&#8221;) degree. The MPH degree is designed to prepare students (nurses and non-nurses) to become public health practitioners to work with communities and populations throughout the world to promote healthy communities, and to prevent community health problems such as disease, poverty, health access disparities and violence. The coursework is interdisciplinary and draws on systems thinking knowledge and skills from a variety of disciplines. The purpose of the MPH program is to prepare graduates to become leadership change agents in working with communities to improve health outcomes at the population and community level. Pending approval from the Higher Learning Commission, Chamberlain plans to launch this program in 2017.

&#160; 

Carrington College (&#8220;Carrington&#8221;) , headquartered in Sacramento, California and formerly comprised of Apollo College, founded in 1976, and Western Career College, founded in 1967, prepares students for careers primarily in healthcare through certificate and associate degree programs at 21 locations.

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Through its CPA exam review courses, Becker served over 45,000 students in fiscal year 2016. Becker is the industry leader in providing CPA exam review services and has been preparing candidates to pass the CPA exam for over 50 years. For calendar year 2015, 68 of the 75 Elijah Watt Sells Award winners, individuals who achieved the highest cumulative scores on the CPA exam, prepared with Becker. For 2014, 53 of 59 Elijah Watt Sells Award winners prepared with Becker. Since 2005, when the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (&#8220;AICPA&#8221;) began to share national results, 90 percent or more of the exam&#8217;s top scorers have prepared with Becker.

&#160;

To better meet the demands of today&#8217;s busy professionals, Becker&#8217;s classes are offered in two formats: live and online. The online product is interactive, and offers the same instructor-led lectures and materials available in the live classroom courses. Becker provides access to online academic support with highly targeted answers to specific questions.

&#160;

Based on surveys of Becker CPA exam review course students who took the CPA exam, and published exam pass rate statistics supplied by the AICPA, Becker CPA Review students pass at twice the rate of all CPA exam candidates who did not take a Becker review course.

&#160;

Becker also offers continuing professional education and training programs in the fields of accounting, finance and project management to help individuals and organizations achieve superior performance through professional development. In addition, Becker Healthcare provides comprehensive review programs for today&#8217;s physicians in training.

&#160;

Students access these programs through a system of 60 locations in the U.S., as of June 30, 2016, as well as through DeVry University&#8217;s online delivery platform. DeVry University&#8217;s campus footprint has been reduced by 21 locations since June 30, 2015. To facilitate transfers from one DeVry University location to another without disrupting studies, our graduate and undergraduate curricula generally are consistent at all locations (with some content variations to meet local employment market and/or regulatory or accreditation requirements).

&#160;

DeVry University offers all of its graduate programs and nearly all of its undergraduate programs online, making these programs available to qualified students in most states and internationally without regard to their location or daily schedule. The majority of DeVry University&#8217;s students are non-traditional learners and/or working adults attracted by the quality, inherent flexibility and convenience of the program delivery format. Non-traditional learners are considered to be those other than recent high-school graduates. We also have many students who &#8220;mix and match&#8221; onsite and online courses to best meet their individual needs and schedules.

&#160;

DeVry University operates on a uniform academic calendar for both the undergraduate and graduate degree programs across both the onsite and online methods of educational delivery. The calendar consists of three 16-week semesters comprised of two 8-week sessions.

&#160;

Laboratory courses throughout many curricula prepare students for the workplace by integrating classroom learning with a practical, hands-on experience and applied learning activities that enhance technical skills. For some courses, laboratory activities are delivered in a specialized classroom featuring specialized equipment and software. In addition, some laboratory activities take place in a lecture-lab classroom, using computers and various software packages.

&#160;

DeVry University also invests in resources for libraries and academic support services that can assist students in any phase of their educational program. DeVry University offers undergraduate students an array of social and professional activities including student organizations closely linked to students&#8217; professional aspirations. Faculty members serve as mentors for student chapters of professional associations and sponsor a wide range of student co-curricular projects. Students are required to study practical strategies and methods for realizing success to help instill individual responsibility for learning and growth.

&#160;

Keller has a continued and sustained focus on excellence in teaching, student mastery of practical management skills and service to working adults. The curricula, like the undergraduate curricula, are subject to regular review for relevance to both students and employers. Keller offers classes in the evening, on weekends and online, which enables students to complete their degrees using whatever combination of online and onsite coursework suits their needs. To broaden the scope and appeal of its master&#8217;s degree programs, Keller has developed concentrations and graduate certificates. Many faculty members are practicing professionals who bring their expertise to the classroom, emphasizing theory and practices that will best serve students in their critical competencies in areas such as business communications, electronic commerce, technology, ethics, quality and international matters are woven throughout the curricula.

MARKET TRENDS AND COMPETITION 

&#160;

Medical and Healthcare 

&#160;

DeVry Medical International 

&#160;

AUC and RUSM compete with 145 accredited U.S. schools of medicine, 33 U.S. colleges of osteopathic medicine and approximately 40 Caribbean medical schools as well as with international medical schools recruiting U.S. students who may be eligible to receive funding from U.S. Department of Education (&#8220;ED&#8221;) Title IV programs. RUSVM competes with American Veterinary Medical Association (&#8220;AVMA&#8221;) accredited schools, of which 30 are U.S.-based, 5 are Canadian and 13 are other international veterinary schools.

&#160;

DMI&#8217;s educational institutions attract potential students for several reasons. Some applied to U.S.-based medical or veterinary schools but were not admitted or were wait-listed. Some students elected not to apply to U.S. schools because of self-perceived chances of gaining acceptance. For some students, DMI&#8217;s education institutions are their first or only choice of schools because of their commitment to and focus on quality and on practitioner-oriented teaching.

&#160;

For the 2015-2016 academic year, the Association of American Medical Colleges (&#8220;AAMC&#8221;) reported 52,550 U.S. medical school applicants, a 9.4% increase over the prior year. Of these applicants, 20,631 enrolled, a 2.9% increase over the prior year.

&#160;

For the 2015-2016 academic year, the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine Application Service (&#8220;AACOMAS&#8221;) reported 20,447 applicants to U.S. colleges of osteopathic medicine, a 13.9% increase over the prior year. The number of Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation approved seats of 6,392 increased only 3.2% over the prior year.

&#160;

For the 2015-2016 academic year, the Association of American Veterinary Medicine Colleges (&#8220;AAVMC&#8221;) received 6,667 applicants, a 1% increase over the prior year, for the 4,227 seats available at AAVMC institutional members (U.S. and international). The number of available seats increased less than 1% over the prior year.

&#160;

Medical and veterinary school applicants who were denied admission or wait-listed at U.S. schools constitute a large segment of prospective students for DMI&#8217;s educational institutions. Based upon the number of Medical College Admission Test (&#8220;MCAT&#8221;) attempts, which increased to approximately 95,000 in 2013, up from approximately 89,000 in 2012, management believes the potential market for medical school students is much larger than the denied applicant pool alone.

&#160;

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

According to the AAMC Center for Workforce Studies, in a June 2010 analysis, the demand for physicians will outpace supply by approximately 12% in 2020 and by almost 17% by 2025. There has been some recent expansion in the U.S. medical education enrollment capacity because of the growing supply/demand imbalance for medical doctors. According to an AAMC March 2014 study, medical school first-year enrollment as of the 2013-2014 academic year increased by 22% over the 2002 level. The current 145 accredited U.S. schools are projected to produce a 30% increase in enrollment by 2018-19 (over 2002 levels). Despite these increases, management believes the imbalance will continue to spur demand for medical education. Management also believes the veterinary medical education market is subject to some of the same forces.

RUSM&#8217;s residency appointments have been in virtually every medical specialty and subspecialty.

Chamberlain College of Nursing 

&#160;

Nationally, Chamberlain competes in the nursing education market which has more than 1,800 programs leading to RN licensure. These include both four-year educational institutions and two-year community colleges. For pre-licensure, Chamberlain has an advantage over many of its competitors because it offers a three-year, year-round BSN program as opposed to typical four-year BSN programs where students take the summer off. Chamberlain also has the ability to add capacity to meet demand due to its standardized program and operational efficiency. In post-licensure nursing education, there are over 600 programs offering RN to BSN programs and over 500 programs offering master&#8217;s degrees in nursing. Chamberlain has an advantage in the post-licensure market over many of its competitors because it offers eight-week sessions, with multiple start dates per year; there are no onsite coursework requirements and the programs have a shorter time to completion. Chamberlain&#8217;s FNP program is approved in 41 states and can be completed almost entirely online. 

&#160;

Nursing constitutes the largest occupation in healthcare in the U.S., with 2.7 million RNs in 2015, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that employment of RNs is expected to grow 16% from 2014 to 2024, faster than the average employment growth rate for all occupations.

&#160;

Despite the long-term need for nurses, demand has not yet produced a sufficient increase in educational capacity. According to ACCN&#8217;s report on 2015-2016 Enrollment and Graduations in Baccalaureate and Graduate Programs in Nursing, U.S. nursing schools turned away 47,341 qualified applicants from baccalaureate nursing programs in 2015 due to an insufficient number of faculty, clinical sites, classroom space, clinical preceptors and budget constraints. In addition, demand for BSN degrees is expected to be impacted by certain hospital accreditation standards of the percentage of nurses requiring this degree or higher.

Carrington College 

&#160; 

The career college segment of the postsecondary education market is highly fragmented and competitive. No single institution has a significant market share. Most students will not relocate or travel long distances to attend a career college, so competition is primarily at the local level. Competitors range from large public community colleges to professionally operated multi-campus institutions to single campus family owned institutions. In general, community colleges offer the lowest tuition prices and have the largest enrollments.

&#160;

A prospective career college student in most markets will have a choice of institutions offering similar programs. Carrington distinguishes itself by focusing primarily on healthcare programs. Carrington campuses offer students:

&#160;

&#183; A wide range of healthcare program offerings; &#183; Attractive and conveniently located facilities; &#183; Learning methodologies that blend didactic instruction with experiential laboratory exercises; &#183; Faculty that have relevant work experience; &#183; Small class sizes; &#183; High levels of service to students; and &#183; Accelerated programs with a choice of class schedules. &#160;

International and Professional Education 

&#160; 

DeVry Brasil 

&#160;

The Brazilian private postsecondary education market grew by 88% between 2003 and 2014 (online and onsite students), reaching approximately US$15 billion in revenue and enrollment of 7.8 million students in 2014, according to Hoper Educational Consulting and Ministry of Education (&#8220;MEC&#8221;). In addition, the goals defined by the Nacional Plan of Education (&#8220;NPE&#8221;) for the period from 2011 to 2020, indicate a continuing favorable scenario for the expansion of higher education in Brazil. NPE expects to increase enrollments by 50%, which would represent almost five million more higher education students in the next seven to eight years.

&#160;

Brazil has the largest private higher education market in Latin America, which until recently, was highly fragmented. Within the last several years, private equity firms and international educational groups have been investing in the country&#8217;s education institutions resulting in consolidation of the market. Private higher education institutions can be divided into three different segments:

&#160;

&#183; Mass market: fastest growing segment, with the highest regulatory risk; &#183; Superior quality market: growth is driven by gaining market share from competitors; increasing the accessibility of student financing should accelerate growth in this market; and &#183; Niche market: highly specialized, has limited growth potential. &#160;

Most DeVry Brasil institutions compete in the superior quality market. DeVry Brasil faces local competition at each location in which it operates. Nationwide there are also competitors such as: Laureate, Kroton Educacional, Anima, SER and UNIP.

&#160;

Private institutions play an important role in the Brazilian education market. According to MEC, of the 7.8 million students who were enrolled in higher education in Brazil, 75% were enrolled in private institutions. Enrollment of new students in private institutions grew by 4.5% from 2012 to 2014, compared to 1.9% growth of new students at public institutions.

&#160;

According to the Brazilian Association of Distance Learning Education, the number of jobs requiring successful completion of a competency exam grew by 45% from 2013 to 2015. There are currently approximately 12 million applicants for these positions. The number of Order of Attorneys of Brazil Exam (the equivalent of the U.S. Bar Exam) applicants has been steady at approximately 115,000 for the past two years.

&#160;

Becker Professional Education 

&#160;

Becker competes with other purveyors of exam preparation, including courses offered by colleges and universities, and courses offered by other public and private training companies. As a trusted brand, Becker typically charges more for exam preparation than its competitors.

&#160;

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

With its 50-plus year history and exceptional track record of preparing students to pass the CPA exam, Becker differentiates itself from competitors by providing:

&#160;

&#183; Extensive, continuously updated and fully integrated review and practice test materials; &#183; Experienced, highly qualified instructors for each of the areas of specialty included in the exam; &#183; Courses available in two formats, live class and online, to meet candidate needs for flexibility and control; &#183; Global presence with over 300 locations worldwide and over 1,500 partner accounting firms, societies and universities; &#183; Practice simulations and software functionality, similar to those used in the actual exam; and &#183; Newly introduced mobile apps enabling students to study anywhere. &#160;

Becker&#8217;s live and online courses provide a wider range of study alternatives than other course providers. Becker students have a high success rate on the CPA exam, passing at double the rate of non-Becker students. Some Becker students enroll after taking other review courses or studying independently without success.

&#160;

CPA exam candidates can take advantage of Becker&#8217;s CPA exam review learning approach and materials in conjunction with their DeVry University MBA, Master of Accounting and Financial Management or Master of Science in Accounting programs, earning full academic credit. These credits also may be used to fulfill the 150-hour educational requirement that most states have made a prerequisite to becoming licensed as a CPA. Extending the marketing and administrative benefits of joint operation, Becker offers classes at DeVry University locations or through online learning.

&#160;

Business, Technology and Management 

&#160; 

DeVry University 

&#160; 

In every market in which DeVry University operates, there are numerous state institutions, community colleges and independent universities. In particular, there is growing competitive pressure from online programs by private-sector, publicly-funded and independent institutions. Due to increased competition and the overall postsecondary student population decline over the last several years, DeVry University is experiencing significantly higher declines in enrollment.

&#160;

The postsecondary education market is highly fragmented and competitive. No single institution has a significant market share. According to the National Center for Education Statistics (&#8220;NCES&#8221;), there were 7,162 Title IV eligible postsecondary institutions in the U.S. as of the 2015-16 academic year, including 3,265 private, for-profit (&#8220;private-sector&#8221;) schools; 1,990 public schools (e.g. state institutions and community colleges); and 1,909 private, not-for-profit (&#8220;independent&#8221;) schools. According to NCES, in the 2014-15 academic year, there were 27.4 million students attending institutions that participate in the various financial aid programs under Title IV.

&#160;

While tuition at independent institutions is, on average, higher than tuition at DeVry University, the net price (Cost of Attendance less scholarships and grants) for the demographic served by DeVry University is often less. Publicly-supported colleges often offer similar programs at a lower tuition level because of government subsidies, tax-deductible contributions, and other financial sources not available to private-sector schools. In fact, many local community colleges offer programs similar in content to DeVry University&#8217;s associate degree programs, but at a much lower tuition. While community colleges may be viewed as competitors, they also provide DeVry University an opportunity. DeVry University has a number of articulation and transfer agreements in place with community colleges that make it easier for community college graduates to continue their education to earn a bachelor&#8217;s degree at DeVry University.

&#160;

Undergraduate Programs 

&#160;

Management believes that DeVry University&#8217;s competitive strengths in the market for undergraduate programs include:

&#160;

&#183; Career-oriented curricula developed with employer input; &#183; Faculty with relevant industry experience; &#183; Well-developed and professionally staffed undergraduate career service programs; &#183; Dedicated student service assistance throughout their programs (DeVry Care); &#183; National name recognition and market presence; &#183; Regional accreditation; &#160;

&#160; 12 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; Modern facilities and well-equipped laboratories; &#183; Flexibility and convenience with classes offered at many locations nationwide and online, utilizing connected classroom technology; &#183; Evening, weekend, and online class schedules; &#183; Year-round academic schedules that permit more flexible attendance and earlier graduation; &#183; Bachelor&#8217;s degree programs that can be completed in three years; and &#183; Small class sizes. &#160;

DeVry University has increased its competitiveness by offering many programs online and providing flexible class schedules and learning formats. Undergraduate classes at DeVry University centers generally are offered in the evening for the convenience of working adult students, but daytime classes are offered at centers in markets where there is deemed to be sufficient demand.

&#160;

Graduate Programs 

&#160;

Management believes that DeVry University&#8217;s competitive strengths in the market for graduate programs include:

&#160;

&#183; A practitioner oriented approach to education that stresses skills that employers value; &#183; A high level of service to the adult student, including flexible schedules and locations that are convenient to where many students work; &#183; The convenience of onsite teaching locations in major metropolitan areas nationwide and online; and &#183; Flexible schedules with six sessions each year that enable new students to start their program at any of the six sessions and continuing students to take a session off, if necessary, to accommodate their schedules. &#160;

Demographic information based on DeVry University&#8217;s fall term enrollment follows.

A second Advantage Academy was later started in Columbus, Ohio, followed by additional Advantage Academies with two different city school districts in Atlanta, Georgia. Students enter DeVry University&#8217;s Advantage Academy at the start of their junior year, and complete two academic years and one summer term. At the conclusion of the program, students can earn their high school diploma and an associate degree in either Network Systems Administration or Web Graphic Design. Most students go on to bachelor&#8217;s degree programs, either at DeVry University or other public or private universities. These programs have consistently reported high combined high school graduation and associate degree completion rates.

Student Admissions and Admissions Standards 

&#160;

DeVry University employs enrollment advisors who visit high schools, community colleges and military bases while conducting presentations on career choices, particularly in business and technology related fields, and on the importance of a college education.

&#160;

Many of DeVry University&#8217;s applicants are working adults who want to attend class in the evening or on weekends, recently unemployed adults seeking to improve their job skills, and students transferring to a DeVry University undergraduate program from other colleges and universities. Because a large portion of our new undergraduate students have some prior college experience, DeVry University has articulation agreements with many community colleges to facilitate the enrollment of their students seeking to transfer course credits to DeVry University.

&#160;

DeVry University&#8217;s &#8220;DeVry Works&#8221; initiative is designed to meet the education needs of corporate clients and their employees with DeVry University program offerings. A national network of account managers directs its student recruiting efforts primarily at Fortune 1000 companies, leveraging relationships with these clients through DeVry University&#8217;s career services organization.

&#160;

To be admitted to a DeVry University undergraduate program, a U.S. applicant must be a high school graduate from a DeVry University recognized institution, have a GED certificate, or hold a degree from a DeVry University approved postsecondary institution. Applicants for general admission must be at least 17 years old and complete an interview with an admissions representative. International applicants must provide documentation demonstrating the required level of prior education, satisfy the English-language proficiency requirement and meet all other admission requirements.

&#160;

All applicants must meet prescribed admission qualifications and be evaluated by DeVry University to determine admissibility and placement. Admissibility and placement criteria vary by degree program. During the admission process, applicants are required to take the DeVry University administered placement exams, which assess achievement levels and transitional study needs. ACT or SAT scores deemed appropriate for the desired program, or acceptable grades in qualifying college-level work completed at an approved postsecondary institution, may also be used to evidence admissibility and determine placement.

&#160;

After prospective students complete an application, an admissions representative contacts them through phone calls, text messages, emails, and/or invitations to location-based workshops or other events to improve the rate at which qualified applicants begin their program of study.

&#160;

To be admitted to a graduate program, applicants must hold a bachelor&#8217;s degree from a U.S. institution that is accredited by or is in candidacy status with a U.S. regional accrediting agency or selected national accrediting agencies or international institutions recognized as the equivalent, and complete an interview with an admissions representative. International applicants must hold a degree recognized to be equivalent to a U.S. baccalaureate degree, satisfy the English-language proficiency requirement and meet all other admission requirements. Applicants whose undergraduate cumulative grade point average is 2.70 or higher are eligible for admission. Applicants with a cumulative grade point average below 2.70 must achieve acceptable scores on the Graduate Management Admission Test (&#8220;GMAT&#8221;), the Graduate Record Examination (&#8220;GRE&#8221;) or the DeVry University administered placement exams. Admissions decisions are based on evaluation of a candidate&#8217;s academic credentials, entrance test scores and a personal interview.

&#160;

ACCREDITATION 

&#160;

Educational institutions and their individual programs are awarded accreditation by achieving a level of quality that entitles them to the confidence of the educational community and the public they serve. Accredited institutions are subject to periodic review by accrediting bodies to ensure continued high performance, institutional and program improvement and integrity, and to confirm that accreditation requirements continue to be satisfied. College and university administrators depend on the accredited status of an institution when evaluating transfer credit and applicants to their schools; employers rely on the accredited status of an institution when evaluating a candidate&#8217;s credentials; and parents and high school counselors look to accreditation for assurance that an institution meets quality educational standards. Moreover, in the U.S., accreditation is necessary for students to qualify for federal financial assistance, and most scholarship commissions restrict their awards to students attending accredited institutions.

&#160; &#183; &#193;REA1: License renewal in final phase, IGC score of 3 &#160; &#183; Damasio: License renewed in 2013, IGC score of 3 &#160; &#183; Faci: License renewed in 2011, IGC score of 3 &#160; &#183; Facid: License renewed in 2012, IGC score of 3 &#160; &#183; Facimp: License renewal in final phase, IGC score of 3 &#160; &#183; Fanor: License renewal in final phase, IGC score of 3 &#160; &#183; FBV: License renewal in final phase, IGC score of 3 &#160; &#183; FMF: License renewal in final phase, IGC score of 3 &#160; &#183; IBMEC &#8211; BH License renewal in final phase, IGC score of 4 &#160; &#183; IBMEC &#8211; RJ License renewed in 2015, IGC score of 4 &#160; &#183; Joao Pessoa: First license granted in 2013, no IGC score yet &#160; &#183; Metrocamp: License renewed in 2011, IGC score of 3 &#160; &#183; Ruy Barbosa: License renewal in final phase, IGC score of 3 &#160; &#183; Sao Luis: First license granted in 2014, no IGC score yet &#160; &#183; UniFavip: License renewed in 2014, IGC score of 3 &#160;

The IGC score is calculated using the average of the last three years of the &#8220; Conceito Preliminar de Curso &#8221; or &#8220;Preliminary Program Grade&#8221; (&#8220;CPC&#8221;) of the institution, weighted by the number of students. The CPC is an academic quality metric composed of:

&#160;

55% Results of the ENADE - the national end-of-program exam organized by MEC; 30% Faculty credentials and part or full time employee status; and 15% Student satisfaction. &#160;

MEC also licenses programs at each institution. The regulations are different for undergraduate and graduate programs. For undergraduate programs, MEC must grant &#8220;authorization&#8221; status before classes may commence. After a program is 50% to 75% complete, MEC auditors visit the program to grant the &#8220;permit&#8221; status, which can be automatically renewed every three years, unless the program presents a CPC below 3 within a range of 1 to 5 (with 5 being the maximum grade). Currently, DeVry Brasil has 339 authorized undergraduate programs, 68 of which possess a valid permit.

&#160;

Only programs leading to Master of Science and Doctorate degrees are regulated at the graduate level in Brazil. DeVry Brasil has one Master of Science program at FBV and that program&#8217;s permit was renewed in 2013.

DeVry University 

&#160;

DeVry University&#8217;s Fixed Tuition Promise (&#8220;FTP&#8221;) is a cohort tuition policy for matriculating students enrolled in the July 2014 through May 2017 sessions, whereby tuition rates are locked in until students graduate as long as they remain enrolled. To maintain eligibility, students may not miss more than five consecutive sessions . The FTP applies to students in all programs and all levels of study.

&#160;

Effective September 2015, DeVry University&#8217;s U.S. undergraduate tuition is $609 per credit hour for new students and the special savings when a student took seven or more credits was eliminated. If a student was enrolled before September 2015, they will still pay $365 for each credit hour in excess of seven as they are covered under the FTP. These amounts do not include the cost of books, supplies, transportation and living expenses. Based upon current tuition rates, a full-time student enrolling in the five semester undergraduate network systems administration associate degree program will pay total tuition of $39,585. A student enrolled in the eight semester undergraduate business administration bachelor&#8217;s degree program will pay total tuition of $75,516. Each semester is comprised of two eight-week sessions.

&#160;

Among four-year institutions, DeVry University&#8217;s undergraduate tuition during the 2014-2015 academic year was lower than the average tuition of independent schools and the average out-of-state (unsubsidized) tuition of public schools, but it was higher than the average in-state (taxpayer subsidized) tuition of publicly-supported institutions, according to data published in the Annual Survey of Colleges by the College Board. At four-year private schools, the average annual undergraduate tuition and fees for the 2014-2015 academic year was $31,231 at independent schools (a 3.7% increase from the prior year) and $15,230 at private-sector schools (a 1.3% increase from the previous year). The average annual undergraduate tuition and fees at four-year public schools was $9,139 for in-state (a 2.9% increase from the previous year) and $22,958 for out-of-state tuition (a 3.3% increase from the previous year).

&#160;

Effective July 2016, Keller program tuition per course is $2,298. This rate has not increased since July 2012.

&#160;

Under the Career Catalyst Scholarship, DeVry University provides scholarship awards to qualifying students. The scholarships are valued at up to a total of $20,000 per student, depending on the degree and transfer credits brought in by a student. Students qualifying for DeVry University&#8217;s Career Catalyst Scholarship are eligible to receive scholarship awards of progressive amounts over a period of three years. For example, students in their first year of a bachelor&#8217;s degree program can be awarded up to $5,000. During the second year, the available award may increase up to $7,000. For the third year, the award can increase up to $8,000.

&#160;

The Career Catalyst Scholarship discussed above and other scholarship offerings were consolidated into a new DeVry University Scholarship and Grant which was announced in February 2016 (effective for the March 2016 session). This offering is for new and readmitted undergraduate students. The merit-based award is designed to give qualified students an opportunity to be rewarded for their academic performance as they progress in their studies to graduation. Initial awards are based on a student&#8217;s incoming grade point average, with subsequent awards determined annually based on the student&#8217;s cumulative GPA. Eligible students can receive up to $25,000 in lifetime award funding for bachelor&#8217;s degree students, and up to a $12,500 lifetime award for associate degree students. Award amounts range from $1,000 to $2,500 per semester for full-time enrollment.

&#160;

If a student leaves school before completing an enrollment period, U.S. state, and Canadian provincial regulations permit schools to retain a set percentage of the total tuition received. This amount varies, but generally equals or exceeds the percentage of the term the student completes. Excess amounts are refunded to the student or the appropriate financial aid funding source.

&#160;

FINANCIAL AID AND FINANCING STUDENT EDUCATION 

&#160;

Students attending AUC, RUSM, RUSVM, Chamberlain, Carrington, DeVry Brasil and DeVry University pay for their education through a variety of sources. These sources include government-sponsored financial aid, private and university-provided scholarships, employer-provided tuition assistance, veteran&#8217;s benefits, private loans and cash payments. Students attending Becker review courses are not eligible for federal or state financial aid, but many receive partial or full tuition reimbursement from their employers. In addition, Becker&#8217;s CPA Review course can be financed through Becker under an 18-month term loan program.

&#160;

The following table summarizes DeVry Group&#8217;s cash receipts from tuition payments by fund source as a percentage of total revenue for the fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively. Final data for fiscal year 2016 is not yet available.

&#160;

&#160; &#160; Fiscal Year &#160; &#160; &#160; 2015 &#160; &#160; 2014 &#160; Funding Source: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Federal Assistance (Title IV) Program Funding (Grants and Loans) &#160; &#160; 59 % &#160; &#160; 60 % Brazil FIES Public Loan Program &#160; &#160; 2 % &#160; &#160; 3 % State Grants &#160; &#160; 1 % &#160; &#160; 1 % Private Loans &#160; &#160; 1 % &#160; &#160; 1 % Student accounts, cash payments, private scholarships, employer and military provided tuition assistance and other &#160; &#160; 37 % &#160; &#160; 35 % Total &#160; &#160; 100 % &#160; &#160; 100 % &#160;

All financial aid and assistance programs are subject to political and governmental budgetary considerations. In the U.S., the Higher Education Act (as reauthorized, &#8220;HEA&#8221;) guides the federal government&#8217;s support of postsecondary education. The HEA was last reauthorized by the U.S. Congress in July 2008, and was signed into law in August 2008. The reauthorization of the HEA automatic one year extension is scheduled to expire on September 30, 2016. Committee leadership of both the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate have begun reauthorization activities with hearings and introduction of several related bills. Existing programs and participation requirements are subject to change in this process. Among the issues that management believes may be included in the final reauthorization bill are affordability and college costs; access, persistence and completion; better information for consumers; student loan programs; accreditation and oversight; innovation; and the burden of federal regulations. Additionally, funding for student financial assistance programs may be impacted during appropriations and budget actions.

Information about Particular U.S. Government Financial Aid Programs 

&#160;

AUC, RUSM, RUSVM, Chamberlain, Carrington and DeVry University students participate in many U.S. and Canadian financial aid programs. Each of these programs is briefly described below.

&#160;

United States Federal Financial Aid Programs 

&#160;

Students in the U.S. rely on three types of ED student financial aid programs under Title IV of the HEA.

&#160;

1. Grants. Chamberlain Carrington and DeVry University undergraduate students may participate in the Federal Pell Grant and Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grant programs.

&#160;

&#183; Federal Pell Grants: These funds do not have to be repaid and are available to eligible undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need and who have not already received a baccalaureate degree. For the 2015-2016 school year, eligible students could receive Federal Pell Grants ranging from $588 to $5,775. &#160;

&#183; Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (&#8220;FSEOG&#8221;): This is a supplement to the Federal Pell Grant, and is only available to the neediest undergraduate students. Federal rules restrict the amount of FSEOG funds that may go to a single institution. The maximum individual FSEOG award is established by the institution but cannot exceed $4,000 per academic year. Educational institutions are required to supplement federal funds with a 25% matching contribution. Institutional matching contributions may be satisfied, in whole or in part, by state grants, scholarship funds (discussed below) or by externally provided scholarship grants. &#160;

2. Loans. AUC, RUSM, RUSVM, Chamberlain, Carrington and DeVry University students may participate in the Direct Subsidized, Unsubsidized and PLUS programs within the Federal Direct Loan Program. Carrington and DeVry University students may also participate in the Federal Perkins Student Loan Program.

&#160;

&#183; Direct Subsidized Loan: Awarded on the basis of student financial need, it is a low-interest loan (a portion of the interest is subsidized by the Federal government) available to undergraduate students with interest charges and principal repayment deferred until six months after a student no longer attends school on at least a half-time basis (the student is responsible for paying the interest charges during the six months after no longer attending school on at least a half-time basis for those loans with a first disbursement between July 1, 2012 and July 1, 2014). First time borrowers after July 1, 2013 are eligible for Direct Subsidized Loans only for 150% of the published length of their academic program. Loan limits per academic year range from $3,500 for students in their first academic year to $5,500 for students in their third or higher undergraduate academic year. &#160;

&#183; Direct Unsubsidized Loan: A warded to students who do not meet the needs test or as an additional supplement to the Direct Subsidized Loan. These loans incur interest from the time funds are disbursed, but actual principal and interest payments may be deferred until six months after a student no longer attends school on at least a half-time basis. Unsubsidized Loan limits per academic year range from $6,000 for students in their first and second academic year to $7,000 in later years and increasing to $20,500 per academic year for graduate and professional program students. Additionally, a student without financial need may borrow an additional amount of Unsubsidized Loans up to the limit of the Direct Subsidized Loan at their respective academic grade level. The total Direct Loan aggregate borrowing limit for undergraduate students is $57,500 and $138,500 for graduate students, which is inclusive of Direct Subsidized Loan amounts borrowed as an undergraduate. &#160;

&#183; PLUS and Grad PLUS Loans : Enables a graduate student or parents of a dependent undergraduate student to borrow additional funds to meet the cost of the student&#8217;s education. These loans are not based on financial need, nor are they subsidized. Interest begins to accrue, and repayment obligations begin, immediately after the loan is fully disbursed, but may be deferred until a student no longer attends school on at least a half-time basis. Graduate students and parents may borrow funds up to the cost of attendance which includes allowances for tuition, fees and living expenses. Both PLUS and Grad PLUS are subject to credit approval, which generally requires the borrower to be free of any current adverse credit conditions. A co-borrower may be used to meet the credit requirements. &#160;

&#160; 22 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; Federal Perkins Loan: A low-interest loan available only to those students who demonstrate exceptional financial need with interest and principal repayment deferred until nine months after a student no longer attends school on at least a half-time basis. The maximum Federal Perkins Loan amount is established by the institution, but cannot exceed $5,500 per award year. Ongoing funding for this program is provided from collections on loans issued in previous years. When students repay principal and interest on these loans, that money goes to the pool of funds available for future loans to students at the same institution. The authorization of the Federal Perkins Loan Program is made separate in the HEA from the Direct Loan Programs and is scheduled to expire on September 30, 2017. &#160;

3. Federal Work-study. This program offers work opportunities, both on or off campus, on a part-time basis to students who demonstrate financial need. Federal Work-study wages are paid partly from federal funds and partly from qualified employer funds.

&#160;

State Financial Aid Programs 

&#160;

Certain states, including Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island, offer state grant and loan assistance to eligible undergraduate students attending DeVry Group institutions.

&#160;

Canadian Government Financial Aid Programs 

&#160;

Canadian citizens or permanent residents of Canada (other than students from the Northwest Territories, Nunavet or Quebec) are eligible for loans under the Canada Student Loans Program, which is financed by the Canadian government. Eligibility and amount of funding vary by province. Students attending AUC, RUSM, RUSVM or DeVry University online in the U.S. may be eligible for the Canada Student Loan Program. The loans are interest-free while the student is in school, and repayment begins six months after the student leaves school. Qualified students also may benefit from Canada Study Grants (designed for students whose financial needs and special circumstances cannot otherwise be met), tax-free withdrawals from retirement savings plans, tax-free education savings plans, loan repayment extensions and interest relief on loans.

&#160; 

Information about Other Financial Aid Programs 

&#160; 

Private Loan Programs 

&#160; 

Some AUC, RUSM, RUSVM, Chamberlain, Carrington and DeVry University students rely on private (non-federal) loan programs for financial assistance. These programs are used to finance the gap between a student&#8217;s educational and living costs and their financial aid awards. The amount of the typical loan varies significantly according to the student&#8217;s enrollment and financial aid awards. DeVry Group estimates that approximately one-half of the borrowings under private loan programs are used by students to pay for non-educational expenses, such as room and board.

&#160;

Most private loans are approved using the student&#8217;s or a co-borrower&#8217;s credit history. The cost of these loans varies, but in almost all cases will be more costly than the federal programs. The application process is separate from the traditional financial aid process. Student finance personnel at DeVry Group&#8217;s degree-granting institutions coordinate these processes so that students generally receive assistance from the federal and state programs before utilizing private loans.

&#160;

DeVry Group does not maintain a preferred lender list, but does list all of the lenders that made private loans to DeVry Group students in the previous year and still offer loans to DeVry Group students.

&#160; 

Tax-favored Programs 

&#160;

The U.S. has a number of tax-favored programs aimed at promoting savings for future college expenses. These include state-sponsored &#8220;529&#8221; college savings plans, state-sponsored prepaid tuition plans, education savings accounts (formerly known as education IRAs), custodial accounts for minors, Hope and Lifetime Learning credits and tax deductions for interest on student loans.

&#160; 

&#160; 23 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Brazilian Government Financial Aid Programs 

&#160; 

DeVry Brasil students are eligible for loans under Brazil&#8217;s FIES public loan program (&#8220; Fundo de Financiamento Estudantil &#8221; or &#8220;Students Financing Fund&#8221;), which is financed by the Brazilian government. DeVry Brasil also participates in PROUNI (&#8220; Programa Universidade para Todos &#8221; or &#8220;University for All Program&#8221;), a Brazilian governmental program which provides federal tax incentives to educational institutions in exchange for providing scholarships to lower income undergraduate students.

&#160;

FIES targets students from low socio-economic backgrounds enrolled at private postsecondary institutions. Eligible students receive loans with below market interest rates that are required to be repaid after an 18-month grace period upon graduation. FIES pays participating educational institutions tax credits which can be used to pay certain federal taxes and social contributions. FIES repurchases excess credits for cash. FIES deducts from periodic payments to DeVry Brasil an average amount of 5.81% to cover administrative expenses (5.63%) and student defaults (0.18%). There is no additional cost to DeVry Brasil if students fail to pay their loans under the applicable rules. In fiscal year 2016, approximately 31% of DeVry Brasil&#8217;s degree-seeking students were financing their education under the FIES program, and approximately 29% of DeVry Brasil revenue was associated with the program.

&#160;

PROUNI promotes the offering of tuition discounts in private postsecondary education schools by granting federal tax incentives for the participating institutions. Discounts reduce tuition by either 50% or 100%. The percentage is driven by rules defined by the Brazilian government based on family monthly earnings. Neither DeVry Brasil nor its students receive direct funding from the federal government for the tuition discounts granted. Instead, DeVry Brasil reduces its income tax expense and its income tax liability for the amount of the discounts issued. As of June 30, 2016, approximately 11% of DeVry Brasil&#8217;s students have obtained scholarships under the PROUNI program.

&#160;

Specialized staff at DeVry Brasil review, interpret and establish procedures for compliance with regulations related to FIES and PROUNI. Both programs are required to be managed in accordance with government standards. Any regulatory violation can be the basis for disciplinary action, including suspension, limitation or termination of rights under the financial assistance program.

&#160;

In addition to the requirements that educational institutions must meet, student recipients of FIES and PROUNI must maintain satisfactory academic progress towards completion of their programs of study and an appropriate grade point average every semester.

&#160;

During fiscal year 2015, the Brazilian postsecondary education sector experienced significant funding changes. Government financial aid initiatives have impacted enrollment growth trends. The Brazilian government has stated that it is supportive of the FIES program, which is important in helping achieve the national goal of increasing the number of college graduates; however, changes enacted in calendar year 2015 to the FIES regulations have added restrictions limiting student eligibility for FIES funding and extended the government&#8217;s time to disburse funding to participating institutions. These changes include reducing the number of new FIES contracts, decreasing the monthly maximum family income limits that students&#8217; families must not exceed to qualify for a FIES loan, and adding minimum required entrance test scores in order to qualify for a FIES loan. Many educational groups and private institutions have experienced a decline in new student enrollment as a result of the new FIES regulations. In addition, the annual interest rate borrowers are charged increased from 3.4% to 6.5%. In 2016, the Brazilian government increased the maximum family income limits that students&#180; families must not exceed to qualify for loans from 2.5 to 3 times the minimum wage. This increased the population that qualifies for these FIES loans.

&#160; 

DeVry Group-Provided Financial Assistance 

&#160; 

DeVry University undergraduate students are eligible for numerous DeVry Group-sponsored scholarships. Scholarship programs generally are designed to attract recent high school graduates and students enrolled at community colleges, with awards that range from $500 to $2,667 per term. DeVry University has also provided funds in the form of institutional grants to help those students most in need of financial assistance.

&#160;

&#160; 24 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

DeVry Group&#8217;s institutional loan programs are available to students at its AUC, RUSM, RUSVM, Chamberlain, Carrington and DeVry University institutions. These loan programs are designed to assist students who are unable to completely cover educational costs by other means. These loans may be used for tuition, books and fees and are available only after all other student financial assistance has been applied toward those purposes. In addition, AUC, RUSM and RUSVM loans may be used for students&#8217; living expenses. Interest charges accrue each month on the unpaid balance. Chamberlain, Carrington and DeVry University require that students begin repaying loans while they are still in school with a minimum payment level designed to prove their capability to repay and reduce the possibility of over borrowing and targeted to minimize interest being accrued on the loan balance. Payments may increase upon completing or departing the program. After a student leaves school, the student typically will have a monthly installment repayment plan. In addition, the Becker CPA Review Course can be financed through Becker with an 18-month term loan program.

&#160;

The institutional loans do not impose any origination fees, in general have a fixed rate of interest and most carry annual and aggregate maximums that ensure that they are only a supplemental source of funding and not relied on as the main source. Borrowers must be current in their payments in order to be eligible for subsequent disbursements. Borrowers are advised about the terms of the loans and counseled to utilize all federal funding options.

&#160;

DeVry Group institutional loans are carried on our balance sheet and there are no relationships with external parties that shift the risk away from DeVry Group.

&#160;

Employer-Provided Tuition Assistance 

&#160;

Chamberlain and DeVry University students who receive employer tuition assistance may choose from several deferred tuition payment plans. Students eligible for tuition reimbursement plans may have their tuition billed directly to their employers or payment may be deferred until after the end of the session. Educational expenses paid by an employer on behalf of an employee generally are excludable from the employee&#8217;s income if provided under a qualified educational assistance plan. At present, the maximum annual exclusion is $5,250.

&#160; 

Becker Professional Education 

&#160;

Students taking the Becker Review courses are not eligible for federal or state financial aid, but many receive partial or full tuition reimbursement from their employers. Private loans are also available to students to help meet the program costs. In addition, Becker&#8217;s CPA Review course can be financed through Becker under an 18-month term loan program.

&#160;

LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS 

&#160;

Extensive and complex regulations govern all government grant, loan and work study programs in which AUC, RUSM, RUSVM, Chamberlain, Carrington, DeVry Brasil, DeVry University and their respective students participate. DeVry Group must comply with many rules and standards. Like all other educational institutions, DeVry Group&#8217;s administration of these programs is regularly reviewed by various regulatory agencies and is subject to audit or investigation by other governmental authorities. Any violation could be the basis for penalties or other disciplinary action, including the suspension, limitation or termination of an institution&#8217;s eligibility to participate in financial aid programs.

&#160;

U.S. Federal Regulations 

&#160;

Our domestic postsecondary institutions are subject to extensive federal and state regulations. The HEA and the related ED regulations govern all higher education institutions participating in Title IV programs, and provide for a regulatory triad by mandating specific regulatory responsibilities for each of the following:

&#160;

&#183; The federal government through ED; &#183; The accrediting agencies recognized by ED; and &#183; State higher education regulatory bodies. &#160;

To be eligible to participate in Title IV programs, a postsecondary institution must be accredited by an accrediting body recognized by ED, must comply with the HEA and all applicable regulations thereunder, and must be authorized to operate by the appropriate postsecondary regulatory authority in each state in which the institution operates, as applicable.

&#160;

&#160; 25 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In addition to governance by the regulatory triad, there has been substantial and continuing increased focus in recent years by members of the U.S. Congress and federal agencies, including ED, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission (&#8220;FTC&#8221;), on the role that proprietary educational institutions play in higher education. Congressional hearings and roundtable discussions have been held regarding various aspects of the education industry, and reports have been issued that are highly critical of proprietary institutions and include a number of recommendations to be considered by Congress in connection with the upcoming reauthorization of the HEA. In addition, in October 2014, ED formed an inter-agency task force involving multiple federal agencies and departments including the FTC, the U.S. Departments of Justice, Treasury and Veterans Affairs, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the SEC, and numerous state attorneys general, to coordinate activities and share information to protect students from unfair, deceptive and abusive acts and practices. In February 2016, ED established a Student Aid Enforcement Unit with four divisions. The Investigations Group will work to identify misconduct by schools. The Borrower Defense Group will provide legal analysis, support and advice on borrower defense claims. According to an ED press call on February 8, 2016, the Borrower Defense Group will also analyze claims to make determinations of injury, investigate institutions in connection with borrower defense claims and coordinate with federal and state agencies regarding those claims. The Administrative Actions and Appeals Service Group (AAASG) will impose administrative actions against schools. The Clery Group will oversee institutional compliance with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Statistics Act. We expect that this challenging regulatory environment will continue for the foreseeable future.

&#160;

Changes in or new interpretations of applicable laws, rules, or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, accreditation, authorization to operate in various states, permissible activities, and operating costs. The failure to maintain or renew any required regulatory approvals, accreditation, or state authorizations could have a material adverse effect on us. ED regulations regarding financial responsibility provide that, if any one of our Title IV-eligible institutions is unable to pay its obligations under its program participation agreement as a result of operational issues and/or an enforcement action, our other Title IV institutions, regardless of their compliance with applicable laws and regulations, would not be able to maintain their Title IV eligibility without assisting in the repayment of the first institution&#8217;s Title IV obligations. As a result, even though DeVry Group&#8217;s Title IV institutions are operated through independent entities, an enforcement action against one of our institutions could also have a material adverse effect on the businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of DeVry Group&#8217;s other institutions and DeVry Group as a whole and could result in the imposition of significant restrictions on the ability for DeVry Group&#8217;s other institutions and for DeVry Group as a whole to operate. For further information, see &#8220; A bankruptcy filing by us or by any of our Title IV institutions, or a closure of one of our Title IV institutions, would lead to an immediate loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs &#8221; under subsection &#8220;Risks Related to DeVry Group&#8217;s Highly Regulated Industry&#8221; in Part I, &#8220;Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors&#8221; of this Form 10-K.

&#160;

We have summarized the most significant regulatory requirements applicable to our domestic postsecondary operations. DeVry Group and DeVry University have been significantly impacted by these regulations and enforcement efforts and are currently facing multiple and related investigations and lawsuits arising from the enhanced scrutiny facing the proprietary education sector. For information regarding such pending investigations and litigation, and the potential impact such matters could have on our institutions or on DeVry Group, see in this Form 10-K: (1) &#8220;Note 14: Commitments and Contingencies&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, (2) the subsection of &#8220;Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors&#8221; entitled &#8220;Risks Related to DeVry Group&#8217;s Highly Regulated Industry,&#8221; and (3) the subsection of &#8220;Item 7 &#8211; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; entitled &#8220;Liquidity and Capital Resources.&#8221;

&#160;

Eligibility and Certification Procedures 

&#160;

The HEA specifies the manner in which ED reviews institutions for eligibility and certification to participate in Title IV programs. Every educational institution participating in the Title IV programs must be certified to participate and is required to periodically renew this certification. Institutions that violate certain ED Title IV regulations, including its financial responsibility and administrative capability regulations, may lose their eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or may only continue participation under provisional certification. Schools that do not meet financial responsibility requirements are required to submit a letter of credit equal to at least 10 percent of its prior fiscal year Title IV disbursements and submit to ED&#8217;s heightened cash monitoring process. Provisional certification status carries fewer due process protections than full certification. As a result, ED may withdraw an institution&#8217;s provisional certification more easily than if it is fully certified.

&#160;

Defense to Repayment Regulations 

&#160;

Under the HEA, ED is authorized to specify in regulations which acts or omissions of an institution of higher education a borrower may assert as a defense to repayment of a loan made under the Federal Direct Loan Program. On June 16, 2016, ED published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking concerning these defenses and other matters, including certain circumstances under which ED may impose a fine, or limit, suspend, or terminate an institution&#8217;s participation in Title IV programs (&#8220;Defense to Repayment Regulations&#8221;). ED&#8217;s current regulations permit a borrower to assert a borrower defense to repayment of a Direct Loan if the institution&#8217;s acts or omissions give rise to a cause of action against the institution under state law. The proposed regulations create a new federal standard for borrower defenses to repayment of Direct Loans, new limitation periods for such claims, and new processes for resolution of such claims. Under the proposed regulations, for Direct Loans first disbursed prior to July 1, 2017, ED would consider a borrower defense claim in accordance with the existing provisions, i.e., whether the institution&#8217;s acts or omissions give rise to a cause of action against the institution under state law. For Direct Loans first disbursed on or after July 1, 2017, a borrower could assert a defense to repayment based on one of three types of claims:

&#160;

&#160; 26 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; Breach of contract, if the institution failed to perform its obligations under the terms of a contract with the student; &#183; Substantial misrepresentation, if the institution or its agents made a substantial misrepresentation on which the borrower reasonably relied when the borrower decided to attend or to continue attending the institution; or &#183; Judgment against the institution, if a governmental agency or the borrower as an individual or a member of a class obtained a non-default favorable judgment against the institution before a court or administrative agency for matters related to the making of a loan. &#160;

The proposed regulations would amend the definition of &#8220;misrepresentation&#8221; to include omissions of information and to include statements with a likelihood or tendency to mislead under the circumstances. This definition would be adopted for purposes of the borrower defenses under the new regulation and for purposes of ED&#8217;s substantial misrepresentation regulations for which ED may impose a fine, or limit, suspend, or terminate an institution&#8217;s participation in Title IV programs.

&#160;

Under the proposed rules, a borrower asserting breach of contract would be able to assert a defense to repayment of amounts owed to the government at any time after the institution&#8217;s breach and would be able to assert a right to recover amounts the government previously collected for a period not later than six years after the breach. A borrower asserting substantial misrepresentation would be able to assert a defense to repayment of amounts owed to the government at any time and would be able to assert a right to recover amounts the government previously collected not later than six years after the borrower discovers, or reasonably could have discovered, the information constituting the substantial misrepresentation. A borrower would be able to assert a defense to repayment or right to recover previously collected amounts based on a judgment against the institution at any time.

&#160;

The proposed regulations would set forth two sets of procedures for borrower defense claims, one for individual borrowers and one for groups of borrowers identified by ED. For claims filed by individual borrowers, at the conclusion of a fact-finding process, ED would issue a final decision as to the merit of the claims and any relief granted to the borrower. ED would be able to initiate a separate proceeding to collect from the institution the amount of relief granted to the borrower. The group process would allow ED to identify a group of borrowers with common borrower defense claims based on individual claims filed or other sources. After a hearing concerning a group claim, ED would collect from the institution any liability assessed against the institution for relief granted to the borrowers.

&#160;

The proposed regulations would also modify ED&#8217;s financial responsibility standards to provide that an institution (other than a public institution) is not able to meet its financial or administrative obligations, and is therefore not financially responsible, if it is subject to one or more triggering events, in some cases during specified periods of time (e.g., during the current award year or during any of the three most recently completed award years), including if the institution:

&#160;

&#183; Is a defendant in certain lawsuits and other actions that have resulted in or could result in liability or monetary damages above a certain amount; &#183; Is required to pay a liability to or settles certain suits brought by a state, federal, or other oversight agency; &#183; Is required to repay ED for losses from borrower defense claims in an amount that exceeds a certain threshold; &#183; Is required by its accrediting agency to submit a teach-out plan based on a location or school closure and for certain reasons or was placed on probation, issued a show-cause order, or placed on similar accreditation status; &#183; Violates a provision in or defaults on a loan agreement with its creditor with the largest secured extension of credit to the institution; &#183; Fails in the previous fiscal year the 90/10 non-Title IV revenue requirement; &#183; Receives certain warnings from the SEC, discloses or is required to disclose certain judicial or administrative proceedings, or fails to file timely required reports; &#183; Enrolls in gainful employment programs deemed &#8220;failing&#8221; or &#8220;in the zone&#8221; greater than 50% of all Title IV recipients enrolled in gainful employment programs at the institution; &#183; Has a composite score of less than 1.5 and has a withdrawal of owner&#8217;s equity by any means, including by declaring a dividend, with certain exceptions; or &#183; Has a cohort default rate of 30% or greater for each of the two most recent official calculations. &#160;

&#160; 27 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In addition, under the proposed regulations, ED may determine that other events or conditions are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the institution and may at its discretion determine that an institution is not financially responsible on the basis of such &#8220;discretionary trigger&#8221; events, which include:

&#160;

&#183; Significant fluctuation in the amount of Title IV funds received by the institution; &#183; Citation by a state agency or authorizing agency for failing requirements; &#183; Failure of a financial stress test developed by ED; &#183; A non-investment grade bond or credit rating for the institution or its corporate parent; &#183; High annual dropout rates, as calculated by ED; and &#183; Any adverse event reported by the institution on a Form 8-K. &#160;

If ED determines that an institution is not financially responsible because of one or more triggering events, the institution would be required to provide an irrevocable letter of credit in connection with each triggering event equal to, in most cases, at least 10 percent of the amount of federal student financial aid funds received by the institution for the past year. An institution with multiple triggering events would be required to post cumulative letters of credit. An institution that is required to provide a letter of credit would also be required to disclose to students information about the letter of credit. While the scope of the final regulations remains unclear, given the significant uncertainties in the regulations and the latitude provided to ED, it is possible that the final regulations may create significant liability or cause us to have to post a significant letter of credit that could have a material adverse effect on our business.

&#160;

In addition to the disclosure to students about the institution&#8217;s letter of credit obligations, the proposed regulations include a loan repayment warning requirement applicable solely to proprietary institutions. If a proprietary institution has a loan repayment rate that is less than or equal to zero during any fiscal year, it would be required to deliver a warning to prospective and enrolled students and also to place a warning on its website, its promotional materials, and its advertisements. Under the proposed regulations, an institution will have a loan repayment rate less than or equal to zero if the median in the population of borrowers has not paid down any of his or her loan balance within five years after leaving school.

&#160;

The proposed regulations also would require schools to provide additional information to students regarding their right to obtain a closed school discharge in the circumstance of a closing school or location, and would provide for automatic discharges in certain situations. The disclosure provided to students would explain the benefits and consequences of obtaining a discharge if the school or location they are attending is scheduled to close, as compared to completing the program through a teach-out arrangement with another school. Under the proposed regulations, ED would also automatically grant a closed school discharge to borrowers attending a closed school or location who did not subsequently re-enroll in any Title IV eligible institution within three years after the date the school or location closed. DeVry Group&#8217;s institutions regularly provide for the initiation and orderly closure of locations consistent with student demand.

&#160;

Lastly, the HEA currently provides for the discharge of a borrower&#8217;s loan if the student&#8217;s eligibility to borrow was falsely certified by the school. The proposed regulations update the rules regarding false certification and the procedures for applying for a false certification discharge.

&#160;

We have submitted a comment letter on the regulations to ED.

&#160;

The effective date of any final regulations cannot be determined at this time, but final regulations promulgated by November 1, 2016 would likely become effective July 1, 2017. We are unable to predict what such final regulations may contain, the result of any other current or future rulemakings, or the impact of such rulemakings on our business. In addition to the outcome from any legal proceeding instituted by a private party or governmental authority, facts asserted in pending or future lawsuits or the outcome of any pending or future governmental inquiry, lawsuit or enforcement action described in this Form 10-K in (1) &#8220;Note 14: Commitments and Contingencies&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements within &#8220;Item 8 &#8211; Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; and (2) the subsection of &#8220;Item 7 &#8211; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; entitled &#8220;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8221; could serve as the basis for individual borrowers or by ED on behalf of a group of borrowers under the Defense to Repayment Regulations, the posting of substantial letters of credit, or the termination of eligibility of one of our institutions to participate in the Title IV program based on ED&#8217;s institutional capability assessment, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operations and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate.

&#160;

Gainful Employment 

&#160;

To be eligible for Title IV funding, most academic programs offered by private-sector institutions of higher education must prepare students for gainful employment (&#8220;GE&#8221;) in a recognized occupation, as determined in accordance with new regulations that became effective on July 1, 2015.

&#160;

&#160; 28 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The new GE regulations establish a framework with three components: 

&#160;

Certification: Institutions must certify that each of their GE programs meet state licensure and accreditation requirements and satisfy applicable educational prerequisites for professional licensure and certification.

&#160;

Accountability Measures: To maintain Title IV eligibility, GE programs must meet minimum standards for limiting the debt burden versus the earnings of their graduates. GE programs will be considered passing, in the zone, or failing for each year in which the accountability measures are calculated, described as follows:

&#160;

Pass: Programs whose graduates have an assumed annual loan repayment burden of 8% or less of total earnings or 20% or less of discretionary income.

&#160;

Zone: Programs that are not passing and whose graduates have an assumed annual loan repayment burden greater than 8% and less than or equal to 12% of total earnings or greater than 20% and less than or equal to 30% of discretionary income.

&#160;

Fail: Programs whose graduates have an assumed annual loan repayment burden greater than 12% of total earnings and greater than 30% of discretionary income.

&#160;

Programs that fail in two out of any three consecutive years or do not pass in any four consecutive years will be disqualified from participation in the Title IV programs for a period of three years, and an institution is prohibited from establishing Title IV eligibility for any substantially similar program during that period.

&#160;

Transparency: Institutions are required to make public disclosures regarding the performance and outcomes of their GE programs. The disclosures include information regarding program costs, median debt of all graduates and completion and placement rates and may include additional disclosure items beginning in 2017.

&#160;

The accountability measures will typically weigh a calculated debt burden from graduates who completed their studies three and four years prior to the measuring academic year against the mean or median earnings of these graduates during the most recent calendar year prior to the conclusion of the measuring academic year. Thus for the 2014-2015 academic year (the first measurement year under these regulations), the cohort will include graduates from the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 academic years and earnings for these graduates from calendar year 2014. Graduate earnings data will be obtained by ED directly from the Social Security Administration and are not available to us at this time. Debt burdens for students enrolled in programs that require an internship or residency prior to licensure, such as the medical doctor degrees offered by AUC and RUSM, are calculated from cohorts who completed their studies six and seven years prior to the measuring academic year. Management expects draft measures for the 2014-2015 academic year to be released to the institutions in late 2016 or early 2017 and final measures to be released publicly in early 2017.

&#160;

Because the information necessary to determine how our programs will fare under the accountability measures is not available at this time, we are unable to fully predict accurately the impact of the GE regulations&#8217; accountability measures. The regulations contemplate a transition period in the first several years to afford institutions the opportunity to make changes to their programs and retain Title IV eligibility. We are using currently-available data to evaluate whether certain of our programs are at risk to fail the new requirements, or fall into the zone, and concurrently evaluating available options to bring at-risk programs into compliance.

&#160;

Under this framework, we believe that less than 10% of the 2015-2016 academic year programs across Carrington and DeVry University are at risk of falling into the failing category. In addition, there are a number of programs that are at risk of falling into the zone category, including the RUSVM&#8217;s veterinary medicine program. Institutions will be required to provide warnings to enrolled and prospective students with respect to GE programs considered under the regulations to be in jeopardy of losing Title IV eligibility. Management expects that certain programs will be able to avoid falling into the zone or failing categories through adjustments to program price, including through scholarships, or, if appropriate and consistent with programmatic standards, the duration of programs. For programs where such adjustments are not feasible, which may include RUSVM&#8217;s veterinary medicine program, we may discontinue such programs or seek to establish relationships with third-party lenders to support student tuition and other expenses. These adjustments, or any requirement to issue warnings to enrolled and prospective students, could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate.

&#160; 29 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#8220;90/10 Rule&#8221; 

&#160;

An ED regulation known as the &#8220;90/10 Rule&#8221; affects only proprietary postsecondary institutions, such as AUC, RUSM, RUSVM, Chamberlain, Carrington and DeVry University. Under this regulation, an institution that derives more than 90% of its revenue on a cash basis from Title IV student financial assistance programs in two consecutive years loses eligibility to participate in these programs for at least two fiscal years. The following table details the percentage of revenue on a cash basis from federal financial assistance programs for each of DeVry Group&#8217;s Title IV eligible institutions for fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively. Final data for fiscal year 2016 is not yet available.

&#160;

&#160; &#160; Fiscal Year &#160; &#160; &#160; 2015 &#160; &#160; 2014 &#160; American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine &#160; &#160; 80 % &#160; &#160; 81 % Ross University School of Medicine &#160; &#160; 80 % &#160; &#160; 80 % Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine &#160; &#160; 84 % &#160; &#160; 85 % Chamberlain College of Nursing &#160; &#160; 65 % &#160; &#160; 65 % Carrington College: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; California &#160; &#160; 76 % &#160; &#160; 77 % Boise &#160; &#160; 70 % &#160; &#160; 72 % Portland &#160; &#160; 76 % &#160; &#160; 74 % Phoenix &#160; &#160; 80 % &#160; &#160; 80 % DeVry University: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Undergraduate &#160; &#160; (1 ) &#160; &#160; 68 % Graduate &#160; &#160; (1 ) &#160; &#160; 67 % Total &#160; &#160; 66 % &#160; &#160; 68 % &#160; 

(1) During fiscal year 2015, DeVry University undergraduate and Keller Graduate School of Management began reporting under one Office of Postsecondary Education identification number (OPEID). As a result, there is no Undergraduate and Graduate breakout for DeVry University for fiscal year 2015 data. &#160;

Incentive Compensation 

&#160;

An educational institution participating in Title IV programs may not pay any commission, bonus or other incentive payments to any person involved in student recruitment or admissions or awarding of Title IV program funds, if such payments are based directly or indirectly in any part on success in enrolling students or obtaining student financial aid. The law and regulations governing this requirement never established clear criteria for compliance in all circumstances, but, prior to 2011, there were 12 safe harbors that defined specific types of compensation that were deemed to constitute permissible incentive compensation. The new rules effective in 2011 eliminated the 12 safe harbors. These changes increase the uncertainty about what constitutes incentive compensation and which employees are covered by the regulation. This makes the development of effective and compliant performance metrics more difficult to establish. As such, these changes limit DeVry Group&#8217;s ability to compensate our employees based on their performance of their job responsibilities, which could make it more difficult to attract and retain highly-qualified employees. Management believes that DeVry Group has not been, nor is currently, involved in any activities that violate the restrictions on commissions, bonuses or other incentive payments to recruiters.

&#160;

Standards of Financial Responsibility 

&#160;

A separate financial responsibility test for continued participation by an institution&#8217;s students in U.S. federal financial assistance programs, which pre-dates the program integrity regulations, is based upon a composite score of three ratios: an equity ratio that measures the institution&#8217;s capital resources; a primary reserve ratio that measures an institution&#8217;s ability to fund its operations from current resources; and a net income ratio that measures an institution&#8217;s ability to operate profitably. A minimum score of 1.5 is necessary to meet ED&#8217;s financial standards. Institutions with scores of less than 1.5 but greater than or equal to 1.0 are considered financially responsible, but require additional oversight. These schools are subject to cash monitoring and other participation requirements. An institution with a score less than 1.0 is considered not financially responsible. However, a school with a score less than 1.0 may continue to participate in the Title IV programs under provisional certification. In addition, this lower score typically requires that the school be subject to cash monitoring requirements and post a letter of credit (equal to a minimum of 10 percent of the Title IV aid it received in the institution's most recent fiscal year).

&#160;

&#160; 30 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

For the past several years, DeVry Group&#8217;s composite score has exceeded the required minimum of 1.5. Management believes it will continue to demonstrate the required level of financial stability. If DeVry Group were unable to meet requisite financial responsibility standards or otherwise demonstrate, within the regulations, its ability to continue to provide educational services, then DeVry Group could be subject to heightened cash monitoring or required to post a letter of credit to enable its students to continue to participate in federal financial assistance programs under provisional certification.

&#160;

Administrative Capability 

&#160;

The HEA directs ED to assess the administrative capability of each institution to participate in Title IV programs. The failure of an institution to satisfy any of the criteria used to assess administrative capability may cause ED to determine that the institution lacks administrative capability and, therefore, subject the institution to additional scrutiny or deny eligibility for Title IV programs.

&#160;

State Authorization 

&#160;

Institutions that participate in Title IV programs must be authorized to operate by the appropriate postsecondary regulatory authority in each state where the institution has a physical presence. Chamberlain, Carrington and DeVry University are specifically authorized to operate in all of the domestic jurisdictions that require such authorizations. Some states assert authority to regulate all degree-granting institutions if their educational programs are available to their residents, whether or not the institutions maintain a physical presence within those states. Chamberlain, Carrington and DeVry University have obtained licensure in states which require such licensure and where their students are enrolled.

&#160;

On July 25, 2016, ED published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking concerning requirements for institutional eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. The proposed regulations would require an institution offering distance education or correspondence courses to be authorized by each state in which the institution enrolls students, if such authorization is required by the State. If an institution offers postsecondary education through distance education or correspondence courses in a state that participates in a state authorization reciprocity agreement, and the institution offering the program is located in a state where it is also covered by such an agreement, the institution would be considered legally authorized to offer postsecondary distance or correspondence education in the state where courses are offered via distance education, subject to any limitations in that agreement. The proposed regulations would also require an institution to document the state processes for resolving complaints from students enrolled in programs offered through distance education or correspondence courses. With regard to additional locations or branch campuses located in foreign countries, the proposed regulations would require that such campuses be authorized by an appropriate government agency of the country where the additional location or branch campus is located and, if at least half of an educational program can be completed at the location or branch campus, be approved by the institution's accrediting agency and be reported to the State where the institution's main campus is located. Lastly, the proposed regulations would require that an institution provide certain disclosures to enrolled and prospective students regarding its programs offered solely through distance education or correspondence courses.

&#160;

The effective date of any final regulations cannot be determined at this time, but final regulations promulgated by November 1, 2016 would likely become effective July 1, 2017. We are unable to predict what such final regulations may contain or the result of any other current or future rulemakings. However, management believes DeVry Group&#8217;s institutions are currently appropriately licensed and will determine, once the new rules are issued, whether additional licensure is required.

&#160;

Cohort Default Rates 

&#160;

ED has instituted strict regulations that penalize institutions whose students have high default rates on federal student loans. Depending on the type of loan, a loan is considered in default after the borrower becomes at least 270 or 360 days past due. For a variety of reasons, higher default rates are often found in private-sector institutions and community colleges &#8212; many of which tend to have a higher percentage of low-income students enrolled than do four-year publicly supported and independent colleges and universities.

&#160;

Educational institutions are penalized to varying degrees under the William D. Ford Federal Direct Student Loan Program, depending on the default rate for the &#8220;cohort&#8221; defined in the statute. An institution with a cohort default rate that exceeds 20% for the year is required to develop a plan to reduce defaults, but the institution&#8217;s operations and its students&#8217; ability to utilize student loans are not restricted. An institution with a cohort default rate of 30% or more for three consecutive years is ineligible to participate in these loan programs and cannot offer student loans administered by ED for the fiscal year in which the ineligibility determination is made and for the next two fiscal years. Students attending an institution whose cohort default rate has exceeded 30% for three consecutive years also are ineligible for Pell grants. Any institution with a cohort default rate of 40% or more in any year is subject to immediate limitation, suspension or termination proceedings from all federal aid programs. DeVry Group carefully monitors students&#8217; loan default rates and has never had a cohort default rate of 30% or more for three consecutive years, or of 40% or more in any one year, at any of its institutions.

&#160;

&#160; 31 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

According to ED, the three-year cohort default rate for all colleges and universities eligible for federal financial aid decreased to 11.8% in fiscal year 2012 (the latest period for which data are available) from 13.7% in fiscal year 2011.

&#160;

Default rates for AUC, RUSM, RUSVM, Chamberlain, Carrington and DeVry University students follow. The latest period for which final three-year data is available is 2012.

&#160;

&#160; &#160; Cohort Default Rate &#160; &#160; &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine &#160; &#160; 0.0 % &#160; &#160; 1.5 % Ross University School of Medicine &#160; &#160; 0.4 % &#160; &#160; 0.8 % Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine &#160; &#160; 0.6 % &#160; &#160; 0.3 % Chamberlain College of Nursing &#160; &#160; 3.8 % &#160; &#160; 5.8 % Carrington College: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; California &#160; &#160; 15.1 % &#160; &#160; 23.2 % Boise &#160; &#160; 10.3 % &#160; &#160; 12.3 % Portland &#160; &#160; 15.7 % &#160; &#160; 16.5 % Phoenix &#160; &#160; 17.5 % &#160; &#160; 21.3 % DeVry University (1) &#160; &#160; 12.6 % &#160; &#160; 18.5 % DeVry University: Federal Perkins Loan Program &#160; &#160; 20.4 % &#160; &#160; 21.0 % &#160; 

(1) Beginning with the 3-year period ended September 30, 2011, all DeVry University programs are reported under the same Office of Postsecondary Education Identification code. &#160;

The three-year cohort default rates for Carrington College-California, Carrington College-Portland and Carrington College-Phoenix were in excess of 15.0% for the most recent year (2012). In accordance with ED regulations, disbursement of Title IV Stafford loans for new students is delayed for a thirty day period for any institution with a cohort default rate in excess of 15.0%. Management believes that the delay in the related cash receipts for this DeVry Group institution will not materially affect its operations or cash flow.

&#160;

Under the Federal Perkins Loan Program, the institution is responsible for collecting outstanding loans. Any institution with a Perkins loan cohort default rate exceeding 15% must establish a default reduction plan. DeVry Group has worked to reduce the default rates for all loan programs by implementing financial awareness and student counseling programs and retaining outside loan servicing agencies to contact former students and inform them of their repayment options.

&#160;

Student-Right-to-Know-Act 

&#160;

Institutions that participate in U.S. federal financial aid programs must disclose information upon request about undergraduate student &#8220;completion rates&#8221; to current and prospective students. The federal Student-Right-To-Know Act defines the cohort of students on which the institution must report as &#8220;first-time, full-time, degree-seeking&#8221; students who enter the fall term. Completion rates calculated in accordance with the statute for each of DeVry University&#8217;s U.S. undergraduate campuses generally fall within the range of completion rates at selected four-year urban public colleges serving low-income students in the areas in which its campuses are located. However, its overall completion rate for full-time students (not limited to first-time students, who comprise only approximately 20% of DeVry University&#8217;s students) is more representative of DeVry University&#8217;s student population and is higher than reported in these statistics. Many DeVry University students have previously attended other colleges (and completion rates for undergraduate students entering with previous college experience generally are higher than for first-time students), but these students are not included in the completion rate statistics that are defined by the Student-Right-To-Know Act. In an effort to improve our completion rates as defined by the statute, DeVry University has enhanced its student support services. For 2008 freshman students (the latest period for which final completion statistics are available), the first-time, full-time degree-seeking graduation rate for DeVry University U.S. undergraduates was 32.0% as compared to the 2007 rate of 31.0%.

&#160;

&#160; 32 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Satisfactory Academic Progress 

&#160;

In addition to the requirements that educational institutions must meet, student recipients of financial aid must maintain satisfactory academic progress toward completion of their program of study and an appropriate grade point average.

&#160;

Change of Ownership or Control 

&#160;

Any change of ownership or control of DeVry Group, depending on the type of change, may have significant regulatory consequences for each of DeVry Group&#8217;s Title-IV eligible institutions. Such a change of ownership or control could require recertification by ED, the reevaluation of accreditation by our institutions accreditors and/or reauthorization by state licensing agencies. If we experience a change of ownership or control, then AUC, RUSM, RUSVM, Chamberlain, Carrington and DeVry University may cease to be eligible to participate in Title IV programs until recertified by ED. There is no assurance that such recertification would be obtained on a timely basis. After a change in ownership or control, most institutions will participate in Title IV programs on a provisional basis for a period of cone to three years.

&#160;

In addition, most institutions would be required to report any material change in stock ownership to their principal institutional accrediting body, including in the case of Chamberlain and DeVry University, the HLC, and would be required to obtain approval prior to undergoing any transaction that affects, or may affect, its corporate control or governance. In the event of any such change, the applicable accreditor may undertake an evaluation of the effect of the change on the continuing operations of the affected institution for purposes of determining if continued accreditation is appropriate, which evaluation may include a comprehensive review.

&#160;

In addition, some states in which our institutions are licensed require approval (in some cases, advance approval) of changes in ownership or control in order to remain authorized to operate in those states, and participation in grant programs in some states may be interrupted or otherwise affected by a change in ownership or control.

&#160;

Refer to Part I, &#8220;Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors&#8221; subsection &#8220;Risks Related to DeVry Group&#8217;s Highly Regulated Industry&#8221; of this Form 10-K. If regulators do not approve or delay their approval of transactions involving a change of control of our company, the eligibility of our institutions to participate in Title IV programs, our institutions&#8217; accreditation and our institutions&#8217; state licenses may be impaired in a manner that materially and adversely affects our business. 

&#160;

Brazil Regulations 

&#160;

Governmental regulations in foreign countries significantly affect our international operations. New or revised interpretations of regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on us. Changes in existing or new interpretations of applicable laws, rules, or regulations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our accreditation, authorization to operate, permissible activities, and costs of doing business outside of the U.S. The failure to maintain or renew any required regulatory approvals could have a material adverse effect on our international operations.

&#160;

State Approvals and Licensing 

&#160;

DeVry Group institutions require authorizations from many state higher education authorities or Canadian ministries to recruit students, operate schools, conduct exam preparation courses and grant degrees. Generally, the addition of any new program of study or new operating location also requires approval by the appropriate licensing and regulatory agencies. In the U.S., each Chamberlain, Carrington and DeVry University location is approved to grant certificates, diplomas, associate, bachelor&#8217;s and/or master&#8217;s and doctorate degrees by the respective state in which it is located. Additionally, many states require approval for out-of-state institutions to recruit within their state or offer instruction through online modalities to residents of their states. DeVry Group believes it is in compliance with all state requirements as an out-of-state institution. AUC and RUSM clinical programs are accredited as part of their programs of medical education by their respective accrediting bodies, approved by the appropriate boards in those states that have a formal process to do so and are posted with ED.

&#160;

Many states and Canadian provinces require private-sector postsecondary education institutions to post surety bonds for licensure. In the U.S., DeVry Group has posted approximately $7.9 million of surety bonds with regulatory authorities on behalf of Chamberlain, Carrington, Becker and DeVry University.

&#160;

Certain states have set standards of financial responsibility that differ from those prescribed by federal regulation. DeVry Group believes it is in material compliance with state and Canadian provincial regulations. If DeVry Group were unable to meet the tests of financial responsibility for a specific jurisdiction, and could not otherwise demonstrate financial responsibility, DeVry Group could be required to cease operations in that state. To date, DeVry Group has successfully demonstrated its financial responsibility where required.

&#160;

Compliance Program Overview 

&#160;

Specialized staff at DeVry Group&#8217;s home office and DeVry Brasil review, interpret and establish procedures for compliance with regulations governing financial assistance programs and processing financial aid applications. Because financial assistance programs are required to be administered in accordance with the standard of care and diligence of a fiduciary, any regulatory violation can be the basis for disciplinary action, including the initiation of a suspension, limitation or termination proceeding.

&#160;

In the U.S., AUC, RUSM, RUSVM, Chamberlain, Carrington and DeVry University have completed and submitted all required audits of compliance with federal financial assistance programs for fiscal year 2015. DeVry Group&#8217;s independent public accountants are currently conducting the required audits of the one-year period ended June 30, 2016.

&#160;

DeVry Group&#8217;s efforts to ensure compliance with all of these regulatory requirements are extensive and include:

&#160;

&#183; A corporate Ombudsman&#8217;s&#8217; office comprised of eight employees that respond to student concerns. &#183; An internal audit function reporting directly to the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors that continuously audits aspects of DeVry Group&#8217;s operations, including compliance with regulations. &#183; A six-person Regulatory Quality Assurance function that assists with the development and implementation of procedures and process controls and monitors execution to assure compliance with federal and state regulations. &#183; A sixteen-person Regulatory Compliance and Affairs team that is responsible for the review and required approval of all student and public-facing communications and media representing student outcomes, program costs or the delivery of educational services, scripted enrollment and financial advising, and monitoring of federal and state regulatory developments. &#183; Quality Assurance functions and the use of peer reviews within the operational units. &#183; Continuous monitoring of recorded phone calls in order to ensure that misrepresentations are not made. &#183; Strict adherence to compliance-approved scripting by colleagues when speaking to potential and current students. &#183; Required annual Ethics and Responsible Communications training that every employee must complete. &#183; Career Services processes that provide for redundant review of the accuracy of employment statistics. &#160;

&#160;

DeVry University holds virtual and onsite Career Fairs periodically to enable students to meet and network with recruiters of DeVry University graduates. The national job database that is available to DeVry University students also allows employers to access the system directly and post open positions, providing additional opportunities for students and graduates. In many cases, employer hiring representatives conduct interviews at DeVry University campuses.

&#160;

SEASONALITY 

&#160;

DeVry Group&#8217;s quarterly revenue and net income fluctuate primarily as a result of the pattern of student enrollments. Generally, the schools&#8217; highest enrollment and revenue typically occur in the fall, which corresponds to the second and third quarters of DeVry Group&#8217;s fiscal year. Enrollment is slightly lower in the spring, and the lowest enrollment generally occurs during the summer months. DeVry Group&#8217;s operating costs do not fluctuate as significantly on a quarterly basis.

&#160;

Results of operations reflect both this seasonal enrollment pattern and the pattern of student recruiting activity costs that precede the start of every term. Revenue, operating income and net income by quarter for each of the past two fiscal years are included in &#8220;Note 16: Quarterly Financial Data&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
