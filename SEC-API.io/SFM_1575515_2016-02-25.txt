 Item 1. 

Business 

Sprouts Farmers Market operates as a healthy grocery store that offers fresh, natural and organic food that includes fresh produce, bulk foods, vitamins and supplements, grocery, meat and seafood, deli, bakery, dairy, frozen foods, body care and natural household items catering to consumers&#8217; growing interest in eating and living healthier. Since our founding in 2002, we have grown rapidly, significantly increasing our sales, store count and profitability. With 224 stores in 13 states as of February 25, 2016, we are one of the largest specialty retailers of fresh, natural and organic food in the United States. 

At Sprouts, we believe healthy living is a journey and every meal is a choice. The cornerstones of our business are fresh, natural and organic products at compelling prices (which we refer to as &#8220;Healthy Living for Less&#8221;), an attractive and differentiated shopping experience featuring a broad selection of innovative healthy products, and knowledgeable team members who we believe provide best-in-class customer engagement and product education. 

Healthy Living for Less. We offer high-quality, fresh, natural and organic products at attractive prices in every department. Consistent with our farmers market heritage, our offering begins with fresh produce, which we source, warehouse and distribute in-house and sell at prices we believe to be significantly below those of other food retailers. In addition, our scale, operating structure and deep industry relationships position us to consistently deliver competitive prices and promote value throughout the store. Based on our experience, we believe we attract a broad customer base, including conventional supermarket customers, and appeal to a much wider demographic than other specialty retailers of natural and organic food. We believe that over time, our compelling prices and product offering convert many &#8220;trial&#8221; customers into loyal &#8220;lifestyle&#8221; customers who shop Sprouts with greater frequency and across an increasing number of departments. 

Attractive, Differentiated Shopping Experience. In a convenient, small-box format (average store size of 28,000 to 30,000 sq. ft.), our stores have a farmers market feel, with a bright, open-air atmosphere to create a comfortable and engaging in-store experience. We strive to be our customers&#8217; everyday healthy grocery store. We feature fresh produce and bulk foods at the center of the store surrounded by a complete grocery offering. Consistent with our fresh, natural and organic offering, we choose not to carry most of the traditional, national branded consumer packaged goods generally found at conventional grocery retailers ( e.g. , Doritos, Tide and Lucky Charms). Instead, we offer high-quality and innovative healthier alternatives that emphasize our focus on fresh, natural and organic products at great values. 

Customer Engagement and Education. Our commitment to &#8220;Healthy Living for Less&#8221; is shared by team members throughout the entire organization who are dedicated to our passion for educating and engaging with our customers with the goal of making healthy eating easier and more accessible. We believe our well-trained and engaged team members, as well as the materials we disseminate through our digital and social media platforms, help our customers increasingly understand that they can purchase a wide selection of high-quality, healthy, and great tasting food for themselves and their families at attractive prices by shopping at Sprouts. 

Our Industry 

We operate within the grocery store industry which encompasses store formats ranging from small grocery and convenience stores to large independent and chain supermarkets. According to the Progressive Grocer , U.S. supermarket sales totaled over $638 billion in 2014. Based on our industry experience, we believe we are capturing significant market share from conventional supermarkets and other specialty concepts in this supermarket segment. 

The supermarket segment is comprised of various formats, including conventional, supercenter, natural / gourmet, limited assortment and warehouse. While the natural and organic food segment is one 

&#160;

&#160;

of the fastest growing segments in the industry, conventional supermarkets have experienced overall share decline from approxim ately 73% in 2005 to 6 5 % in 201 4 , according to the Progressive Grocer , as customers have migrated to other grocery retail formats , including specialty grocers and mass retailers . Conventional supermarket customers are attracted to competitors&#8217; unique product offerings, formats and differentiated shopping experiences. 

We believe Sprouts offers consumers a compelling value relative to conventional supermarkets and mass retailers and will continue to benefit from the following industry and consumer trends: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Increasing consumer focus on health and wellness . We believe, based on our industry experience, that consumers are increasingly focused on health and wellness and are actively seeking healthy foods in order to improve eating habits. According to SPINS LLC, a leading provider of retail consumer insights, analytics and consulting for the natural, organic and specialty products industry, sales of natural and organic products, including food and supplements, are projected to grow from $105 billion in 2014 to over $166 billion in 2019, representing projected annual growth of over 9%. 

This overall demand for healthy products is driven by many factors, including increased awareness about the benefits of eating healthy, a greater focus on preventative health measures, and the rising costs of health care. We believe customers are attracted to retailers with comprehensive health and wellness product offerings. As a result, food retailers are offering an increased assortment of fresh, natural and organic foods as well as vitamins and supplements to meet this demand. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Emphasis on the customer shopping experience. Consumers are increasingly focused on their shopping experience, and often choose their shopping location based on variety, price and higher-quality produce and meat. Shoppers are also loyal to their primary store, with 75% of their total grocery budget spent at their primary store according to a survey in the Food Marketing Institute&#8217;s U.S. Grocery Shopper Trends 2014 . Grocers are therefore focused on providing a broad selection of products along with exceptional customer service. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Consumer desire for value. Customers across formats seek quality products at compelling value and certain traditional, natural and organic retailers have faced pressure on sales as customers shifted to lower-priced items or eliminated certain discretionary purchases. We believe consumers will continue to seek high-quality, value-priced offerings in their purchases over the long-term, regardless of macroeconomic conditions. 

Growing Our Business 

We believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on two powerful, long-term consumer trends&#8212;a growing interest in health and wellness and a focus on value and are pursuing a number of strategies designed to continue our growth and strong financial performance, including: 

Expand our store base. We intend to continue expanding our store base by pursuing new store openings in existing markets, expanding into adjacent markets and penetrating new markets. We have opened 19, 24 and 27 new stores in fiscal 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively, representing 14% unit growth each year. We expect to continue to expand our store base with 36 store openings planned in fiscal 2016, of which seven have opened as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and we intend to achieve 14% annual new store growth over at least the next five years. 

&#160;

&#160;

The below diagram shows our store footprint, by state, as of January 3, 2016 . 

&#160;

Continue positive comparable store sales. For 35 consecutive quarters, including throughout the economic downturn from 2008 to 2010, stores under our management have achieved positive comparable store sales growth. We believe the consistency of our performance over time and across geographies and vintages is the result of a number of factors, including our distinctive value positioning and merchandising strategies, product innovation and a well-trained staff focused on customer education and engagement. We believe we can continue to grow the number and size of customer transactions by enhancing our core value proposition and distinctive customer-oriented shopping experience. We aim to grow our average ticket by continuing to expand and refine our fresh, natural and organic product offering, our targeted and personalized marketing efforts and our in-store and digital education. We believe these factors, combined with the continued strong growth in fresh, natural and organic food consumption, will allow Sprouts to gain new customers, increase customer loyalty and, over time, convert single-department trial customers into core, lifestyle customers who shop Sprouts with greater frequency and across an increasing number of departments. 

Grow the Sprouts Farmers Market brand. We are committed to supporting our stores, product offerings and brand through a variety of marketing programs, private label offerings and corporate partnerships. In addition, we will continue our community outreach and charity programs to more broadly connect with our local communities with the aim of promoting our brand and educating consumers on healthy choices. We will also continue to expand our innovative marketing and promotional strategy through print, digital and social media platforms. 

Our Heritage 

In 2002, we opened the first Sprouts Farmers Market store in Chandler, Arizona. From our founding in 2002 through January 3, 2016, we continued to open new stores while successfully rebranding 43 Henry&#8217;s Farmers Market (referred to as &#8220;Henry&#8217;s&#8221;) and 39 Sunflower Farmers Market (referred to as &#8220;Sunflower&#8221;) stores added through acquisitions to the Sprouts banner (referred to as the &#8220;Transactions&#8221;). These three businesses all trace their lineage back to Henry&#8217;s Farmers Market and were built with similar store formats and operations including a strong emphasis on value, produce and service in smaller, convenient locations. The consistency of these formats and operations was an important factor that 

&#160;

&#160;

allowed us to rapidly and successfully rebrand and integr ate each of these businesses under the Sprouts banner and on a common platform. As of January 3, 2016 , we had 217 stores in 13 states , and are one of the largest specialty retailers of fresh, natural and organic food in the United States. 

In connection with our initial public offering (referred to as our &#8220;IPO&#8221;), on July 29, 2013, Sprouts Farmers Markets, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, converted into Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc., a Delaware corporation. As part of the corporate conversion, holders of membership interests of Sprouts Farmers Markets, LLC in the form of Class A and Class B units received 11 shares of our common stock for each unit held immediately prior to the corporate conversion, and options to purchase units became options to purchase 11 shares of our common stock for each unit underlying options outstanding immediately prior to the corporate conversion, at the same aggregate exercise price in effect prior to the corporate conversion. 

On August 1, 2013, our common stock began trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and on August 6, 2013, we closed our IPO. 

Our Stores and Operations 

We believe our stores represent a blend of conventional supermarkets, farmers markets, natural foods stores, and smaller specialty markets, differentiating us from other food retailers, while also providing a complete offering for our customers. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Store Design. Our stores are organized in a &#8220;flipped&#8221; conventional food retail store model, positioning our produce at the center of the store surrounded by a complete grocery offering. We typically dedicate approximately 15% of a store&#8217;s selling square footage to produce, which we believe is significantly higher than many of our peers. The stores are designed with open floor plans and low displays, intended to provide an easy-to-shop environment that allows our customers to view the entire store. The below diagram shows a sample layout of our stores: 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Culture of Customer Engagement . We are committed to providing and believe we have best-in-class customer engagement, which builds trust with our customers and differentiates the Sprouts shopping experience from that of many of our competitors. We design our stores to maximize customers&#8217; interactions with our team members, as we believe this interaction provides an opportunity to educate customers and provides a valued, differentiated customer service model, which enhances customer loyalty and increases visits and purchases over time. 

&#160;

&#160;

C ustomer engagement is critical to our culture and we place great importance on training our team members on customer engagement and product knowledge to ensure there is friendly, knowledgeable staff in every department. Our team members are trained and emp owered to proactively engage with customers throughout the entire store. This includes investing time to educate them on the benefits of different vitamins, sharing ways to prepare a meal or cutting a piece of produce or opening a package to offer customer s product tastings throughout the store. We consider customer education and engagement to be particularly important as many conventional supermarket customers that have not shopped our stores believe that eating healthy is expensive and difficult. 

Our stores are typically staffed with 80 to 90 full and part-time team members including a store manager, an assistant store manager, eight department managers, five assistant department managers, store office staff and other team members. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Recruiting, Training, Development and Promotion. We strive to create a strong and unified company culture and develop team members throughout the entire organization. We have prioritized making investments in training that we believe enhances our team members&#8217; knowledge, particularly with respect to our expanded and evolving product offerings, so our team members can continue to engage and assist our customers. We also have regional department level merchandisers and trainers who are focused on training team members within departments and also assist with store and local merchandising strategies and execution. For new stores, we typically have team members on site approximately three to four weeks before opening to optimize initial and long-term store performance and customer service. We also have approximately 100 people in the field as regional support teams in human resources, operations and compliance. These teams focus on hiring, retention, training, food safety, security, financial management and other operational best practices. We regularly perform audits of our stores to assess customer engagement, inventory quality and control, merchandising and other factors. We believe our team members contribute to our consistently high service standards and that this helps us successfully open new stores. 

&#160;

We believe Sprouts is an attractive place to work with significant growth opportunities for our team members. We regularly assess prevailing wages in the markets in which we operate and offer competitive wages and benefits as we believe active, educated and passionate team members contribute to consumer satisfaction. In 2015, we promoted approximately 4,800 team members. We also host quarterly Team Member Appreciation Days at each store, hold town hall meetings between team members and company management and provide our team members with discounts on purchases in the store. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Store Size . Our stores are generally between 28,000 and 30,000 square feet, which we believe is smaller than many of our peers&#8217; average stores. Our stores are located in a variety of mid-sized and larger shopping centers, lifestyle centers and in certain cases, independent single-unit, stand-alone developments. The size of our stores and our real estate strategy provide us flexibility in site selection, including entering into new developments or existing sites formerly operated by other retailers, including other grocery banners, office supply stores, electronics retailers and other second generation space. Further, we believe our value positioning allows us to serve a diverse customer base and provides us significant flexibility to enter new markets across a variety of socio-economic areas, including markets with varying levels of fresh, natural and organic grocer penetration. 

Our Product Offering 

We are a complete food retailer. We focus and tailor our assortment to fresh, natural and organic foods and healthier options throughout all of our departments. 

&#160;

&#160;

Fresh, Natural and Organic Foods 

Our product offerings focus on fresh, natural and organic foods. Foods are generally considered &#8220;fresh&#8221; if it is minimally processed or in its raw state not subject to any type of preservation or freezing. Natural foods can be broadly defined as foods that are minimally processed and are free of synthetic preservatives, artificial sweeteners, colors, flavors and other additives, growth hormones, antibiotics, hydrogenated oils, stabilizers and emulsifiers. Essentially, natural foods are largely or completely free of non-naturally occurring chemicals and are as near to their whole, natural state as possible. 

Organic foods refer to the food itself as well as the method by which it is produced. In general, organic operations must demonstrate that they are protecting natural resources, conserving biodiversity, and using only approved substances and must be certified by a USDA-accredited certifying agency. These organic standards include: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Crop production must not use irradiation, sewage sludge, synthetic fertilizers, prohibited pesticides, and genetically modified organisms. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Livestock producers must meet animal health and welfare standards, not use antibiotics or growth hormones, use 100% organic feed, and provide animals with access to the outdoors. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Multi-ingredient organic food must be compromised of 95% or more certified organic content. 

Further, retailers that handle, store or sell organic products must implement measures to protect their organic character. 

Products 

We categorize the varieties of products we sell as perishable and non-perishable. Perishable product categories include produce, meat, seafood, deli and bakery. Non-perishable product categories include grocery, vitamins and supplements, bulk items, dairy and dairy alternatives, frozen foods, beer and wine, and natural health and body care. The following is a breakdown of our perishable and non-perishable sales mix:

Departments 

Our stores include the following departments: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Produce . Placed at the center of our stores, our high-quality, value-oriented offering begins with our produce department. We offer our customers a farmers market open-feel environment consisting of an abundant and affordable natural and organic offering of fresh fruits, vegetables and herbs, focused on appearance, flavor and value. Our extensive produce selection includes seasonal, specialty and organic items, often from local or regional farms, at prices targeted to be significantly lower than our competitors. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Grocery . Our grocery offering focuses on healthy options. We carry approximately 5,400 natural and organic products in our grocery aisles, including meal components, natural sodas and other beverages, snacks and bars, baking goods, baby, pet and household items such as detergent and paper towels, and earth-friendly mercantile items. Our product offering includes more than 3,500 gluten-free items, and our own Sprouts private label brand products. We also offer distinctive locally-produced products in each of our market areas, such as preserves, honey, BBQ sauces, salsas and chips. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Meat and Seafood . Our Olde Tyme Butcher Shops combine high-quality sourcing through our trusted supplier network, product variety and old-fashioned customer service, as we cut and 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

grind meat fresh, as needed for our customers, and unlike much of the industry today, we have no offsite facility delivering products processed days in advance. We feature &#8220;choice natural&#8221; beef, pasture raised pork, grass fed organic beef, organic chicken and Grade A all-natural poultry raised cage-free from trusted partner ranches and farms. We also carry varieties of sausages made fresh daily in-store as well as an abundant selection of entrees, including gourmet burgers, pinwheels, stuffed chicken breast s, pork chops and roasts. We offer a wide variety of seafood favorites delivered up to six days a week and carry multiple options for baking, saut&#233;ing, or grilling and round out our assortment with wild fresh species while in season. We believe that our cu stomers value the freshness, quality and service level of our meat and seafood department and this generates repeat traffic and purchases. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Deli. We feature a broad array of fresh deli specialties, including high-quality sliced deli meat, salads, dips, entrees, side dishes and fresh made to order sandwiches at value prices and an abundant selection of cheeses from around the world. We have begun to roll out our new and expanded deli offerings into a select number of new stores and existing stores, including features like a new salad bar, stocked with ready to eat, healthy and flavorful salads, a full-service deli case with prepared proteins and healthy side dishes and an expanded assortment of component meals and side dishes. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Vitamins and Supplements . Our stores feature more than 4,500 vitamins, supplements, natural remedies, functional food, lifestyle support, and herbal supplements. This department includes an extensive private label offering. We believe there is an education component to shopping in our vitamins and supplements department and that our customers value friendly, knowledgeable and dedicated team members to introduce products and to guide them through their purchases. We employ a full-time nutritionist to assist and train team members through online modules. Each store typically holds four to five training sessions per month (including both internal and vendor-led) to ensure our team members are knowledgeable about the products on our shelves. These training sessions prepare our vitamin and supplement team members to better educate and serve our customers through personalized service. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Dairy and Dairy Alternatives. Our dairy department features a wide selection of organic, natural and regionally sourced milk, yogurt, butter and eggs, as well as a full selection of plant-based alternative dairy products. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Bulk Items . Our stores can include up to 450 varieties of uniquely crafted selection of scoopable nuts, fruits, trail mixes, grains, beans, cereals, coffee, tea, spices, candy and snacks featured in the center of the store. We believe this high-quality, value-oriented department provides a feeling of an &#8216;old-time grocery store&#8217; as customers are able to select and scoop as much of these items as they wish. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Bakery. Our focus on fresh, high-quality and unique &#8220;signature&#8221; products is evident in our bakery department, which is located at the entrance to each store. Sprouts&#8217; bakery offering includes artisan bread alongside a wide assortment of sandwich breads, rolls, tortillas, pitas, muffins, cookies and pies as well as sugar free, gluten free and low carbohydrate products. We bake a large selection of products fresh in-store every day to enhance the overall customer experience. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Frozen Foods . Our freezer cases feature traditional and ethnic natural and organic entrees and side dishes, along with frozen vegetables, desserts and specialty items, such as gluten-free breads and non-dairy ice creams. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Natural Health and Body Care . Sprouts offers approximately 2,700 natural, cruelty-free health and beauty products, old-fashioned remedies and modern body care innovations, including facial care products and make up, skin, hair, dental, baby care and grooming products, all at value-oriented prices. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Beer and Wine . We offer a carefully selected assortment of craft beers, microbrews and premium beers from around the world and an expansive variety of domestic and international 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

wines, many of which we price at $10 or less. We also stock Kosher, organic, sustainable and biodynamic, local, exclusive-to-Sprouts and even non-alcoholic wines. &#160;

Private Label 

We have been expanding the breadth of our Sprouts branded products over the last several years and have a dedicated product development team focused on continuing this growth. These products feature competitively priced specialty and innovative products, with quality and ingredient standards that we believe equal or exceed national brands. We have increased our portfolio of private label items from approximately 800 items at the end of 2011 to approximately 1,800 as of January 3, 2016. Our private label brands drive value by offering our customers lower prices while still delivering higher margin as compared to branded products. We believe our private label products build and enhance the Sprouts brand and allow us to distinguish ourselves from our competitors, promoting customer loyalty and creating a destination shopping experience. 

Sourcing and Distribution 

We manage the buying of, and set the standards for, the products we sell, and we source our products from over 800 vendors and suppliers, both domestically and internationally. 

We believe, based on our industry experience, that our strong relationships in the produce business provide us a competitive advantage and enable us to offer high-quality produce at prices we believe are significantly below those of conventional food retailers and even further below high-end natural and organic food retailers. Given the importance of produce to our stores, we source, warehouse and distribute all produce in-house. This ensures our produce meets our high quality standards. We are supported by dedicated regional procurement teams that provide us flexibility to procure produce on local, regional and national levels. 

We have department and product specifications that ensure a consistently high level of quality across product ingredients, production standards and other key measures of freshness, natural and organic standards. These specifications are measured at both entry and exit points to our facilities. We distribute all produce to our stores from two leased distribution facilities and one third-party operated distribution facility, and we manage every aspect of quality control in this department. We believe we currently have sufficient capacity at these facilities to support our near-term growth plans, but we continue to explore expansion opportunities as our needs evolve. 

We believe our scale, together with this decentralized purchasing structure and flexibility generates cost savings, which we then pass on to our customers. Distributors and farmers recognize the volume of goods we sell through our stores and our flexible purchasing and distribution model allows us to opportunistically acquire produce at great value which we will also pass along to our customers. 

For all non-produce products, we use third-party distributors and vendors to distribute products directly to our stores following specifications and quality control standards that are set by us. 

Nature&#8217;s Best, Inc., acquired by KeHE Distributors, LLC in 2014 (referred to as &#8220;NB&#8221;), is our primary supplier of dry grocery and frozen food products, accounting for approximately 24%, 23% and 23% of our total purchases in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Another 4% of our total purchases in each of fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 were made through our secondary supplier, United Natural Foods, Inc. (referred to as &#8220;UNFI&#8221;). See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Disruption of significant supplier relationships could negatively affect our business.&#8221; 

&#160;

&#160;

Our Customers 

Our target customer seeks a wide assortment of high-quality fresh and nutritious food as well as vitamins and supplements at competitive prices. We believe our value proposition and complete grocery offering engages both conventional and health-focused shoppers. 

We have a broad range of customers from those looking for value, to customers seeking specific attribute products, to those seeking to eat healthier. We believe the majority of our customers are initially attracted to our stores by our fresh produce, which we offer at prices we believe are significantly below those of conventional food retailers and even further below high-end natural and organic food retailers. We drive customer traffic by aggressively promoting produce and other items through weekly advertisements designed primarily to reach the everyday supermarket shopper. These customers include &#8220;trial&#8221; customers that limit their shopping to specific products or departments, such as produce. Through department-specific promotions, in-store signage, and customer education, many customers become &#8220;transition&#8221; customers that shop new departments and try new products. Over time, through customer service and engagement, targeted marketing, and increased knowledge of our product offering, we believe that transition customers become &#8220;lifestyle&#8221; customers that shop with greater frequency throughout the entire store.

Our Pricing, Marketing and Advertising 

&#160;

&#183; 

Pricing . We are committed to a pricing strategy consistent with our motto of &#8220;Healthy Living for Less.&#8221; As a farmers market style store, we emphasize low prices throughout the entire store, as we are able to pass along the benefits of our scale and purchasing power to our customers. We position our prices with everyday value for our customers with regular promotions on selected products that drive traffic and trial. We typically have about 30% of our approximately 18,800 products on sale at any given time. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Marketing and Advertising. We supplement and support our everyday competitive pricing strategy through weekly advertised specials, a weekly e-circular, online coupons and special promotions. We send over 15 million weekly advertisement circulars to encourage customers to shop at our stores. These circulars focus on product education and offerings and aim to engage the customer. We use sales flyers distributed through direct delivery or inserted into local newspapers as our primary medium for advertising. These sales flyers include representative products from our key departments. In addition, we have a customer database of over one million customers as of January 3, 2016, many of whom receive electronic versions of our weekly circulars or monthly newsletters. 

We tailor our advertisements to specific markets, which provides us with greater flexibility to offer different promotions and respond to local competitive activity. In addition, we advertise our sales promotions and support our brand image through the use of local radio, as well as targeted direct mail in specific markets. 

We also continue to promote and enhance our digital presence. We maintain a smartphone app and our website, www.sprouts.com , on which we display our weekly sales flyers and offer special deals and coupons and continue to expand our social media platform. Our website also features on-line ordering for holiday meals and catering trays. The inclusion of our website address in this Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include or incorporate by reference the information on or accessible through our website herein. As of January 3, 2016, we had approximately 1.3 million Facebook fans. In addition, we have partnered with Amazon Prime to offer 1-hour or 2-hour deliveries from our stores in selected pilot markets. We will continue to explore online ordering opportunities to further connect with our customers. 

In addition to the weekly circulars, we offer numerous other saving opportunities for our customers, all of which are meant to reinforce our value offering and are designed to appeal to specific target customers. In 2015, we had approximately 31 department-wide promotions at 

&#160;

&#160;

each store throughout the year , which included our Vitamin Extravaganza, Frozen Frenzy, Gluten-Free Favorites, and Incredible Bulk Sales, in addition to our routine Double-Ad Wednesday promotion and 72-Hour Sales . 

Our Communities 

We are actively involved in the communities in which we operate, and support many local non-profit and educational institutions that share our goal of improved health, nutrition and fitness. In 2015, we formed The Sprouts Healthy Communities Foundation (referred to as our &#8220;Foundation&#8221;), a registered 501(c)(3) organization focused on fighting food insecurity, increasing health and nutrition education and assisting those living with the daily challenges of disabilities and health concerns. Our involvement in the communities we serve, through our Foundation or our stores, takes many forms, including: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Alignment with Certain Causes . Sprouts has undertaken a number of innovative corporate fundraising initiatives, including a multi-faceted program with Autism Speaks and the Southwest Autism Research and Resource Center. From 2010 through 2014, we raised more than $4.9 million through our donations, as well as the donations by our and business partners. In 2015, we raised $2.5 million including donations from our business partners and customers. Our Foundation has allowed us to expand our reach to additional causes related to its mission, including donations to REAL School Gardens to fund the creation of a school garden that promotes healthy food choices and nutrition education and to No Kid Hungry to fund nutritional programs and support free/reduced school breakfast programs for low-income students. In addition, we partnered with Vitamin Angels on two in-store fundraisers in 2015 to help connect undernourished children with life changing and lifesaving nutrients. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Donations . Our donation goal is to contribute to the health of families and children and to healthy environments through in-kind support. Many donations are made at store level, in the form of food donations or gift cards, to qualifying organizations that are aligned with our goals. Examples include bananas or water for fundraising road races, reusable bags for health fairs and green festivals and gift cards to be used as raffle items or to provide catering for a fundraising event. During 2015, we donated over eight million pounds of produce and other food to local food banks in the markets in which we operate through our Food Rescue Program. We have also adopted the Grab &#38; Give campaign, which encourages customers to buy bags of groceries at a discount and then allow us to donate them to food banks in the markets in which we operate. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Volunteerism . Our team members are encouraged to help people and organizations in need. We have provided major volunteer support for the Arizona Walk Now for Autism Speaks, the Phoenix Rescue Mission, REAL School Gardens and various food banks. With an engaged base of more than 20,000 team members, we have the ability to use our leverage to support causes. 

Store Selection and Economics 

We have an extensive and selective process for new store site selection, which includes in-depth analysis of area demographics, competition, growth potential, traffic patterns, grocery spend and other key criteria. We have a dedicated real estate team as well as a real estate committee comprised of our Chief Development Officer and other members of senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer, President and Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Multiple members of our committee will also conduct an on-site inspection prior to approving any new location. 

We believe that our store model, combined with our rigorous store selection process and a growing interest in health and wellness, contribute to our attractive new store returns on investment. Our typical store requires an average new store cash investment of approximately $3.1 million, consisting of store buildout (net of contributions from landlords) of approximately $2.6 million, and inventory (net of payables) 

&#160;

&#160;

and cash pre-opening expenses of approximately $0.5 million. On average, our stores reach a mature sales growt h rate in three or four years after opening, with net sales increasing 20-30% during this time period. Based on our historical performance, we target net sales of $12-$14 million during the first year after opening and pre-tax cash-on-cash returns of 35-40 % within three to four years after opening. We believe the consistent performance of our store portfolio across geographies and vintages supports the portability of the Sprouts brand and store model into a wide range of markets. 

Based on our experience, we believe that our broad product offering and value proposition appeals to a wider demographic than other leading competitors, including higher-priced health food and gourmet food retailers. Sprouts has been successful across a variety of urban, suburban and rural locations in diverse geographies, from California to Georgia, underscoring the heightened interest in eating healthy across markets. We believe that the U.S. market can support approximately 1,200 Sprouts Farmers Market stores operating under our current format, and that we have significant growth opportunity in existing markets, as approximately 400 of these 1,200 potential stores are located in our current markets (13 states). We intend to achieve 14% annual new store growth over at least the next five years, with a balanced focus on existing, adjacent and new market growth. 

See &#8220;Properties&#8221; for additional information with respect to our store locations. 

Competition 

The $638 billion U.S. supermarket industry is large, intensely competitive and highly fragmented. We compete for customers with a wide array of food retailers, including natural and organic, specialty, conventional, mass and discount and other food retail formats. Our competitors include conventional supermarkets such as Kroger and Safeway, as well as other food retailers such as Whole Foods, Natural Grocers by Vitamin Cottage and Trader Joe&#8217;s. 

Insurance and Risk Management 

We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance to provide for potential liability for workers&#8217; compensation, general liability, product liability, director and officers&#8217; liability, team member healthcare benefits, and other casualty and property risks. Changes in legal trends and interpretations, variability in inflation rates, changes in the nature and method of claims settlement, benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws, insolvency of insurance carriers, and changes in discount rates could all affect ultimate settlements of claims. We evaluate our insurance requirements on an ongoing basis to ensure we maintain adequate levels of coverage. 

Seasonality 

Our business is subject to modest seasonality. Our average weekly sales per store fluctuate throughout the year and are typically highest in the first half of the fiscal year and lowest during the fourth quarter. Produce, which contributed approximately 25% of our net sales for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2016, is generally more available in the first six months of our fiscal year due to the timing of peak growing seasons. 

Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property 

We believe that our intellectual property has substantial value and has contributed to the success of our business. In particular, our trademarks, including our registered SPROUTS FARMERS MARKET &#174; , SPROUTS &#174; and HEALTHY LIVING FOR LESS! &#174; trademarks, are valuable assets that we believe reinforce our customers&#8217; favorable perception of our stores. In addition to our trademarks, we believe that 

&#160;

&#160;

our trade dress, which includes the human-scale design, arrangement, color scheme and other physical characteristics of our stores and product displays, is a large part of the farmers market atmosphere we create in our stores and enables customers to distinguish our stores and products from those of our competitors. 

From time to time, third parties have used names similar to ours, have applied to register trademarks similar to ours and, we believe, have infringed or misappropriated our intellectual property rights. Third parties have also, from time to time, opposed our trademarks and challenged our intellectual property rights. We respond to these actions on a case-by-case basis. The outcomes of these actions have included both negotiated out-of-court settlements as well as litigation. 

Information Technology Systems 

We have made significant investments in information technology infrastructure, including purchasing, receiving, inventory, point of sale, warehousing, distribution, accounting, reporting and financial systems. We also maintain modern supply chain systems allowing for operating efficiencies and scalability to support our continued growth. All of our stores operate under one integrated information technology platform. We believe our current information technology infrastructure will support our growth plans but plan on continuing our history of investment in this area. 

&#160;

Regulatory Compliance 

Our stores are subject to various local, state and federal laws, regulations and administrative practices affecting our business. We must comply with provisions regulating health and sanitation standards, food labeling, equal employment, minimum wages, environmental protection, licensing for the sale of food and, in many stores, licensing for beer and wine or other alcoholic beverages. Our operations, including the manufacturing, processing, formulating, packaging, labeling and advertising of products are subject to regulation by various federal agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration (referred to as the &#8220;FDA&#8221;), the Federal Trade Commission (referred to as the &#8220;FTC&#8221;), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (referred to as the &#8220;USDA&#8221;), the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency. 

Food. The FDA has comprehensive authority to regulate the safety of food and food ingredients (other than meat and poultry products), as well as dietary supplements. Food additives and food contact substances are subject to pre-market approvals or notification requirements. The FDA&#8217;s overall food safety authority was dramatically enhanced in 2011 with the passage of the Food Safety Modernization Act (referred to as &#8220;FSMA&#8221;). Implementing regulations, which begin to go into effect in 2016, will require food processors and handlers to design and implement effective measures to insure food safety. Additionally, FSMA increases the FDA&#8217;s authority to institute administrative detentions of adulterated and misbranded foods. FSMA is also likely to result in enhanced tracking and tracing of food requirements and, as a result, added recordkeeping burdens upon our suppliers and contract manufacturers. 

The FDA also exercises broad jurisdiction over the labeling and promotion of food. Labeling is a broad concept that, under certain circumstances, extends even to product-related claims and representations made on a company&#8217;s website or similar printed or graphic medium. All foods, including dietary supplements, must bear labeling that provides consumers with essential information with respect to ingredients, product weight, etc. The FDA administers a systematic review and approval program for certain &#8220;health claims&#8221; (claims describing the relationship between a food substance and a health or disease condition). It has also promulgated regulatory definitions for various &#8220;nutrient content claims&#8221; ( e.g., &#8220;high in antioxidants,&#8221; &#8220;low in fat,&#8221; etc.). In 2014, the FDA issued a proposed rule, still pending, that would amend the nutrition facts labeling standards on food products, which if adopted, could affect our costs through mandatory label or signage updates to products sold in our deli department. 

&#160;

&#160;

FDA and USDA Enforcement. The FDA has broad authority to enforce the provisions of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (referred to as &#8220;FDCA&#8221;) applicable to the safety, labeling, manufacturing and promotion of foods and dietary supplements, including powers to issue a public warning letter to a company, publicize information about illegal products, institute an administrative detention of food, request or order a recall of illegal products from the market, and request the Department of Justice to initiate a seizure action, an injunction action or a criminal prosecution in the U.S. courts. Similarly, the USDA&#8217;s Food Safety Inspection Service is th e public health agency responsible for ensuring that the nation&#8217;s commercial supply of meat, poultry and egg products is safe, wholesome and correctly labeled and packaged. 

Dietary Supplements. The FDCA has been amended several times with respect to dietary supplements, in particular by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (referred to as &#8220;DSHEA&#8221;). DSHEA established a framework governing the composition, safety, labeling, manufacturing and marketing of dietary supplements, defined &#8220;dietary supplement&#8221; and &#8220;new dietary ingredient&#8221; and established new statutory criteria for evaluating the safety of substances meeting the respective definitions. In the process, DSHEA removed dietary supplements and new dietary ingredients from pre-market approval requirements that apply to food additives and pharmaceuticals and established a combination of &#8220;notification&#8221; and &#8220;post marketing controls&#8221; for regulating product safety, however, non-dietary ingredients in a dietary supplement remain subject to the FDA&#8217;s food additive authorities. DSHEA also empowered the FDA to establish binding good manufacturing practice regulations governing key aspects of the production of dietary supplements. 

Food and Dietary Supplement Advertising. The FTC exercises jurisdiction over the advertising of foods and dietary supplements. The FTC has the power to institute monetary sanctions and the imposition of consent decrees and penalties that can severely limit a company&#8217;s business practices. In recent years, the FTC has instituted numerous enforcement actions against dietary supplement companies for failure to have adequate substantiation for claims made in advertising or for the use of false or misleading advertising claims. 

Compliance. As is common in our industry, we rely on our suppliers and contract manufacturers to ensure that the products they manufacture and sell to us comply with all applicable regulatory and legislative requirements. In general, we seek certifications of compliance, representations and warranties, indemnification and/or insurance from our suppliers and contract manufacturers. However, even with adequate insurance and indemnification, any claims of non-compliance could significantly damage our reputation and consumer confidence in products we sell. In addition, the failure of such products to comply with applicable regulatory and legislative requirements could prevent us from marketing the products or require us to recall or remove such products from our stores. In order to comply with applicable statutes and regulations, our suppliers and contract manufacturers have from time to time reformulated, eliminated or relabeled certain of their products and we have revised certain provisions of our sales and marketing program. 

Employees 

As of January 3, 2016, we had more than 20,000 team members. None of our team members are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relations with our team members to be good, and we have never experienced a strike or significant work stoppage.
