Our business consists principally of promoting racing events at these major motorsports entertainment facilities, which, in total, currently have approximately 763,500 &#32;grandstand seats and 548 &#32;suites. We earn revenues and generate substantial cash flows primarily from admissions, television media rights fees, promotion and sponsorship fees, hospitality rentals (including luxury suites, chalets and the hospitality portion of club seating), advertising revenues, royalties from licenses of our trademarks, parking and camping, and track rentals. We own Americrown Service Corporation (&#8220;Americrown&#8221;), which provides catering, concessions and services at certain of our motorsports entertainment facilities. We also own and operate the Motor Racing Network, Inc. ("MRN") radio network, also doing business under the name &#8220;MRN Radio&#8221;, the nation&#8217;s largest independent motorsports radio network in terms of event programming. We also have an equity investment in a Hollywood Casino at Kansas Speedway that has generated substantial equity earnings and cash distributions to us since its opening in fiscal year 2012. 

INCORPORATION 

We were incorporated in 1953 under the laws of the State of Florida under the name &#8220;Bill France Racing, Inc.&#8221; and changed our name to &#8220;Daytona International Speedway Corporation&#8221; in 1957. With the groundbreaking for Talladega Superspeedway in 1968, we changed our name to &#8220;International Speedway Corporation.&#8221; Our principal executive offices are located at One Daytona Boulevard, Daytona Beach, Florida 32114, and our telephone number is (386) 254-2700. We maintain a website at http://www.internationalspeedwaycorporation.com/ . The information on our website is not part of this report. 

OPERATIONS 

The general nature of our business is a motorsports themed amusement enterprise, furnishing amusement to the public in the form of motorsports themed entertainment. Our motorsports themed event operations consist principally of racing events at our major motorsports entertainment facilities, which include providing catering, and food and beverage concessions at our motorsports entertainment facilities that host NASCAR Sprint Cup Series events except for catering, and food and beverage concessions at Chicagoland and Route 66 . Our other operations include MRN; our 50.0 percent equity investment in the joint venture Kansas Entertainment, LLC ("Kansas Entertainment"), which operates the Hollywood Casino at Kansas Speedway; and certain other activities including souvenir merchandising operations. We derived approximately 88.8 &#32;percent of our 2015 &#32;revenues from NASCAR-sanctioned racing events at our wholly owned motorsports entertainment facilities. In addition to events sanctioned by NASCAR, in fiscal 2015 , we promoted other stock car, sports car, open wheel, motorcycle and go-kart racing events. 

Food, Beverage and Merchandise Operations 

We conduct, either through operations of the particular facility or through our wholly owned subsidiary, Americrown, food and beverage concession operations and catering services, both in suites and chalets, for customers at each of our motorsports entertainment facilities with the exception of food and beverage concessions and catering services at Chicagoland and Route 66. In January 2015, the Company entered into a 10-year agreement with Fanatics Retail Group Concessions, Inc. ("Fanatics") for Fanatics to have exclusive retail merchandise rights for its track trademarks and certain other intellectual property at all ISC tracks (see Merchandising Operations in Future Trends In Operating Results of MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS). 

Motor Racing Network, Inc. 

Our wholly owned subsidiary, MRN, also does business under the name &#8220;MRN Radio&#8221;. While not a radio station, MRN creates motorsports-related programming content carried on radio stations around the country, as well as a national satellite radio service, Sirius XM Radio. MRN produces and syndicates to radio stations live coverage of the NASCAR Sprint Cup, Xfinity and Camping World Truck series races and certain other races conducted at our motorsports entertainment facilities, as well as some races conducted at motorsports entertainment facilities we do not own. Sirius XM Radio also compensates MRN for the contemporaneous re-airing of race broadcasts and certain other production services. MRN produces and provides unique content to its website, http://www.motorracingnetwork.com/ , and derives revenue from the sale of advertising on such website. Each motorsports entertainment facility has the ability to separately contract for the rights to radio broadcasts of NASCAR and certain other events held at its location. In addition, MRN provides production services for Sprint Vision, the trackside large screen video display units, at NASCAR Sprint Cup Series event weekends that take place at our motorsports facilities, as well as at Dover International Speedway and Pocono Raceway. MRN also produces and syndicates daily and weekly NASCAR racing-themed programs. MRN derives revenue from the sale of national advertising contained in its syndicated programming, the sale of advertising and audio and video production services for Sprint Vision, as well as from rights fees paid by radio stations that broadcast the programming. 

EQUITY INVESTMENT 

Hollywood Casino at Kansas Speedway 

We have a 50/50 partnership with Penn Hollywood Kansas Inc. (&#8220;Penn&#8221;), a subsidiary of Penn National Gaming Inc., which operates a Hollywood-themed and branded destination entertainment facility, overlooking turn two at Kansas. Penn is the managing member of Kansas Entertainment and is responsible for the operation of the casino. 

Other Activities 

From time to time, we use our motorsports entertainment facilities for testing for teams, driving schools, riding experiences, car shows, auto fairs, concerts, music festivals and settings for television commercials, print advertisements and motion pictures. We also rent &#8220;show cars&#8221; for promotional events. 

Competition 

We are among the largest owners of major motorsports themed entertainment facilities based on revenues, number of facilities owned and/or operated, number of motorsports themed events promoted and market capitalization. Racing events compete with other professional sports such as football, basketball, hockey and baseball, as well as other recreational events and activities. Our events also compete with other racing events sanctioned by various racing bodies such as NASCAR, the American Sportbike Racing Association &#8212; Championship Cup Series, United States Auto Club (&#8220;USAC&#8221;), Sports Car Club of America (&#8220;SCCA&#8221;), IMSA, IndyCar Series, Automobile Racing Club of America (&#8220;ARCA&#8221;) and others, many of which are often held on the same dates at separate motorsports entertainment facilities. We believe that the type and caliber of promoted racing 

events, facility location, sight lines, pricing, variety of motorsports themed amusement options and level of customer conveniences and amenities are the principal factors that distinguish competing motorsports entertainment facilities. 

Employees 

As of November 30, 2015 &#32;we had over 807 &#32;full-time employees. We also engage a significant number of temporary personnel to assist during periods of peak attendance at our events, some of whom are volunteers. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We believe that we enjoy a good relationship with our employees.
