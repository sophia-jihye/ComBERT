Forward-Looking Information 

Some of the statements in this document and any documents incorporated by reference, including any statements as to operational and financial projections, constitute &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;). These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our businesses&#8217; or our industries&#8217; actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. Such statements may address our plans, our strategies, our prospects, changes and trends in our business and the markets in which we operate under the heading &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; (&#8220;MD&#38;A&#8221;) or in other sections of this document. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;could,&#8221; &#8220;would,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;expect,&#8221; &#8220;plan,&#8221; &#8220;anticipate,&#8221; &#8220;intend,&#8221; &#8220;believe,&#8221; &#8220;estimate,&#8221; &#8220;predict,&#8221; &#8220;project,&#8221; &#8220;potential&#8221; or &#8220;continue&#8221; or the negative of those terms or other comparable terminology. Particular risks facing us include economic, business and other risks stemming from our recent spin-off transaction, internal operations, legal and regulatory risks, costs of raw materials, pricing pressures, pension funding requirements, integration of acquisitions and changes in the economy. These statements are only predictions. Actual events or results may differ materially because of market conditions in our industries or other factors, and forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results. In addition, management&#8217;s estimates of future operating results are based on our current complement of businesses, which is subject to change as management selects strategic markets. 

All the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the factors discussed under the heading &#8220;Risk Factors,&#8221; in this filing and any subsequent filing with the SEC, as well as in any documents incorporated by reference that describe risks and factors that could cause results to differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements. We caution you that these risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment and frequently enter into new businesses and product lines.

Business 

We were incorporated in Muskegon, Michigan in 1912 as the Piston Ring Company and adopted our current name in 1988. Since 1968, we have been incorporated under the laws of Delaware, and we have been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since 1972. 

On September 26, 2015 (the &#8220;Distribution Date&#8221;), we completed the spin-off to our stockholders (the &#8220;Spin-Off&#8221;) of all the outstanding shares of SPX FLOW, Inc. (&#8220;SPX FLOW&#8221;), a wholly-owned subsidiary of SPX Corporation ("SPX") prior to the Spin-Off, which at the time of the Spin-Off held the businesses comprising our Flow Technology reportable segment, our Hydraulic Technologies business, and certain of our corporate subsidiaries (collectively, the &#8220;FLOW Business&#8221;). On the Distribution Date, each of our stockholders of record as of the close of business on September 16, 2015 (the &#8220;Record Date&#8221;) received one share of common stock of SPX FLOW for every share of SPX common stock held as of the Record Date. SPX FLOW is now an independent public company trading under the symbol &#8220;FLOW&#8221; on the New York Stock Exchange. Following the Spin-Off, SPX&#8217;s common stock continues to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, but trades under the new ticker symbol, &#8220;SPXC&#8221;. 

Unless otherwise indicated, amounts provided in Part I pertain to continuing operations only (see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for information on discontinued operations). 

We are a diversified, global supplier of infrastructure equipment with (i) scalable growth platforms in heating, ventilation and air conditioning (&#8220;HVAC&#8221;) and detection and measurement markets and (ii) a strong presence in power and energy markets.

Our power businesses are committed to driving value through continued focus on operational and engineering efficiencies. 

Reportable Segments 

As indicated in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, during the third quarter of 2015, we realigned our segment reporting structure. Under the realigned structure, we have aggregated our operating segments into the following three reportable segments: HVAC, Detection and Measurement, and Power. The factors considered in determining our aggregated segments are the economic similarity of the businesses, the nature of products sold or services provided, production processes, types of customers, distribution methods, and regulatory environment. In determining our segments, we apply the threshold criteria of the Segment Reporting Topic of the Codification to operating income or loss of each segment before considering impairment and special charges, pension and postretirement expense/income, stock-based compensation and other indirect corporate expenses. This is consistent with the way our Chief Operating Decision Maker evaluates the results of each segment. 

HVAC Reportable Segment 

Our HVAC reportable segment had revenues of $529.1 , $ 535.7 &#32;and $ 497.3 &#32;in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively, and backlog of $ 31.1 &#32;and $ 44.6 &#32;as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. Approximately 99 % of the segment's backlog as of December 31, 2015 &#32;is expected to be recognized as revenue during 2016 . The segment engineers, designs, manufactures, installs and services cooling products for the HVAC and industrial markets, as well as heating and ventilation products for the residential and commercial markets.

Acquisitions 

We did not acquire any businesses in 2015, 2014 or 2013. However, we regularly review and negotiate potential acquisitions in the ordinary course of business, some of which are or may be material. 

Divestitures 

We regularly review and negotiate potential divestitures in the ordinary course of business, some of which are or may be material. As a result of this continuous review, we determined that certain of our businesses would be better strategic fits with other companies or investors. 

The following businesses, which have been sold or for which operations have been terminated, have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented:

Joint Ventures 

As of December 31, 2013, we had a joint venture, EGS Electrical Group, LLC and Subsidiaries ("EGS"), with Emerson Electric Co., in which we held a 44.5% interest. EGS operates primarily in the United States, Brazil, Canada and France and is engaged in the manufacture of electrical fittings, hazardous location lighting and power conditioning products. We accounted for our investment using the equity method, on a three-month lag basis, and we typically received our share of the joint venture's earnings in cash dividends paid quarterly. On January 7, 2014, we completed the sale of our 44.5% interest in EGS to Emerson Electric Co. for cash proceeds of $574.1. As a result of the sale, we 

recorded a gain of $491.2 to "Other income (expense), net" and no equity earnings related to this investment during 2014. 

We have a joint venture with the Shanghai Electric Group Co., Ltd. ("Shanghai Electric"), in which we hold a 45% interest. Shanghai Electric controls and operates the joint venture, which supplies dry cooling and moisture separator reheater products primarily to the power sector in China. We account for this investment using the equity method. 

International Operations 

We are a multinational corporation with operations in approximately 20 countries. Sales outside the United States were $463.9 , $650.1 &#32;and $682.7 &#32;in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on our international operations. 

Research and Development 

We are actively engaged in research and development programs designed to improve existing products and manufacturing methods and to develop new products to better serve our current and future customers. These efforts encompass certain of our products with divisional engineering teams coordinating their resources. We place particular emphasis on the development of new products that are compatible with, and build upon, our manufacturing and marketing capabilities. 

We expensed $30.4 , $32.2 &#32;and $32.0 &#32;in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, of research activities relating to the development and improvement of our products. 

Patents/Trademarks 

We own approximately 180 domestic and 140 foreign patent "families", including approximately 7 patents that were issued in 2015, covering a variety of our products and manufacturing methods. We also own a number of registered trademarks. Although in the aggregate our patents and trademarks are of considerable importance in the operation of our business, we do not consider any single patent or trademark to be of such importance that its absence would adversely affect our ability to conduct business as presently constituted. We are both a licensor and licensee of patents. For more information, please refer to "Risk Factors." 

Outsourcing and Raw Materials 

We manufacture many of the components used in our products; however, our strategy includes outsourcing certain components and sub-assemblies to other companies where strategically and economically beneficial. In instances where we depend on third-party suppliers for outsourced products or components, we are subject to the risk of customer dissatisfaction with the quality or performance of the products we sell due to supplier failure. In addition, business difficulties experienced by a third-party supplier can lead to the interruption of our ability to obtain the outsourced product and ultimately to our inability to supply products to our customers. We believe that we generally will be able to continue to obtain adequate supplies of key products or appropriate substitutes at reasonable costs. 

We are subject to increases in the prices of many of our key raw materials, including petroleum-based products, steel and copper. In recent years, we have generally been able to offset increases in raw material costs. Occasionally, we are subject to long-term supplier contracts, which may increase our exposure to pricing fluctuations. We use forward contracts to manage our exposure on forecasted purchases of commodity raw materials ("commodity contracts"). See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on commodity contracts. 

Due to our diverse products and services, as well as the wide geographic dispersion of our production facilities, we use numerous sources for the raw materials needed in our operations. We are not significantly dependent on any one or a limited number of suppliers, and we have been able to obtain suitable quantities of raw materials at competitive prices. 

Competition 

Our competitive position cannot be determined accurately in the aggregate or by reportable or operating segment since we and our competitors do not offer all the same product lines or serve all the same markets. In addition, specific reliable comparative figures are not available for many of our competitors. In most product groups, competition comes from numerous concerns, both large and small. The principal methods of competition are service, product performance, technical innovation and price. These methods vary with the type of product sold. We believe we compete effectively on the basis of each of these factors as they apply to the various products and services offered. See "Reportable Segments" above for a discussion of our competitors. 

Environmental Matters 

See "MD&#38;A &#8212; Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates &#8212; Contingent Liabilities," "Risk Factors" and Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding environmental matters. 

Employment 

At December 31, 2015, we had over 6,000 employees. Six domestic collective bargaining agreements covered approximately 1,000 employees. We also had various collective labor arrangements as of that date covering certain non-U.S. employee groups. While we generally have experienced satisfactory labor relations, we are subject to potential union campaigns, work stoppages, union negotiations and other potential labor disputes. 

Executive Officers 

See Part III, Item 10 of this report for information about our executive officers. 

Other Matters 

No customer or group of customers that, to our knowledge, are under common control accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues for any period presented. 

Our businesses maintain sufficient levels of working capital to support customer requirements, particularly inventory. We believe our businesses' sales and payment terms are generally similar to those of our competitors. 

Many of our businesses closely follow changes in the industries and end markets they serve. In addition, certain businesses have seasonal fluctuations. Historically, our businesses generally tend to be stronger in the second half of the year.
