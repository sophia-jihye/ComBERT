Principal Products, Services and Their Markets 

&#160;

Our company provides comprehensive landscaping services centered on the fundamental promotion of water conservation through 'green' gardening practices in the greater Los Angeles area. California is, currently, in the midst of an unprecedented 4-year drought, and in fact, one of the worst periods of drought in the state's recorded history. In summer, the temperatures in the Greater Los Angeles area and surrounding valleys consistently soar to record-high levels, and the supporting water reservoirs are critically low. Traditionally, Southern California relies on the rainy season from December to April to replenish reservoirs that are used for everything from vital agricultural irrigation and drinking water, to manufacturing industries, to household use, which includes a staggering proportion for lawn and garden watering. Historically, the moisture-heavy winter storms that rolled in over the Sierra Nevada mountains deposited large alpine snow packs that subsequently melted in spring months to supply up to 30% of the state's water requirements. Now, while it appears that the winter of 2015-2016 has supplied some relief in the form of El Nino induced storms, 2015 saw the existing snow pack at its second-lowest level on record. The federal government has warned farmers in the Central Valley of California that for the 2nd year in a row, it will not provide any water from its Central Valley reservoir system &#8211; a tremendous setback to an international multi-billion dollar industry.

&#160; &#160; 4 

&#160;

In March 2015, state regulators voted to impose a new round of broad-based water conservation rules. From the once routine pouring of water into glasses at the restaurant table, to the often daily irrigation of front and backyard lawns and gardens, the government is initiating sweeping changes in response to the recognized crises. Furthermore, based on recent years, and with the assessment for this year, farmers anticipate leaving as much as one million acres fallow, nearly twice the area that went unplanted last year. In cities such as Santa Barbara, desalination plants that have hitherto gone unused, are now being restored and brought on line to help meet the fresh water demand. In short, while the El Nino storms of 2015-2016 provided some short term relief, there is no evidence to conclude that the current crisis will ease anytime soon, hence, California is in dire need of strategies for water diversion and conservation.

&#160;

The motivation for our company came in part from the desire to help address California's drought crisis by providing individuals with the ability to choose sustainable water-saving landscape alternatives. Our sustainable garden solutions not only offer an array of options for groundcover and plant materials, but select species that are naturally more indigenous to the arid environment and flourish in such climates. The idea of a "desert oasis," planting high water-demand plants in an arid setting is no longer realistic from an environmental or economic perspective. Through selecting beautiful low-demand plant material, alongside natural stone surfaces, dramatic landscape settings can be created to conserve both water and money realized year after year.

&#160;

For individuals seeking to maintain a more traditional appearance of their gardens with the juxtaposition of grass in this emerging desert landscape, our company has specifically targeted the use of ultra-realistic faux grass to supplant the use of real grass for 'lawnscapes'. The technology of faux grass has made significant strides in quality, aesthetic, and price over recent years. Older versions of faux grass, or artificial turf as it was more commonly called, often lacked the look and feel of real grass, was prone to fading and wear, and was in some cases hazardous in its construction - containing unwanted elements such as lead. Previous generations of faux grass simply could not match the beauty of a real, lush lawn, however, this is no longer the case. Faux grass is now a well-constructed, durable, safe, and viable alternative to real grass, with remarkable visual similarities to real grass. Faux grass lawns are purposely built, determining density and height of grass 'blades' based on needs of residential and commercial uses. From pet ownership to recreational playing fields, these made in the USA solutions are readily available and highly customizable.

&#160;

Our company is in the process of determining landscaping options that include plants that are misers with water, as well as natural patio stones and bricks that when blended all together, create a spectacular and realistic yard. Our company will do all of the project construction and ensure that each element is properly designed and installed. We company will also warranty all of our work.

&#160;

The market for our services is currently strong and growing, with now even local governments in Los Angeles providing cash subsidies to homeowners when they convert to sustainable landscaping. Our company will provide full service care for residential and commercial properties, from initial landscape design, to hard and soft materials selection, plant or synthetic groundcovers, as well as installation. As water conservation emerges in the consciousness of the consumer, our company is positioned to be a leading resource for innovation in this field.

&#160;

While our company is based in Glendale, California, we are planning to do our initial test marketing in the wealthy enclave known as the greater "South Bay" communities such as Manhattan Beach, Hermosa Beach, Palos Verdes, Redondo Beach, and the Pacific Palisades are all nearby and generally have upper tier demographics. This market has both the means and the social awareness to embrace our green water-saving concept. Homeowners in these areas often have fantastic properties and put a high value on aesthetic, and when this is coupled with a social obligation to conserve water, a powerful marketing case is created. Our company will eventually expand beyond the South Bay market and ultimately encompass all of the greater Los Angeles region, however, it is felt that starting in relatively more affluent areas is most prudent.

&#160;

Distribution Methods 

&#160;

Potential customers will find our company primarily through an on-line campaign that will leverage our website (http://www.go2greenlandscaping.com). On-line ads and marketing platforms such as Google Adwords will be employed in our initial campaign. It is also hoped that as our marketing takes hold and customers start to enjoy our services that a solid referral network will come into being. Our company will also take out strategic ads and place coupons in local home flyers and home and garden publications.

&#160;

Our company has no new publicly announced products or services.

&#160;

Competitive Business Conditions and Strategy; the Company's Position in the Industry 

&#160;

Our company will compete with other local faux grass and landscape installation companies. Established companies such as AGI (Artificial Grass Inc.) and "Fass" Fake Grass, among others, are well established in the Greater Los Angeles market and produce quality work. We will be in direct competition with these firms, and will hopefully carve out our own niche in this rapidly expanding market. What will set our company apart is that we will provide an all-encompassing water conservation and landscape solution. In essence, our company will approach each customer and look at their lawn, garden, and landscaping needs in their totality.

&#160;

We will be able to assess all aspects of a customer's landscaping needs, from the installation of faux grass, to the determining of proper plants and foliage, to the shipping and installation of landscape construction materials. Rather than simply being a one off turf installer, we will provide complete landscaping solutions that aesthetically blend all of the elements together to create water conserving function, with eye-pleasing form. Everything will be geared to bringing water usage to an absolute minimum, but do it in a way that exceeds our customer's expectations and almost masks the underlying purpose with the sheer beauty of the finished product.

&#160;

Our company will also act as a go to educational resource that can provide do-it -yourself information for customers that are both inclined to research and perhaps tackle projects on their own. Information will be primarily gleaned through our website and downloadable conservation and landscaping whitepapers. Customers will be able to get a wealth of technical detail and step by step installation advice. We will also provide key details on government incentives that can significantly reduce the cost of a project, as well as long term cost savings vs. keeping their existing real-grass yard. Our goal in providing as much information as possible is to empower our customers to make informed decisions, and also to do our part to mitigate the larger water crisis whenever possible. We are also confident that a high percentage of those that purchase our materials will also become customers and purchasers of our complete landscaping solution.

&#160;

Talent Sources and Names of Principal Suppliers 

&#160;

The key to our success will be in the quality of our leadership and the degree to which we excel in our customer service. We feel that we have retained the right talent to succeed. Tom Toth is a local Los Angeles contractor, who has built a number of successful construction businesses. Mr. Toth currently owns Pacific Vinyl Fences, which installs state of the art durable fencing, deck and patio covers. Mr. Toth, in operating his current business, was struck by the degree to which customers were also asking him about faux grass and ecological landscaping.

&#160;

Mr. Toth would frequently refer inquires to others, until he realized that the market was ripe to provide the solution in-house and do so in concert with a larger ecological good. Mr. Toth has also done a considerable amount of practical research and has identified local garden centers that can provide low water consumption plants and greenery, as well as local wholesalers of faux grass that is 100% American made and of high quality. Also, through Mr. Toth's network of construction industry contacts, a reliable source of landscaping materials has been identified.

&#160;

Our company is also in the process of acquiring the services of a landscape designer that can render 3-D designs and graphic illustrations. The main goal being to supply a seamless customer experience from the first estimate, through to the design and construction phases.

&#160;

Our company has also services of John Scavo. Mr. Scavo is an established Los Angeles based entrepreneur. Mr. Scavo has founded a number of successful companies, and he currently specializes in supplying high quality catering for the motion picture business. The focus for John is to always supply high quality meals that come from sustainable and natural sources whenever possible. His keen interest in providing environmentally friendly products has piqued John's interest in our company. He is willing to devote his marketing and sales expertise to our company and build a comprehensive marketing strategy that will connect our company with our targeted upper-tier demographic. Mr. Scavo also realizes the tertiary benefit of our company, in that every gallon of water saved domestically can help go to the irrigation of sustainable and natural crops (food stuffs) &#8211; that he of course relies on in his other line of work.
