Business Introduction/Summary

&#160;

References herein to &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;Sunworks,&#8221; and &#8220;the Company&#8221; are to Sunworks, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Sunworks United, Inc. (&#8220;Sunworks United&#8221;), MD Energy, Inc. (&#8220;MD Energy&#8221;), and Elite Solar Acquisition Sub, Inc. (&#8220;Elite Solar&#8221;). All dollar figures are in thousands (000&#8217;s) unless otherwise specified. 

&#160;

We provide photo voltaic (&#8220;PV&#8221;) based power systems for the residential, commercial and agricultural markets in California and Nevada. Through our operating subsidiaries, we design, arrange financing, integrate, install and manage systems ranging in size from 2kW (kilowatt) for residential loads to multi MW (megawatt) systems for larger commercial projects. Commercial installations have included office buildings, manufacturing plants, warehouses, and agricultural facilities such as farms, wineries and dairies. The Company provides a full range of installation services to our solar energy customers including design, system engineering, procurement, permitting, construction, grid connection, warranty, system monitoring and maintenance.

&#160;

We adhere to the business principles of:

1.

Doing what is right for the customer

2.

Delivering the best value in our industry; and

3.

Doing what we say we will do.

We have installed over 850 systems in 2015 in California and Nevada, an approximately 18 MW of capacity, which is more than a 250% increase over the approximately 300 systems installations and 7MW of capacity in 2014. 

Approximately 60% of our 2015 revenue was from sales to the commercial market, including the agricultural market, and approximately 40% of our revenue was from sales to the residential market.

&#160;

In addition to our core solar integrator business, our technology division has developed a patent-pending 3-dimensional solar cell technology that we believe has the potential to increase PV conversion efficiency thereby reducing the cost of the electricity generated.

&#160;

&#160;

Recent Developments

Name Change 

&#160;

On March 1, 2016, we changed our name to Sunworks, Inc. with simultaneous NASDAQ stock symbol change from SLTD to SUNW. Also, on February 26, 2016, we changed the name of our subsidiary, Solar United Network, Inc. to Sunworks United, Inc.

&#160; Closing of Elite Solar Acquisition 

&#160;

On August 6, 2015, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#8220;Merger Agreement&#8221;) with Plan B Enterprises, Inc., a California corporation and d/b/a Universal Racking Solutions (&#8220;Plan B&#8221;), Kirk R. Short and Elite Solar Acquisition Sub., Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the &#8220;Surviving Corporation&#8221;) whereby Plan B merged with and into the Surviving Corporation. The transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, as amended, closed on December 1, 2015. We paid a consideration of $7 million, with $2.5 million paid in cash and 1,506,024 in shares of our Series B Preferred Stock valued at $4.5 million.

&#160;

Market Opportunity

&#160;

We believe the following trends will contribute to the growth and prospects of our business:

&#160;

&#183;

Growing Market for Solar Energy. The market for residential distributed solar energy is growing rapidly. According to research compiled by GTM Research, an industry research firm, and the Solar Energy Industries Association, or SEIA, 7.4 gigawatts of capacity will be installed within the U.S. solar energy market in 2015, up 19% over 2014. GTM Research/SEIA forecasts that installations in 2016 will be up 25-50% over 2015. We believe that the market is growing rapidly yet possesses significant growth opportunities since solar energy is still a small percentage of the U.S. energy market. We believe that there is a significant opportunity for distributed solar energy to increasingly displace traditional retail electricity generated from fossil fuels.

&#183;

Strong Regional Markets . According to the U.S. Solar Market Insight Report, 4.1 gigawatts of solar power were installed in the US in the first 3 quarters of 2015, of which we believe, over half were installed in California and Nevada, our target market.

&#183;

Highly Fragmented Industry . The solar installer industry is highly fragmented and populated with many companies that have been born out of the electrical contractors industry. The solar installer industry has already undergone significant consolidation with the number of installers in California alone dropping, according to the U.S. Department of Energy, from 1,000 between 2009 and 2013 to 600 in 2014. While we believe that some consolidation has occurred, we also believe that there is opportunity for further consolidation.

&#160;

Strategy

&#160;

Our strategy for growth is twofold. First, we plan to continue to expand the reach and penetration of our existing businesses. Second, we also to plan to selectively acquire PV installers that are financially stable, quality oriented, profitable and have a strong management team that is compatible with our existing team.

&#160;

Our acquisition candidates primarily consist of small independent companies that generate between $15 million to $50 million of revenues profitably, but lack the resources to scale their businesses. This limits the exit options for the owners of these companies. We believe that a sale to us will offer them a liquidity opportunity and an opportunity to participate in the continued growth of the business with our resources through convertible notes issued in the acquisition.

&#160;

Our acquisition criteria include the following:

&#160;

&#183;

Same Target Market &#8211; Companies in the residential and commercial markets.

&#183;

Willingness to Continue Participation &#8211; Prefer management of acquired companies to continue in an operating role.

&#183;

Compatible and Collaborative Management &#8211; Target management must be willing to accept our best practices.

&#183;

Profitable &#8211; Companies that generate an operating profit.

&#183;

Location &#8211; Currently focused on the western states markets.

&#160;

We believe the keys to success in acquiring companies are to buy the right company, with a good transaction structure, and with strong management in place. Our management team has experience in successfully executing a strategy of acquiring companies that have become successful enterprises under their new ownership.

&#160;

&#160;

Company Operations

&#160;

Employees

&#160;

We employ a total of approximately 200 full-time employees. We also utilize outside subcontractors to assist with providing solar systems to our customers. We split our direct labor between employees and contract labor. With each acquisition, we look to transition the majority of back office functions to our corporate headquarters to reduce costs and make our operations consistent across our subsidiaries. We believe that our strategy of consolidating such functions as purchasing, supplier relations, accounting, human resources and other basic functions help to realize cost reductions and strategic synergies.

&#160;

Sales and Marketing

&#160;

We have approximately 70 employees primarily focused on sales and marketing in California and Nevada. Over 60% of our commercial sales and approximately 40% of our sales to the residential market are generated by referrals.

&#160;

In Northern California, we have specially-designed marketing efforts and tracking systems in place that enable us to attract new customers at a low cost and higher conversion rate than what we believe to be the industry average. The Company utilizes several marketing tools and business strategies to differentiate itself from its competitors and attract new customers, including its proprietary proposal tool, its proprietary CRM (customer relationship management software), radio shows and celebrity endorsements, our website, search engine optimization, social media, email marketing, direct mailers, its solar outreach division (canvassing, trade shows and events, solar open houses), call center, strategic partnerships/joint ventures, sponsorships, shared space in retail stores, solar stations (kiosks) and its referral program.

&#160;

In our Southern California operations, we have a strong advantage in the commercial solar market given our extensive contact list resulting from our experience in the commercial and industrial construction market, which provides access to customer lists. Through our network of vendors and independent sales consultants, we now have a growing list of repeat clients, as well as an active and loyal referral network.

&#160;

Financing

&#160;

To promote sales, we assist customers in obtaining financing. Our objective is to arrange the most flexible terms that meet the needs and wants of the customer. Although we do not provide financing ourselves, we have relationships to arrange financing with numerous private and public sources, including PACE (Property Assessed Clean Energy) Programs, which are programs that involve both municipal governments and private financing companies that allow property owners to receive upfront funding for renewable energy projects, and Farm Credit financing offered by a network of lending institutions.

&#160;

We believe it is best for customers to own their own systems, but some customers prefer not to own their systems. We also have the ability to arrange financing with third parties through power purchase agreements (&#8220;PPAs&#8221;) and leases for our customers.

&#160;

Suppliers

&#160;

We purchase solar panels and materials directly from multiple manufacturers. We intend to further coordinate purchases and optimize supply relationships to realize the advantages of greater scale.

&#160;

If one or more of our suppliers fail to meet our anticipated demand, or ceases or reduces production due to its financial condition, acquisition by a competitor or otherwise, it may be difficult to quickly identify alternate suppliers or to qualify alternative products on commercially reasonable terms, and our ability to satisfy this demand may be adversely affected. We do not, however, rely on any single supplier and, we believe, we can obtain needed solar panels and materials from a number of different suppliers. Accordingly, we believe that the loss of any single supplier would not materially affect our business.

&#160;

We also utilize strategic companies with subcontractors, such as Tiger Electric, Inc. for electrical installations, Aerotek Inc. for racking and module installations, as well as numerous subcontractors for grading, landscaping, and construction for our large commercial, industrial and agricultural customers.

&#160;

Installation

&#160;

We are a licensed contractor in the markets we serve, and we are responsible for every customer installation. We manage the entire process from permitting through inspection to interconnection to the power grid, thereby making the system installation process simple and seamless for our customers. Controlling every aspect of the installation process allows us to minimize costs, ensure quality and deliver high levels of customer satisfaction.

&#160;

&#160;

After-Sales Support

&#160;

It is our intent to provide continuing operation and maintenance services for our installed residential and commercial PV system. We provide extended factory equipment technical support and act as a service liaison using our proprietary knowledge, technology and solar electric energy engineering staff. We do this through a 25 Year Limited Workmanship Warranty and Operations and Maintenance Program, which among other things provide a service and technical support line to our customers. We generally respond to our job site related issues within 24 hours and offer assistance as long as required to maintain customer satisfaction. Our price to customers includes this warranty, which is essentially a pass through of manufacturers&#8217; warranty.

&#160;

Facilities

&#160;

Our corporate headquarters was relocated from Santa Barbara, California to Roseville, California during the fourth quarter of 2015. We maintain sales and installation offices in Roseville, California, in Reno, Nevada, in Rancho Cucamonga, California and in Durham, California. We lease all of our offices and facilities.

&#160;

Customers

&#160;

Currently, the majority of our revenue comes from installations in California with a small amount in Nevada. Approximately 60% of our sales in 2015 were in the commercial/agricultural market and approximately 40% were generated by residential sales, but we expect that these percentages will vary from year to year.

&#160;

Our residential operations address the needs of property owners installing systems smaller than 20kW. The typical residential system installed is about 6kW with an average cycle time of 45 days. We facilitate purchase or lease financing and offer product options to fit the specific needs of each customer.

&#160;

We also install systems for the commercial market, which includes offerings to agricultural customers. We define small commercial projects as the installation of systems under 100kW, whereas large commercial projects involve the installation of systems greater than 100kW. Solar projects have received limited financing from traditional lending sources but we have been encouraged by municipal PACE programs in California which have drawn funding sources such as Ygrene and California First into the financing of energy projects. Cycle times vary from fifteen to twenty weeks, which is a common cycle for commercial projects. Larger projects typically have a longer cycle time than smaller projects. Agricultural system sizes vary significantly within this sector and can range from 10kW to multiple megawatts. Agricultural loans to farmers and tax-oriented leases are the primary funding sources within the industry. Similar to commercial installations, cycle times for agricultural projects may commonly range from fifteen to twenty weeks or longer for larger projects.

&#160;

Competitors

&#160;

In the solar installation market, we compete with companies that offer products similar to ours. Some of these companies have greater financial resources, operational experience and technical capabilities than us. When bidding for solar installation projects, however, our current experience suggests that there is no clear dominant or preferred competitor in the markets in which we compete. We do not believe that any competitor has more than 10% of the market across all of the areas that we operate. We compete with other solar installers on pricing, service and the ability to arrange financing. On a global scale, we also compete, on a cost basis, with traditional utilities that supply electricity to our potential customers and with companies that are not regulated like traditional utilities but that have access to the traditional utility electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure pursuant to state and local pro-competitive and consumer choice policies. Our advantage over traditional utilities is that we offer customers the opportunity to create their own electricity and detach from the traditional electrical grid.

&#160;

Seasonality

&#160;

Exposure to seasonality in our sales patterns is largely mitigated because of the breadth of our business offerings to residential, commercial and agricultural customers. We do find, however, that some customers tend to book projects by the end of a calendar year to realize the benefits of available subsidy programs prior to year-end. This results in fourth quarter sales being more robust usually at the expense of the first quarter. The first quarter in California often has rain, which also reduces our ability to install in that quarter relative to the remainder of the year.

&#160;

&#160;

Technology and Intellectual Property

&#160;

Generally, the solar installation business is not dependent on intellectual property. With respect to our research efforts, patent applications have been filed for the Sunworks 3-dimensional solar cell technology for nationalization in the United States, China, Singapore, and India. The novel 3D cell, which is still in the development stage, is designed to collect sunlight from a wide angle and allow light to bounce around within 3-dimensional microstructures on the solar cell surface more fully absorbing the light than traditional solar cells. To commercialize this technology, we plan to work with a manufacturing partner that has the capability to assist with the remaining steps (prototyping and volume runs to verify and prove improvement in conversion efficiency). Research and development expense was $53 and $113 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

&#160;

During 2015, we have invested in the development and implementation of Vista by Viewpoint, a robust enterprise management system, to facilitate the efficient integration and management of our recent and any future acquisitions. We expect to begin working with the new software for 2016 operations and accounting.

&#160;

Government Regulation and Incentives

&#160;

Government Regulation

We are not regulated as a public utility in the United States under applicable national, state or other local regulatory regimes where we conduct business.

&#160;

To operate our systems we obtain interconnection permission from the applicable local primary electric utility. Depending on the size of the solar energy system and local law requirements, interconnection permission is provided by the local utility and us and/or our customer. In almost all cases, interconnection permissions are issued on the basis of a standard process that has been pre-approved by the local public utility commission or other regulatory body with jurisdiction over net metering procedures. As such, no additional regulatory approvals are required once interconnection permission is given.

&#160;

Our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws, including regulations governing the occupational health and safety of our employees and wage regulations. For example, we are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended, or OSHA, the U.S. Department of Transportation, or DOT, and comparable state laws that protect and regulate employee health and safety.

&#160;

Government Incentives

&#160;

Federal, state and local government bodies provide incentives to owners, end users, distributors, system integrators and manufacturers of solar energy systems to promote solar energy in the form of rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives such as system performance payments , payments for renewable energy credits associated with renewable energy generation and exclusion of solar energy systems from property tax assessments. These incentives enable us to lower the price we charge customers for energy from, and to lease, our solar energy systems, helping to catalyze customer acceptance of solar energy as an alternative to utility-provided power.

&#160;

The Federal government currently offers a 30% Investment Tax Credit (&#8220;ITC&#8221;) under Section 48(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, or the ITC, for the installation of certain solar power facilities until December 31, 2016. By statute, this tax credit was scheduled to decrease to 10% on January 1, 2017, but was extended in December by Congress through 2019, after which it will fall to 26 percent in 2020, 22 percent in 2021 and 10 percent in 2022.

&#160;

The economics of purchasing a solar energy system are also improved by eligibility for accelerated depreciation, also known as the modified accelerated cost recovery system, or MACRS, depreciation, which allows for the depreciation of equipment according to an accelerated schedule set forth by the Internal Revenue Service. The acceleration of depreciation creates a valuable tax benefit that reduces the overall cost of the solar energy system and increases the return on investment.

&#160;

Approximately half of the states offer a personal and/or corporate investment or production tax credit for solar energy that is additive to the ITC. Further, more than half of the states, and many local jurisdictions, have established property tax incentives for renewable energy systems that include exemptions, exclusions, abatements and credits. Many state governments, traditional utilities, municipal utilities and co-operative utilities offer a rebate or other cash incentive for the installation and operation of a solar energy system or energy efficiency measures. Capital costs or &#8220;up-front&#8221; rebates provide funds to solar customers based on the cost, size or expected production of a customer&#8217;s solar energy system. Performance-based incentives provide cash payments to a system owner based on the energy generated by their solar energy system during a pre-determined period, and they are paid over that time period. Depending on the cost of the system and other site-specific variables, tax incentives can typically cover 30-40% of the cost of a commercial or residential solar system.

&#160;

&#160;

Many states also have adopted procurement requirements for renewable energy production. Thirty states and the District of Columbia have adopted a renewable portfolio standard that requires regulated utilities to procure a specified percentage of total electricity delivered to customers in the state from eligible renewable energy sources, such as solar energy systems, by a specified date. California&#8217;s renewable portfolio standard requires all utilities in the state to source 33% of their electric generation from renewable resources by 2020.

In December 2015, the Nevada Public Utilities Commission, which regulates the state&#8217;s energy market, announced a net metering rate change. Effective January 1, 2016, the new tariffs will gradually increase the monthly fees that solar users pay to use the electric grid and cut by 75% users&#8217; reimbursements for feeding electricity into the grid. The Commission&#8217;s decision is retroactive. Following public outcry, the Commission agreed to hold hearings to reconsider imposing the new rates on existing solar users, and NV Energy Department announced that it would not insist on the immediate retroactive provision but will gradually phase in the new rates for all solar customers over a 12-year period. In response to the regulation, we have begun to shift focus from the residential to the commercial markets which we believe still have economic viability.

Corporate History

&#160;

We were originally incorporated in Delaware on January 30, 2002 as MachineTalker, Inc. In September 2010, we shifted our engineering and research focus to developing a new means for generating solar-produced electrical power for use in the manufacture of highly efficient solar cells. In July 2010, we changed our company name to Solar3D, Inc. in order to better reflect our new business plan and filed for patent protection covering our new concepts for 3D solar cell designs. On January 31, 2014, we acquired 100% of the stock of Sunworks United, a California corporation. On March 2, 2015, we acquired MD Energy. On December 1, 2016, we acquired Plan B through a merger of Plan B Enterprises, Inc. into our wholly owned subsidiary, Elite Solar Acquisition Sub., Inc. On March 1, 2016 we changed our name to Sunworks, Inc. with simultaneous NASDAQ stock symbol change from SLTD to SUNW.
