 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

GENERAL 

Asure Software, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is a global provider of cloud-based software-as-a-service (&#8220;SaaS&#8221;) solutions that help companies bring people, time, space and assets together. 

Asure serves approximately 6,000 clients in 80 countries, ranging from global Fortune 500 clients to small and mid-sized businesses. Some of our clients include Aetna, Apple Inc., Baker &#38; McKenzie, Deutsche Bank, KPMG UK, La Trobe University, Merck and Co., Inc., Mondelez, Pfizer, Inc., Pearson, PSSI, Salesforce.com, Inc., State Street and Thomson Reuters. Our mission guides the work we do each day; it is &#8220;To deliver innovative technology with the passion to empower every client&#8217;s workplace and the commitment to make their workdays easier.&#8221; 

We currently offer a full suite of solutions to help clients optimize and manage their mobile workforces and their global workspaces. SaaS-based offerings include: asset management, mobile room scheduling, mobile time tracking, scheduling software, space utilization solutions, tablet-based time clocks, time and labor management software, traditional time clocks, touch panels for room scheduling, and workplace business intelligence (&#8220;BI&#8221;) analytics. All products are implemented using our proven client deployment model and supported with professional services and client support teams as needed. 

More than ever, companies are trying to get a handle on how to track, understand and optimize their real estate and time and labor costs in a world that is becoming increasingly mobile and global. With tele-commuting, hoteling (i.e., sharing of cubical space), and alternative working on the rise, executives have an opportunity to reinvent their workspaces to better meet the needs of their workforces and save millions in real estate costs. Similarly, mobile time tracking with geospatial and facial recognition technologies allows executives to better understand where and when their employees are working, and provides great insights into optimizing labor schedules and labor costs. Mobile time and tablet-based time tracking solutions also help combat &#8220;buddy punching&#8221;- when a dishonest worker covers for an absent co-worker by punching the company time clock for the absent worker- which can cost companies millions of dollars per year. 

We were incorporated in 1985 and our principal executive offices are located at 110 Wild Basin Road, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78746. Our telephone number is (512) 437-2700 and our website is www.asuresoftware.com. Information on our website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Asure makes available free of charge, on or through its website, our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file these materials or furnish them to the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

&#160; 

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 

&#160; 

Term Loan - Wells Fargo 

In March 2014, we entered into a credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (&#8220;N.A.&#8221;), as administrative agent, and the lenders that are party thereto (&#8220;Credit Agreement&#8221;). The Credit Agreement originally provided for a term loan in the amount of $15.0 million. The term loan will mature in March 2019. We amended the Credit Agreement in August 2014 to revise the leverage ratio beginning with the quarter ending September 30, 2014 to a leverage ratio of not greater than 3.6 to 1.0 with the levels stepping down thereafter. We further amended the Credit Agreement in March 2015 to authorize us to optionally prepay, subject to specified conditions, the Subordinated Note Payable to Roomtag and to revise the leverage ratio beginning with the quarter ended March 31, 2015 to a leverage ratio of not greater than 3.5 to 1.0 with the levels stepping down thereafter. We also amended the Credit Agreement in November 2015. The November 2015 amendment increased the applicable margin relative to the LIBOR rate upon which we compute the interest payable. We agreed that if our leverage ratio is (a) less than or equal to 2.25:1, (b) greater than 2.25:1 but less than or equal to 2.75:1, (c) greater than 2.75:1 but less than or equal to 3.25:1 or (d) greater than 3.25:1, the applicable margin relative to the LIBOR rate would be 3.00, 3.50, 4.00 or 4.50 percentage points, respectively. We further agreed that until the leverage ratio testing period ending September 30, 2016, we will pay interest based on the 4.50 percentage point margin level. 

&#160;

&#160; 

We amended the Credit Agreement again in March 2016 coincident with the acquisition of Mangrove Employer Services, Inc. of Tampa, Florida (&#8220;Mangrove&#8221;). Under this amendment, we expanded our overall credit facility by $12.5 million to $29.2 million. This includes a $26.2 million term facility which is due March 21, 2019 and a $3.0 million revolving credit facility. This amendment also changed the applicable margin rates for determining the interest rate payable on the loan as follows: 

Total Leverage Ratio 

&#160; Base Rate Margin 

&#160; &#160; LIBOR Rate Margin 

&#160; &#8804; 2.75:1 

&#160; &#160; 3.50 % &#160; &#160; 4.50 % &#62; 2.75:1 but &#8804; 3.25:1 

&#160; &#160; 4.00 % &#160; &#160; 5.00 % &#8805; 3.25:1 

&#160; &#160; 4.50 % &#160; &#160; 5.50 % 

We have agreed to repay the outstanding principal amount of the term loan as follows: 

&#183; $491,016 on June 30, 2016 and the last day of each fiscal quarter thereafter up to March 31, 2017; and 

&#183; $654,688 on June 30, 2017 and the last day of each fiscal quarter thereafter. 

&#160;

The March 2016 amendment also changed our leverage ratio requirements under the Credit Agreement. We have now agreed to a leverage ratio not to exceed 5.00:1 at March 31, 2016, stepping down to 2.25:1 at December 31, 2018. 

As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all covenants, with the exception of the leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio, and all payments remain current. A covenant waiver related to the leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio was received from the lender as of December 31, 2015. As a result of the waiver, we were in compliance with all covenant requirements as of December 31, 2015. We expect to be in compliance or be able to obtain compliance through debt repayments with the available cash on hand or as we expect to be generated from the ordinary course of operations over the next twelve months. 

See Note 6 - Note Payable in the accompanying financial statements for more information about the Credit Agreement and Guaranty and Security Agreement. 

2016 Acquisitions 

Through the stock and asset purchases described below, we have entered into the human resource management, payroll processing and benefits administration services businesses, which we intend to integrate into our existing AsureForce&#174; product line. 

Stock Purchase Agreement 

In March 2016, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock (the &#8220;Shares&#8221;) of Mangrove Employer Services, Inc. of Tampa, Florida (&#8220;Mangrove&#8221;). Pursuant to this stock purchase, we acquired the payroll division of Mangrove, which is engaged in the human resource management and payroll processing businesses. The aggregate consideration for the Shares consisted of (i) $11.3 million in cash, a portion of which was used to pay certain obligations of Mangrove and (ii) a secured subordinated promissory note (the &#8220;Note&#8221;) in the principal amount of $6.0 million, subject to adjustment as provided in the Stock Purchase Agreement. We funded the cash payment with proceeds from our credit agreement with Wells Fargo. The Note bears interest at an annual rate of 3.50% and matures in March, 2018, with the first installment of principal due in March, 2017 and the second installment of principal due in March, 2018. The Stock Purchase Agreement contains certain customary representations, warranties, indemnities and covenants. 

Asset Purchase Agreement 

In March, 2016, we also acquired substantially all the assets of Mangrove COBRAsource Inc., a benefits administration services business which then was a wholly owned subsidiary of Mangrove. The aggregate consideration for the assets was $1.0 million, which Mangrove COBRAsource applied to payoff certain loan balances. The Asset Purchase Agreement contains certain customary representations, warranties, indemnities and covenants. 

See Note 14- Subsequent Events in the accompanying financial statements for more information about the Stock Purchase Agreement and Asset Purchase Agreement. 

2014 Acquisitions 

In July 2014, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock (the &#8220;Shares&#8221;) of FotoPunch, Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#8220;FotoPunch&#8221;), a cloud-based time and labor solution provider whose photo-based time clock technology transforms any mobile device into a biometric, geo-located time clock. We have been working with FotoPunch since 2012 as a technology partner for our GeoPunch&#8482; solution, which was launched to help customers support a workforce that is increasingly mobile, global and dispersed. 

&#160;

&#160; 

The aggregate consideration for the Shares consisted of (i) $1.5 million in cash, a portion of which was used to pay certain obligations of FotoPunch and (ii) up to an additional $3.0 million in post-closing earnout payments. We funded the $1.5 million cash payment with proceeds from our Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo. 

The $3.0 million earnout is payable over three earnout periods (with the first, second and third periods ending June 30, 2015, June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2018, respectively) based on the FotoPunch operations achieving specified target revenues in each earnout period. At least 75% of the target revenues must be achieved in the first and second earnout periods and at least 50% of the target revenues must be achieved in the third earnout period. The FotoPunch operations did not achieve the requisite target revenue level for the 2015 time period and, accordingly, we paid no earnout amount relating thereto. 

In August 2014, we acquired substantially all the assets of Roomtag, LLC (&#8220;Roomtag&#8221;). The aggregate consideration for the assets consisted of (i) $933,000 in cash and (ii) an unsecured subordinated promissory note (&#8220;Note&#8221;) for $754,000. We funded the $933,000 cash payment with proceeds from our Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo. The Note bears interest at an annual rate of 0.36% and is payable on October 31, 2016. In August 2015, we paid $722,000 in full payment of this Note, after applying a 5% discount. See Note 6 - Note Payable in the accompanying financial statements for more information about the Note. 

&#160; 

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES 

Asure&#8217;s SaaS-based solutions are uniquely designed to help companies bring people, time, space and assets together to more effectively manage their global, mobile workforces. As companies recruit, hire and work to retain mobile employees, executives use Asure&#8217;s solutions to understand how their workspaces are used, track how and when people work, and foster productivity by making it easy for employees to find the workspace they need. We currently offer two main product lines, AsureSpace&#8482; and AsureForce&#174;. AsureSpace&#8482; provides workplace management solutions that enable organizations to manage their office environments and optimize real estate utilization, and AsureForce&#174; time and labor management solutions help organizations optimize labor and labor administration costs and activities. 

With AsureSpace&#8482; workspace management solutions, clients realize significant costs savings and Return on Investment (&#8220;ROI&#8221;) gains by better using their real estate with a full portfolio of industry-leading, global, SaaS-based solutions. Our SmartView&#174; product offers unique insights into how space is being used, which allows companies to make proactive, strategic decisions about real estate investments. SmartTag&#174; asset management helps companies assign physical assets to people and spaces so they can track and recover all assets, including cell phones, laptops, desks, chairs, and virtually any item assigned to an employee. AsureSpace&#8482; resource scheduling and meeting room management solutions help employees easily find and reserve space for their specific needs. Our new product, NowSpace&#174;, allows users to find and reserve desk spaces, conference rooms, catering, audiovisual, and more directly from their smart phones. AsureSpace&#8482; touch panels and kiosks are placed outside busy areas for on-the-fly desk and space reservation needs; viewers can find, reserve and use available space as needed. And lastly, workplace business intelligence (&#8220;Workplace BI&#8221;) tools offer invaluable reporting for executives to understand space utilization and continue to make improvements in their real estate investments. 

Cost savings and additional ROI gains come in the form of a more strategic use of labor dollars and the elimination of time theft with AsureForce&#174; workforce management solutions. GeoPunch&#174; mobile time tracking, the AirClock&#8482; tablet-based time tracking, and Asure&#8217;s workforce management platform offer clients several advantages. First, mobile time tracking with geospatial and facial recognition technologies help executives better understand where and when their employees are working and provide great insights into optimizing labor schedules and labor costs. Mobile time and tablet-based time tracking solutions make it much more efficient for employees to punch in and out from wherever they are working, whether it is a client site, a work site, or a home-based work arrangement. GeoPunch&#174; and AirClock&#8482; also help combat buddy punching, which can cost companies millions of dollars per year. Finally, employees, supervisors and executives have real-time access to data and business intelligence to help eliminate buddy punching, optimize job costing and labor scheduling, and ultimately control and optimize labor costs. 

&#160; 

For both product lines, support and professional services are other key elements of our software and services business. As an extension of our legacy perpetual software product offerings, Asure offers our customers maintenance and support contracts that provide ready access to qualified support staff, software patches and upgrades to our software products. We also provide installation of and training on our products, add-on software customization and other professional services on a global scale. 

&#160; &#160; 

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT 

We strive to quickly bring to market innovative, cloud-based solutions that work when, where and how workforces are operating today. Asure&#8217;s strategy is to deliver the right technology to its customer base in order to realize efficiencies in the workplace. First-to-market mobile applications are a testament to our success in innovation. Additionally, Asure is committed to co-innovation, working in partnership with industry leaders, partners and clients around the globe to develop technology solutions that meet the needs of a rapidly shifting workplace. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Our industry is characterized by continuing improvements in technology, resulting in the frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, changes in customer needs and continual improvement in product performance characteristics. Asure strives to be cost-effective and timely in enhancing our software applications, developing new innovative software solutions that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of an evolving range of customers, and anticipating technological advances and evolving industry standards and practices. 

&#160; 

Asure development teams &#8211; located in Traverse City, Michigan; Dedham, Massachusetts; Salt Lake City, Utah and Austin, Texas &#8211; are staffed with software developers, quality assurance engineers and support specialists who work closely with our customers and sales and marketing teams to build products and services based on market requirements and customer feedback. We develop our new product and service roadmaps based on inputs from customers, competitive comparisons and relevant technology innovations. 

&#160; 

Our research and development strategy is rooted in innovation and flexibility. The development team enhances the functionality of our software and hardware products through new releases and new feature developments, with a particular focus on cloud-based SaaS solutions and products for the mobile workforce. Asure will also continue to evaluate opportunities for developing new software so that organizations may further streamline and automate the tasks associated with administering their businesses. We seek to simultaneously allow organizations to improve their productivity while reducing the costs associated with those business tasks. 

&#160; 

We also actively search for potential product, service or business acquisitions that we believe will complement our existing and planned product and service offerings, such as our 2016 Mangrove human capital management, payroll processing and employee benefits administration acquisitions. We cannot assure that we will make future acquisitions or that we can successfully integrate acquired assets or businesses profitably into Asure. 

Despite our efforts, we also cannot assure that we will complete our existing and future development efforts or that our new and enhanced software products will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance. Additionally, Asure may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development or introduction of new or enhanced software products. In the case of acquiring new or complementary software products or technologies, we may not be able to integrate the acquisitions into our current product lines. Furthermore, despite extensive testing, errors may be found in new software products or releases after shipment, resulting in a diversion of development resources, increased service costs, loss of revenue and/or delay in market acceptance. 

&#160; 

SALES AND DISTRIBUTION 

Asure sells its software products and services through both a direct and channel (partner) model, which enables us to sell our software solutions in an efficient, cost-effective manner. Prospective customers learn about Asure through a variety of ways, including advertising, web site searches, sales calls, public relations, direct marketing and social media. When prospective customers show an interest in Asure, we connect them with a sales representative via our web site, phone or a face-to-face meeting to discuss their needs and the solutions they are interested in and make the sale. We track our marketing and sales activities to provide immediate preview into activities, leads and pipeline opportunities. Asure account management teams also work with existing customers to promote and sell additional solutions that are relevant for each customer. In addition to this direct sales model, we supplement these efforts with our partner programs described below. By working with our partners, we expand the reach of our direct sales force and gain access to key opportunities in major market segments worldwide. Asure has two distinct levels of partners in our Partner Program: Reseller Partners and Referral Partners. 

&#160; 

Reseller Partners . Reseller Partners are companies that represent us globally, as well as before the Federal government, and often offer complementary products to either the workspace management product line or the workforce product line. Reseller Partners commit to a minimum level of business per year with us and receive a channel discount for that commitment. Our Reseller Partners outside the United States include Novera in Australia which represents the workspace product line. We also have several Reseller Partners that represent our software in the Federal government space. Resellers of our workforce product line in the United States include Oasis Outsourcing, a large provider of human resource outsourcing solutions. 

&#160; 

Referral Partners . Referral Partners provide us with the name and particular information about a prospective customer and its needs as a sales lead. If we accept the sales lead, we register it for the Referral Partner. If we make a sale as a direct result of such a lead, we will pay the Referral Partner a sales lead referral fee. Currently, we have a number of Referral Partners, including PolyVision Corp., Steelcase and e-Innovative Solutions for the workspace management product line and several smaller firms for our workforce product line. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

COMPETITION 

We believe we have a unique position in the market place, in that Asure is the only technology company in the world that offers SaaS-based workspace and workforce management solutions from a single partner. Additionally, we believe Asure has been first-to-market with mobile apps in the workspace management industry and we are the only known company to have both geospatial and facial recognition technology working together for mobile time tracking. 

Specific to the AsureSpace&#8482; line of workspace management software solutions, we have a competitive advantage in the breadth of our comprehensive platform of workspace scheduling and utilization analytics as well as our resources available for product development, client services, and customer support. The primary competitors to AsureSpace&#8482; include Dean Evans &#38; Associates, Inc., Emergingsoft Corporation, AgilQuest Corporation and Condeco Ltd. (UK). In addition to the features and available services, we believe the principal advantages of AsureSpace&#8482; with respect to its competitors include its cloud-based services model, extensive product integration options and partner channel, scalable deployments, configurable interfaces, mobile access and price. 

We believe that the AsureForce&#174; line of workforce management software solutions has a competitive advantage in the marketplace in serving organizations seeking specific point-solutions as well as organizations desiring an integrated suite of solutions, particularly in the area of mobile time collection. We believe GeoPunch&#174; and AirClock&#8482; products are first-to-market technology solutions with significant market demand. By competing tactically with point-solutions and strategically with an integrated suite of solutions, Asure can serve the needs of a broad spectrum of companies. Primary competitors to AsureForce&#174; include Kronos, Replicon, and Time Simplicity. 

&#160; 

While Asure has the advantage of a flexible, easy to use, cloud-based, SaaS-delivered software model, affordability and proven deployment methodology, we face several categories of competitive challenges: 

&#160; 

Vendors with face-to-face sales contact. In this highly relationship-based sales process, vendors with large, dispersed field-based sales teams who meet and consult with prospects have an advantage. Key U.S. vendors who approach the market in this manner include ADP, Kronos, PeopleSoft, Condeco and Steelcase. Asure has recently launched a field-based approach to sales and also focuses on high-touch marketing campaigns and leveraging relationships with channel partners to build relationships with prospects. 

National payroll processors with loss-leader products. Large brand and market share payroll processing vendors (such as ADP, Inc.) offer equivalent point solutions at little or no cost to prospects when in a competitive engagement because these loss leader products become inconsequential next to their core business offerings. 

Single application vendors. Vendors that offer similar point-solutions, such as room scheduling, office hoteling management, time and attendance, employee/manager self-service and paystub management, can be perceived as better meeting an immediate and specific need. 

Because the market for our products and services is subject to rapid technological change and there are relatively low barriers to entry in the workplace management software market, we routinely encounter new entrants or competition from vendors in some or all aspects of our two product lines. Competition from these potential market entrants may take many forms. Some of our competitors, both current and future, may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources than us and therefore may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. As a result, they may compete more effectively on price and other terms. Additionally, those competitors may devote greater resources in developing products or in promoting and selling their products to achieve greater market acceptance. Asure is actively taking measures designed to address our competitive challenges. However, we cannot assure that we will be able to achieve or maintain a competitive advantage with respect to any of the competitive factors. 

&#160; 

MARKETING 

&#160; 

Asure&#8217;s marketing strategy has relied on the development and implementation of a comprehensive integrated plan rooted in our business objectives. The marketing plan includes four primary objectives: 1) build brand awareness, 2) develop lead generation programs that drive revenue, 3) launch products in a meaningful way and 4) develop an infrastructure that supports and measures marketing activities. We deploy multi-faceted, multi-series direct marketing programs to drive awareness, interest and revenue. Marketing vehicles include our web site, organic and paid search, advertising, public relations, direct marketing, events, social media, content marketing and eMarketing. Our marketing plan addresses growth and retention goals for all target audiences, from small and medium-sized businesses to Fortune 500 companies and divisions of enterprise organizations throughout the United States, Europe and Asia/Pacific. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

TRADEMARKS 

We have registered Asure Software&#174; as a federal trademark with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Our other federal trademarks include AsureForce&#174;, Face Time Clock&#174;, Legiant Timecard&#174; and ADI Time&#174;, and we have pending applications for federal registration of the marks AsureSpace&#8482;, SmartView&#8482; and GeoPunch&#8482;. We also use the common law trademarks iEmployee&#8482;, Netsimplicty&#8482;, AsureSpace&#8482;, ADI&#8482;, Workplace BI&#8482; and Legiant Express&#8482;. 

EMPLOYEES 

As of December 31, 2015, we had a total of 132 employees in the following departments:

&#160; &#160; 132 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We continually evaluate and adjust the size and composition of our workforce. We also periodically retain contractors to support our sales and marketing, information technology and administrative functions. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. Asure has not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. Additionally, we augment our workforce capacity in research and development and customer service and technical support by contracting for services through third parties. 

&#160; 

Our future performance depends largely on our ability to continually and effectively attract, train, retain, motivate and manage highly qualified and experienced technical, sales, marketing and managerial personnel. Asure&#8217;s future development and growth depend on the efforts of key management personnel and technical employees. Asure uses incentives, including competitive compensation and stock options, to attract and retain well-qualified employees. However, we cannot assure that we will continue to attract and retain personnel with the requisite capabilities and experience. The loss of one or more of Asure&#8217;s key management or technical personnel could have a material and adverse effect on our business and operating results.
