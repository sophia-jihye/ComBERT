 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

General 

Citrix develops and sells products and services that enable the secure and reliable delivery of applications and data over public, private or hybrid clouds or networks, to virtually any type of device. 

We market and license our products directly to customers, over the Web, and through systems integrators, or SIs, in addition to indirectly through value-added resellers, or VARs, value-added distributors, or VADs, original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs and service providers. 

Citrix is a Delaware corporation founded on April 17, 1989. 

Business Overview 

For 27 years, Citrix has innovated and delivered products consistent with a vision of a workplace where people can securely and easily collaborate across boundaries of time, place and device, creating better business outcomes, improving productivity, and making businesses far more agile and responsive to change - both in information technology change as well as business change. 

Proposed Spin-off Transaction 

On November 17, 2015, we announced a plan to spinoff our "GoTo" family of products into a separate, publicly traded company. The proposed separation, which is intended to be a tax-free spinoff to our stockholders, is expected to be completed in the second half of 2016. Upon completion of the separation, Chris Hylen, who currently serves as Senior Vice President and General Manager of our Mobility Apps business unit, will serve as Chief Executive Officer of the new company. 

The company established as a result of the spinoff will be made up of the following Mobility Apps products and services: GoToAssist, GoToMeeting, GoToMyPC, GoToTraining, GoToWebinar, Grasshopper and OpenVoice. Immediately following the separation, Citrix shareholders will own shares in two publicly traded companies. The new spinoff company will more effectively allocate resources in line with its own market opportunity, unique growth priorities and go-to-market capabilities, as well as adapt more quickly to SaaS market and customer dynamics; and, Citrix post-spinoff, will focus on its strategic solutions for secure and reliable delivery of applications and data. 

The spinoff will be subject to customary closing conditions and final approval by our Board of Directors. Please see the information in "Item 1A: Risk Factors" under the heading "Risk Factors Related to the Planned Separation," which describes some of the risks and uncertainties associated with the proposed separation. 

Products and Services 

Our products and services target customers of all sizes, from individuals and professional consumers, to large global enterprises. Two business units, Enterprise and Service Provider and Mobility Apps, administer the research and development, product marketing, and product management for our offerings. Our Enterprise and Service Provider business unit is comprised of Workspace Services and Delivery Networking products. Our Mobility Apps business unit is comprised of Communications Cloud and Workflow Cloud products. Broadly, as an organizing principle, we group our offerings in the following main categories within our two business units:

&#32;9 

In fiscal year 2015 , there was no individual customer that accounted for over 10% of our total net revenues. In fiscal years 2014 &#32;and 2013 , one distributor, Ingram Micro, accounted for 13% &#32;and 14% , respectively, of our total net revenues. Our distributor arrangements with Ingram Micro consist of several non-exclusive, independently negotiated agreements with its subsidiaries, each of which covers different countries or regions. Each agreement is negotiated separately and is independent of any other contract (such as a master distribution agreement), one of which was individually responsible for over 10% &#32;of our total net revenues in fiscal years 2014 &#32;and 2013 . 

We are not obligated to accept product returns from our distributors under any conditions, unless the product item is defective in manufacture. See &#8220;Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates&#8221; and Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;for information regarding our revenue recognition policy. 

International revenues (sales outside the United States) accounted for approximately 43.1% &#32;of our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 , 45.2% &#32;of our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 &#32;and 45.4% &#32;of our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 . For detailed information on our international revenues, please refer to Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 . 

Segment Revenue 

Our revenues are derived from our Enterprise and Service Provider products, which primarily include Workspace Services solutions, Delivery Networking products and related license updates and maintenance, support and professional services and from our Mobility Apps business unit's Communications Cloud and Workflow Cloud products. The Enterprise and Service Provider and the Mobility Apps business units constitute our two reportable segments. As part of our continued transformation, effective January 1, 2016, we reorganized a part of our business by creating a new Cloud Services business unit that will include our ShareFile product line. The ShareFile product line is currently included within our Workflow Cloud products under the Mobility Apps segment. We are currently evaluating our segment reporting for 2016 as a result of these changes. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 . 

Operations 

For our Delivery Networking products, which include NetScaler, we use independent contractors to provide a redundant source of manufacture and assembly capabilities. Independent contractors provide us with the flexibility needed to meet our product quality and delivery requirements. We have manufacturing relationships that we enter into in the ordinary course of business, primarily with Flextronics and IBM (primarily for ByteMobile Smart Capacity) under which we have subcontracted the majority of our hardware manufacturing activity, generally on a purchase order basis. These third-party contract manufacturers also provide final test, warehousing and shipping services. This subcontracting activity extends from prototypes to full production and includes activities such as material procurement, final assembly, test, control, shipment to our customers and repairs. Together with our contract manufacturers, we design, specify and monitor the tests that are required to meet internal and external quality standards. Our contract manufacturers manufacture our products based on forecasted demand for our products. Each of the contract manufacturers procures components necessary to assemble the products in our forecast and test the products according to our specifications. We are dual-sourced on our components, however, in some instances, those sources may be located in the same geographic area. Accordingly, if a natural disaster occurred in one of those areas, we may need to seek additional sources. Products are then shipped to our distributors, VARs or end-users. If the products go unsold for specified periods of time, we may incur carrying charges or obsolete material charges for products ordered to meet our forecast or customer orders. In 2015 , we did not experience any material difficulties or significant delays in the manufacture and assembly of our products. 

We control all purchasing, inventory, scheduling, order processing and accounting functions related to our operations. For our software products, production, warehousing and shipping are performed by our independent contractors Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Ireland and Digital River. Master software, development of user manuals, packaging designs, initial product quality control and testing are primarily performed at our facilities. In some cases, independent contractors also duplicate master software, print documentation and package and assemble products to our specifications. 

While it is generally our practice to promptly ship product upon receipt of properly finalized purchase orders, we sometimes have orders that have not shipped upon receipt of a purchase order. Although the amount of such product license orders may vary, the amount, if any, of such orders at the end of a fiscal year is not material to our business. We do not believe that backlog, as of any particular date, is a reliable indicator of future performance. 

We believe that our fourth quarter revenues and expenses are affected by a number of seasonal factors, including the lapse of many corporations' fiscal year budgets and an increase in amounts paid pursuant to our sales compensation plans due to 

&#32;10 

compensation plan accelerators that are often triggered in the fourth quarter. We believe that these seasonal factors are common within our industry. Such factors historically have resulted in first quarter revenues in any year being lower than the immediately preceding fourth quarter. We expect this trend to continue through the first quarter of 2016 . In addition, our European operations generally generate lower revenues in the summer months because of the generally reduced economic activity in Europe during the summer. This seasonal factor also typically results in higher fourth quarter revenues. 

Competition 

We sell our products in intensely competitive markets. Some of our competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, sales and marketing and other resources than we do. As the markets for our products and services continue to develop, additional companies, including those with significant market presence in the computer appliances, software and networking industries, could enter the markets in which we compete and further intensify competition. In addition, we believe price competition could become a more significant competitive factor in the future. As a result, we may not be able to maintain our historic prices and margins, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. See &#8220;Technology Relationships&#8221; and Part I-Item 1A entitled &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 . 

Workspace Services 

Our Windows App Delivery products are based on an alternative technology platform the success of which will depend on organizations and customers perceiving technological and operational benefits and cost savings associated with adopting desktop and application virtualization solutions. We differentiate from basic virtualization solutions with robust security and flexibility to enable IT to deliver Windows apps and desktops for better business outcomes. Our primary competition in this market is the existing IT desktop management practice of manually configuring physical desktops, which is time-consuming, expensive and subject to inconsistency. We also face numerous competitors that provide automation of these processes and alternative approaches, including VMware's Horizon View product and the emergence of virtual applications and desktop delivery from public and private cloud services. We believe XenApp, XenDesktop and Citrix Workspace Suite give Citrix a competitive advantage by providing customers multiple ways to virtualize and deliver desktops and/or apps with one, integrated virtualization system and delivering a higher performance user experience, more robust security and the flexibility for people to use any device and IT to use any cloud infrastructure - public or private. 

Our Enterprise Mobility Management product line, XenMobile, competes with AirWatch by VMware, MobileIron, Good Technology by BlackBerry and other smaller competitors. We believe we differentiate ourselves from these competitors by providing the most complete solution on the market, with MDM, MAM and superior core mobile productivity applications, including secure mobile email, calendar, browser, notes and more. Our apps feature unique workflow integrations designed to make people work better, a significant advantage over competitors that do not focus on the end user experience and either have basic applications or rely on third parties for their mobile apps and can drive similar integrations. 

We also see competition from competitors that are combining mobile and desktop technologies. We believe the Citrix solution, Citrix Workspace Suite, is the best solution available today that can securely deliver a mobile workspace - all Windows, Web, SaaS and native mobile applications, data and virtual desktops - to any device, anywhere. VMware responded to our introduction of the Citrix Workspace Suite with the introduction of the VMware Workspace Suite. We expect other vendors to follow suit. We offer market-leading technologies for every component of the Citrix Workspace Suite. Further, we believe that our end-user experience is a competitive edge when compared to the alternative solutions due to the intuitiveness and self-service features of our offering. 

Delivery Networking 

Our NetScaler products compete against other established competitors, including, F5 Networks, Inc., or F5, and to a lesser extent, Radware and A10 Networks. The companies compete with us for traditional enterprise sales opportunities, while F5 is our principal competitor in the Internet-centric market segment. We continue to enhance NetScaler's feature capability and aggressively market NetScaler to our existing customer base as well as expanding into telco and cloud provider markets. NetScaler&#8217;s integration with XenApp and XenDesktop provides a major competitive advantage with customers who are already using these products. 

Mobility Apps 

Our products for collaboration continue to maintain leadership positions in extremely competitive markets, particularly among SMBs. We differentiate our SaaS offerings by designing simple, secure, reliable and cost-efficient products that deliver a superior customer experience. Our competitors range from large, established technology firms to small, Internet-based startups. 

&#32;11 

Our Communications Cloud products compete primarily with Adobe Connect, Cisco WebEx, TeamViewer, Microsoft Lync and Skype, BlueJeans and Zoom, and conferencing call solutions from AT&#38;T, BT, Intercall, PGi, RingCentral, Verizon and Vonage. In addition, we compete with freemium products such as LogMeIn's Join.me and Google's Google + Hangouts. Our GoToMeeting, GoToWebinar and GoToTraining products have proven to be competitive based on ease-of-use and our All You Can Meet pricing model, combined with built-in VoIP and toll-based PSTN audio services. We further differentiate our collaboration products by integrating OpenVoice toll-free seamlessly with built-in VoIP and toll audio services and having purpose-built solutions for marketing and training use cases. We believe these features give us a competitive advantage among individual, prosumer and SMB customers. 

We have been a market leader with our GoToMyPC product for many years. Our competition includes LogMeIn, free solutions such as Microsoft's Live Mesh and those from many others, including internet startups. In addition, our Windows App Delivery products and new remote access features in desktop operating systems like Microsoft Windows and Macintosh OSX provide alternatives to GoToMyPC. We endeavor to differentiate our products by continuing our focus on security, ease-of-use and support for multiple desktop operating systems focused on individual, prosumer and SMB customers. 

Our GoToAssist product has achieved success in Web-based clientless remote support. This product includes a version purpose-built for individual users, consultants and small businesses, positioning Citrix as the only provider of remote support solutions for all customer segments. In remote support, we compete with Cisco's WebEx, LogMeIn, TeamViewer, Bomgar and Zendesk. 

In the data sharing segment, our ShareFile product's direct competition includes Dropbox, Box, Syncplicity, BlackBerry's Watchdox, Accellion, Microsoft and HighTail (formerly YouSendIt), as well as legacy solutions such as traditional file transfer protocol, or FTP. Many of these competitors have strong brand recognition through consumer and free versions of their products. However, we believe our ShareFile product offers a superior solution for businesses as it is built specifically for the needs of business. Further, we believe that Citrix's strong reputation in certain vertical segments, along with ShareFile's integration with other Citrix products, such as Receiver and XenMobile, and our unique ability to store data on-premise or in the Cloud, will be key differentiators. 

Proprietary Technology 

Our success is dependent upon certain proprietary technologies and core intellectual property. We have been awarded numerous domestic and foreign patents and have numerous pending patent applications in the United States and foreign countries. Our technology is also protected under copyright laws. Additionally, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality and proprietary information agreements to protect our proprietary technology. We have established proprietary trademark rights in markets across the globe, and own trademark registrations and pending registration applications in the United States and other countries, including Citrix, GoToAssist, GoToMeeting, GoToWebinar, NetScaler, ShareFile, Xen, XenApp, XenDesktop, XenServer and XenMobile. While our competitive position could be affected by our ability to protect our proprietary information, we believe that because of the rapid pace of technological change in the industry, factors such as the technical expertise, knowledge and innovative skill of our management and technical personnel, our technology relationships, name recognition, the timeliness and quality of support services provided by us and our ability to rapidly develop, enhance and market software products could be more significant in maintaining our competitive position.

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 9,500 employees. In November 2015, we announced a strategic restructuring program which included steps to reduce our headcount by approximately 700 full-time positions over its term, which extends into 2016. We believe our relations with employees are good. In certain countries outside the United States, our relations with employees are governed by labor regulations that provide for specific terms of employment between our company and our employees.
