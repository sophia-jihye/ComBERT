 Item 1. Business. 

We are a clinical-stage specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel and proprietary combination therapies that address significant unmet medical needs. Our initial focus is on the development of Hydros-TA, our proprietary, potentially best-in-class intra-articular (&#8220;IA&#8221;), injectable product candidate to treat pain associated with osteoarthritis (&#8220;OA&#8221;), of the knee. Current joint injection, or intra-articular, treatments for OA pain include corticosteroids, which provide short-term relief, and viscosupplements, which provide relief over the longer-term. In contrast, Hydros-TA utilizes our proprietary cross-linking technology to deliver both rapid pain relief with a low dose corticosteroid triamcinolone acetonide, or TA, and sustained pain relief from our novel hyaluronic acid viscosupplement.

In February 2016, we announced topline results of our COR1.1 trial, a Phase 3, multi-center, international, randomized, double-blind, three-arm trial that enrolled 560 patients with grade two and grade three OA of the knee, comparing treatment with Hydros-TA to treatment with Hydros and with TA, on a standalone basis. The primary endpoints of the trial were changes from baseline in the WOMAC A pain scores at week 2 for Hydros-TA versus Hydros and at week 26 for Hydros-TA versus TA, as well as a safety assessment of adverse events. Hydros-TA met the first of its two primary endpoints, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement from baseline in the WOMAC A pain score at week 2 versus Hydros. In addition, Hydros-TA maintained a significant reduction in pain from baseline over 26 weeks. However, patients in the TA arm continued to show an unexpected significant reduction in pain through 26 weeks. Given the comparable effectiveness at 26 weeks, COR1.1 did not meet its second primary endpoint. Hydros-TA was generally well tolerated with no treatment related serious adverse events, or SAEs, and adverse events, or AEs, were mostly mild and included arthralgia (knee pain) and swelling.

In March 2016, we engaged a financial and strategic advisor, Wedbush PacGrow, to advise us on strategic alternatives. Wedbush PacGrow will provide a range of advisory services aimed to enhance shareholder value. The alternatives to be considered will include the potential for an acquisition, merger, strategic partnership or other strategic transactions. We expect to devote substantial time and resources to exploring strategic alternatives, however, there can be no assurance that such activities will result in any agreements or transactions that will enhance shareholder value. Further, any strategic transaction that is completed ultimately may not deliver the anticipated benefits or enhance shareholder value.

We own the global development and commercialization rights to Hydros-TA, except in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau. We have three issued U.S. patents and ten issued non-U.S. patents, the earliest of which will expire in 2030, and 25 patent applications worldwide covering our Hydros platform technology, including claims directed to composition of matter, methods of use and product-by-process.

Osteoarthritis Overview

OA is a joint disorder involving the degradation of the IA cartilage, joint lining, ligaments and, ultimately, underlying bone. OA results in inflammation of the soft tissue and bony structures of the joint, which worsens over time and leads to progressive thinning of articular cartilage. Symptoms of this disease include pain, stiffness, swelling and limitation in the function of the joint. There is no known way to reverse the progression of OA and while there are a number of therapeutic options to treat the pain associated with OA, the disease typically continues to advance. 

In the United States, there are over 27 million patients with OA, and approximately half of all adult patients will develop symptomatic OA of the knee. According to Millennium Research Group, in 2012, 1.65 million IA knee injections of hyaluronic acid, or HA, were administered. In the same year, worldwide sales of HA were approximately $1.76 billion, $726 million of which came from the United States.

Limitations of Curren t Treatments 

OA severity is generally graded on a scale from one to four. When OA advances and oral or topical drug treatments are not sufficient to effectively address the associated pain, physicians often turn to IA treatments, such as corticosteroids, commonly known as steroids, and HA viscosupplements.

While steroid injections can provide rapid pain relief, clinical practice and medical literature suggest that they generally provide only short-term pain relief of two to four weeks post injection. On the other hand, while HA injections can often provide long-term pain relief of up to approximately six months, they do not generally begin to provide peak pain relief until five weeks post injection. The following graph sets out what we believe to be the standard treatment progression for the treatment of OA pain in the knee:

&#160;

Despite the use of currently available treatments, many OA patients experience persistent and worsening pain. Joint replacement surgery, often referred to as total knee arthroplasty, or TKA, is generally the last option for the treatment of OA. Compared to other treatments, this invasive surgery is an expensive option, with an initial surgical procedure cost of approximately $33,000 to $40,000. With patients receiving TKAs more frequently at a younger age, surgery to replace a previously performed TKA, known as a revision surgery, is increasingly common. Revision surgeries are not only more costly, at approximately $74,000, they are also associated with significantly higher morbidity and failure rates than the initial TKA surgery. Due to the expense of surgery and the limitations of treatments administered to prevent such surgeries, there exists a need for an alternative treatment that could provide both rapid and sustained relief from OA pain and potentially delay the need for joint replacement surgery.

Our Solution &#8212; Hydros-TA

Hydros-TA is a combination IA product, designed to provide both rapid and sustained pain relief with a single 6 ml intra-articular injection comprised of 52 mg of bacterially derived HA and 10 mg of TA. Rapid relief may be provided from our low dose steroid component and sustained pain relief, up to six months, may be provided from our proprietary HA component. Hydros-TA is comprised of bacterially derived HA-based hydrogel particles suspended in a solution of hyaluronic acid. The hydrogel particles contain the steroid, TA, which is entrapped within these particles. The dose of TA used in Hydros-TA is 10 mg, which is one quarter of the dose of TA that is often given clinically for IA injections into the knee. We believe the incorporation of a low dose steroid into Hydros-TA provides a means of rapid pain relief currently missing from commercially-available HA. We believe that a clinically-proven and FDA-approved combination Hydros-TA product will provide a compelling alternative to sequential injections of steroids and viscosupplements.

Hydros-TA Clinical Program

COR1.1

Our first Phase 3 clinical trial of Hydros-TA, known as COR1.1, was a multi-center, international, randomized, double-blind, three-arm trial that enrolled 560 patients with grade two and grade three OA of the knee, comparing treatment with Hydros-TA to treatment with Hydros and with TA 10mg, on a standalone basis. We utilized the WOMAC NRS 3.1 Index in our COR1.1 trial (0-10 point scale). Our studies also utilize standardized criteria to define the number and percentage of defined positive &#8220;strict responders&#8221; (&#62;50% and &#62;20 mm improvements in WOMAC A (pain) or WOMAC C (function) scores, respectively, over baseline).

Our COR1.1 trial was conducted in 30 clinical centers across Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and the Caribbean with a total of 560 enrolled subjects that were treated and followed for six months with an optional 1 year safety follow-up . These subjects were randomized 1:1:1 to three study treatment arms: Hydros-TA, Hydros (the viscosupplement without steroid) and TA 10mg. The primary endpoints of the trial were changes from baseline in the WOMAC A pain scores at week 2 for Hydros-TA vers us Hydros and at week 26 for Hydros-TA versus TA 10mg.Hydros-TA met the first of its two primary endpoints, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement from baseline in the WOMAC A pain score at week 2 versus Hydros. In addition, Hydros-TA maint ained a significant reduction in pain from baseline over 26 weeks. However, patients in the TA arm continued to show an unexpected significant reduction in pain through 26 weeks. Given the comparable effectiveness at 26 weeks, COR1.1 did not meet its seco nd primary endpoint. Hydros-TA was generally well tolerated with no treatment related serious adverse events, or SAEs, and adverse events, or AEs, were mostly mild and included arthralgia (knee pain) and swelling. 

The following table represents the COR1.1 trial baseline scores for each of the treatment groups, as well as the WOMAC pain score least square mean reductions from baseline at 1, 2, 6, 13 and 26 week post injection. The estimated difference between the treatment groups is also represented.

COR1.0

Our Phase 2b clinical trial of Hydros-TA, known as COR1.0, was a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind feasibility study to evaluate the safety and performance of Hydros-TA in subjects with OA of the knee. Our COR1.0 trial was conducted in eight clinical centers in Canada, Europe and the Caribbean with a total of 98 enrolled subjects that were treated and followed for six months thereafter. These subjects were randomized 1:1:1 to three study treatment arms: Hydros-TA, Hydros (the viscosupplement without steroid) and Synvisc-One (the U.S. market leading HA viscosupplement). In our primary endpoint, WOMAC pain score, pain reduction from baseline was observed in all treatment groups, however, Hydros-TA provided greater pain reduction compared to Synvisc-One at all study time points, as well as over the full study follow-up period of 26 weeks. Though we did not design our COR1.0 trial to enroll a sufficient number of patients to demonstrate statistical significance generally, the separation of pain reduction scores between Hydros-TA and Hydros was large enough to demonstrate statistical significance at the two week measurement point with the number of patients actually enrolled. Though statistical significance was not achieved at any other time point and in any other comparison of treatment arms, the separation between Hydros-TA and Synvisc-One represented approximately 10% of the baseline score, a numerical amount generally considered &#8220;clinically meaningful&#8221; and, we believe, not often seen in viscosupplementation trials with active comparators. For our secondary endpoints, WOMAC B (stiffness), WOMAC function, and responder rate, we saw a similar trend of improved outcomes with Hydros-TA compared to Synvisc-One. In addition, Hydros-TA was generally well-tolerated with fewer product-related adverse events reported than Synvisc-One.

The following table represents the COR1.0 trial baseline scores for each of the treatment groups, as well as the WOMAC pain score least square mean reductions from baseline over the full 26 week evaluation period, as well as at the 2, 6, 13 and 26 week time points post injection. The estimated difference between the treatment groups is also represented.

Future Development of Hydros-TA 

We are required to successfully complete two Phase 3 clinical trials and one safety trial in order to satisfy the requirements for the demonstration of safety and efficacy of Hydros-TA in our initial indication for OA pain in the knee. In addition to the two Phase 3 clinical trials, we will need to collect safety data from an additional 400 to 450 patients, which will provide us with approximately 800 patients to make up our safety database. Since TA is an approved product in different pharmaceutical preparations, we may rely on the FDA&#8217;s prior findings of safety and efficacy for TA and, thus, the Hydros-TA new drug application, or NDA, could benefit from being filed under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, by eliminating the need for certain pre-clinical safety studies of TA. Hydros is considered a new molecular entity, or NME, and we are required to complete full pre-clinical testing to assure its safety profile. However, since Hydros-TA is our product candidate, not Hydros alone, in order to obtain regulatory approval of Hydros-TA, Hydros will not have to undergo any clinical testing independent of the Hydros-TA studies. While we are considering potential strategic alternatives, we are also considering the potential for the future clinical development of Hydros-TA. 

Coverage and Reimbursement 

Viscosupplemention has become an important treatment option for patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. A number of viscosupplementation products are currently approved by the FDA for marketing in the United States with indications for use in OA of the knee. Each has demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in pain and improvement in function. In the United States, third-party payors (such as Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial health plans) provide coverage to individuals for medically necessary services. The Medicare program covers certain individuals who are disabled or aged 65 or older, two groups with a comparatively higher incidence of OA. The Medicare program is increasingly used as a model for how private payors and other governmental payors develop their coverage and reimbursement policies for drugs and biologics. Since no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for medical products exists among third-party payors, we may be required to provide economic, scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. 

AAOS issued a guideline in 2008 in which it found that the benefits of viscosupplementation were inconclusive and was unable to recommend for or against their use. In May 2013, AAOS issued a revised guideline on treatment of OA of the knee that stated &#8220;we cannot recommend using hyaluronic acid for patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee&#8221;. AAOS stated that its recommendation was strong and was based on high quality supporting evidence related to lack of efficacy, rather than potential harm. In developing its 2013 guidelines, AAOS considered a different and smaller group of studies than it had in 2008 and found statistically significant positive treatment effects with respect to pain, function and stiffness. However, in 2013, it went on to consider whether the improvements in pain and function were large enough to pass &#8220;minimum clinically important improvement&#8221; thresholds and the evidence it considered approached, but did not pass, these thresholds. 

While some third-party payors continue to cover HA for the treatment of OA of the knee after the publication of the AAOS guidelines, a number of third-party payors, including Blue Cross Blue Shield, have reversed their coverage policies and no longer cover the use of HA for the treatment of OA of the knee. Several payors still continue to cover viscosupplementation for patients with OA of the knee and related pain that interferes with function after more conservative therapies have been attempted. The more conservative therapies that payors expect to precede viscosupplementation include NSAIDs and intra-articular injection of steroids. Evidence-based review by payors has generally found a lack of reliable evidence that any particular brand of viscosupplement is superior to others when used for medically necessary indications. As a result, some payors may disfavor new products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are already available or subsequently become available. Many payors also limit repeat treatment to 6 month intervals. 

Manufacturing 

We have relied on contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to manufacture both the active pharmaceutical ingredient and final drug product dosage form for Hydros-TA that has been used as clinical trial material. We have manufactured the two intermediate components used in the manufacture of the hydrogel for the initial clinical studies. These two components will be outsourced to CMOs for future clinical material and for commercial production. Our management team has extensive experience with the management of a virtual supply chain consisting of CMOs, contract packaging operations and third-party logistics providers. We currently anticipate continuing to use CMOs to manufacture clinical material for future clinical studies and for the initial commercial product. 

The manufacture of sterile injectables is a complex and expensive process that is subject to a high degree of regulatory oversight. All of our CMOs are experienced commercial manufacturers and are qualified by us before we begin to work with them. The patented and proprietary Hydros chemistry involves mild processing conditions and routine unit operations. Extensive development work has been completed to optimize the operations for commercial manufacture. Hyaluronic acid and triamcinolone acetonide, the two key raw materials for Hydros-TA, are readily available from multiple sources commercially. 

Intellectual Property 

Patents and Patent Applications 

We seek to protect our product candidates and our technology through a combination of patents, trade secrets, proprietary know-how, FDA exclusivity and contractual restrictions on disclosure. Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our drug candidates, manufacturing and process discoveries and other know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. As a normal course of business, we pursue composition-of-matter and method-of-use patents for our product candidates in key therapeutic areas. As of December 31, 2015, we have three issued U.S. patents and ten issued non-U.S. patents, the earliest of which will expire in 2030, and 25 patent applications worldwide covering our Hydros platform technology, including claims directed to composition of matter, methods of use and product-by-process.

We also rely on trade secrets and careful monitoring of our proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. 

Currently our Hydros platform is covered by three patent families: (1) those relating to modified hyaluronic acid polymer compositions and related methods; (2) those relating to in-situ gel forming compositions; and (3) those relating to stabilized compositions of hyaluronic acid. For the modified hyaluronic acid polymer compositions and related methods patent family which covers the Hydros and Hydros-TA products, we have two issued U.S. patents and four issued non-U.S. patents, all of which will expire in 2030. These patents consist of composition of matter claims, method claims and product-by-process claims. We have issued patents and patent applications that cover Hydros-TA in the United States and 15 countries internationally. 

Trade Secrets and Proprietary Information 

During the development of the Hydros and Hydros-TA formulations, we have established numerous trade secrets that relate to the raw materials, formulation, manufacturing process and quality control testing of the product. We seek to protect our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, by requiring our employees to execute confidentiality and invention assignment agreements upon the commencement of their employment. Consultants and other advisors are required to sign confidentiality and consulting agreements. These agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of the relationship with us be kept confidential and not be disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of our employees, the agreements also typically provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us, utilizing our property or relating to our business and conceived or completed during employment shall be our exclusive property to the extent permitted by law. Further, we require confidentiality agreements from entities that receive our confidential data or materials or that generate confidential information and materials for us. 

Government Regulation and Product Approval 

Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. Hydros and Hydros-TA and any other drug candidate that we develop must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the corresponding foreign regulatory agencies before they may be legally marketed in foreign countries. 

U.S. Government Regulation 

In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA&#8217;s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 

FDA approval is required before any new unapproved drug or dosage form, includ ing a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 

&#160;

&#8226; 

completion of nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, or other applicable regulations; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before human clinical trials in the United States may begin; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, for each clinical site before each trial may be initiated; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with laws and FDA regulations pertaining to the conduct of human clinical studies, collectively referred to as Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for each intended use; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

development of the product under rigorous development and design controls as stipulated by governing regulations such as 21 CFR 210 and 211, known as current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP. 

&#160;

&#8226; 

submission to the FDA of an NDA for a proposed new drug; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

satisfactory completion of a potential FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug is produced to assess compliance with the FDA&#8217;s cGMP requirements, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug&#8217;s identity, strength, quality and purity; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

satisfactory completion of a potential review by an FDA advisory committee, if applicable; and 

&#160;

&#8226; 

FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing, sale or shipment of the drug. 

The lengthy process of seeking FDA approval and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources and approvals are inherently uncertain. Notwithstanding the expenditure of time and resources approval is never guaranteed and FDA my grant approval for less than the desired indications. Moreover, the time required to obtain approval, if any, may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease. 

Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, a drug candidate typically undergoes nonclinical testing, also referred to as pre-clinical testing. Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and activity of the drug candidate. The conduct of the pre-clinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLP. 

&#160;

An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The IND sponsor must submit the results of pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, information about product chemistry, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, among other things, to the FDA as part of the IND. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on a clinical hold, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. 

A separate submission to an existing IND application must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a drug candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trial. 

Clinical Studies 

Clinical trials involve the administration of the drug candidate to healthy subjects or patients with the target disease under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor&#8217;s control. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA under the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA&#8217;s regulations. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted before the trial commences at that site. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the Informed Consent Form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until it is completed. 

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. The drug may also be tested for early evidence of effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted only in patients having the specific disease. 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Phase 2. The drug is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for a specific indication and to determine the dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule for patients having the specific disease. 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Phase 3. The drug is administered to an expanded patient population in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to generate sufficient data to statistically confirm the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. Generally, at least two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA, though a single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances (for example, where the study is a large multicenter trial providing highly reliable and statistically persuasive evidence of an important clinical benefit and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible). 

Post-approval studies, also referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and may be required by the FDA as part of the approval process. &#160; 

During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points, including prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2 and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice and for the sponsor and FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the end of Phase 2 meeting to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that they believe will support approval of the new drug. 

The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB&#8217;s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to study subjects. 

Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies, develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 

FDA Review and Approval Processes 

Submission of an NDA to the FDA 

Assuming successful completion of required clinical testing and other requirements, the results of the pre-clinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product&#8217;s chemistry, pharmacology, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is subject to a substantial application user fee and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA are also subject to annual product and establishment user fees. 

NDAs for most new drug products are based on two Phase 3 clinical studies which must contain substantial evidence of the safety and efficacy of the proposed new product. These applications are submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA. The FDA is, however, authorized to approve an alternative type of NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. NDAs filed under Section 505(b)(2) may provide an alternate and potentially more expeditious pathway to FDA approval for modified formulations or new uses of previously FDA-approved products. This type of application allows the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA&#8217;s previous findings of safety and efficacy for a similar product, or published literature. Specifically, Section 505(b)(2) applies to NDAs for a drug for which the investigations made to show whether or not the drug is safe for use and effective in use and relied upon by the applicant for approval of the application &#8220;were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted.&#8221; If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA&#8217;s previous approval is scientifically appropriate, the applicant may eliminate the need to conduct certain pre-clinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements, including clinical trials, to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new drug candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. 

The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency&#8217;s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. 

The FDA may request additional information before accepting an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information and is subject to payment of additional user fees. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA has agreed to certain goals for review of NDAs. For an NDA that does not contain a new molecular entity (NME), FDA endeavors to complete its review of a standard NDA and respond to the applicant within 10 months after submission of the NDA, and to complete its review and respond to a priority review NDA within six months after submission of the NDA. For an NDA that contains an NME, the FDA endeavors to complete its review and respond to the applicant within 12 months after submission of a standard NDA and within eight months after submission of a priority review NDA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for review of standard or priority review NDAs. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by additional three month review periods whenever the FDA requests or the NDA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission at any time during the review cycle. 

The FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product&#8217;s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes independent clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 

During the drug approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA without a REMS, if required, and the sponsor must agree to the REMS at the time of approval. A REMS may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate healthcare providers of the drug&#8217;s risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, or other elements to assure safe use, such as special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. In addition, the REMS must include a timetable to periodically assess the strategy. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a drug 

Before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect the facilities at which the product is to be manufactured. The FDA will not ap prove the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a n NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with FDA regulations regarding conduct of clinical trials. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptabl e, it will inform the applicant of the deficiencies and often will request additional testing or information. 

After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a &#8220;complete response&#8221; letter, or CRL. The FDA will issue a CRL to indicate that the review cycle for an application is complete and that the application is not ready for approval. A CRL generally describes the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA and outlines the additional steps that would need to be undertaken in order for FDA to reconsider the application. These could include additional clinical trials, additional manufacturing or product characterization, or further pre-clinical or pharmacokinetic studies. If a CRL is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. If, or when, the deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. Should the applicant disagree with the decision to issue the CRL, there are dispute resolution processes through which the applicant can appeal the approvability of the NDA within the FDA. These processes can be lengthy and do not ensure that the NDA will be re-reviewed in its current state or subsequently approved. 

An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require post-approval surveillance to monitor the drug&#8217;s safety or efficacy or post-approval studies, referred to as Phase 4 studies, which involve clinical trials designed to further assess a product&#8217;s safety and effectiveness. The FDA has the authority to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. 

Post-Approval Requirements 

Any drug products for which we receive FDA approvals will be subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to drug listing and registration, record-keeping, adverse event reporting, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, sampling and distribution and product promotion and advertising. These promotion and advertising requirements include, among other things, standards and regulations regarding direct-to-consumer advertising, prohibitions against promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug&#8217;s approved labeling (known as &#8220;off-label use&#8221;) and rules for conducting industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. While physicians may prescribe for off-label uses, manufacturers may only promote their products for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. 

Failure to comply with FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, enforcement letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors and civil or criminal penalties. In addition, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. 

We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities o f our products. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA&#8217;s cGMP regulations, and quality-control, drug manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform t o cGMP regulations after approval. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are also required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced and announced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies to assess compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain c GMP compliance. Failure to comply with regulatory standards, the emergence of problems following initial marketing, or the discovery of previously unrecognized problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product or the manufactur er or holder of an approved NDA. These restrictions may include suspension of a product until the FDA is assured that quality standards can be met, continuing oversight of manufacturing by the FDA under a consent decree of permanent injunction, which frequ ently includes the imposition of costs and continuing inspections over a period of many years, as well as possible withdrawal of product approvals or a request for product recalls. The FDA may also impose a REMS requirement on a drug already on the market if the FDA determines, based on new safety information, that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the drug&#8217;s benefits outweigh its risks. In addition, regulatory authorities may take other enforcement action, including, among other things, warning letters, t he seizure of products, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, civil penalties and criminal prosecution. 

&#160;

Changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented. Other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. A growing majority of states also impose certain drug pedigree requirements on the sale and distribution of prescription drugs. 

Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 

Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Sales of products will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered by third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. Many commercial health plans may also require prior authorization to monitor compliance with patient selection and other coverage criteria. 

In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. A payor&#8217;s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Third-party reimbursement may not be sufficient to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development. 

In addition to uncertainties surrounding coverage policies, there are periodic changes to reimbursement. Third-party payors regularly update reimbursement amounts and also from time to time revise the methodologies used to determine reimbursement amounts. This includes annual updates to payments to physicians and hospitals where our product candidates will be used. Because injection of the viscosupplement is performed by the physician, usually in the office or outpatient clinic, payors generally reimburse the physician for both the IA injection pursuant to a fee schedule and for the viscosupplement on the basis of the average selling price of each viscosupplement product plus a percentage, the total of which, for Medicare patients, is approximately 106% of the average selling price of each viscosupplement product. As a result, these payment updates could directly impact the demand for our product candidates, if approved. An example of payment updates is the Medicare program&#8217;s updates to hospital and physician payments, which are done on an annual basis using a prescribed statutory formula. In the past, when the application of the formula resulted in lower payment, Congress has passed interim legislation to prevent the reductions. Most recently, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, signed into law in April 2014, provided for a 0.5% update from 2013 payment rates under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule through 2014 and a 0% update from January 1 until April 1, 2015. If Congress fails to intervene to prevent the negative update factor in future years, the resulting decrease in payment may adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. 

In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced mark ets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements. 

Healthcare Reform 

In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations. In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the United States federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs. 

By way of example, in March 2010, the President signed one of the most significant healthcare reform measures in decades. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively known as the Affordable Care Act, substantially changes the way healthcare will be financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. The comprehensive $940 billion dollar overhaul is expected to extend coverage to approximately 32 million previously uninsured Americans. The Affordable Care Act contains a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes and fraud and abuse, which will impact existing government healthcare programs and will result in the development of new programs, including Medicare payment for performance initiatives and improvements to the physician quality reporting system and feedback program. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act: 

&#160;

&#8226; 

mandates a further shift in the burden of Medicaid payments to the states; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

increases the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand-name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

addresses a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

requires collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

requires manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program, under which they must agree to offer 50 percent point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer&#8217;s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and 

&#160;

&#8226; 

imposes a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell &#8220;branded prescription drugs&#8221; to specified federal government programs. 

In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was signed into law, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation&#8217;s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and will stay in effect through 2024 unless congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates if approved, or additional pricing pressure. 

Other U.S. Healt hcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 

In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation under various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing and education programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include: 

&#160;

&#8226; 

the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

the federal transparency laws, including the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, that requires drug manufacturers to disclose payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH Act, and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; and 

&#160;

&#8226; 

state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the industry&#8217;s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities in the future could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. In addition, recent health care reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the Affordable Care Act broadened the reach of the fraud and abuse laws by, among other things, amending the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the applicable criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. 

If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid and imprisonment, damages, fines and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. 

We are also subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which prohibits improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Safeguards we implement to discourage improper payments or offers of payments by our employees, consultants and others may be ineffective, and violations of the FCPA and similar laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, or other liabilities or proceedings against us, any of which would likely harm our reputation, business, financial condition and result of operations. 

U.S. Marketing Exclusivity 

Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs 

In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Act, Congress established abbreviated FDA approval procedures for drugs that are shown to be equivalent to proprietary drugs previously approved by the FDA under the NDA provisions of the statute. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency. An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, drug product formulation, specifications and stability of the generic drug, as well as analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data and quality control procedures. In support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the pre-clinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference listed drug, or RLD. 

Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must generally find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form and the strength of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is &#8220;bioequivalent&#8221; to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a RLD if &#8220;the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug. . . .&#8221; In certain situations, an applicant may obtain ANDA approval of a generic product with a strength or dosage form that differs from a referenced innovator drug pursuant to the filing and approval of an ANDA Suitability Petition. The FDA will approve the generic product as suitable for an ANDA application if it finds that the generic product does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the innovator product. A product is not eligible for ANDA approval if the FDA determines that it is not equivalent to the referenced innovator drug, if it is intended for a different use, or if it is not subject to an approved Suitability Petition. However, such a product might be approved under an NDA, with supportive data from clinical trials. 

Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates that the generic product is &#8220;therapeutically equivalent&#8221; to the RLD and it assigns a therapeutic equivalence rating to the approved generic drug in its publication &#8220;Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,&#8221; also referred to as the &#8220;Orange Book.&#8221; Physicians and pharmacists generally consider an &#8220;AB&#8221; therapeutic equivalence rating to mean that a generic drug is fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, FDA&#8217;s designation of an &#8220;AB&#8221; rating often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient. 

Non-Patent Exclusivity 

The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity, which is a drug that contains an active moiety that has not been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An &#8220;active moiety&#8221; is defined as the molecule or ion responsible for the drug substance&#8217;s physiological or pharmacologic action. In cases where such exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application referencing that drug may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years after the approval date of the referenced drug, unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the approval date of the referenced drug. The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product such as a new formulation for a previously approved product, if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. In cases where such exclusivity is granted, the FDA would be precluded from approving any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for the protected modification until after that three-year exclusivity period has run. However, unlike NCE exclusivity, the FDA can accept an application and begin the review process during the exclusivity period. 

A 505(b)(2) NDA applicant also may be eligible for its own regulatory exclusivity period, such as three-year exclusivity. The first approved 505(b)(2) applicant for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new extended release formulation for a previously approved product, may be granted three-year Hatch-Waxman exclusivity if one or more clinical studies, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted/sponsored by the applicant. Should this occur, the FDA would be precluded from making effective any other application for the same condition of use or for a change to the drug product that was granted exclusivity until after that three-year exclusivity period has run. Additional exclusivities may also apply to products approved through the 505(b)(2) pathway. 

Hatch-Waxm an Patent Certification and the 30-Month Stay 

In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant&#8217;s product or an approved method of using the product. Upon approval of the NDA, each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an applicant files an application with the FDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the applicant is not seeking approval. 

Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that: 

&#160;

&#8226; 

no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

the listed patent has expired; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or 

&#160;

&#8226; 

the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. 

&#160;

If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicate that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. 

A certification that the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted is known as a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent, the date of a settlement order or consent decree entered by the court stating that the patent is invalid or not infringed, or a court finding that the patent is invalid or infringed. 

Europe/Rest of World Government Regulation 

In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. 

Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, for example, a clinical trial application, or CTA, must be submitted to each country&#8217;s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country&#8217;s requirements, the clinical trial described in that CTA may proceed. 

The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the ICH GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. In the European Economic Area, or EEA (which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations: the Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, a body of the European Medicines Agency, or the EMA, and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA; and the National MA, which is issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only authorized marketing in that Member State&#8217;s national territory and not the EEA as a whole. 

The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegene rative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technic al innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. The National MA is for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the E EA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member Stat es through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Memb er state, or RMS. If the RMS proposes to authorize the product, and the other Member States do not raise objections, the product is granted a national MA in all the Member States where the authorization was sought. Before granting the MA, the EMA or the co mpetent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. 

If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
