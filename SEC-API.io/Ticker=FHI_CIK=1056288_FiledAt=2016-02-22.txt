 ITEM 1 &#8211; BUSINESS 

General 

Federated Investors, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation, together with its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, Federated), is a leading provider of investment management products and related financial services. Federated has been in the investment management business since 1955 and is one of the largest investment managers in the United States (U.S.) with $361.1 billion &#32;in assets under management (AUM or managed assets) at December 31, 2015 . 

Federated operates in one operating segment, the investment management business. Federated sponsors, markets and provides investment-related services to various investment products, including mutual funds and Separate Accounts (which include separately managed accounts, institutional accounts, sub-advised funds and other managed products) in both domestic and international markets. Federated's principal source of revenue is investment advisory fee income earned by various domestic subsidiaries of Federated pursuant to investment advisory contracts with the investment products. These subsidiaries are registered as investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act). Federated also has investment adviser subsidiaries that are located outside of the U.S. and registered with foreign regulators. Investment advisers are compensated for their services in the form of investment advisory fees based primarily upon the AUM of the investment products. 

Federated provided investment advisory services to 122 &#32;Federated-sponsored funds (the Federated Funds) as of December 31, 2015 . Federated markets these funds to banks, broker/dealers and other financial intermediaries who use them to meet the needs of customers and/or clients (collectively, customers), including retail investors, corporations and retirement plans. The Federated Funds are domiciled in the U.S., with the exception of Federated International Funds Plc and Federated Unit Trust, both of which are domiciled in Ireland, the Federated Cash Management Funds, which are domiciled in the United Kingdom and the Federated Short-Term Daily U.S. Dollar Fund, Ltd., which is domiciled in the Cayman Islands. In February 2016, the Federated Strategic Value U.S. Equity Dividend Fund, which is domiciled in Canada, was also initially offered. Most of Federated's U.S.-domiciled funds are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (1940 Act) and under other applicable federal laws. Each of the U.S.-domiciled registered funds enters into an advisory agreement that is subject to annual approval by the fund's board of directors or trustees, a majority of whom are not interested persons of the funds or Federated as defined under the 1940 Act. In general, material amendments to such advisory agreements must be approved by the funds' shareholders. A significant portion of Federated's revenue is derived from these advisory agreements, which are generally terminable upon 60 days notice to the investment adviser. 

Of the 122 &#32;Federated Funds as of December 31, 2015 , Federated's investment advisory subsidiaries managed 37 money market funds totaling $221.6 billion &#32;in AUM, 49 fixed-income funds with $38.0 billion &#32;in AUM and 36 equity funds with $34.1 billion &#32;in AUM. 

As of December 31, 2015 , Federated provided investment advisory services to $67.4 billion &#32;in Separate Account assets. These Separate Accounts represent assets of government entities, high-net-worth individuals, pension and other employee benefit plans, corporations, trusts, foundations, endowments, sub-advised mutual funds and other accounts or products owned or sponsored by third parties. Fees for Separate Accounts are typically based on AUM pursuant to investment advisory agreements that may be terminated at any time. 

Certain Federated Funds have adopted distribution plans that, subject to applicable law, provide for payment to Federated for distribution expenses, including sales commissions paid to broker/dealers. These distribution plans are implemented through a distribution agreement between Federated and each respective fund. Although the specific terms of each such agreement vary, the basic terms of the agreements are similar. Pursuant to these agreements, Federated acts as underwriter for the funds and distributes shares of the funds primarily through unaffiliated dealers. Each distribution plan and agreement is initially approved by the directors or trustees of the respective fund and is reviewed for approval by such directors or trustees annually as required under applicable law. 

Federated also provides a broad range of services to support the operation and administration of the Federated Funds. These services, for which Federated receives fees pursuant to agreements with the Federated Funds, include administrative services and shareholder servicing. 

Assets Under Management 

Total AUM are composed of Federated Funds, Separate Accounts and, prior to its complete liquidation in the fourth quarter of 2014, a liquidation portfolio and represent the balance of AUM at a point in time. Total managed assets for the past three years were as follows:

Average managed assets represent the average balance of AUM during a period of time. Because substantially all revenue and certain components of distribution expense are generally calculated daily based on AUM, changes in average managed assets are typically a key indicator of changes in revenue earned and asset-based expenses incurred during the same period. Average managed assets for the past three years were as follows:

Changes in Federated's average asset mix year-over-year across both asset classes and product/strategy types have a direct impact on Federated's operating income. Asset mix impacts Federated's total revenue due to the difference in the fee rates earned on each asset class and product/strategy type per invested dollar. Generally, management-fee rates charged for advisory services provided to equity products and strategies are higher than management-fee rates charged on money market and fixed-income products and strategies. &#32; Likewise, mutual funds typically have a higher management-fee rate than Separate Accounts. &#32;Additionally, certain components of distribution expense can vary depending upon the asset class, distribution channel and/or the size or structure of the customer relationship. Federated generally pays out a larger portion of the revenue earned from managed assets in money market funds than the revenue earned from managed assets in equity or fixed-income funds. 

Revenue 

Federated's revenues from investment advisory, administrative and other service fees provided under agreements with the Federated Funds and other entities over the last three years were as follows: &#160;

Low Short-Term Interest Rates &#32; 

In December 2015, the &#32;Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve Board ( FOMC ) increased the federal funds target rate range by 25 basis points to 0.25%-0.50%, slightly raising short-term interest rates late in the year. The federal funds target rate, which drives short-term interest rates, had been near zero for nearly seven years. &#32; As a result of the long-term near-zero interest-rate environment, &#32; the gross yield earned by certain money market funds is not sufficient to cover all of the fund's operating expenses. &#32; Since the fourth quarter of 2008, &#32;Federated has voluntarily waived fees (either through fee waivers or reimbursements or assumptions of expenses) in order for certain money market funds to maintain positive or zero net yields ( Voluntary Yield-related Fee Waivers ). These fee waivers have been partially offset by related reductions in distribution expense and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests as a result of Federated's mutual understanding and agreement with third-party intermediaries to share &#32; the impact of the Voluntary Yield-related Fee Waivers. &#32; 

These Voluntary Yield-related Fee Waivers are calculated as a percentage of AUM in certain money market funds and thus will vary depending upon the asset levels in such funds. &#32; In addition, &#32; the level of waivers are dependent on several other factors including, &#32; but not limited to, &#32; yields on instruments available for purchase by the money market funds, &#32; changes in expenses of the money market funds and changes in the mix of money market assets. &#32; In any given period, &#32; a combination of these factors drives the amount of Voluntary Yield-related Fee Waivers. &#32; As an isolated variable, &#32; an increase in yields on instruments held by the money market funds will cause the pre-tax impact of fee waivers to decrease. &#32; Conversely, &#32; as an isolated variable, &#32; an increase in expenses of the money market funds would cause the pre-tax impact of fee waivers to increase. &#32; 

With regard to asset mix, &#32; changes in the relative amount of money market fund assets in prime and government money market funds (or between such funds and other money market funds or other products) as well as the mix among certain share classes that vary in pricing structure will impact the level of fee waivers. &#32; Generally, &#32; prime money market funds waive less than government money market funds as a result of higher gross yields on the underlying investments. &#32; As such, &#32; as an isolated variable, &#32; an increase in the relative proportion of average managed assets invested in prime money market funds as compared to total average money market fund assets should typically result in lower &#32; Voluntary Yield-related Fee Waivers. &#32; Conversely, &#32; the opposite would also be true. &#32;&#32; 

These Voluntary Yield-related Fee Waivers &#32;impact various components of Federated's Consolidated Statements of Income, including revenue and operating income. See Item 1A &#32;- Risk Factors &#32;under the caption Potential Adverse Effects of Low Short-Term Interest Rates &#32;and Item 7 &#32;- Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#32;under the caption Business Developments &#32;- Low Short-Term Interest Rates &#32;for additional information. 

Investment Products 

Federated offers a wide range of products and strategies, including money market, equity and fixed-income investments. Federated's mix includes products and strategies that Federated expects to be in demand under a variety of economic and market conditions. Federated has structured its investment process to meet the requirements of fiduciaries and others who use Federated's products and strategies to meet the needs of their customers. Fiduciaries typically have stringent demands regarding portfolio composition, risk and investment performance. 

Federated is one of the largest U.S. managers of money market assets, with $256.4 billion &#32;in such AUM at December 31, 2015 . Federated has developed expertise in managing cash for institutions, which typically have strict requirements for regulatory compliance, relative safety, liquidity and competitive yields. Federated began selling money market fund products to institutions in 1974. Federated also manages retail money market products that are typically distributed through broker/dealers. At December 31, 2015 , Federated managed money market assets in the following asset classes: government ($124.2 billion); prime ($105.0 billion); tax-free ($17.8 billion); and non-U.S. domiciled ($9.4 billion). 

Federated's equity assets totaled $53.6 billion &#32;at December 31, 2015 &#32;and are managed across a wide range of styles including: value ($29.3 billion); growth ($10.9 billion); international/global ($5.0 billion); blend ($2.7 billion); and alternative ($0.6 billion). Federated also manages assets in balanced and asset allocation funds ($5.1 billion) which may also invest in fixed-income securities. 

Federated's fixed-income assets totaled $51.1 billion &#32;at December 31, 2015 &#32;and are managed in a wide range of categories including: multisector ($23.3 billion); high-yield ($8.1 billion); municipal ($6.4 billion); U.S. corporate ($5.2 billion); U.S. government ($4.8 billion); mortgage-backed ($1.7 billion); and international/global ($1.6 billion). 

Investment products are generally managed by a team of portfolio managers supported by fundamental and quantitative research analysts. Federated's proprietary, independent investment research process is centered on the integration of several disciplines including: fundamental research and credit analysis; quantitative research models; style-consistent and disciplined portfolio construction and management; performance attribution; and trading. 

Distribution Channels 

Federated's distribution strategy is to provide products and strategies geared toward financial intermediaries, primarily banks, broker/dealers and investment advisers and directly to institutions such as corporations and government entities. Federated provides comprehensive investment management to approximately 8,400 institutions and intermediaries including corporations, government entities, insurance companies, foundations, endowments, banks and broker/dealers. Federated uses its trained sales force of approximately 200 representatives and managers to add new customer relationships and strengthen and expand existing relationships. 

Product Markets 

Federated's investment products and strategies are distributed in four markets. These markets and the relative percentage of managed assets at December 31, 2015 &#32;attributable to such markets are as follows: wealth management and trust ( 43% ); broker/dealer ( 33% ); institutional ( 20% ); and international ( 4% ). 

Wealth Management &#38; Trust. &#32;Federated pioneered the concept of providing liquidity management to bank trust departments through money market mutual funds in 1974, and has since expanded its services nationwide to institutional cash management and treasury professionals, as well as financial professionals. Today, wealth management professionals across all of these types of firms use a broad range of Federated's equity, fixed-income and money market funds, and Separate Accounts, to invest the assets over which they have discretion. 

The majority of Federated's managed assets from the wealth management channel are invested in money market funds. In allocating investments across various asset classes, investors typically maintain a portion of their portfolios in cash or cash equivalents, including money market funds, irrespective of trends in bond or stock prices. In addition, Federated offers an extensive menu of equity and fixed-income mutual funds and Separate Accounts structured for this market. In addition to bank trust departments and registered investment advisory firms, Federated provides products and services to capital markets customers (institutional brokerages generally within banks) and directly to cash management and treasury departments at major corporations and government entities. 

Federated employs a dedicated sales force backed by an experienced support staff to offer products and strategies to the wealth management and trust market. As of December 31, 2015 , managed assets in this market included $129.2 billion in money market assets, $16.2 billion in fixed-income assets and $8.9 billion in equity assets. 

Broker/Dealer. &#32;Federated distributes its products and strategies in this market through a large, diversified group of approximately1,400 national, regional and independent broker/dealers and bank broker/dealers. Federated maintains sales staff dedicated to calling on broker/dealers, bank broker/dealers and insurance interests. Broker/dealers use Federated's products to meet the needs of their customers, who are typically retail investors. Federated also offers money market mutual funds as cash management products designed for use by its broker/dealer customers. As of December 31, 2015 , managed assets in the broker/dealer market included $66.2 billion in money market assets, $38.0 billion in equity assets and $15.7 billion in fixed-income assets. 

Institutional. &#32;Federated maintains a dedicated sales staff to focus on the distribution of its products and strategies to a wide variety of domestic institutional customers including corporations, corporate and public pension funds, government entities, foundations, endowments, hospitals, and non-Federated investment companies. As of December 31, 2015 , managed assets in the institutional market included $52.9 billion in money market assets, $16.3 billion in fixed-income assets and $4.6 billion in equity assets. 

International. &#32;Federated manages assets from customers outside the U.S. through subsidiaries focused on gathering assets in Europe, Canada, Latin America and the Middle East. As of December 31, 2015 , managed assets in the international market included $8.1 billion in money market assets, $2.9 billion in fixed-income assets and $2.1 billion in equity assets. 

Competition 

The investment management business is highly competitive. Competition is particularly intense among mutual fund providers. According to the Investment Company Institute, at the end of 2015 , there were approximately 8,100 open-end mutual funds of 

varying sizes and investment objectives whose shares are currently being offered to the public both on a sales-load and no-sales-load basis. In addition to competition from other mutual fund managers and investment advisers, Federated and the mutual fund industry compete with investment alternatives offered by insurance companies, commercial banks, broker/dealers, deposit brokers, other financial institutions, hedge funds and exchange traded funds. 

Competition for sales of investment products and strategies is influenced by various factors, including investment performance, attainment of stated objectives, yields and total returns, fees and expenses, advertising and sales promotional efforts, investor confidence and type and quality of services. 

Regulatory Matters &#32; 

Federated and its investment management business are subject to extensive regulation in the U.S. and abroad. &#32; Federated and its products (such as the Federated Funds) and strategies are subject to federal securities laws, &#32; principally the &#32;Securities Act of 1933 ( 1933 Act ), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( 1934 Act ), the 1940 Act, &#32; the Advisers Act, &#32; state laws regarding securities fraud, and regulations, or other rules, promulgated by various regulatory authorities, self-regulatory organizations or exchanges, &#32; as well as foreign laws, regulations or other rules promulgated by foreign regulatory or other authorities. &#32;See Item 1A &#32;- Risk Factors &#32;under the caption Potential Adverse Effects of Changes in Laws, Regulations and Other Rules on Federated's Investment Management Business &#32;for additional information. 

Current Regulatory Environment - Domestic 

Increased regulation and oversight of the investment management industry in the United States continued in 2015, and Federated anticipates it continuing in 2016. This increased regulation and oversight has required, and is expected to continue to require, additional internal and external resources to be devoted to technology, legal, compliance, operations and other efforts to address regulatory-related matters, and has caused, and may continue to cause, product structure, pricing, offering and development effort adjustments, as well as changes in assets flows and customer relationships. The current regulatory environment has affected, and is expected to continue to affect, to varying degrees Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 

The implementation of changes in response to the amendments to Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act (Rule 2a-7), and certain other laws and regulations, adopted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on July 23, 2014 (2014 Money Fund Rules), and the related SEC guidance that was last revised by the SEC staff on January 13, 2016 (Money Fund Rules Guidance), persisted in 2015 and is expected to continue in 2016. The 2014 Money Fund Rules built on initial money market fund reforms adopted by the SEC in 2010. Under the 2014 Money Fund Rules, compliance with certain current event and related website disclosure requirements was required on July 14, 2015. In addition to compliance with certain diversification, stress testing, and disclosure requirements by April 14, 2016, compliance with the 2014 Money Fund Rules is required by October 14, 2016 with respect to the floating net asset value (NAV) requirements for institutional prime and municipal (or tax-exempt) money market funds. These requirements will require such funds to utilize market-based valuations to calculate a floating NAV rather than using the amortized cost method for valuing securities maturing in more than 60 days to seek to maintain a stable NAV. Government or retail money market funds will be allowed to continue using the amortized cost method (and/or the penny rounding method of pricing) in calculating their NAVs. Compliance by October 14, 2016 also is required with respect to the provisions of the 2014 Money Fund Rules regarding the liquidity fees and redemption limits (gates) permitted, or in certain cases required, for money market funds (other than government money market funds), as well as related disclosure requirements. 

On May 20, 2015, the SEC proposed new rules relating to the modernization of investment company reporting. In addition to other requirements, these proposed rules, if adopted as proposed, would require additional or enhanced reporting relating to portfolio-wide and individual position levels, fund census data, and derivatives and securities lending activities, impose certain data format requirements, and permit website disclosure of fund shareholder reports in lieu of mailing them to shareholders. On May 20, 2015, the SEC also proposed amendments to Form ADV that, if adopted as proposed, would require, among other amendments, additional performance records to be maintained, and additional disclosure of borrowing and derivative information, relating to separately managed accounts. On September 16, 2015, the SEC issued final rules, which became effective on October 26, 2015, that removed all references to credit ratings from Rule 2a-7 and created a uniform credit quality standard under Rule 2a-7 under which a money market fund may invest in a security only if the fund determines that the security presents minimal credit risks after analyzing certain prescribed factors. These amendments also require a money market fund to adopt certain procedures related to an ongoing review of the credit quality of each of the fund's portfolio securities, clarify stress testing requirements for an event indicating or evidencing a credit deterioration of a portfolio security, and subject certain additional securities to the issuer diversification requirements under Rule 2a-7. 

On September 22, 2015, the SEC proposed certain rule amendments under the 1940 Act that, if adopted as proposed, would require open-end mutual funds (other than money market funds) and exchange traded funds to have liquidity risk management 

programs that contain certain required elements, including (among others): (1) classification of fund portfolio assets based on how quickly they could be liquidated; (2) assessment, periodic review and management of a fund's liquidity risk; (3) the establishment of a minimum percentage of assets that could be liquidated in three days; and (4) fund board review and approval. The proposed rules also would provide a framework under which covered mutual funds could elect to use "swing pricing" to effectively pass on the costs stemming from shareholder purchase and redemption transactions to the shareholders transacting in the funds' shares. On December 11, 2015, the SEC proposed new rules that, if adopted as proposed, would enhance the regulation of the use of derivatives by investment companies. Under these proposed rules, a fund would be required (among other requirements) to (1) comply with one of two alternative portfolio limitations designed to limit the amount of leverage the fund may obtain through derivatives and certain other transactions, (2) manage the risks associated with the fund's derivatives transactions by segregating certain assets in an amount designed to enable the fund to meet its obligations, including under stressed conditions, (3) if the fund engages in more than a limited amount of derivatives transactions or uses certain complex derivatives, establish a formalized derivatives risk management program, and (4) if a fund uses certain financial commitment transactions, such as reverse repurchase agreements and short sales, segregate certain assets to cover the fund's obligations under such transactions. 

The SEC staff also has engaged, and continues to engage, in a series of investigations, enforcement actions and/or examinations involving investment management industry participants, including certain sweep examinations of investment management companies involving various topics, such as fixed-income and high yield liquidity, liquidity controls, liquid alternatives, cybersecurity, side-by-side management of private funds, private placements, separately managed or wrap-fee accounts, excessive trading, "distribution in guise," and intermediary and other payments and related disclosures. The SEC staff also continued in 2015, and is expected to continue in 2016, to focus its attention on liquidity and redemption risks, leverage, information security, vendor risk management and other operational risks, and the failure/closing of investment industry participants. These investigations, actions and examinations have led, and may lead, to further regulation and scrutiny of the investment management industry. For example, on September 21, 2015, the SEC announced a settlement of an enforcement action brought against a third-party mutual fund investment adviser and distributor relating to alleged improper payments to intermediaries. In 2015, the SEC staff also issued guidance statements on (among other topics) cybersecurity and, in January 2016, issued a guidance statement on mutual fund distribution and sub-accounting fees, which provided guidance based, in part, on the SEC staff's "distribution in guise" sweep examination and outlined the SEC staff's views on issues that may arise when mutual funds make payments to financial intermediaries that provide shareholder and recordkeeping services to shareholders, particularly regarding whether a portion of those payments may be viewed as being used to finance distribution of fund shares. 

Regulation or potential regulation by other regulators, in addition to the SEC, also continued in 2015, and is expected to continue in 2016, to affect investment management industry participants, including Federated. Among other regulatory changes, at the time the 2014 Money Fund Rules were adopted, the U.S. Treasury Department (Treasury Department) and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued certain rules aimed at, among other things, addressing for investors in an institutional prime or municipal (or tax- exempt) money market fund with a fluctuating NAV the application of wash sale rules and relief from the tax burdens derived from small capital gains and losses for shareholders that frequently purchase or redeem shares (such as through a broker/dealer or bank "sweep arrangement"). On July 31, 2014, the Financial Stability Oversight Counsel (FSOC) indicated that it intended to monitor the effectiveness of the 2014 Money Fund Rules, which prompted concerns that the FSOC may recommend new or heightened regulation for "non-bank financial companies" under Section 120 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), which the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Governors) have indicated can include open-end investment companies, such as money market funds and other mutual funds. Management continues to respectfully disagree with this position and does not believe that asset managers and management products, such as money market funds, create systemic risk. More recently, the FSOC has moved away from potential systemically important financial institution designations of asset managers or investment products, in favor of studying the financial stability implications of the asset management sector. At its September 2015 meeting, the FSOC indicated that it was engaged in an ongoing process of evaluating the asset management industry. Certain proposed legislation currently pending in Congress also seeks to address, among other items relating to the FSOC's authority, the transparency of the FSOC's decision making process. 

Finally, debate continued in 2015, and likely will continue in 2016, over a proposed fiduciary standard for broker/dealers and other intermediaries, including the Department of Labor's proposed fiduciary standard applicable to retirement plan advisers. The DOL's proposed fiduciary rule, if adopted as proposed, would address conflicts of interest raised by the receipt of compensation (such as Rule 12b-1 fees) by retirement plan advisers by requiring such advisers to (among other requirements) put their clients' interests before their own profits, acknowledge their fiduciary status, enter into customer contracts addressing standards of impartial conduct, provide disclosure regarding investment fees and costs, adopt certain policies and procedures to address conflicts of interest and retain certain records. 

Management believes that the floating NAV under the 2014 Money Fund Rules will be detrimental to Federated's money market fund business and could materially and adversely affect Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Federated continues to dedicate internal and external resources to analyzing and addressing the evolving changes to these various regulations applicable to Federated, including the 2014 Money Fund Rules, Money Fund Rules Guidance, and the investment company modernization, uniform credit standard, liquidity, derivative and other final and proposed regulations, guidance, initiatives and actions referred to above (Other Regulatory Developments), and their effect on Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. For example, as appropriate, Federated participated, and will continue to participate, either individually or with industry groups in the comment process for proposed regulations. Federated also has expended, and anticipates expending in 2016, legal and compliance resources to adopt, revise and/or implement policies and procedures and to respond to examinations, inquiries and other matters involving its regulators, including the SEC, customers or other third parties. Federated has devoted, and expects in 2016 to devote, resources to technology and system investment, and the development of other investment management and compliance tools, to enable Federated to, among other things, be in a position to address new regulatory requirements. The 2014 Money Fund Rules, Money Fund Rules Guidance, and Other Regulatory Developments, and related regulatory oversight, also impacted, and/or may impact, Federated's customers and vendors, their preferences and their businesses, which has caused, and may cause, certain money market fund products to be less attractive to institutional and other investors, reductions in AUM and revenues, and/or adjustments to product structures and pricing, offerings and development efforts, as well as asset flows and customer relationships. Federated has dedicated, and expects in 2016 to continue to dedicate, resources to planning and implementing product development and restructuring initiatives in response to the 2014 Money Fund Rules, Money Fund Rules Guidance and Other Regulatory Developments. Federated's analysis, planning and implementation efforts have included, and are expected to continue to include, consideration of Federated's legislative, regulatory, product structure and development, information system development, reporting capability, business and other options that have been or may be available in an effort to minimize the potential impact of any adverse consequences. 

While significant steps in Federated's efforts to adjust its product line in response to the 2014 Money Fund Rules, Money Fund Rules Guidance, and Other Regulatory Developments have been completed, Federated's plans are not finalized or completed, continue to evolve and remain subject to fund board and, in certain cases, fund shareholder and other review and approvals. Federated has taken, and continues to take, steps to adjust its product line to address the liquidity management needs of its broad array of customers. Federated will continue to offer Treasury and government money market funds without the liquidity fees or gates as permitted by the 2014 Money Fund Rules. Federated's Treasury and government money market funds will continue to seek a $1.00 NAV per share. Federated has designated a subset of its prime and municipal money market funds as retail money market funds under the 2014 Money Fund Rules, and Federated's retail money market funds will continue to seek to maintain an NAV of $1.00 per share and have the required provisions for liquidity fees and gates under the 2014 Money Fund Rules. Federated plans to offer four institutional prime and national municipal (or tax-exempt) money market funds that will, beginning on or about October 14, 2016, have an initial NAV of $1.0000 that fluctuates and have the required provisions for liquidity fees and gates. Federated has filed a registration statement for an institutional 60-day maximum maturity fund, and continues to evaluate converting certain existing Federated Funds to 60-day maximum maturity funds, while other existing funds will remain 397-day maximum maturity funds. Other steps in Federated's product line adjustments have included, or may include, for example, reorganizing, renaming, modifying, making pricing adjustments or adding share classes to certain existing Federated Funds, modifying fund disclosures and developing new products and strategies. For example, Federated continues to explore investment options for certain customers and anticipates launching in 2016 one or more private funds that mirror existing Federated money market funds as investment options for qualified investors. Federated anticipates that the adjustments to Federated's product line will offer investors a full menu of product choices for liquidity management. 

Federated will announce any further plans relating to the adjustments to its product line periodically in advance of the October 14, 2016 final mandatory compliance date under the 2014 Money Fund Rules to give customers the opportunity to plan for their liquidity management needs. Subject to Federated Fund board and, in certain cases, shareholder and other approvals and disclosure, Federated expects to implement remaining adjustments to its product line prior to the final mandatory compliance date. Further analysis and planning, or additional refinements to Federated's product line, may be required in response to market, customer or regulatory changes, such as further updates to the Money Fund Rules Guidance, the Other Regulatory Developments or any additional regulation or guidance issued by the SEC or other regulators. 

On a cumulative basis, &#32; Federated's regulatory, product development and restructuring, &#32; and other efforts in response to the &#32; 2014 Money Fund Rules, &#32; Money Fund Rules Guidance, &#32; and Other Regulatory Developments, &#32; including the internal and external resources dedicated to such efforts, have had, and may continue to have, a material impact on Federated's expenses and, in turn, financial performance. &#32;As of December 31, 2015, given the 2014 Money Fund Rules, Money Fund Rules Guidance and Other Regulatory Developments, and the potential for future additional regulation or guidance, Federated is unable at this time to fully assess the degree of the impact of these regulatory requirements and developments, and Federated's related efforts, on its business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. These regulatory changes and developments, and 

Federated's efforts in responding to them, could have a material and adverse effect on Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Federated also is unable to assess whether, or the degree to which, any of the Federated Funds, including money market funds or any of its other products, could ultimately be designated a systemically important non-bank financial company by the FSOC. In management's view, the issuance of final regulations pertaining to systemically important non-bank financial companies is, and any reforms ultimately put into effect would be, detrimental to Federated's money market fund business and could materially and adversely affect Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Federated also is unable to assess at this time whether, or the degree to which, any potential options being evaluated in connection with these regulatory requirements and developments ultimately may be successful. 

International 

European Union money market fund reform efforts continued in 2015 without reforms being adopted and are expected to continue in 2016. European-based money market funds face regulatory reform pressure in Europe similar to that faced in the U.S. On September 4, 2013, the European Commission released its money market fund reform proposal, which would have permitted either floating NAV money market funds or constant NAV (CNAV) money market funds that would have had to either build a capital buffer of 3% or convert to a floating NAV money market fund. On April 29, 2015, the European Parliament approved its version of money market fund reform, which, if adopted as proposed, would provide for (1) retail CNAV funds (to include charity, not for profit, public body and public foundation investors); (2) government CNAV funds that invest at least 99.5% of assets in government and government-guaranteed securities (and by 2020 in European Union government and government-guaranteed securities only); and (3) institutional funds constituting either (a) low volatility NAV (LVNAV) funds, which would be open to all investors, and could use amortized cost accounting for portfolio securities maturing within 90 days and mark-to-market prices for portfolio securities maturing after 90 days and that are subject to sunset within five years or at the European Commission's review, or (b) variable NAV (VNAV) money market funds (subject to new independent pricing rules not previously applied to VNAV funds in Europe and mark-to-market prices for all their portfolio securities). Under the European Parliament's proposal the retail CNAV, government CNAV and LVNAV funds would be required to have certain triggers in place for liquidity fees and gates, ratings would be permitted for money market funds, and there would be a nine month implementation period starting after the final regulation is promulgated. 

The next step in the European reform process is for the European Council, which is made up of representatives from each Member State, to adopt its own version of money market fund reform and to then negotiate at a trialogue with European Parliament to form a final European text. Formal discussions of the money market fund reform file commenced under the Italian Presidency (July 1, 2014 - December 31, 2014). It is unclear whether formal discussions on the money market fund reform file will resume under the Netherlands Presidency (January 1, 2016 - June 30, 2016) or later. Negotiations at the European Council level are likely to continue through 2016 and the proposed money market fund reform could vary materially from that proposed by the European Parliament. Management does not anticipate final resolution on an agreed upon European regulation until the second half of 2016 at the earliest. 

Discussions regarding a European Financial Transactions Tax (FTT) also continued in 2015 without the FTT being adopted and are expected to continue in 2016. Notwithstanding challenges to its legality, discussions have continued regarding the scope, application and allocation of the FTT. Proponents of the FTT have sought the widest possible application of the FTT with low tax rates. On December 8, 2015, after one of the 11 participating European Union Member States, Estonia, dropped out of the discussions, and despite opposition by the United Kingdom, the remaining 10 participating Member States agreed on certain fundamental aspects of the tax, including that: (1) the FTT should apply to all (including intra-day) share transactions, except transactions of agents and clearing members when acting as facilitators and, possibly, certain narrowly-defined market making transactions; and (2) the FTT should apply to derivatives based on the principle of the widest possible base and low rates, without impacting the cost of sovereign borrowing, and be determined based on the type of derivative involved in a transaction (e.g., for option-type derivatives, preferably the option premium; for other types of derivatives coming with a maturity, preferably a term-adjusted notional amount or, where available, market value; and for other types of derivatives not coming with a maturity, the notional amount or, where available, market value), with adjustments to the tax base in some cases to avoid distortions and no market making exception. While the remaining participating Member States generally agreed that the jurisdictional scope of the FTT should be based on the location of the parties to the transaction and the share issuer, and that the impact of the FTT on the real economy and pension schemes should be minimized, additional analysis and discussions will be conducted on the FTT's impact, the financial viability of the FTT for each country and certain other issues. The participating Member States agreed to target mid-2016 for a final agreement on the FTT. The Netherlands Presidency of the European Council, however, did not include the FTT among the topics due for political agreement during its six-month term ending June 30, 2016. In late January 2016, Johan Van Overtveldt, the Finance Minister of Belgium, one of the remaining 10 participating Member States, announced that the present drafts of the FTT proposal were unacceptable. A February meeting of 

ministers from the Member States supporting the FTT also was canceled. If an agreement on the FTT is reached, management does not anticipate any such agreement until the second half of 2016 at the earliest. The time needed to implement any agreement is not known at this time. 

After publishing an initial consultative document on "Assessment Methodologies for Identifying Non-Bank Non-Insurer Global Systemically Important Financial Institutions" in January, 2014, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) published for comment on March 6, 2015 a second consultative document on "Assessment Methodologies for Identifying Non-Bank Non-Insurer Global Systemically Important Financial Institutions" (Second Consultation), in which the FSB and IOSCO took a more inclusive approach setting forth revised methodologies for assessing the systemic risk of investment funds with an increased focus on leverage, and a new methodology for asset managers that focuses on activities that are conducted by a particular asset manager and may have the potential to generate systemic risk and warrant consideration. Each methodology contemplated the application of a materiality threshold to determine an assessment pool and requires assessment of global systemic importance for entities selected for further analysis by reviewing "impact factors" (e.g., size, interconnectedness, complexity, substitutability, and cross jurisdictional activities) based on sector-specific indicators relating to each of the relevant impact factors. As noted in its May 29, 2015 comment letter submitted to the FSB and IOSCO on the Second Consultation, Federated believes that the application of Second Consultation's criteria should generally result in the exclusion of funds and asset managers that do not make significant use of leverage or derivatives from being designated as non-bank, non-insurance company global systemically important financial institutions under the Second Consultation. Management believes that money market funds should not be designated as non-bank, non-insurance company global systemically important financial institutions. On June 17, 2015, IOSCO announced that its risk analysis will initially focus on industry activities and managers in the broader global financial context in identifying potential systemic risks, rather than on the size of asset managers, but that after that review is complete, work on methodologies for the identification of individual entities should be reassessed. On July 30, 2015, the FSB announced that it has decided to wait to finalize the assessment methodologies for non-bank non-insurance company global systemically important financial institutions until after its current work on financial stability risks stemming from asset management activities is completed. The FSB indicated that, after discussing its initial findings in September 2015, it will develop activities-based policy recommendations by spring 2016. At that time, it is expected that the FSB, together with IOSCO, will conduct further analyses and attempt to finalize the asset management methodology. 

European money market reform and the imposition of the FTT, particularly if enacted with broad application, would each be detrimental to Federated's fund business and could materially and adversely affect Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Federated is unable to assess the degree of any potential impact that European money market reform proposals or the FTT may have on its business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows until such proposals are finalized and approved or the FTT is enacted. Federated also is unable to assess whether, or the degree to which Federated, any of its investment management subsidiaries or any of the Federated Funds, including money market funds, or any of its other products, could ultimately be determined to be a non-bank, non-insurance company global systemically important financial institution at this time.
