 

1. Description of Business 

New Jersey Mining Company (&#147;the Company&#148;) was incorporated as an Idaho corporation on July 18, 1996. The Company's primary business is exploring for and developing gold, silver, and base metal mineral resources in the Greater Coeur d&#146;Alene Mining District of North Idaho and extending into Western Montana. It is currently evaluating new mineral investment and development opportunities in the western United States. The Company is currently focused on advanced stage exploration and development assets that could be developed into near-term cash flow. During late 2014, one of its mineral properties had a new mine developed and put into production by a lessee. The New Jersey Mill was also put into production in 2014 to process ore from the Golden Chest Mine. The mine and mill were in production through the first three quarters of 2015. Production has since been halted due to continued low gold prices but is expected to resume in the second or third quarter of 2016.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Principles of Consolidation 

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries, the New Jersey Mill Joint Venture (&#147;NJMJV&#148;), Golden Chest LLC Joint Venture (&#147;GCJV&#148;), and GF&#38;H Company (&#147;GF&#38;H&#148;). Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. The Company owns less than 100% and controls both NJMJV and GF&#38;H. The portion of both of these entities owned by other investors is presented as non-controlling interests.

Accounting for Investments in Joint Ventures 

For joint ventures where the Company holds more than 50% of the voting interest and has significant influence, the joint venture is consolidated with the presentation of non-controlling interest. In determining whether significant influence exists, the Company considers its participation in policy-making decisions and its representation on the venture&#146;s management committee.

For joint ventures in which the Company does not have joint control or significant influence, the cost method is used. Under the cost method, these investments are carried at the lower of cost or fair value. For those joint ventures in which there is joint control between the parties, the equity method is utilized whereby the Company&#146;s share of the ventures&#146; earnings and losses is included in the statement of operations as earnings in joint ventures and its investments therein are adjusted by a similar amount. The Company periodically assesses its investments in joint ventures for impairment. If management determines that a decline in fair value is other than temporary it will write-down the investment and charge the impairment against operations.

At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the Company&#146;s percentage ownership and method of accounting for each joint venture is as follows:

Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements 

Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Company&#146;s equity. Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original acquisition and the non-controlling investor&#146;s share of changes in equity since that date.

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes for items such as depreciation lives and methods, potential impairment of long-lived assets, deferred income taxes, estimation of asset retirement obligations and reclamation liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition 

Revenue is recognized when title and risk of ownership of metals or metal bearing concentrate have passed and collection is reasonably assured. Revenue from the sale of metals may be subject to adjustment upon final settlement of estimated metal prices, weights and assays, and are recorded as adjustments to revenue in the period of final settlement of prices, weights and assays; such adjustments are typically not material in relation to the initial invoice amounts. Revenue received from drilling and exploration contracts with third parties is recognized when the contract has been established, the services are rendered and collection of payment is deemed probable. These services are not a part of normal operations. Income received as the operator of the Company's joint ventures is recognized in the months during which those operations occur. Revenue received from engineering services provided is recognized when services are rendered and collection of payment is deemed probable. These services are not a part of normal operations. Revenues from mill operations and custom milling are recognized in the period in which the milling is performed and collection of payment is deemed probable.

Income Taxes 

Income taxes are accounted for under the liability method. Under this method deferred income tax liabilities or assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when the taxes are expected to be paid or recovered. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets, if there is uncertainty regarding their realization.

Fair Values of Financial Instruments 

The Company discloses the following information for each class of assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value:

1.

the fair value measurement;

2.

the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurements in their entirety fall, segregating fair value measurements using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1), significant other observable inputs (Level 2), and significant unobservable inputs (Level 3);

3.

for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3), a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances, separately presenting changes during the period attributable to the following:

a.

total gains or losses for the period (realized and unrealized), segregating those gains or losses included in earnings, and a description of where those gains or losses included in earnings are reported in the statement of operations;

b.

the amount of these gains or losses attributable to the change in unrealized gains or losses relating to those assets or liabilities still held at the reporting period date and a description of where those unrealized gains or losses are reported; 

c.

purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements (net); and

d.

transfers into and/or out of Level 3.

4.

the amount of the total gains or losses for the period included in earnings that are attributable to the change in unrealized gains or losses relating to those assets and liabilities still held at the reporting date and a description of where those unrealized gains or losses are reported in the statement of operations; and

5.

in annual periods only, the valuation technique(s) used to measure fair value and a discussion of changes in valuation techniques, if any, during the period.

The carrying amounts of financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, reclamation bonds, milling advance, note receivable, notes payable to related parties, and notes payable approximate their fair values.

Net Income (Loss) Per Share 

Net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net amount by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted net income (loss) per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through stock options, warrants, and other convertible securities. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the effect of the Company&#146;s potential issuance of shares from the exercise of 10,200,000 warrants and 5,750,000 stock options in 2015 and 21,200,000 warrants and 4,500,000 stock options in 2014 would have been anti-dilutive. Accordingly, only basic net loss per share has been presented. Outstanding warrants and options are discussed in detail in Note 9 of the financial statements.

Reclassifications 

Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2015 financial statement presentation. Reclassifications had no effect on net loss, stockholders' equity, or cash flows as previously reported.

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

The Company considers cash in banks and other deposits with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash and cash equivalents.

Property, Plant and Equipment 

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are based on the estimated useful lives of the assets and are computed using straight-line or units-of-production methods. The expected useful life of most of the Company&#146;s buildings is up to 50 years and equipment life expectancy ranges between 2 and 10 years. When assets are retired or sold, the costs and related allowances for depreciation and amortization are eliminated from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations.

Mineral Properties 

Significant payments related to the acquisition of mineral properties, mineral rights, and mineral leases are capitalized. 

If a commercially mineable ore body is discovered, such costs are amortized when production begins using the units-of-production method based on proven and probable reserves. If no commercially mineable ore body is discovered, or such rights are otherwise determined to have no value, such costs are expensed in the period in which it is determined the property has no future economic value.

Mine Exploration and Development Costs 

The Company expenses exploration costs as such in the period they occur. Mine development costs are capitalized as deferred development costs after proven and probable reserves have been identified. Amortization of deferred development costs is calculated using the units-of-production method over the expected life of the operation based on the estimated recoverable mineral ounces.

Claim Fees 

Unpatented claim fees paid at time of staking are expensed when incurred. Recurring renewal fees which are paid annually are recorded as prepaid and expensed over the course of the year.

Impairment of Properties and Property Evaluations 

The Company evaluates the carrying amounts of its mineral properties, including deferred development costs, for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. Estimated discounted and undiscounted future net cash flows from each mineral property are calculated using estimated future production, three year average metals prices, operating capital and costs, and reclamations costs. An impairment loss is recognized when the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset are less than the carrying amount of the asset. The Company&#146;s estimates of future cash flows are subject to risks and uncertainties. It is reasonably possible that changes in estimates could occur which may affect the expected recoverability of the Company&#146;s investments in mineral properties.

Asset Retirement Obligations and Remediation Costs 

Mineral properties are subject to standards for mine reclamation that have been established by various governmental agencies. Asset retirement obligations are related to the retirement of the mine when a contractual obligation has been established, if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be determined. These obligations are initially measured at fair value with the resulting cost capitalized at the present value of estimated reclamation costs. An asset and a related liability are recorded for the fair value of these costs. The liability is accreted and the asset amortized over the life of the related asset. Adjustments are made for changes resulting from either the timing or amount of the original estimate underlying the obligation. If there is an impairment to an asset&#146;s carrying value and a decision is made to permanently close the property, changes to the liability are recognized and charged to the provision for closed operations and environmental matters. Separate from asset retirement obligations, the Company records liability for remediation costs when a reasonable estimate of fair value can be determined. Remediation costs are not discounted.

Reclamation Bonds 

Various laws and permits require that financial assurances be in place for certain environmental and reclamation obligations and other potential liabilities. There is currently no balance being carried for any reclamation bonds.

Share Based Compensation or Payments 

All transactions in which goods or services are received for the issuance of shares of the Company&#146;s common stock are accounted for based on the fair value of the goods or services received or the fair value of the common stock issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. We estimate the fair value of our stock-based compensation using the Black-Scholes model, which requires the input of some subjective assumptions. These assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them (&#147;expected life&#148;), the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term (&#147;volatility&#148;), employee forfeiture rate, the risk-free interest rate and the dividend yield. Changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock-based compensation. The value of common stock awards is determined based upon the closing price of our stock on the date of the award.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

On January 5, 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-01, Financial Instruments &#150; Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The update intends to enhance the reporting model for financial instruments to provide users of financial instruments with more decision-useful information and addresses certain aspects of the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The new standard affects all entities that hold financial assets or owe financial liabilities. ASU 2016-01 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Management has not determined the effect, if any, this new standard will have on its financial statements. 

ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers creates a new, principle-based revenue recognition framework that will affect nearly every revenue-generating entity. The guidance in ASU 2014-09 is allowable for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and required for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Management has not determined the effect, if any, this new standard will have on its financial statements.

3. Going Concern 

As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company had minimal revenue and a net loss of $282,088 in 2015, an accumulated deficit, negative working capital, and a Cash and Cash Equivalents balance of $62,275 at December 31, 2015. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern.

However, the Company did put the New Jersey Mill into production in 2015 and is proceeding with plans to both mine and mill ore from the Golden Chest property in 2016 if successful in raising the required startup funds. In the first three quarters of 2015 the Company did generated revenue from milling ores from the Golden Chest Mine.

The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue its operations. 

4. Note Receivable 

On September 30, 2014 the Company loaned $58,386 to Premium Exploration (USA) Inc under a convertible promissory note. The note carries simple interest at 8% and matures on August 1, 2015 at which time the principal and interest is due. At any time prior to expiration the note is convertible to shares of Premium Exploration Inc. Premium Exploration has since filed for bankruptcy however the Company is listed as a creditor in the bankruptcy proceedings and still expects to receive payment and has accrued no reserve for uncollectibility at December 31, 2015

During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement to acquire the Eastern Star Elk City property for $425,000. The agreement called for a down payment of $125,000 in April 2014 and a promissory note for the balance at 5% per annum. As scheduled, the next payment of $125,000 was made on August 15, 2014. Final payment of $175,000 was due on July 15, 2015. The agreement was structured such that the Company could opt to not make the final payment and receive title to parcels of the Elk City property covered by the first two payments. The Company opted out of making the final payment and has received title to the property for which payment has been made.

New Jersey 

The Coleman property is located at the New Jersey Mine area of interest and consists of 62 acres of patented mining claims, mineral rights to 108 acres of fee land, 80 acres of land for which the Company owns the surface but not the mineral rights, and approximately 130 acres of unpatented mining claims. The Coleman property was acquired in October 2002. As of December 31, 2015, an impairment analysis determined that the property&#146;s value had been impaired based upon current mineral prices and market conditions and a non receiving impairment loss of $70,098 was recognized. At December 31, 2015 and 2014 the balance includes asset retirement costs of $23,365. Fair value of the property was determined using Level 3 fair value inputs based on recent sales of comparable properties in the immediate area.

McKinley 

The McKinley Project is an exclusive exploration and mining lease which covers several historic mines and prospects, including the McKinley Mine, Ibex Mine, and Big Easy Mine, on private land located in central Idaho near the town of Lucile. On December 31, 2013, NJMC received all rights and agreements, intellectual property, historic and recent due diligence, surveys and maps, along with a 12-month option to purchase the historic McKinley Mine, located on 62 acres within the overall land package. The option to purchase the McKinley mine has been extended by an additional 24 months to November 18, 2016.

Golden Chest 

The Golden Chest is an exploration and underground mine project located near Murray, Idaho consisting of 25 patented and 70 unpatented mining claims. Previously owned by GCJV the property is now owned by NJMC after the Company acquired the remaining 52.22% interest in the 4 th quarter of 2015 (Note 15).

Silver Button/Roughwater 

The Silver Button claim is the remaining property of the ten claims acquired from Roughwater Mining Company. During 2005, the other nine Roughwater unpatented claims were dropped. In 2001, the Company purchased the property through the issuance of 255,000 shares of its common stock to Roughwater Mining Company. The shares were valued at $0.10 per share, for a total acquisition cost of $25,500. As of December 31, 2015 an impairment analysis determined that the property had no value using Level 3 fair value inputs based on current mineral prices and market conditions and an impairment loss for the entire $25,500 carrying value was recognized.

Toboggan 

Toboggan is a gold and silver exploration project consisting of 106 claims covering 2,100 acres of federal land administered by the U.S. Forest Service. In 2001, the Company issued 50,000 shares of stock to an individual to acquire the rights. The shares were valued at $0.10 per share for a total acquisition cost of $5,000. This cost was for a portion of the claims in the Toboggan property that were purchased; the remaining claims were staked by the Company.

8. Asset Retirement Obligation 

The Company has established asset retirement obligations associated with the ultimate closing of its mineral properties. Below is a reconciliation as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 of the Company&#146;s asset retirement obligations. The estimated reclamation costs were originally discounted using a credit adjusted, risk-free interest rate of 5.4%.

9. Mining and Milling Venture Agreements 

Golden Chest LLC (&#147;GCJV&#148;) 

In December of 2010, a limited liability company was formed between the Company and Marathon Gold USA (MUSA). MUSA&#146;s contribution to GCJV was $4,000,000 paid in installments ending on November 30, 2011. The Company contributed to GCJV all of its interests in the Golden Chest Mine, including unpatented claims and some mining equipment with a carrying value of $553,205. At inception, GCJV purchased the patented mining claims for $3.75 million with $500,000 paid at closing in December 2010 and the remainder due under a Promissory Note and Mortgage at the rate of $500,000 per year with quarterly payments and the $250,000 balance due in the seventh and final year. The note is collateralized by a first mortgage on the claims. Funding in 2012 and future funding for the venture is being paid by each partner at a percentage equal to their ownership, which in 2012 and through June of 2013 was 50 percent per partner. In May and June of 2013, the Company elected not to participate in some funding calls resulting in dilution of its ownership interest in GCJV. During the year ended December 31, 2012 the Company began accounting for the GCJV using the equity method because significant influence was obtained during the year. After dilution of its share in 2013, significant influence was no longer possessed and accounting for the Joint Venture reverted back to the cost method.

9. Mining and Milling Venture Agreements, continued 

On September 3, 2013, GCJV signed a lease agreement with Juniper Resources, LLC (Juniper) of Boise, Idaho for a defined portion of the Golden Chest mine property. The lease with Juniper called for an initial payment of $50,000 to GCJV, which was received, and a work requirement of 1,500 to 3,000 meters of core drilling which was completed during 2014. Juniper signed the lease and made a payment of $200,000 to GCJV at the end of November 2013. Juniper was required to make land payments of $125,000 per quarter on the promissory note on behalf of GCJV. Additionally, Juniper paid a 2% net smelter royalty to GCJV on all gold production from the leased area with the $250,000 initial payments treated as an advance on this royalty. The lease was assigned to Gold Hill Reclamation and Mining Inc. (&#147;Gold Hill&#148;), a company affiliated with Juniper, on September 3, 2013. The lease had a term of 39 months. A Milling advance of $200,000 was received from Gold Hill November 7, 2014 to facilitate the start-up of the mill. The advance was to be paid back to Gold Hill as a reduction in future invoices for milling services once full production was achieved. Payments totaling $75,000 were made in the second and third quarter of 2015. Gold Hill began shipping ore in the 4 th quarter of 2014 and continued with shipments through the 3 rd quarter of 2015.

10. Income Taxes 

The Company did not recognize a provision (benefit) for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2015and 2014.

At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had deferred tax assets principally arising from the net operating loss carry forwards for income tax purposes multiplied by an expected rate of 40%. As management of the Company cannot determine that it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance equal to the deferred tax asset has been established at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. The significant components of the deferred tax asset at December 31, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:

We are open to examination of our income tax filings in the United States and state jurisdictions for the 2013 through 2015 tax years. In the event that the Company is assessed penalties and or interest, penalties will be charged to other operating expense and interest will be charged to interest expense. Certain tax positions taken in the 2013 through 2014 tax years could result in minor adjustments to our exploration and development costs for tax purposes. However, these adjustments would not result in a tax provision, but only revise to the net operating loss carry forward balance.

&#160;

As the Company&#146;s carrying value of their previously held 47.77% interest was Nil at the time of acquisition, a gain was recorded as remeasurement of previously held interest. The fair value of the remeasurement was established based upon the purchase price of 52.22% of GCJV held by MUSA for $180,000 which resulted in an impued full value for the property of $344,696 which implied that the original investment held a value of $164,696.

The note discount was calculated at an assumed rate of 10% for the remaining 10 quarterly payments on the full note value of $1,125,000 at the date of acquisition resulting in a discount of $155,992 to be amortized over the remainder of the note. At December 31, 2015 the balance remaining of the discount was $128,642.

The Company purchased the outstanding share in GCJV to consolidate ownership and facilitate exploration and mining plans going forward.
