&#160; 

Markets 

&#160; 

Our systems are used in the creation of a broad range of microelectronic components, including LEDs, MEMS, radio frequency (&#147;RF&#148;) filters, power semiconductors, thin film magnetic heads (&#147;TFMHs&#148;), and compound semiconductor devices. Our customers who manufacture these devices invest in our systems to develop next generation products and deliver more efficient, cost effective, and advanced technological solutions. We operate in a cyclical business environment, and our customers&#146; buying patterns are dependent upon industry trends. Our products are sold into multiple markets, and the following discussion focuses on the trends that most influence our business within each of those markets. 

&#160; 

Lighting, Display &#38; Power Electronics 

&#160; 

LED technology has existed for more than 50 years; however, commercial adoption of LEDs was limited to niche applications until the most recent decade. In the early 1990&#146;s, researchers developed a process utilizing Gallium Nitride (&#147;GaN&#148;) that created a low cost LED to produce white light. With that breakthrough, the LED industry started, and the number of applications for LEDs began to expand. The first wave of LED growth occurred between 2003 and 2006 driven by mobile phones, which implemented the use of LED technology for display backlighting. The LED industry experienced its second period of rapid growth as LEDs were adopted for TV display backlighting. Starting in 2009, LED producers, particularly in South Korea and Taiwan, made significant investments in LED process equipment to capture share in these markets. Our metal organic chemical vapor deposition (&#147;MOCVD&#148;) technology is at the core of the manufacturing process for GaN-based LEDs. Over the next couple of years, our sales increased considerably driven in part by Chinese government subsidies for MOCVD equipment. Following this investment wave, there was an oversupply of MOCVD equipment, and our business went into a deep decline. 

&#160; 

The adoption of LEDs for solid state lighting helped drive improvements in industry conditions in 2014. LED technology offered energy and cost savings opportunities in lighting, which played an important role in the global shift toward energy efficiency initiatives. LEDs are up to 80% more efficient than traditional incandescent bulbs and up to 25% more efficient than compact fluorescent bulbs. LED penetration into the lighting market is growing, and for the first time, LED unit demand for general lighting surpassed demand for display backlighting in 2015. While LED industry conditions softened in the second half of 2015, due largely to weak TV and LED display backlighting demand, we expect to benefit from the ongoing adoption of LED lighting over time. 

&#160; 

MOCVD technology is equally important in the manufacturing of red, orange, and yellow (&#147;ROY&#148;) LEDs, which are used in signage and automotive lighting applications. For these LEDs, our K475 MOCVD platform is used to deposit highly uniform Arsenic Phosphide (&#147;AsP&#148;) films which create amber and red hues. While ROY LEDs are predicted to grow at a slower pace than LED units for general lighting, we expect to benefit from growth driven by increased adoption of LED technology for automobiles and outdoor display/signage applications. In addition to depositing the critical GaN layer with our MOCVD products, our Precision Surface Processing (&#147;PSP&#148;) products address multiple etch and clean steps required for the LED manufacturing process. 

&#160; 

Our products are also crucial in the manufacturing of GaN-on-Silicon based power electronic devices. Global demand is increasing for advanced power electronics with greater energy efficiency, smaller footprints, higher operating temperatures, faster switching capabilities, and greater reliability. These devices support many needs, including more efficient IT servers, electrical motors, electric vehicles, wind turbines, and photovoltaic power inverters. 

&#160; 

While silicon-based transistors are widely used in power electronic devices today, GaN-on-Silicon based power electronics developed on MOCVD tools can potentially deliver higher performance (e.g., smaller power supply form factors, higher efficiency, and faster switching speeds). These devices are ideal for applications such as IT servers, where heat generation is an ever-increasing problem as server banks become larger and where heat management and energy efficiency requirements continues to rise. In 2015, global industry leaders in power electronics continued to focus on research and development (&#147;R&#38;D&#148;) programs to commercialize this new technology. Device manufacturers will likely begin to transition from development to production of these devices over the next couple of years; we can benefit from this transition as our customers invest in process equipment to support this production ramp-up. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Advanced Packaging, MEMS &#38; RF 

&#160; 

Advanced Packaging includes a portfolio of wafer-level assembly technologies that enable the miniaturization and performance improvement of electronic products, such as smartphones, smartwatches, tablets, and laptops. Our PSP products have been gaining traction in the rapidly growing area of Advanced Packaging. Demand for higher performance, increased functionality, smaller form factor, and lower power consumption in mobile devices, consumer electronics, and high performance computing is driving the adoption of advanced packaging technology. Independent Device Manufacturers (&#147;IDMs&#148;) and Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test (&#147;OSAT&#148;) companies are implementing multiple advanced packaging approaches including Fan-Out Wafer Level Packaging (&#147;FO-WLP&#148;) and Through Silicon Via (&#147;TSV&#148;) to enable stacked memory, 2.5D, and 3D packaging devices. 

&#160; 

MEMS devices are used for an increasing number of applications, including accelerometers for automobile airbags, pressure sensors for medical uses, and gyroscopes for a variety of consumer products, such as gaming consoles and mobile devices. One of the fastest growing MEMS applications has been RF filters for mobile devices, driven by increasingly complex wireless standards and the exponential growth of mobile data. In order to address these growing demands, a high-end smartphone can have as many as 60 discrete RF filters, a figure that has more than doubled in recent years. These trends are positive for us, particularly for our PSP products as well as our ion beam etch and Molecular Beam Epitaxy (&#147;MBE&#148;) products, which are used to create Bulk Acoustic Wave (&#147;BAW&#148;) and Surface Acoustic Wave (&#147;SAW&#148;) RF filters. 

&#160; 

Data Storage 

&#160; 

The Data Storage market involves the storage of data in electromagnetic or other forms for use by a computer or device, including HDDs used in large capacity storage applications. While HDDs face significant competition from flash memory, we believe that HDDs will continue to provide the best value for mass storage and will remain at the forefront of large capacity storage applications. This is especially true for data center applications where large volumes of data storage are required to serve an increasingly mobile population. The HDD manufacturing industry continues to optimize its existing manufacturing capacity to address demand. While we have seen signs of capacity constraints in some process areas and have experienced incremental orders for our equipment in 2015, future orders are likely to be focused on implementation of new technologies as opposed to capacity expansion. Future demand for our data storage systems is unclear and orders are expected to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Our process knowledge and magnetic materials expertise from the Data Storage market positions us well for certain front-end semiconductor and MEMS opportunities, as thin film magnetic manufacturing methods become increasingly used in these markets. 

&#160; 

Scientific &#38; Industrial 

&#160; 

The Scientific and Industrial markets include advanced materials research and a broad range of manufacturing applications including laser diodes, infrared detectors, optical coatings, and extreme ultraviolet (&#147;EUV&#148;) photomasks. 

&#160; 

Our MBE systems are used by scientific research organizations and universities to drive new discoveries in the areas of materials science. MBE enables precise epitaxial crystal growth for a wide variety of materials, which supports the development of new performance materials used for emerging technologies. MBE technology is also used in the manufacturing of products such as laser diodes and infrared sensors. Our tools create highly uniform Gallium-Arsenide (&#147;GaAs&#148;) or Indium-Phosphide (&#147;InPh&#148;) film layers, which are critical to the performance of these devices. Our PSP products are also used to manufacture infrared sensors. 

&#160; 

Our Ion Beam Deposition (&#147;IBD&#148;) tools are used to produce high quality optical films for multiple applications including laser mirrors, optical filters and anti-reflective coatings. Our tools deposit thin layers of advanced materials on various substrates to alter how light is reflected and transmitted. Our ability to precisely deposit high quality films with extremely low particulate levels make our ion beam deposition technology ideal for manufacturing defect-free EUV photomask blanks. The front-end semiconductor industry is expected to adopt EUV lithography to meet future device requirements. Future growth will depend on overall EUV production readiness. 

&#160;

Precision Surface Processing Systems 

&#160; 

In December 2014, we acquired Solid State Equipment LLC, a leading innovator in single wafer wet etch, clean, and surface preparation equipment targeting high growth segments in advanced packaging, MEMS, LEDs, and compound semiconductor markets, which we renamed PSP. The two core platforms acquired are the WaferEtch&#153; and the WaferStorm&#153;. The WaferEtch platform provides highly uniform, selective etching with onboard end point detection for improved process control and yield. The flagship of the WaferEtch platform, the TSV Revealer&#153;, is specifically configured to address the requirements of TSV reveal, which is the process where the backside of a wafer is thinned to reveal the copper interconnects. The TSV Revealer offers a significant cost of ownership reduction compared with dry etch processing by replacing up to four separate process steps. The WaferStorm platform is based on PSP&#146;s unique soak and spray technology, which provides improved performance at a lower cost of ownership than conventional wet bench-only or spray-only approaches. This highly flexible platform targets solvent based cleaning applications that require a significant level of control. 

&#160; 

Ion Beam Etch and Deposition Systems 

&#160; 

Our NEXUS &#174; IBD systems utilize ion beam technology to deposit precise layers of thin films. IBD systems deposit high purity thin film layers and provide maximum uniformity and repeatability. Our NEXUS Ion Beam Etch (&#147;IBE&#148;) systems utilize a charged particle beam consisting of ions to etch precise, complex features. The NEXUS systems may be included on our cluster system platform to allow either parallel or sequential deposition/etch processes. These systems are used primarily by data storage and telecommunications device manufacturers in the fabrication of discrete and integrated microelectronic devices. 

&#160; 

We also provide a broad array of ion beam sources. These technologies are applicable in the HDD industry as well as for optical coatings and other end markets. Our SPECTOR &#174; systems offer manufacturers improvements in target material utilization, optical endpoint control, and process time for cutting-edge optical interference coating applications. 

&#160;

&#160; 

MBE is the process of precisely depositing epitaxially-aligned atomically-thin crystalline layers, or epilayers, of elemental materials onto a substrate in an ultra-high vacuum environment. We are the leading supplier of MBE systems worldwide. Our MBE systems, sources, and components are used to develop and manufacture critical epitaxial layers in a wide variety of applications such as solar cells, fiber lasers, infrared detectors, mobile phones, radar systems, and displays. For many compound semiconductors, MBE is the critical step of the fabrication process, ultimately determining device functionality and performance. We provide MBE systems and components for the production of wireless devices (e.g., power amplifiers, high electron mobility transistors, or hetero-junction bipolar transistors) and a broad array of research applications for new compound semiconductor materials. In 2013, we introduced the GENxplor&#153; R&#38;D MBE System, the industry&#146;s first fully-integrated MBE system for the compound semiconductor research and development market. The GENxplor MBE system creates high quality epitaxial layers on substrates up to 3&#148; in diameter and is ideal for cutting edge research on a wide variety of materials including gallium arsenide, nitrides, and oxides.
