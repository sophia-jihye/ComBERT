 Item 1. Business 

General 

Ally Financial Inc. is a leading, independent, diversified financial services firm &#32;with $158.6 billion &#32;in assets as of December 31, 2015 . Founded in 1919, we are a leading financial services company with over 95 years of experience providing a broad array of financial products and services, primarily to automotive dealers and their retail customers. We operate as a financial holding company (FHC) and a bank holding company (BHC). &#32; Our banking subsidiary, Ally Bank, is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Ally Financial Inc. and a leading franchise in the growing direct (internet, telephone, mobile, and mail) banking market , with total assets of $111.3 billion &#32;and deposits of $66.2 billion &#32;at December 31, 2015 . The terms &#8220;Ally,&#8221; &#8220;the Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; and &#8220;us&#8221; refer to Ally Financial Inc. and its subsidiaries as a consolidated entity, except where it is clear that the terms mean only Ally Financial Inc. 

Our Business 

Dealer Financial Services, which includes our Automotive Finance and Insurance operations, and Mortgage are our primary lines of business. Our Dealer Financial Services business is centered on our strong and longstanding relationships with automotive dealers and serves the financial needs of over 17,500 dealers in the United States, including nearly 11,000 dealers outside of the General Motors Company (GM) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles US LLC (Chrysler) channels, and approximately 4.5 million of their retail customers with a wide range of financial services and insurance products. We believe our dealer-focused business model, with a focus on premium service and deep relationships, value added products and services, and full credit spectrum expertise proven over many credit cycles, makes us the preferred automotive finance company for thousands of our automotive dealer customers. We have developed particularly strong relationships with thousands of dealers resulting from our longstanding relationship with GM as well as relationships with other manufacturers, including Chrysler, providing us with an extensive understanding of the operating needs of these dealers relative to other automotive finance companies. In addition, we have established relationships with thousands of Growth channel (non-GM/Chrysler) dealers through our customer-centric approach and specialized incentive programs. Our Growth channel primarily focuses on franchised and larger, well capitalized dealers. 

Ally Bank, our direct banking platform, is focused on the continued prudent expansion of assets while growing a stable deposit base and deepening relationships with its 1.1 million &#32;primary customers driven by its compelling brand and strong value proposition. Ally Bank raises deposits directly from customers through direct banking via internet, telephone, mobile, and mail channels. Ally Bank offers a full spectrum of deposit product offerings including savings and money market accounts, certificates of deposit, interest-bearing checking accounts, trust accounts, and individual retirement accounts. We continue to expand the deposit product offerings and accessibility in our banking platform in order to meet customer needs. At December 31, 2015, approximately 70% of Ally's total assets were funded at Ally Bank. &#32; Additionally, during 2015, the deposit base at Ally Bank grew $8.4 billion , an increase of over 14% &#32;from December 31, 2014. Ally Bank's assets and operating results are divided between our Automotive Finance operations, Mortgage operations, and Corporate Finance business based on its underlying business activities. 

Our strategy is to extend our leading position in automotive finance in the United States by continuing to provide automotive dealers and their retail customers with premium service, a comprehensive product suite, consistent funding and competitive pricing, reflecting our commitment to the automotive industry. We are focused on expanding profitable dealer relationships, prudent earning asset growth, and acceptable risk-adjusted returns. Our growth strategy continues to focus on diversifying the franchise by expanding into different products as well as strengthening our network of dealer relationships and on the newer online marketplaces. Over the past several years, we have increased our focus on the Growth channel, which has resulted in increased new standard rate and used vehicle financing volume. We also seek to broaden and deepen the Ally Bank franchise, prudently growing stable, quality deposits while extending our foundation of products and providing a high level of customer service. 

In addition, as we look ahead, we are well positioned as the marketplace continues to evolve and are working to build on our existing foundation of approximately 5.6 million customers, strong brand, innovative culture, and leading digital platform to expand our products and services and to create an integrated customer experience. 

Use of the word "loan" in this document is intended to refer to, as the context suggests, retail installment sales contracts that we have acquired or other financing products. The term "originate" generally refers to our acquisition of retail installment sales contracts, other financing products, or leases as the context suggests. 

For further details and information related to our business segments and the products and services they provide, refer to Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&#38;A) and Note 27 &#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Industry and Competition 

The markets for automotive and mortgage financing, insurance, and banking are highly competitive. We directly compete in the automotive financing market with banks, credit unions, captive automotive finance, direct to consumer, and independent finance companies. Our insurance business also faces significant competition from automotive manufacturers, captive automotive finance companies, insurance carriers, third-party administrators, brokers, and other insurance-related companies. Some of these competitors have certain exclusivity privileges with automotive manufacturing companies whose customers and dealers compose a significant portion of our customer base. In addition, Ally Bank faces significant competition from commercial banks, savings institutions, and other financial institutions. Many of our competitors have substantial positions nationally or in the markets in which they operate. Some of our competitors have lower cost structures, 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-K 

lower costs of capital, and are less reliant on securitization activities, unsecured debt, and other public markets. We face significant competition in most areas, including product offerings, rates, pricing and fees, and customer service. 

Certain Regulatory Matters 

We are subject to various regulatory, financial, and other requirements of the jurisdictions in which our businesses operate. Regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry. The following is a description of some of the laws and regulations that currently affect our business. 

Bank Holding Company and Financial Holding Company Status 

Ally and IB Finance Holding Company, LLC (IB Finance) are currently both BHCs under the BHC Act. IB Finance is the direct holding company for Ally's FDIC-insured depository institution, Ally Bank. As a BHC, Ally is subject to supervision, examination and regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB). Ally must also comply with regulatory risk-based and leverage capital requirements, as well as various safety and soundness standards imposed by the FRB, and is subject to certain statutory restrictions concerning the types of assets or securities it may own and the activities in which it may engage. Ally Bank, our banking subsidiary, is currently not a member of the Federal Reserve System and is subject to supervision, examination and regulation by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions (Utah DFI). This regulatory oversight focuses on the protection of depositors, the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund, and the banking system as a whole, not security holders, and in some instances may be contrary to their interests. An application has been filed for Ally Bank to become a Federal Reserve member. 

&#8226; 

Permitted Activities &#8212; The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (GLB Act) amended the BHC Act by providing a new regulatory framework applicable to &#8220;financial holding companies,&#8221; which are bank holding companies that meet certain qualifications and elect FHC status. FHCs are generally permitted to engage in a broader range of financial and related activities than those that are permissible for BHCs, in particular, securities, insurance, and merchant banking activities. The FRB supervises, examines, and regulates FHCs, as it does all BHCs. However, insurance and securities activities conducted by a FHC or its nonbank subsidiaries are also regulated by functional regulators. Our election to become a FHC under the BHC Act was approved by the FRB and became effective on December 20, 2013. Ally's status as a FHC allows us to continue all existing insurance activities, as well as our SmartAuction vehicle remarketing services for third parties. To maintain its status as a FHC, Ally and its bank subsidiary, Ally Bank, must remain &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; and &#8220;well-managed,&#8221; as defined under applicable law. Refer to Note 21 &#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. See also &#8220;Basel Capital Frameworks&#8221; below. Under the BHC Act, Ally generally may not, directly or indirectly, acquire more than 5% of any class of voting shares of any nonaffiliated bank or BHC without first obtaining FRB approval. 

&#8226; 

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act &#160;&#8212; On July 21, 2010, the President of the United States signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act). The Dodd-Frank Act represents a significant overhaul of many aspects of the regulation of the financial services industry, addressing, among other things, systemic risk, capital adequacy, deposit insurance assessments, consumer financial protection, derivatives, restrictions on an insured bank&#8217;s transactions with its affiliates, lending limits, and mortgage-lending practices. A number of provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act have entered into effect while others will become effective at a later date after a rulemaking process is completed. While U.S. regulators have finalized many regulations to implement various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, they plan to propose or finalize additional implementing regulations in the future. 

The Dodd-Frank Act has had, and will have as its provisions are further implemented, material implications for Ally and the entire financial services industry. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations: 

&#8226; 

subject Ally to enhanced prudential standards, oversight, and scrutiny as a result of being a BHC with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets (a large BHC); 

&#8226; 

have increased the levels of capital and liquidity with which Ally must operate and affect how it plans capital and liquidity levels; 

&#8226; 

subject Ally to new and/or higher fees paid to various regulatory entities, including but not limited to deposit insurance fees paid by Ally Bank to the FDIC; 

&#8226; 

require Ally to provide to the FRB and FDIC an annual plan for its rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress; 

&#8226; 

subject Ally to regulation and examination by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which has very broad rule-making, examination, and enforcement authorities; and 

&#8226; 

subject derivatives that Ally enters into for hedging, risk management and other purposes to a comprehensive new regulatory regime which, when fully implemented, will require central clearing and execution on designated markets or execution facilities for certain standardized derivatives and impose margin, documentation, trade reporting, and other new requirements. 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-K 

These and other requirements may, either currently or in the future, impact Ally&#8217;s business and risk management strategies and/or restrict the revenue that Ally generates from certain businesses. 

&#8226; 

Enhanced Prudential Standards &#8212; In February 2014, the FRB issued a final rule to implement certain enhanced prudential standards under the Dodd-Frank Act for large bank holding companies such as Ally. The final rule generally became effective on January 1, 2015. Among other things, the final rule requires Ally to maintain a buffer of unencumbered highly liquid assets to meet projected net cash outflows for 30 days over the range of liquidity stress scenarios used in internal stress tests and to comply with a number of risk management and governance requirements, including liquidity risk management standards. The Federal Reserve has stated that it will issue, at a later date, final rules to implement certain other enhanced prudential standards under the Dodd-Frank Act for large bank holding companies, including single counterparty credit limits and an early remediation framework. 

&#8226; 

Liquidity Coverage Ratio Requirements &#8212; To complement the above-mentioned internal liquidity stress testing and liquidity buffer requirements, the FRB and other U.S. banking regulators issued a final rule in September 2014 to implement the Basel III liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) requirements for large bank holding companies. The LCR was developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) to ensure banking organizations maintain an amount of high-quality liquid assets that is no less than 100 percent of their total net cash outflows arising from significant stress over a prospective 30 calendar-day period. The U.S. LCR rule is more stringent in certain respects compared to the Basel Committee&#8217;s version of the LCR, and includes a generally narrower definition of debt and equity securities that qualify as high-quality liquid assets and a two-year phase-in period that began on January 1, 2015, and ends on January 1, 2017. A simpler, less stringent U.S. LCR requirement (Modified LCR) applies to depository institution holding companies with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets that are not covered by the LCR. The Modified LCR requires depository institution holding companies to calculate their Modified LCR on a monthly basis beginning January 1, 2016, subject to a transition period (phased-in implementation with a minimum ratio of 90% in 2016 and 100% in 2017 and beyond). Because Ally&#8217;s total assets are less than $250 billion but greater than $50 billion, and because it has immaterial foreign exposure, Ally is subject to the requirements of the Modified LCR. 

&#8226; 

Capital Adequacy Requirements &#8212; Ally and Ally Bank are subject to various capital adequacy requirements as established under FRB and FDIC regulations. Refer to Note 21 &#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. See also &#8220;Basel Capital Frameworks&#8221; below. 

&#8226; 

Capital Planning and Stress Tests &#8212; Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the FRB has adopted capital planning and stress test requirements for large bank holding companies, including Ally, which form part of the FRB's Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) process. Under the FRB's capital plan rule, Ally must submit an annual capital plan to the FRB, taking into account the results of stress tests conducted by Ally based on scenarios prescribed by the FRB. The capital plan must include a description of all planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon, including any issuance of a debt or equity capital instrument, any capital distribution, and any similar action that the FRB determines could have an impact on Ally's consolidated capital. The capital plan must also include a discussion of how Ally will maintain capital above the U.S. Basel III minimum regulatory capital ratios for each period over the nine-quarter planning horizon, and serve as a source of strength to Ally Bank. The FRB will either object to Ally's capital plan, in whole or in part, or provide a notice of non-objection. If the FRB objects to the capital plan, or if certain material events occur after approval of the plan, Ally must submit a revised capital plan within 30 days. In addition, even with an approved capital plan, Ally must seek the approval of the FRB before making a capital distribution if, among other factors, Ally would not meet its regulatory capital requirements after making the proposed capital distribution. 

Ally received a non-objection to its 2014 and 2015 capital plans. Under a new rule effective for the 2016 capital planning cycle and subsequent cycles, Ally expects to submit its 2016 capital plan by April 5, 2016, with a response expected from the FRB by June 30, 2016. 

The FRB final stress test rule requires Ally to conduct semi-annual (annual and mid-cycle) company-run stress tests under baseline, adverse, and severely adverse economic scenarios over a planning horizon that spans nine quarters. The rule also subjects Ally to an annual supervisory stress test conducted by the FRB. For the 2015 stress testing cycle, Ally submitted the results of its semi-annual stress test to the FRB in January and July 2015. Under a new rule effective for the 2016 and subsequent cycles, Ally expects to submit its 2016 company-run stress tests by April 5, 2016 and October 5, 2016. In addition, an FDIC final rule requires Ally Bank to conduct an annual company-run stress test under baseline, adverse, and severely adverse economic scenarios over a planning horizon that spans nine quarters. Ally Bank expects to submit its 2016 company-run stress test by April 5, 2016. 

&#32;In addition, the FRB publishes summary results of the supervisory stress tests of each large BHC, including Ally, conducted by the FRB pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act. The supervisory stress tests are intended to provide supervisors with forward-looking information to help identify downside risk and the potential effect of adverse conditions on capital adequacy. 

&#8226; 

Limitations on Bank and Bank Holding Company Dividends and Capital Distributions &#8212; Utah law (and, in certain instances, federal law) places restrictions and limitations on dividends or other distributions payable by our banking subsidiary, Ally Bank, to Ally. Under the FRB&#8217;s capital plan rule, an objection to a large BHC's capital plan generally prohibits it from paying dividends or making certain other capital distributions without specific FRB non-objection to such action. Even if a large BHC receives a non-objection to its capital plan, it may not pay a dividend or make certain other capital distributions without FRB approval under certain circumstances (e.g., where the BHC would not meet certain minimum regulatory capital ratios after giving effect to the 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-K 

dividend or distribution). In addition, FRB supervisory guidance requires BHCs such as Ally to consult with the FRB prior to increasing dividends, implementing common stock repurchase programs or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments. The U.S. banking regulators are also authorized to prohibit a banking subsidiary or BHC from engaging in unsafe or unsound banking practices and, depending upon the circumstances, could find that paying a dividend or making a capital distribution would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice. 

&#8226; 

Transactions with Affiliates &#8212; Certain transactions between Ally Bank and any of its nonbank &#8220;affiliates,&#8221; including but not limited to Ally, are subject to federal statutory and regulatory restrictions. Pursuant to these restrictions, unless otherwise exempted, &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; including Ally Bank's extensions of credit to and asset purchases from its nonbank affiliates, generally (1) are limited to 10% of Ally Bank's capital stock and surplus with respect to transactions with any individual affiliate, with an aggregate limit of 20% of Ally Bank's capital stock and surplus for all affiliates and all such transactions; (2) in the case of certain credit transactions, are subject to stringent collateralization requirements; (3) in the case of asset purchases by Ally Bank, may not involve the purchase of any asset deemed to be a &#8220;low quality asset&#8221; under federal banking guidelines; and (4) must be conducted in accordance with safe-and-sound banking practices (collectively, the Affiliate Transaction Restrictions). In addition, transactions between Ally Bank and a nonbank affiliate generally must be on market terms and conditions. 

Furthermore, there is an &#8220;attribution rule&#8221; that provides that a transaction between Ally Bank and a third party must be treated as a transaction between Ally Bank and a nonbank affiliate to the extent that the proceeds of the transaction are used for the benefit of or transferred to a nonbank affiliate of Ally Bank. For example, because Ally controls Ally Bank, Ally is an affiliate of Ally Bank for purposes of the Affiliate Transaction Restrictions. Thus, retail financing transactions by Ally Bank involving vehicles for which Ally provided floorplan financing are subject to the Affiliate Transaction Restrictions because the proceeds of the retail financings are deemed to benefit, and are ultimately transferred to, Ally. 

Under the Dodd-Frank Act, among other changes to the Affiliate Transaction Restrictions, credit exposures arising from derivatives transactions, securities lending and borrowing transactions, and acceptance of affiliate-issued debt obligations (other than securities) as collateral for a loan or extension of credit will be treated as "covered transactions." The Dodd-Frank Act also expands the scope of covered transactions required to be collateralized, requires that collateral be maintained at all times for covered transactions required to be collateralized, and places limits on acceptable collateral. 

Historically, the FRB was authorized to exempt, at its discretion, transactions or relationships from the requirements of these rules if it found such exemptions to be in the public interest and consistent with the purposes of the rules. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, exemptions now may be granted by the FDIC if the FDIC and FRB jointly find that the exemption is in the public interest and consistent with the purposes of the rules, and the FDIC finds that the exemption does not present an unacceptable risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund. The FRB granted several such exemptions to Ally Bank in the past. However, the existing exemptions are subject to various conditions and, particularly in light of the statutory changes made by the Dodd-Frank Act, any requests for future exemptions might not be granted. Moreover, these limited exemptions generally do not encompass consumer leasing or used vehicle financing. Since there is no assurance that Ally Bank will be able to obtain future exemptions or waivers with respect to these restrictions, the ability to grow Ally Bank's business will be affected by the Affiliate Transaction Restrictions and the conditions set forth in the existing exemption letters. 

&#8226; 

Source of Strength &#8212; Pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, FRB policy and regulations, and the Parent Company Agreement and the Capital and Liquidity Maintenance Agreement described in Note 21 &#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Ally is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to Ally Bank and is required to commit necessary capital and liquidity to support Ally Bank. This support may be required at inopportune times for Ally. 

&#8226; 

Single Point of Entry Resolution Authority &#8212; Under the Dodd-Frank Act, certain financial institutions, including BHCs such as Ally, are eligible to be subjected to a new FDIC-administered resolution regime called orderly liquidation authority, an alternative to bankruptcy. The FDIC&#8217;s orderly liquidation authority became effective in July 2010, with implementing regulations adopted thereafter in stages, with some rulemakings still to come. If Ally were to become insolvent and be placed into receivership under the orderly liquidation authority, the FDIC would be appointed as receiver, giving the FDIC considerable rights and powers that it must exercise with the goal of liquidating and winding up Ally, including the ability to assign assets and liabilities without the need for creditor consent or prior court review and the ability of the FDIC to differentiate and determine priority among creditors. In December 2013, the FDIC released its proposed Single Point of Entry strategy for resolution of a systemically important financial institution under the orderly liquidation authority. The FDIC&#8217;s release outlines how it would use its powers under the orderly liquidation authority to resolve a systemically important financial institution by placing its top-tier U.S. holding company in receivership and keeping its operating subsidiaries open and out of insolvency proceedings by transferring the operating subsidiaries to a new bridge holding company, recapitalizing the operating subsidiaries, and imposing losses on the shareholders and creditors of the holding company in receivership according to their statutory order of priority. 

&#8226; 

Enforcement Authority &#8212; The FDIC and FRB have broad authority to issue orders to banks and bank holding companies to cease and desist from unsafe or unsound banking practices and from violations of laws, rules, regulations, or conditions imposed in writing by the banking agencies. The FDIC and FRB also are empowered to require affirmative actions to correct any violation or practice; issue administrative orders that can be judicially enforced; direct increases in capital; limit dividends and distributions; restrict growth; assess civil money penalties against institutions or individuals who violate any laws, regulations, orders, or written 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-K 

agreements with the banking agencies; order termination of certain activities of BHCs or their subsidiaries; remove officers and directors; order divestiture of ownership or control of a nonbanking subsidiary by a BHC (in the case of the FRB); terminate deposit insurance (in the case of the FDIC); and/or place a bank into receivership (in the case of the FDIC). 

Basel Capital Frameworks 

Until January 1, 2015, the U.S. risk-based and leverage capital standards applicable to Ally and Ally Bank were based on the Basel Committee's Basel I capital accord (Basel I). 

In December 2010, the Basel Committee reached an agreement on the Basel III capital framework, which was designed to increase the quality and quantity of regulatory capital by introducing new risk-based and leverage capital standards. In July 2013, the U.S. banking regulators finalized rules implementing the Basel III capital framework and related Dodd-Frank Act provisions (U.S. Basel III). U.S. Basel III represents a substantial revision to the regulatory capital standards for U.S. banking organizations. Ally became subject to U.S. Basel III on January 1, 2015. Certain aspects of the U.S. Basel III final rules, including the new capital buffers and regulatory capital deductions, will be phased in over several years. 

U.S. Basel III subjects Ally to a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%, a minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%, and a minimum Total risk-based capital ratio of 8%. In addition to these minimum requirements, Ally will also be subject to a Common Equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of more than 2.5%, subject to a phase-in from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2018. Failure to maintain the full amount of the buffer will result in restrictions on Ally&#8217;s ability to make capital distributions, including dividend payments and stock repurchases and redemptions, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers. In addition to these new risk-based capital standards, U.S. Basel III subjects all U.S. banking organizations, including Ally, to a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%, the denominator of which takes into account only on-balance sheet assets. 

In addition to introducing new capital ratios, U.S. Basel III revises the eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments and provides for the phase-out of instruments that had previously been recognized as capital but that do not satisfy the new criteria. Subject to certain exceptions (e.g., for certain debt or equity issued to the U.S. government under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act), trust preferred and other &#8220;hybrid&#8221; securities are no longer included in a BHC&#8217;s Tier 1 capital as of January 1, 2016. Also, subject to a phase-in schedule, certain new items will be deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 capital, and certain other deductions from regulatory capital will be modified. Among other things, U.S. Basel III requires certain deferred tax assets (DTAs) that exceed specified individual and aggregate thresholds to be deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 capital. U.S. Basel III also revises the U.S. Basel I-based standardized approach for calculating risk-weighted assets by, among other things, modifying certain risk weights and introducing new methods for calculating risk-weighted assets for certain types of assets and exposures. Ally is subject to the U.S. Basel III standardized approach for counterparty credit risk. It is not subject to the U.S. Basel III advanced approaches for counterparty credit risk. 

Ally is currently not subject to the U.S. market risk capital rule, which applies only to banking organizations with significant trading assets and liabilities. 

At December 31, 2015, Ally was in compliance with its regulatory capital requirements. For an additional discussion of capital adequacy requirements, refer to Note 21 &#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Depository Institutions 

Ally Bank's deposits are insured by the FDIC, under applicable rules, and Ally Bank is required to file periodic reports with the FDIC concerning its financial condition. Total assets of Ally Bank were $111.3 billion &#32;and $104.4 billion &#32;at December 31, 2015 , and 2014 , respectively. As a commercial nonmember bank chartered by the State of Utah, Ally Bank is subject to various regulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by state and federal banking agencies. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA), among other things, identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions ("well-capitalized," "adequately capitalized," "undercapitalized," "significantly undercapitalized," and "critically undercapitalized") and requires the respective federal regulatory agencies to implement systems for "prompt corrective action" for insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements within such categories. Depending on the category in which an institution is classified, FDICIA imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management, and capital distributions. 

Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on Ally Bank's results of operations and financial condition. FDICIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution, including payment of a cash dividend or paying any management fee to its holding company, if the depository institution would become under-capitalized after such payment. Under-capitalized institutions are also subject to growth limitations and are required by the appropriate federal banking agency to submit a capital restoration plan. If any depository institution subsidiary of a holding company is required to submit a capital restoration plan, the holding company would be required to provide a limited guarantee regarding compliance with the plan as a condition of approval of such plan. Failure to meet the capital guidelines could also subject a banking institution to capital raising requirements. 

At December 31, 2015 , Ally Bank was in compliance with its regulatory capital requirements. For an additional discussion of capital adequacy requirements, refer to Note 21 &#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-K 

Consumer Financial Laws 

The CFPB has issued various rules to implement consumer financial protection provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and related requirements. Many of these rules impose new requirements on Ally and its business operations. In addition, as an insured depository institution with total assets of more than $10 billion, Ally Bank is subject to the examination and enforcement authority of the CFPB with respect to its compliance with federal consumer financial protection laws and regulations. 

&#8226; 

Mortgage Operations &#8212; Our mortgage business is subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws, rules, and regulations, in addition to judicial and administrative decisions that impose requirements and restrictions on this business. The mortgage business is also subject to examination by the Federal Housing Commissioner to assure compliance with Federal Housing Administration regulations, policies, and procedures. The federal, state, and local laws, rules, and regulations to which our mortgage business is subject, among other things, impose licensing obligations and financial requirements; limit the interest rates, finance charges, and other fees that can be charged; regulate the use of credit reports and the reporting of credit information; impose underwriting requirements; regulate marketing techniques and practices; require the safeguarding of nonpublic information about customers; and regulate servicing practices, including the assessment, collection, foreclosure, claims handling, and investment and interest payments on escrow accounts. 

The future of the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), and the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae) (collectively, the Government-sponsored Enterprises, or GSEs) and the role of government agencies in the U.S. mortgage markets remain uncertain. The Executive Branch has committed to work with the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to develop a plan to responsibly reduce the role of the GSEs in the mortgage market and, ultimately, wind down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In addition, proposals have been introduced in both houses of Congress to reform the role of the GSEs in the U.S. housing sector and move toward a private sector model. 

&#8226; 

Automotive Lending Business &#8212; The CFPB has focused on the area of automotive finance, particularly with respect to indirect financing arrangements and fair lending compliance. In March 2013, the CFPB provided guidance about compliance with the fair lending requirements of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and its implementing regulations for indirect automotive finance companies that permit dealers to charge annual percentage rates to consumers in excess of buy rates used by the finance company to calculate the price paid to acquire an assignment of the retail installment sale contract. In December 2013, Ally Financial Inc. and Ally Bank entered into Consent Orders issued by the CFPB and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) pertaining to the allegation of disparate impact in the automotive finance business. For further information, refer to Note 30 &#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Asset-backed Securitizations 

Section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act requires securitizers of different types of asset-backed securitizations, including transactions backed by residential mortgages, commercial mortgages, and commercial, credit card, and automotive loans, to retain no less than 5% of the credit risk of the assets being securitized, with an exemption for securitizations that are wholly composed of &#8220;qualified residential mortgages&#8221; (QRMs). Federal regulators issued final rules implementing this Dodd-Frank Act requirement in October 2014. The final rules aligned the definition of QRMs with the CFPB&#8217;s definition of &#8220;Qualified Mortgage&#8221; and also included an exemption for the GSEs&#8217; mortgage-backed securities (MBS). The regulations took effect on February 23, 2015. Compliance was required with respect to new securitization transactions backed by residential mortgages beginning December 24, 2015, and will be required with respect to new securitization transactions backed by other types of assets beginning December 24, 2016. Ally continues to evaluate the final rules and assess their impact on our securitization activities. 

Insurance Companies 

Certain of our Insurance operations are subject to certain minimum aggregate capital requirements, net asset and dividend restrictions under applicable state and foreign insurance laws, and the rules and regulations promulgated by various U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies. Under various state and foreign insurance regulations, dividend distributions may be made only from statutory unassigned surplus with approvals required from the regulatory authorities for dividends in excess of certain statutory limitations. Our insurance operations are also subject to applicable state laws generally governing insurance companies, as well as laws and regulations for products that are not regulated as insurance, such as vehicle service contracts and guaranteed asset protection waivers. 

Investments in Ally 

Because Ally Bank is a FDIC-insured bank and Ally and IB Finance are BHCs, acquisitions of our voting stock above certain thresholds may be subject to regulatory approval or notice under federal or state law. Investors are responsible for ensuring that they do not, directly or indirectly, acquire shares of our stock in excess of the amount that may be acquired without regulatory approval under the Change in Bank Control Act, the BHC Act, and Utah state law. 

Further, refer to the Tax Assets Protective Measures section of MD&#38;A for details of certain actions taken by us during January 2014, which are intended to prevent persons from acquiring Ally common stock that exceeds certain ownership thresholds. These measures are intended to protect certain tax benefits that may be significantly limited under an "ownership change" as defined under the applicable tax regulations.

Other Regulations 

Some of the other more significant regulations that we are subject to include: 

&#8226; 

Privacy &#160;&#8212; The GLB Act imposes additional obligations on us to safeguard the information we maintain on our customers, requires us to provide notice of our privacy practices, and permits customers to &#8220;opt-out&#8221; of information sharing with unaffiliated parties. The U.S. banking regulators and the Federal Trade Commission have issued regulations that establish obligations to safeguard information. In addition, several states have enacted even more stringent privacy and safeguarding legislation. If a variety of inconsistent state privacy rules or requirements are enacted, our compliance costs could increase substantially. 

&#8226; 

Volcker Rule &#160;&#8212; On December 10, 2013, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, FDIC, Federal Reserve Board, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the SEC issued final rules to implement the Volcker Rule required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The Volcker Rule prohibits an insured depository institution and its affiliates from (1) engaging in &#8220;proprietary trading&#8221; and (2) investing in or sponsoring certain types of funds (covered funds) subject to certain limited exceptions. The final rules contain exemptions for market-making, hedging, underwriting, trading in U.S. government and agency obligations and also permit certain ownership interests in certain types of funds to be retained. They also permit the offering and sponsoring of funds under certain conditions. The final rules extend the conformance period to July 21, 2015, and in December of 2014 the Federal Reserve Board issued an order to extend the relevant conformance date for certain covered funds activities to July 21, 2016. The final Volcker Rule regulations impose significant compliance and reporting obligations on banking entities. The impact of the Volcker Rule will not be material to Ally&#8217;s business operations. 

&#8226; 

Fair Credit Reporting Act &#160;&#8212; The Fair Credit Reporting Act regulates the use of credit reports and the reporting of information to credit reporting agencies, and also provides a national legal standard for lenders to share information with affiliates and certain third parties and to provide firm offers of credit to consumers. In late 2003, the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act was enacted, making this preemption of conflicting state and local law permanent. The Fair Credit Reporting Act was also amended to place further restrictions on the use of information shared between affiliates, to provide new disclosures to consumers when risk-based pricing is used in the credit decision, and to help protect consumers from identity theft. All of these provisions impose additional regulatory and compliance costs on us and reduce the effectiveness of our marketing programs. 

&#8226; 

Truth in Lending Act &#160;&#8212; The Truth in Lending Act (TILA), as amended, and Regulation Z, which implements TILA, requires lenders to provide borrowers with uniform, understandable information concerning terms and conditions in certain credit transactions. These rules apply to Ally and its subsidiaries in transactions in which they extend credit to consumers and require, in the case of certain mortgage and automotive financing transactions, conspicuous disclosure of the finance charge and annual percentage rate, if any. In addition, if an advertisement for credit states specific credit terms, Regulation Z requires that such advertisement state only those terms that actually are or will be arranged or offered by the creditor. The CFPB has recently issued substantial amendments to the mortgage requirements under Regulation Z, and additional changes are likely in the future. Amendments to Regulation Z and Regulation X, which implements the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, require new integrated mortgage loan disclosures to be provided for applications received on or after October 3, 2015. Failure to comply with TILA can result in liability for damages as well as criminal and civil penalties. 

&#8226; 

Sarbanes-Oxley Act &#160;&#8212; The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 implemented a broad range of corporate governance and accounting measures designed to promote honesty and transparency in corporate America. The principal provisions of the act include, among other things, (1) the creation of an independent accounting oversight board; (2) auditor independence provisions that restrict non-audit services that accountants may provide to their audit clients; (3) additional corporate governance and responsibility measures including the requirement that the principal executive and financial officers certify financial statements; (4) the potential forfeiture of bonuses or other incentive-based compensation and profits from the sale of an issuer's securities by directors and senior officers in the twelve-month period following initial publication of any financial statements that later require restatement; (5) an increase in the oversight of and enhancement of certain requirements relating to audit committees and how they interact with the independent auditors; (6) requirements that audit committee members must be independent and are barred from accepting consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fees from the issuer; (7) requirements that companies disclose whether at least one member of the audit committee is a &#8220;financial expert&#8221; (as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)) and, if not, why the audit committee does not have a financial expert; (8) a prohibition on personal loans to directors and officers, except certain loans made by insured financial institutions, on nonpreferential terms and in compliance with other bank regulatory requirements; (9) disclosure of a code of ethics; (10) requirements that management assess the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and that the Independent Registered Public Accounting firm attest to the assessment; and (11) a range of enhanced penalties for fraud and other violations. 

&#8226; 

USA PATRIOT Act/Anti-Money-Laundering Requirements &#160; &#8212; In 2001, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act (USA PATRIOT Act) was signed into law. Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act amends the Bank Secrecy Act and contains provisions designed to detect and prevent the use of the U.S. financial system for money laundering and terrorist financing activities. The Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act, requires BHCs, banks, and certain other financial companies to undertake activities including maintaining an anti-money-laundering program, verifying the identity of clients, monitoring for and reporting on suspicious transactions, reporting on cash transactions exceeding specified thresholds, and responding to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law

enforcement agencies. We have implemented internal practices, procedures, and controls designed to comply with these anti-money-laundering requirements. 

&#8226; 

Community Reinvestment Act &#8212; Under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), a bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with the safe-and-sound operation of the institution, to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income persons and neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions. However, institutions are rated on their performance in meeting the needs of their communities. Failure by Ally Bank to maintain a "satisfactory" or better rating under the CRA may adversely affect Ally's ability to make acquisitions and engage in new activities, and in the event of such a rating, the FRB must prohibit the FHC and its subsidiaries from engaging in any additional activities other than those permissible for bank holding companies that are not FHCs. 

Employees 

We had approximately 7,100 and 6,900 employees at December 31, 2015 , and 2014 , respectively.
