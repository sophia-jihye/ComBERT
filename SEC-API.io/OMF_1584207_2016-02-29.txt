 Item 1. Business. 

BUSINESS OVERVIEW 

OneMain Holdings, Inc. (formerly Springleaf Holdings, Inc.) is referred to in this report as &#8220;OMH&#8221; or, collectively with its subsidiaries, whether directly or indirectly owned, &#8220;the Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221;. 

As one of the nation&#8217;s largest consumer finance companies, we: 

&#8226; 

provide responsible personal loan products; 

&#8226; 

offer credit and non-credit insurance; 

&#8226; 

pursue strategic acquisitions of loan portfolios; and 

&#8226; 

pursue acquisitions of companies and/or establish joint ventures. 

As part of our acquisition strategy, on November 15, 2015, OMH, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Independence Holdings, LLC, (&#8220;Independence&#8221;) completed its acquisition of OneMain Financial Holdings, LLC (&#8220;OMFH&#8221;) from CitiFinancial Credit Company (&#8220;Citigroup&#8221;) for $4.5 billion in cash (the &#8220;OneMain Acquisition&#8221;). OMFH, collectively with its subsidiaries, is referred to in this report as &#8220;OneMain&#8221;. OMH and its subsidiaries (other than OneMain) is referred to in this report as &#8220;Springleaf&#8221;. 

The OneMain Acquisition brings together two branch-based consumer finance companies with complementary strategies and locations. OneMain provides personal loans to primarily middle&#8209;income households through a national, community&#8209;based network of 1,139 branches as of December 31, 2015, serving nearly 1.3 million &#32;customer accounts across 43 &#32;states. Springleaf provides high quality origination, underwriting and servicing of personal loans, primarily to non-prime consumers. Together, with an experienced management team, proven access to the capital markets, and strong demand for consumer credit, we believe we are well positioned for future growth. At December 31, 2015 , we had $13.9 billion &#32;of combined personal loans due from over 2.3 million &#32;customer accounts (including personal loans held for sale of $617 million ). 

Our combined network of over 1,900 &#32;branches as of December 31, 2015 and expert personnel is complemented by our online consumer loan origination business and centralized operations, which allows us to reach customers located outside our branch footprint. In September 2015, we launched a new online consumer loan origination business (&#8220;iLoan&#8221;) to provide our current and prospective customers the option of obtaining an unsecured personal loan via a digital platform. We also pursue strategic acquisitions of loan portfolios through our Springleaf Acquisitions division, which we service through our centralized operations. We service the loans acquired through a joint venture in which we own a 47% equity interest (the &#8220;SpringCastle Portfolio&#8221;). In addition, we pursue fee-based opportunities in servicing loans for others in connection with potential strategic portfolio acquisitions through our centralized operations. See &#8220;Centralized Operations&#8221; for further information on our centralized servicing centers. 

In connection with our personal loan business, Springleaf and OneMain insurance subsidiaries offer our customers credit and non-credit insurance policies covering our customers and the property pledged as collateral for our personal loans. 

At December 31, 2015 , Springleaf Financial Holdings, LLC (the &#8220;Initial Stockholder&#8221;) owned approximately 58% &#32;of OMH&#8217;s common stock. The Initial Stockholder is owned primarily by a private equity fund managed by an affiliate of Fortress Investment Group LLC (&#8220;Fortress&#8221;). 

The following chart summarizes our organization structure as a result of the OneMain Acquisition. The chart is provided for illustrative purposes only and does not represent all of OMH&#8217;s subsidiaries or obligations. 

INDUSTRY AND MARKET OVERVIEW 

We operate in the consumer finance industry serving the large and growing population of consumers who have limited access to credit from banks, credit card companies and other lenders. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as of December 31, 2015 , the U.S. consumer finance industry had grown to approximately $3.4 trillion &#32;of outstanding borrowings in the form of personal loans, vehicle loans and leases, credit cards, home equity lines of credit, and student loans. Furthermore, difficult economic conditions in recent years have resulted in an increase in the number of non-prime consumers in the United States. 

This industry&#8217;s traditional lenders have undergone fundamental changes, forcing many to retrench and in some cases to exit the market altogether. Tightened credit requirements imposed by banks, credit card companies, and other traditional lenders that began during the recession of 2008-2009 have further reduced the supply of consumer credit for non-prime borrowers. In addition, we believe that recent regulatory developments create a dis-incentive for these lenders to resume or support these lending activities. As a result, while the number of non-prime consumers in the United States has grown in recent years, the supply of consumer credit to this demographic has contracted. We believe this large and growing number of potential customers in our target market, combined with the decline in available consumer credit, provides an attractive market opportunity for our business model. 

We are one of the few remaining national participants in the consumer installment lending industry still serving this large and growing population of non-prime customers. Our centralized operations, combined with the capabilities resident in our national branch system, provide an effective nationwide platform to efficiently and responsibly address this growing market of consumers. We believe we are, therefore, well-positioned to capitalize on the significant growth and expansion opportunity created by the large supply-demand imbalance within our industry. 

SEGMENTS 

Our segments coincide with how our businesses are managed. At December 31, 2015 , our three &#32;segments include: 

&#8226; 

Consumer and Insurance; 

&#8226; 

Acquisitions and Servicing; and 

&#8226; 

Real Estate. 

Following the OneMain Acquisition, we include OneMain&#8217;s operations within the Consumer and Insurance segment. 

Management considers Consumer and Insurance, and Acquisitions and Servicing as our &#8220;Core Consumer Operations&#8221; and Real Estate as our &#8220;Non-Core Portfolio.&#8221; See Note 23 &#32;of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for more information about our segments. 

CORE CONSUMER OPERATIONS 

Consumer and Insurance 

We originate and service secured and unsecured personal loans and offer voluntary credit insurance and related products through our combined branch network, our newly launched iLoan platform, and our centralized operations. Personal loan origination and servicing, along with our insurance products, forms the core of our operations. As a result of the OneMain Acquisition, our combined branch operations include over 1,900 &#32;branch offices in 43 &#32;states as of December 31, 2015. In addition, our centralized support operations provide underwriting and servicing support to branch operations. 

Our insurance business is conducted through Springleaf insurance subsidiaries, Merit Life Insurance Co. (&#8220;Merit&#8221;) and Yosemite Insurance Company (&#8220;Yosemite&#8221;), which are both wholly owned subsidiaries of SFC, and OneMain&#8217;s insurance subsidiaries, American Health and Life Insurance Company (&#8220;AHL&#8221;) and Triton Insurance Company (&#8220;Triton&#8221;). Merit and AHL are life and health insurance companies that write credit life, credit disability, and non-credit insurance. Merit is licensed in 46 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and AHL is licensed in 49 states, the District of Columbia, and Canada. Yosemite and Triton are property and casualty insurance companies that write credit-related property and casualty and credit involuntary unemployment insurance. Yosemite is licensed in 46 states, and Triton is licensed in 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Canada. 

Products and Services. &#32;Our combined personal loan portfolio comprises high yielding assets that have performed well through difficult market conditions. Our personal loans are typically fully amortizing, fixed rate, non-revolving loans secured by titled personal property (such as automobiles), consumer goods, or other personal property or unsecured. 

Since mid-2014, our direct auto loan program has further expanded our core product offerings to better serve our customers&#8217; needs. The auto loan product offers a customized solution for our current and prospective customers to finance the purchase of a vehicle, pay off an existing auto loan with another lender, or use the equity in their vehicle to consolidate debt, make home improvements or receive cash. We offer the auto loan product through our branch network and our centralized operations. 

The typical size of the auto loan product is $6,000 - $25,000, with a typical maximum term of five years. The auto loan product is secured by the customer&#8217;s automobile in all cases, compared to our personal loans, of which 21% &#32;were secured by titled personal property (primarily automobiles) at December 31, 2015 . We report the auto loan product in our core personal loans, which are included in our Core Consumer Operations. At December 31, 2015 , we had over $1.0 billion &#32;of auto loans. 

We write the following types of credit insurance policies covering our customers and the property pledged as collateral through products that we offer to our customers: 

&#8226; 

Credit life insurance &#8212; Insures the life of the borrower in an amount typically equal to the unpaid balance of the finance receivable and provides for payment to the lender of the finance receivable in the event of the borrower&#8217;s death. 

&#8226; 

Credit disability insurance &#8212; Provides scheduled monthly loan payments to lender during borrower&#8217;s disability due to illness or injury. 

&#8226; 

Credit involuntary unemployment insurance &#8212; Provides scheduled monthly loan payments to the lender during borrower&#8217;s involuntary unemployment. 

&#8226; 

Credit-related property and casualty insurance &#8212; Written to protect the value of property pledged as collateral for the finance receivable. 

A borrower&#8217;s purchase of credit life, credit disability, credit-related property and casualty, or credit involuntary unemployment insurance is voluntary, with the exception of lender placed property damage coverage for property pledged as collateral for our real estate loans. 

We also offer non-credit insurance policies, which are primarily traditional level term life policies with very limited underwriting. The purchase of this coverage is also voluntary. 

In addition, we offer home and auto membership plans of an unaffiliated company. We have no risk of loss on these membership plans, and these plans are not considered insurance products. We recognize income from this ancillary product in other revenues &#32; &#8212; other. The unaffiliated company providing these membership plans is responsible for any required reimbursement to the customer on the ancillary product. 

Customer Development. &#32;We staff each of our branch offices with local, well-trained personnel who have significant experience in the industry. Our business model revolves around an effective origination, underwriting, and servicing process that leverages each branch office&#8217;s local presence in these communities along with the personal relationships developed with our customers. Our combined branch network helps solicit new prospects by facilitating our &#8220;high-touch&#8221; servicing approach for personal loans due to the geographical proximity that typically exists between our branch offices and our customers. Our customers often develop a relationship with their local office representatives, which we believe not only improves the credit performance of our personal loans but also leads to additional lending opportunities. 

During the second quarter of 2015, we launched Springleaf Rewards, a unique digital loyalty program that is designed to encourage credit education, positive customer behavior and brand engagement. The program rewards customers for a range of activities, such as consistently paying their bills on time and interacting with us on social media. Unlike traditional rewards programs, Springleaf Rewards allows members to accrue points for completing tasks that help them establish and build their credit, such as viewing personal financial education videos and budgeting tutorials on line, monitoring their credit score, and submitting bill payments on time. Customers also earn points for enrolling in conveniences like paperless statements and automatic payments. Since its launch in June 2015, more than 75,000 customers have signed up to start earning rewards. Springleaf Rewards members can choose how and when to redeem their points. Points can be exchanged for a variety of gift cards for national retailers, restaurants and other merchants. 

Our online consumer loan origination business and our centralized operations allow us to reach customers located outside our branch footprint. We believe this provides us a significant opportunity to grow our customer base, loan portfolio and finance charges. If a customer applies online and is located near an existing branch, we request, though do not require, that the customer visit the branch to meet with one of our employees, who will close and fund the loans. Loans closed in a branch office are serviced by that branch. This approach provides the branches with an additional source of customers who are located close to a branch, but who prefer the convenience of applying online or during hours when the branches are not open. We also believe that this approach will enable us to leverage our branch network to offer additional products and services, including insurance products, and to help maintain the credit quality of the loans we source online. 

Our newly launched iLoan platform provides our current and prospective customers the option of obtaining an unsecured personal loan via a digital platform. The new online lending product offers a customized solution for our customers to consolidate debt, make home improvements or receive cash. Our iLoan product leverages our central underwriting and servicing operations in addition to our expertise in analytics, marketing, central operations and internet technology developed to support our branch operations. 

We use search engine optimization, banner advertisements and email campaigns to attract new customers through the internet. We also have entered into agreements with other internet loan originators to purchase leads for potential customers seeking loans. Our e-signature capabilities facilitate our online lending products. Customers who are approved for loans through our centralized operations also have the added convenience of receiving the loan funds through an automated clearinghouse (&#8220;ACH&#8221;) direct deposit into their bank accounts. These loans are serviced by our centralized operations. 

We also solicit new prospects, as well as current and former customers, through a variety of direct mail offers. Our data warehouse is a central, proprietary source of information regarding current and former customers. We use this information to tailor offers to specific customers. In addition to internal data, we purchase lists of new potential personal loan borrowers from major list vendors based on predetermined selection criteria. Mail solicitations include invitations to apply for personal loans and pre-qualified offers of guaranteed personal loan credit. 

Through our merchant referral program, merchants refer their customers to us and we originate a loan directly to the merchant&#8217;s customers to facilitate a retail purchase. We believe this approach allows us to apply our proprietary underwriting standards to these loans rather than relying on the merchant&#8217;s underwriting standards. In addition, it gives us direct access to the customer, which gives our branches the opportunity to build a relationship with the customer that could lead to opportunities to offer additional products and services, including insurance products. Our branch employees are actively soliciting new relationships with merchants in their communities, and we believe that this referral program provides us with a significant opportunity to grow our customer base and increase our finance receivables revenue. 

We market our insurance products to eligible finance receivable customers through both our branch network and our centralized operations. This allows us to benefit from the customer base underlying our consumer loan business, which significantly reduces the marketing expenses that are typically borne by insurance companies. In addition, the overhead costs of our consumer and insurance businesses are shared. 

Credit Risk. &#32;Credit quality is driven by our long-standing underwriting philosophy, which takes into account each prospective customer&#8217;s household budget, and his or her willingness and capacity to repay the loan. We use credit risk scoring models at the time of the credit application to assess the applicant&#8217;s expected willingness and capacity to repay. We develop these models using numerous factors, including past customer credit repayment experience and application data, and periodically revalidate these models based on recent portfolio performance. Our underwriting process in the branches and for loan applications received through our website that are not automatically approved also includes the development of a budget (net of taxes and monthly expenses) for the applicant. We may obtain a security interest in either titled personal property or consumer household goods. 

Our customers are primarily considered non-prime and require significantly higher levels of servicing than prime or near-prime customers. As a result, we charge these customers higher interest rates to compensate us for the related credit risks and servicing. 

Account Servicing. &#32;The account servicing and collection processing for personal loans are generally handled at the branch office where the personal loans were originated, or in our centralized service centers. All servicing and collection activity is conducted and documented on proprietary systems which log and maintain, within our centralized information systems, a permanent record of all transactions and notations made with respect to the servicing and/or collection of a personal loan and are also used to assess a personal loan application. The proprietary systems permit all levels of branch office management to review on a daily basis the individual and collective performance of all branch offices for which they are responsible. 

Acquisitions and Servicing 

The SpringCastle Portfolio consists of unsecured loans and loans secured by subordinate residential real estate mortgages (which we service as unsecured loans due to the fact that the liens are subordinated to superior ranking security interests) and includes both closed-end accounts and open-end lines of credit. These loans are in a liquidating status and vary in form and substance from our originated loans. At December 31, 2015, the SpringCastle Portfolio included over 232,000 of acquired loans, representing $1.6 billion &#32;in net finance receivables. 

NON-CORE PORTFOLIO 

Since we ceased real estate lending in January 2012, our real estate loans are in a liquidating status. In 2014, we entered into a series of transactions relating to the sales of our beneficial interests in our non-core real estate loans, the related servicing of these loans, and the sales of certain performing and non-performing real estate loans, which substantially completed our plan to liquidate our non-core real estate loans. At December 31, 2015 , our real estate loans held for investment totaled $524 million &#32;and comprised less than 4% of our net finance receivables. Real estate loans held for sale totaled $179 million &#32;at December 31, 2015 . 

CENTRALIZED OPERATIONS 

We continually seek to identify functions that could be more effective if centralized to achieve reduced costs or free our lending specialists to service our customers and market our products. Our centralized operational functions support the following: 

&#8226; 

mail and telephone solicitations; 

&#8226; 

payment processing; 

&#8226; 

originating &#8220;out of footprint&#8221; loans; 

&#8226; 

servicing of delinquent real estate loans and certain personal loans; 

&#8226; 

bankruptcy process for Chapter 7, 11, 12 and 13 loans; 

&#8226; 

litigation requests for wage garnishments and other actions against borrowers; 

&#8226; 

collateral protection insurance tracking; 

&#8226; 

repossessing and re-marketing of titled collateral; and 

&#8226; 

charge-off recovery operations. 

We currently have servicing facilities in Mendota Heights, Minnesota, Tempe, Arizona, and London, Kentucky, and in connection with the OneMain Acquisition, we acquired three additional servicing facilities in Fort Mill, South Carolina, Fort 

Worth, Texas, and Irving, Texas. We believe these facilities, along with the offices in Evansville, Indiana, position us for additional portfolio purchases or fee-based servicing, as well as additional flexibility in the servicing of our lending products. 

OPERATIONAL CONTROLS 

We control and monitor our businesses through a variety of methods including the following: 

&#8226; 

Our operational policies and procedures standardize various aspects of lending and collections. 

&#8226; 

Our branch finance receivable systems control amounts, rates, terms, and fees of our customers&#8217; accounts; create loan documents specific to the state in which the branch office operates or to the customer&#8217;s location if the loan is made electronically through our centralized operations; and control cash receipts and disbursements. 

&#8226; 

Our headquarters accounting personnel reconcile bank accounts, investigate discrepancies, and resolve differences. 

&#8226; 

Our credit risk management system reports allow us to track individual branch office performance and to monitor lending and collection activities. 

&#8226; 

Our executive information system is available to headquarters and field operations management to review the status of activity through the close of business of the prior day. 

&#8226; 

Our branch field operations management structure is designed to control a large, decentralized organization with succeeding levels of supervision staffed with more experienced personnel. 

&#8226; 

Our field operations compensation plan aligns the operating activities and goals with corporate strategies by basing the incentive portion of field personnel compensation on profitability and credit quality. 

&#8226; 

Our compliance department assesses our compliance with federal and state laws and regulations, as well as our compliance with our internal policies and procedures; oversees compliance training to ensure employees have a sufficient level of understanding of the laws and regulations that impact their job responsibilities; and manages our regulatory examination process. 

&#8226; 

Our executive office of customer care maintains our consumer complaint resolution and reporting process. 

&#8226; 

Our internal audit department audits our business for adherence to operational policy and procedure and compliance with federal and state laws and regulations. 

Currently, OneMain&#8217;s operations are being harmonized with Springleaf&#8217;s operations in connection with the integration of the two businesses. 

REGULATION 

Federal Laws 

Various federal laws and regulations govern loan origination, servicing and collections, including: 

&#8226; 

the Dodd-Frank Act; 

&#8226; 

the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (prohibits discrimination against creditworthy applicants) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau&#8217;s (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;) Regulation B, which implements this Act; 

&#8226; 

the Fair Credit Reporting Act (governs the accuracy and use of credit bureau reports); 

&#8226; 

the Truth in Lending Act (governs disclosure of applicable charges and other finance receivable terms) and the CFPB&#8217;s Regulation Z, which implements this Act; 

&#8226; 

the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act; 

&#8226; 

the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (governs the handling of personal financial information) and CFPB Regulation P, which implements this Act; 

&#8226; 

the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, which can impose limitations on the servicer&#8217;s ability to collect on a loan originated with an obligor who is on active duty status and up to nine months thereafter; 

&#8226; 

the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and the CFPB&#8217;s Regulation X (both of which regulate the making and servicing of certain loans secured by real estate); 

&#8226; 

the Federal Trade Commission&#8217;s Consumer Claims and Defenses Rule, also known as the &#8220;Holder in Due Course&#8221; Rule; and 

&#8226; 

the Federal Trade Commission Act. 

The Dodd-Frank Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder are likely to affect our operations in terms of increased oversight of financial services products by the CFPB and the imposition of restrictions on the terms of certain loans. Among regulations the CFPB has promulgated are mortgage servicing regulations that became effective January 10, 2014 and are applicable to the remaining real estate loan portfolio serviced by or for Springleaf. The CFPB has significant authority to implement and enforce federal consumer finance laws, including the new protections established in the Dodd-Frank Act, as 

well as the authority to identify and prohibit unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts and practices. In addition, under the Dodd-Frank Act, securitizations of loan portfolios are subject to certain restrictions and additional requirements, including requirements that the originator retain a portion of the credit risk of the securities sold and the reporting of buyback requests from investors. We also utilize third-party debt collectors and will continue to be responsible for oversight of their procedures and controls. 

The CFPB has supervisory, examination and enforcement authority with respect to various federal consumer protection laws for some providers of consumer financial products and services, such as any nonbank that it has reasonable cause to determine has engaged or is engaging in conduct that poses risks to consumers with regard to consumer financial products or services. In addition to the authority to bring nonbanks under the CFPB&#8217;s supervisory authority based on risk determinations, the CFPB also has authority under the Dodd-Frank Act to supervise nonbanks, regardless of size, in certain specific markets, such as mortgage companies (including, mortgage originators, brokers and servicers) and payday lenders. Currently, the CFPB has supervisory authority over us with respect to mortgage servicing and mortgage origination, which allows the CFPB to conduct an examination of our mortgage servicing practices and our prior mortgage origination practices. The Dodd-Frank Act also gives the CFPB supervisory authority over entities that are designated as &#8220;larger participants&#8221; in certain financial services markets, including consumer installment loans and related products. The CFPB has not yet promulgated regulations that designate &#8220;larger participants&#8221; for consumer finance companies. If we are designated as a &#8220;larger participant&#8221; for this market, we also will be subject to supervision and examination by the CFPB with respect to our consumer loan business. We expect to be designated as a &#8220;larger participant.&#8221; On June 30, 2015, the CFPB published regulations for &#8220;larger participants&#8221; in the market of auto finance. With the adoption of these regulations, we are a larger participant in the market of auto finance and are subject to examination by the CFPB for our auto finance lending, including loans that are secured by autos and refinances of loans secured by autos that were for the purchase of autos. 

In addition to its supervision and examination authority, the CFPB is authorized to conduct investigations to determine whether any person is engaging in, or has engaged in, conduct that violates federal consumer financial protection laws, and to initiate enforcement actions for such violations, regardless of its direct supervisory authority. Investigations may be conducted jointly with other regulators. 

The CFPB also has enforcement authority and is authorized to conduct investigations to determine whether any person is engaging in, or has engaged in, conduct that violates federal consumer financial protection laws, and to initiate enforcement actions for such violations, regardless of its direct supervisory authority. Investigations may be conducted jointly with other regulators. In furtherance of its regulatory and supervisory powers, the CFPB has the authority to impose monetary penalties for violations of applicable federal consumer financial laws, require remediation of practices and pursue administrative proceedings or litigation for violations of applicable federal consumer financial laws (including the CFPB&#8217;s own rules). The CFPB has the authority to obtain cease and desist orders (which can include orders for restitution or rescission of contracts, as well as other kinds of affirmative relief) and monetary penalties ranging from $5,000 per day for ordinary violations of federal consumer financial laws to $25,000 per day for reckless violations and $1 million per day for knowing violations. Also, where a company has violated Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act or CFPB regulations implemented thereunder, the Dodd-Frank Act empowers state attorneys general and state regulators to bring civil actions to remedy violations of state law. If the CFPB or one or more states attorneys general or state regulators believe that we have violated any of the applicable laws or regulations, they could exercise their enforcement powers in ways that could have a material adverse effect on us or our business. The CFPB has actively utilized this enforcement authority against financial institutions and financial service providers, including the imposition of significant monetary penalties and orders for restitution and orders requiring mandatory changes to compliance policies and procedures, enhanced oversight and control over affiliate and third-party vendor agreements and services and mandatory review of business practices, policies and procedures by third-party auditors and consultants. If, as a result of an examination, the CFPB were to conclude that our loan origination or servicing activities violate applicable law or regulations, we could be subject to a formal or informal enforcement action. Formal enforcement actions are generally made public, which carries reputational risk. We have not been notified of any planned examinations or enforcement actions by the CFPB. 

The Dodd-Frank Act also may adversely affect the securitization market because it requires, among other things, that a securitizer generally retain not less than 5% of the credit risk for certain types of securitized assets that are created, transferred, sold, or conveyed through issuance of asset-backed securities with an exception for securitizations that are wholly composed of &#8220;qualified residential mortgages.&#8221; The final rules implementing the risk retention requirements of Section 941 of the Dodd Frank Act became effective on February 23, 2015. Compliance with the rule with respect to asset-backed securities collateralized by residential mortgages was required beginning December 24, 2015. Compliance with the rule with regard to all other classes of asset-backed securities is required beginning December 24, 2016. The risk retention requirement may limit our ability to securitize loans and impose on us additional compliance requirements to meet origination and servicing criteria for qualified residential mortgages. The impact of the risk retention rule on the asset-backed securities market remains uncertain. Furthermore, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) adopted significant revisions to Regulation AB, imposing 

new requirements for asset-level disclosures for asset-backed securities backed by real estate related assets, auto related assets, or backed by debt securities. This could result in sweeping changes to the commercial and residential mortgage loan securitization markets, as well as to the market for the re-securitization of mortgage-backed securities. 

State Laws 

Various state laws and regulations also govern personal loans and real estate secured loans. Many states have laws and regulations that are similar to the federal laws referred to above, but the degree and nature of such laws and regulations vary from state to state. While federal law preempts state law in the event of certain conflicts, compliance with state laws and regulations is still required in the absence of conflicts. 

These additional state laws and regulations, under which we conduct a substantial amount of our lending business, generally: 

&#8226; 

provide for state licensing and periodic examination of lenders and loan originators, including state laws adopted or amended to comply with licensing requirements of the federal Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 (the &#8220;SAFE Act&#8221;) (which, in some states, requires licensing of individuals who perform real estate loan modifications); 

&#8226; 

require the filing of reports with regulators; 

&#8226; 

impose maximum term, amount, interest rate, and other charge limitations; 

&#8226; 

regulate whether and under what circumstances we may offer insurance and other ancillary products in connection with a lending transaction; and 

&#8226; 

provide for additional consumer protections. 

There is a clear trend of increased state regulation on loan origination, servicing and collection, as well as more detailed reporting, more detailed examinations, and coordination of examinations among the states. 

State authorities also regulate and supervise our insurance business. The extent of such regulation varies by product and by state, but relates primarily to the following: 

&#8226; 

licensing; 

&#8226; 

conduct of business, including marketing and sales practices; 

&#8226; 

periodic financial and market conduct examination of the affairs of insurers; 

&#8226; 

form and content of required financial reports; 

&#8226; 

standards of solvency; 

&#8226; 

limitations on the payment of dividends and other affiliate transactions; 

&#8226; 

types of products offered; 

&#8226; 

approval of policy forms and premium rates; 

&#8226; 

formulas used to calculate any unearned premium refund due to an insured customer; 

&#8226; 

permissible investments; 

&#8226; 

reserve requirements for unearned premiums, losses, and other purposes; and 

&#8226; 

claims processing. 

With respect to the insurance made available to borrowers through a third party Canadian lender, the Canadian Federal and Provincial Insurance Regulators regulate and supervise this insurance business. Their regulation and supervision relates primarily to the following: 

&#8226; 

licensing; 

&#8226; 

conduct of business, including marketing and sales practices; 

&#8226; 

periodic financial and market conduct examination of the affairs of insurers; 

&#8226; 

form and content of required financial reports; 

&#8226; 

standards of solvency; 

&#8226; 

limitations on the payment of dividends and other affiliate transactions; 

&#8226; 

types of products offered; and 

&#8226;

We operate primarily in the consumer installment lending industry focusing on the non-prime customer. As of December 31, 2015 , OMH maintained a national footprint (defined as 500 or more branches and receivables over $2 billion) of brick and 

mortar branches. As a result of the OneMain Acquisition, the combined company has over 2.4 million &#32;customer accounts and over 1,900 &#32;branch offices as of December 31, 2015. 

In addition, there are a large number of local, regional and internet competitors in the consumer installment lending industry serving the large and growing population of non-prime customers. We also compete with a large number of other types of financial institutions within our geographic footprint and over the internet, including community banks and credit unions, that offer similar products and services. We believe that competition between consumer installment lenders occurs primarily on the basis of price, speed of service, flexibility of loan terms offered, and the quality of customer service provided. 

We believe that we possess several competitive strengths that position us to capitalize on the significant growth and expansion opportunity created by the large supply-demand imbalance within our industry, and to compete effectively with other lenders in our industry. The capabilities resident in our national branch system provide us with a proven distribution channel for our personal loan and insurance products, allowing us to provide same-day fulfillment to approved customers and giving us a distinct competitive advantage over many industry participants who do not have&#8212;and cannot replicate without significant investment&#8212;a similar footprint. Our newly launched iLoan platform and our centralized operations also enhance our nationwide footprint by allowing us to serve customers that reside outside of our branch footprint. We believe our deep understanding of local markets and customers, together with our proprietary underwriting process, data analytics, and decisioning tools allow us to price, manage and monitor risk effectively through changing economic conditions. In addition, our high-touch relationship-based servicing model is a major contributor to our superior loan performance, and distinguishes us from our competitors.
