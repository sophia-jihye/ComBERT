 Item 1. 

BUSINESS 

Overview 

American Superconductor Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, &#8220;AMSC &#174; &#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was founded on April 9, 1987. We are a leading provider of megawatt-scale solutions that lower the cost of wind power and enhance the performance of the power grid. In the wind power market, we enable manufacturers to field highly competitive wind turbines through our advanced power electronics products, engineering, and support services. In the power grid market, we enable electric utilities, industrial facilities, and renewable energy project developers to connect, transmit and distribute power through our transmission planning services and power electronics, and superconductor-based products. Our wind and power grid products and services provide exceptional reliability, security, efficiency, and affordability to our customers. 

Our company has designed wind turbines for or licensed wind turbine designs to more than 10 wind turbine manufacturing customers including Inox Wind Limited (&#8220;Inox&#8221;) in India. We have also served over 100 customers in the grid market since our inception, including American Electric Power, Long Island Power Authority and Keys Energy Services in the United States, EDF Group in France, Korean Electric Power Corporation in Korea, Scottish &#38; Southern Energy in the United Kingdom, Consolidated Power Projects (Pty) Ltd in South Africa, and Ergon Energy in Australia. We serve customers globally through a localized sales and field service presence in our core target markets. Additionally, our sales personnel in the United States are supported by manufacturers&#8217; representatives.

Our wind and power grid solutions help to improve energy efficiency, alleviate power grid capacity constraints and increase the adoption of renewable energy generation. Demand for our solutions is driven by the growing needs for renewable sources of electricity, such as wind and solar energy, and for modernized smart grids that improve power reliability, security, and quality. Concerns about these factors have led to increased spending by corporations as well as supportive government regulations and initiatives on local, state and national levels, including renewable portfolio standards, tax incentives, and international treaties. We estimate that today&#8217;s total annual addressable global market for our wind and grid solutions is approximately $11.0 billion. 

We segment our operations into two market-facing business units: Wind and Grid. We believe this market-centric structure enables us to more effectively anticipate and meet the needs of wind turbine manufacturers, power generation project developers and electric utilities. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Wind. Through our Windtec Solutions TM , our Wind business segment enables manufacturers to field wind turbines with exceptional power output, reliability, and affordability. We supply advanced power electronics and control systems, license our highly engineered wind turbine designs, and provide extensive customer support services to wind turbine manufacturers. Our design portfolio includes a broad range of drive trains and power ratings of 2 megawatts (&#8220;MW&#8221;) and higher.

&#160;

&#183; 

Grid. Through our Gridtec Solutions TM , our Grid business segment enables electric utilities and renewable energy project developers to connect, transmit and distribute power with exceptional efficiency, reliability, security and affordability. We provide transmission planning services that allow us to identify power grid congestion, poor power quality, and other risks, which help us determine how our solutions can improve network performance. These services often lead to sales of our grid interconnection solutions for wind farms and solar power plants, power quality systems and transmission and distribution cable systems. We also sell ship protection products to the U.S. Navy. 

Our fiscal year begins on April 1 and ends on March 31. When we refer to a particular fiscal year, we are referring to the fiscal year beginning on April 1 of that same year. For example, fiscal 2015 refers to the fiscal year beginning on April 1, 2015. Other fiscal years follow similarly. 

Competitive strengths 

We believe our competitive strengths position us well to execute on our growth plans in the markets we serve. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Unique Solutions for the Wind and Grid Markets. We believe we are the only company in the world that provides wind turbine manufacturers with an integrated approach of wind turbine design and engineering, customer support services and power electronics and control systems.

Market opportunities 

Our solutions address two substantial global demands: 

&#160;

&#183; 

the demand for renewable sources of electricity, and 

&#160;

&#183; 

the demand for modernized, smart power grid infrastructure that alleviates capacity constraints and improves electricity reliability, security, and efficiency. 

Wind market overview 

According to GlobalData, a research firm, nearly 55 Gigawatts (GW) of wind generation capacity were added worldwide in 2015, as compared to 52 GW in 2014. GlobalData anticipates that more than 56 GW of additional capacity will be added in 2016. 

Several factors are expected to drive the future growth in the wind power market, including substantial government incentives and mandates that have been established globally, technological improvements, turbine cost reductions, the development of the offshore wind market, and increasing cost competitiveness with existing power generation technologies. Technological advances, declining turbine production cost and fluctuating prices for some fossil fuels continue to increase the competitiveness of wind versus traditional power generation technologies. 

Our solutions for the wind market 

We address the challenges of the wind power market by designing and engineering wind turbines, providing extensive support services to wind turbine manufacturers and manufacturing and selling critical components for wind turbines. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Electrical Control Systems. We provide full electrical control systems (&#8220;ECS&#8221;) or a subset of those systems (&#8220;core electrical components&#8221;) to manufacturers of wind turbines designed by us. Our ECS regulate voltage, control power flows and maximize wind turbine efficiency, among other functions. To date, we have shipped enough core electrical components and complete ECS to power nearly 16,000 Megawatts (&#8220;MW&#8221;) of wind power. We believe our ECS represent approximately 5-10% of a wind turbine&#8217;s bill of materials. We believe that the total addressable market for ECS was approximately $3.2 billion annually in 2015. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Wind Turbine Designs. We design and develop entire state-of-the-art onshore and offshore wind turbines with power ratings of 2 MWs and higher for manufacturers who are in the business of producing wind turbines or who plan to enter the business of manufacturing wind turbines. These customers typically pay us licensing fees, and in some cases royalties for wind turbine designs, and purchase from us the core electrical components or complete electrical control systems needed to operate the wind turbines. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Customer Support Services . We provide extensive customer support services to wind turbine manufacturers. These services range from providing designs for customers&#8217; wind turbine manufacturing plants to establishing and localizing their supply chains and training their employees on proper wind turbine installation and maintenance. We believe these services enable customers to accelerate their entry into the wind turbine manufacturing market and lower the cost of their wind turbine platforms. 

Our approach to the wind energy markets allows our customers to use our world-class turbine engineering capabilities while minimizing their research and development costs. These services and our advanced electrical control systems provide our customers with the ability to produce standardized or next-generation wind turbines at scale for their local market or the global market quickly and cost-effectively. Our team of highly experienced engineers works with clients to customize turbine designs specifically tailored to local markets while providing ongoing access to field services support and future technological advances. 

Grid market overview 

It is widely believed that the electricity grid in the U.S. is in need of modernization through a technology upgrade if it is to maintain reliability and adapt to the changing market needs. In fact, a recent report written by The White House and titled, &#8220;Economic Benefits of increasing Electric Grid Resilience in Weather Outages&#8221; found that economic damage from weather-related power outages averaged between $18 and $33 billion per year between 2003 and 2012 &#8211; and went as high as $75 billion in 2008 and $52 billion in 2012, as a result of damage caused by Hurricanes Ike and Sandy, respectively. Furthermore, the electric grid is also vulnerable to equipment failure, acts of terror, and threats to cyber security. Recent events and the reliance of safety, security, and economy on the electricity grid have prompted broad recognition worldwide of the need to modernize and enhance the reliability and security of power grids. 

Power grid operators worldwide face various challenges, including: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Stability . Power grid operators are confronting power quality and stability issues arising from intermittent renewable energy sources and from the capacity limitations of transmission and overhead distribution lines and underground cables. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Reliability . Traditional transmission lines and cables often reach their reliable voltage stability limit well below their thermal threshold. Driving more power through a power grid when some lines and cables are operating above their voltage stability limit during times of peak demand can cause either unacceptably low voltage in the power grid (a brownout) or risk of a sudden, uncontrollable voltage collapse (a blackout). 

&#160;

&#183; 

Capacity . The traditional way to enable increases in power grid capacity without losing voltage stability is to install more overhead power lines and underground cables. However, permitting new transmission and distribution lines can take 10 years or more due to various public policy issues, such as environmental, aesthetic, and health concerns. In urban and metropolitan areas, installing additional conventional underground copper cables is similarly challenging, since many existing underground corridors carrying power distribution cables are already filled to their physical capacity and cannot accommodate any additional conventional cables. In addition, adding new conduits requires excavation to expand existing corridors or create new corridors, which are costly and disruptive undertakings. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Efficiency . Most overhead lines and underground cables use traditional conductors such as copper and aluminum, which lose power due to electrical resistance. At transmission voltage, electrical losses average about 7% in the United States and other developed nations, but can exceed 20% in some locations due to the distance of the line, quality of conductor, and the power grid&#8217;s architecture and characteristics, among other factors. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Security . Catastrophic equipment failures caused by aging equipment, physical and cyber threats, and weather related disasters can leave entire sec tions of an urban environment without power for hours or days. It can be difficult to recover from extended power outages in urban load centers, worsening situations where the personal safety of residents and the economic health of business are threatened . 

Our solutions for the grid market 

We address these challenges in the Grid market by providing services and solutions designed to increase the power grid&#8217;s capacity, reliability, security and efficiency. We also provide advanced ship protection equipment for the U.S Navy in this segment as each Navy ship can be thought of as having its own power grid. Our solutions include:

&#160;

&#183; 

Superconductor Wire and Applications . Conventional conductors of electricity, such as aluminum and copper wire, lose energy due to resistance. Using a compound of yttrium barium copper oxide (&#8220;YBCO&#8221;), we manufacture and provide high-temperature superconductor (&#8220;HTS&#8221;) wire that can conduct many times more electricity than conventional conductors with no power loss. We have developed full system solutions that we sell and expect to continue to sell directly to customers. This business model leverages our applications expertise, drives value beyond the wire and enables us to recognize revenue and take ownership over the marketing and sales of the full systems. These systems include: 

&#160;

o 

Resilient Electric Grid Systems . Our REG system has two primary applications that increase the reliability and the capacity of the urban infrastructure. For applications focused on reliability improvement, the REG cable is best used in a &#8220;ring&#8221; or &#8220;loop&#8221; configuration to interconnect nearby urban substations. This enables urban utilities to share transmission connections and excess station capacity, while controlling the high fault currents that naturally result from such interconnections, providing protection against the adverse effects that follow the loss of critical substation facilities in urban areas. For applications focused on capacity improvement, the REG cable can be used in a &#8220;branch&#8221; configuration. In this application, the REG cable connects an existing large urban substation with a new, much smaller, and more simplified substation within the city at a lower cost. The smaller urban substation does not need large power transformers and takes up much less space, thereby significantly reducing real estate, construction, and other related costs in the urban area. The key component to the REG system is a breakthrough cable system that combines very high power handling capacity with fault current limiting characteristics, features that are attributable to our proprietary HTS wire. Assuming all urban substations in major cities in the U.S. could be connected with our REG system, we believe the total annual addressable market is approximately $5.7 billion. 

&#160;

o 

Ship Protection Systems . The primary focus of our ship protection systems (&#8220;SPS&#8221;) has been degaussing systems. These systems reduce a Naval ship&#8217;s magnetic signature, making it much more difficult for a mine to detect and damage a ship. Traditionally made of heavy copper wire, degaussing is required on all Navy combat ships. Our HTS advanced degaussing system is lightweight, compact, and often outperforms its conventional counterpart. This HTS system is estimated to enable a 50 to 80 percent reduction in total degaussing system weight, offering significant potential for fuel savings or options to add different payloads. The core components of a degaussing system are transferable to other applications being targeted for ship implementation. We are also continuing to work on expanding HTS technology into the fleet through a variety of applications for power, propulsion, and protection equipment. We estimate that the total addressable market for HTS-based, ship protection systems for the U.S. Navy fleet to be between $70.0 million and $120.0 million per year between the years 2020 and 2025. 

&#160;

&#183; 

FACTS Systems. Flexible alternating current transmission system &#8211; or FACTS &#8211; is a system that consists of power electronics and other static components used for controlling power flow and voltage in the AC transmission system. FACTS products aim to increase controllability and power transferability of a network, which allows more effective utilization of existing assets, and reduces the need for new transmission lines and facilities to increase electricity availability. Our FACTS sales process begins with our group of experienced transmission planners working with power grid operators, renewable energy developers, and industrial system operators to identify power grid constraints and determine how our solutions might improve network performance. These services often lead to sales of grid interconnection solutions for wind farms and solar power plants, power quality systems for utilities and heavy industrial operations and transmission and distribution cable systems. Our transmission planners work with our customers on the following solutions: 

&#160;

o 

D-VAR &#174; Systems . The power that flows through AC networks comprises both real power, measured in watts, and reactive power, measured in Volt Amp Reactive (&#8220;VARs&#8221;). In simple terms, reactive power is required to support voltage in the power network. D-VAR systems can provide the reactive power needed to stabilize voltage on the grid. These systems also can be used to connect wind farms and solar power plants to the power grid seamlessly as well as to protect certain industrial facilities against voltage swells and sags. GlobalData and AMSC estimate the market for FACTS systems such as D-VAR was more than $2.0 billion in 2015. 

&#160;

o 

D -SVC Systems. Our D-SVC systems are a cost-effective solution that allow large industrial loads to operate on the AC power system while minimizing the impacts of voltage sags and flicker problems, and also provides dynamic, distribution level voltag e regulation and power factor control solutions for utilities. Our D-SVC system automatically applies VARs on a cycle-by-cycle basis to maintain steady line voltages adjacent to large inductive loads such as motors, welders, arc furnaces and pipeline pump ing stations. 

&#160;

&#183; 

We are also offering full system solutions through a collaboration with industry leader Nexans: 

&#160;

o 

Stand-alone Fault Current Limiters . Used in substations, superconductor fault current limiters (&#8220;SFCLs&#8221;) act as surge protectors for the power grid. SFCLs can help protect the grid by reducing the destructive nature of faults, extending the life of existing substation equipment and allowing utilities to defer or eliminate equipment replacements or upgrades. Together with Nexans, we offer SFCLs for medium voltage alternating current (&#8220;AC&#8221;) networks. 

Core Technologies 

Superconductors 

Our second generation (&#8220;2G&#8221;) HTS wire technology helps us address the smart grid infrastructure market opportunity by providing components and solutions designed to increase the power grid&#8217;s capacity, reliability, security and efficiency. Our wire, known as Amperium wire, conducts electricity with zero resistance below about -297 degrees Fahrenheit. Additionally, our 2G wire has the ability to switch to a resistive state whenever a fault current exceeds a predetermined value. This characteristic is a key enabler to our REG system. The technology can be used in many applications including electricity transmission cables, superconducting generators, voltage regulators and degaussing systems for naval vessels. Superconductor power cables, which are a class of high-capacity, environmentally-benign, and easy-to-install transmission and distribution cables, address power grid capacity issues by increasing the thermal limit of existing or new corridors. Superconductor power cables are cylindrically shaped systems consisting of HTS wires (which conduct electricity) surrounded by electrical insulation encased in a metal or polymeric jacket. 

Currently, power cables are made primarily using copper wires. Power cables incorporating our Amperium wire are able to carry up to 10 times the electrical current of copper cables of the same diameter. These cable systems also bring efficiency advantages. Traditional cable systems heat up due to the electrical resistance of copper, causing electrical losses. Electrical losses at transmission voltage average about 7% in the United States and other developed nations, but can exceed 20% in some locations due to the distance of the line and the power grid&#8217;s architecture and characteristics, among other factors. Conversely, HTS materials can carry direct current (&#8220;DC&#8221;) with 100% efficiency and AC with nearly 100% efficiency when they are cooled below a critical temperature. As a result, AC HTS power cables lose significantly less power to resistive heating than copper cables, and DC HTS power cables have no energy losses due to resistive heating. 

PowerModule Power Converters 

Our family of PowerModule power electronic converters incorporates power semiconductor devices that switch, control and move large amounts of power faster and with far less disruption than the electromechanical switches historically used. While today our PowerModule systems are used primarily in our ECS and D-VAR systems, they also have been incorporated into electric motor drives, distributed and dispersed generation devices (micro-turbines, fuel cells, and photovoltaics), power quality solutions, batteries, and flywheel-based uninterruptible power supplies. 

&#160;

Research and Development

Our research and development expenses were $12.3 million, $11.9 million and $12.2 million in fiscal 2015, fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, respectively.

Our global footprint also includes sales and field service offices in Australia, Germany, India, Korea and the United Kingdom. 

Sales and marketing 

Our strategy is to serve customers locally in our core target markets through a direct sales force operating out of sales offices worldwide. In addition, we utilize manufacturers&#8217; sales representatives in the United States to market our products to utilities in North America. The sales force also leverages business development staff for our various offerings as well as our team of wind turbine engineers and power grid transmission planners, all of whom help to ensure that we have an in-depth understanding of customer needs and provide cost-effective solutions for those needs. 

In fiscal 2015, Inox accounted for 62% of our total revenues, and no other customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues. In fiscal 2014, Inox accounted for 56% of our total revenues, and no other customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues. In fiscal 2013, Inox and Beijing JINGCHENG New Energy accounted for 31% and 18%, respectively, of our total revenues.

The portion of total revenue recognized from customers located outside the United States was 85%, 86% and 87% for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Of the revenue recognized from customers outside the United States, we recognized 73%, 65% and 36% from customers in India for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and we recognized 10%, 17% and 34% from customers in China in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. For additional financial information, see the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein, including Note 17, &#8220;Business Segments&#8221;. 

Our foreign operations, particularly our operations in China, India and other emerging markets, expose us to a variety of risks. For a discussion of additional risks associated with our foreign operations, see Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors &#8211; We have operations in and that depend on sales in emerging markets, including China and India, and global conditions could negatively affect our operating results or limit our ability to expand our operations outside of these countries. Changes in China&#8217;s or India&#8217;s political, social, regulatory and economic environment may affect our financial performance.&#8221;

Backlog 

We had backlog at March 31, 2016 of approximately $88.9 million from government and commercial customers, compared to $40.7 million at March 31, 2015. Current backlog represents the value of contracts and purchase orders received for which delivery is expected during the next twelve months based on contractually agreed-upon terms. The year over year increase in backlog is driven primarily by the larger orders received from Inox in fiscal 2015, as well as stronger orders recently for our D-VAR products. Of our reported twelve month backlog at March 31, 2016, $58.0 million pertains to the supply contract with Inox entered into in December 2015, shipments under which are expected to commence once Inox makes the required $2.0 advance payment under the supply contract. See Item 7 &#8211; &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation&#8221;, for further discussion of the strategic agreements entered into with Inox.

Competition 

We face competition in various aspects of our technology and product development. We believe that competitive performance in the marketplace depends upon several factors, including technical innovation, range of products and services, product quality and reliability, customer service and technical support. 

Wind 

We face competition from companies offering power electronic converters for use in applications for which we expect to sell our PowerModule products. These companies include ABB, Hopewind, Semikron, Shinergy, Vacon, and Xantrex (a subsidiary of Schneider Electric). 

We face competition from companies offering various types of wind turbine electrical system components, which include ABB, Ingeteam, Mita-Teknik and Woodward. We also face indirect competition in the wind energy market from global manufacturers of wind turbines, such as Gamesa, General Electric, Suzlon, and Vestas. 

We face competition for the supply of wind turbine engineering design services from design engineering firms such as GL Garrad Hassan, and from licensors of wind turbine systems such as Aerodyn. 

Grid 

We face competition from other companies offering FACTS systems similar to our D-VAR products. These include static var compensators (&#8220;SVCs&#8221;) from ABB, General Electric, AREVA, Mitsubishi Electric, and Siemens; adaptive VAR compensators and STATCOMs produced by ABB, Siemens, and S&#38;C Electric; Dynamic voltage restorers (&#8220;DVRs&#8221;) produced by companies such as ABB and S&#38;C Electric; and flywheels and battery-based uninterruptable power supply (&#8220;UPS&#8221;) systems offered by various companies around the world. 

We face competition both from suppliers of traditional utility solutions and from companies who are developing HTS wires. We also face competition for our Amperium wire from a number of companies in the United States and abroad. These include Superconductor Technologies and Superpower (a subsidiary of Furukawa) in the United States; Fujikura and Sumitomo in Japan; SuNAM in South Korea; BASF Corporation in Europe (&#8220;BASF&#8221;), Innova and Shanghai Creative Superconductor in China; and SuperOx in Russia. With our HTS-based REG product, we are offering a new approach that provides alternatives to utilities for power system design. Therefore, we believe that we compete with traditional approaches such as new full sized substations, overhead and underground transmission, and urban power transformers. 

We believe we are currently the only company that can offer HTS-based SPS products that have been fully qualified for use aboard Navy surface combatants. Therefore, the primary competition for our SPS products is currently coming from defense contractors that provide the copper-based systems that our lighter, more efficient HTS versions have been developed to replace. Companies such as L3, Excelis, Raytheon and Textron have the bulk of the copper-based business today. However, over time, as the HTS-based SPS proliferate to the fleet, companies that have the capability to manufacture and/or package HTS wire into robust, turn-key systems will likely attempt to duplicate our products, and thus additional competition is expected from more traditional HTS competitors such as those listed above.

Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources, research and development, manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do. In addition, as our target markets develop, other large industrial companies may enter these fields and compete with us. 

Patents, licenses and trade secrets 

Patent Background 

An important part of our business strategy is to develop a strong worldwide patent position in all of our technology areas. Our intellectual property (&#8220;IP&#8221;) portfolio includes both patents we own and patents we license from others. We devote substantial resources to building a strong patent position. As of March 31, 2016, we owned (either solely or jointly) 100 U.S. patents and 8 U.S. patent applications on file. We also hold licenses from third parties covering more than 75 issued U.S. patents and patent applications. Together with the international counterparts of each of these patents and patent applications, we own almost 400 patents and patent applications worldwide, and have rights through exclusive and non-exclusive licenses to more than 200 additional patents and patent applications. We believe that our current patent position, together with our ability to obtain licenses from other parties to the extent necessary, will provide us with sufficient proprietary rights to develop and sell our products. However, for the reasons described below, we cannot assure you that this will be the case. 

Despite t he strength of our patent position, a number of U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications of third parties relate to our current products, to products we are developing, or to technology we are now using in the development or production of our produ cts. We may need to acquire licenses to those patents, contest the scope or validity of those patents, or design around patented processes or applications as necessary. If companies holding patents or patent applications that we need to license are competi tors, we believe the strength of our patent portfolio will significantly improve our ability to enter into license or cross-license arrangements with these companies. We have already successfully negotiated cross-licenses with several competitors. We may b e required to obtain licenses to some patents and patent applications held by companies or other institutions, such as national laboratories or universities, not directly competing with us. Those organizations may not be interested in cross-licensing or, i f willing to grant licenses, may charge unreasonable royalties. We have successfully obtained licenses related to HTS wire from a number of such organizations with royalties we consider reasonable. Based on historical experience, we expect that we will be able to obtain other necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms. However, we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to obtain all necessary licenses from competitors on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. 

Failure to obtain all necessary patents, licenses and other IP rights upon reasonable terms could significantly reduce the scope of our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We do not now know the likelihood of successfully contesting the scope or validity of patents held by others. In any event, we could incur substantial costs in challenging the patents of other companies. Moreover, third parties could challenge some of our patents or patent applications, and we could incur substantial costs in defending the scope and validity of our own patents or patent applications whether or not a challenge is ultimately successful. 

There are multiple foreign counter-part patents that continue to be exclusively licensed to AMSC that expire in fiscal year 2016. 

Wind and Grid Patents 

We have received patents and filed a significant number of additional patent applications on power quality and reliability systems, including our D-VAR products. Our products are covered by 60 patents and patents pending worldwide on both our systems and power converter products. The patents and applications focus on inventions that significantly improve product performance and reduce product costs, thereby providing a competitive advantage. One invention of note allows for a reduction in the number of power inverters required in the system by optimally running the inverters in overload mode, thereby significantly reducing overall system costs. Another important invention uses inverters to offset transients due to capacitor bank switching, which provides improved system performance. 

Under our Windtec Solutions TM brand, we design a variety of wind turbine systems and license these designs, including expertise and patent rights, to third parties for an upfront fee, plus in some cases, future royalties. Our wind turbine designs are covered by more than 30 patents and patents pending worldwide on wind turbine technology. We have patent coverage on the unique design features of our blade pitch control system, which ensures optimal aerodynamic flow conditions on the turbine blades and improves system efficiency and performance. The pitch system includes a patented SafetyLOCK&#8482; feature that causes the blades to rotate to a feathered position to prevent the rotor blades from spinning during a fault. 

We recognize the importance of IP protection in China and believe that China is steadily moving toward recognizing and acting in accordance with international norms for IP. As such, we have incorporated China in our patent strategy for all of our various products. Nevertheless, we recognize that the risk of IP piracy is still higher in China than in most other industrialized countries, and so we are careful to limit the technology we provide through our product sales and other expansion plans in China. While we take the steps necessary to ensure the safety of our IP, we cannot provide any assurance that these measures will be fully successful. For example, see Part I, Item 3, &#8220;Legal Proceedings,&#8221; for more information regarding legal proceedings that we have undertaken against Sinovel Wind Group Co., Ltd (&#8220;Sinovel&#8221;) alleging the illegal use of our intellectual property. 

HTS Patents 

Since the discovery of high temperature superconductors in 1986, rapid technical advances have characterized the HTS industry, which in turn have resulted in a large number of patents, including overlapping patents, relating to superconductivity. As a result, the patent situation in the field of HTS technology and products is unusually complex. We have obtained licenses to patents and patent applications covering some HTS materials. We have acquired exclusive rights (through 2017) to a fundamental U.S. patent (U.S. 8,060,169 B1) covering 2G and similar HTS wire and applications. However, we may have to obtain additional licenses to HTS materials and, upon expiration of U.S. 8,060,169, to the materials covered by such patent. 

We are focusing on the production of our Amperium wire, and we intend to continue to maintain a leadership position in 2G HTS wire through a combination of patents, licenses and proprietary expertise. In addition to our owned patents and patent applications in 2G HTS wire, we have obtained licenses from (i) MIT for the MOD process we use to deposit the YBCO layer, (ii) Alcatel-Lucent on the YBCO material, and (iii) the University of Tennessee/Battelle for the RABiTS &#174; process we use for the substrate and buffer layers for this technology. During fiscal 2015, we entered into a Joint Development Agreement (&#8220;JDA&#8221;) and licensed certain of our HTS manufacturing process technology to BASF. Under the JDA, we agreed with BASF to develop a new s olutions-based deposition technology for the interface layers of our Amperium wire. Should this development effort be successful, any newly developed intellectual property as a result of the JDA will be owned by BASF, but we will have the right to incorpo rate this new technology into our manufacturing process on a royalty-free basis. Alternatively, we could purchase HTS wire directly from BASF should they decide to manufacture and sell HTS wire. If alternative processes become more promising in the futur e, we also expect to seek to develop a proprietary position in these alternative processes. 

We have a significant number of patents and patents pending covering applications of HTS wire, such as HTS fault current limiting technology including our fault current limiting cable, HTS rotating machines and ship protection systems. Since the superconductor rotating machine and the fault current limiting cable applications are relatively new, we are building a particularly strong patent position in these areas. At present, we believe we have the world&#8217;s broadest and most fundamental patent position in superconductor rotating machines technology. We have also filed a series of patents on our concept for our proprietary fault current limiting technology. However, there can be no assurance that that these patents will be sufficient to assure our freedom of action in these fields without further licensing from others. See Part I, Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors,&#8221; for more information regarding the status of the commercialization of our Amperium wire products. 

Trade Secrets 

Some of the important technology used in our operations and products is not covered by any patent or patent application owned by or licensed to us. However, we take steps to maintain the confidentiality of this technology by requiring all employees and all consultants to sign confidentiality agreements and by limiting access to confidential information. We cannot provide any assurance that these measures will prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of that information. For example, see Part I, Item 3, &#8220;Legal Proceedings,&#8221; for more information regarding legal proceedings that we have filed against Sinovel alleging the illegal use of our intellectual property. In addition, we cannot provide any assurance that others, including our competitors, will not independently develop the same or comparable technology that is one of our trade secrets. 

Employees 

As of March 31, 2016, we employed 369 persons. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. Retaining our key employees is important for achieving our goals, and we are committed to developing a working environment that motivates and rewards our employees.
