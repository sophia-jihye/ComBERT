Overview 

&#160; 

U.S. Rare Earth Minerals (formerly U.S. Natural Nutrients and Minerals, Inc.) (the &#8220;Company&#8221;), was organized on June 9, 2008. The Company changed its name in April, 2011. The Company&#8217;s focus is on sales and distribution of certain products derived from the Company&#8217;s mining activities relating to natural mineral deposits commonly known as Calcium Montmorillonite. These activities are currently carried out through a distributor-based sales program directed at agricultural and human uses of the product. The Company commenced its mining activities in 2009, the Company entered into an agreement with M Strata LLC, a related party, whereby M Strata granted the Company permission and consent to mine certain mining claims owned or controlled by M Strata located on land located in the southwestern part of southern Nevada not far from the town of Panaca A copy of the First Amended and Restated Mining Agreement (the &#8220;M Strata Agreement&#8221;) effective as of November 1, 2013 was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in late 2013 on Form 8-K. 

&#160; 

The Company has commenced a sales and marketing program and has been selling the product extracted in the mining process under the name &#8220;Excelerite&#174;&#8221;. The Company believes that Excelerite&#174; may have broad applications for plants, animals and humans. Specifically, the Company believes that by adding Excelerite&#174; back into the soil, household and commercial farmers are replacing what has been lost by the use of man-made fertilizers over hundreds of years. Farmers using Excelerite&#174; are seeing higher yields and larger and more nutritious crops. In addition, studies suggest that animals whose feed is supplemented with Excelerite&#174; grow healthier and produce more. The naturally chelated nutrients and minerals in Excelerite&#174; may enhance the production of enzymes. Without enzymes living things cannot build protein and other vital processes. 

&#160;

The Company markets Excelerite&#174; through various channels including but not limited to direct distribution, sales through third-party distributors and sales on the Company&#8217;s website. The Company has also undertaken to develop a network of distributors, both in the United States and internationally. In late March 2014, the Company temporarily suspended website sales of bagged products due to an inefficient and costly process then in place by prior management. Web based sales are expected to resume by late 2016.
