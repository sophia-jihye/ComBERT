 Item 1. Business

Overview

Earthstone Energy, Inc. (together with our consolidated subsidiaries, the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;Earthstone&#8221; or similar terms), a Delaware corporation formed in 1969, is a growth-oriented independent oil and natural gas exploration and production company focused on the acquisition, development, exploration and production of onshore, crude oil and natural gas reserves. Our strategy, which is discussed in greater detail below, is to deliver competitive and sustainable rates of return to our stockholders by developing and acquiring oil and natural gas reserves through an active and diversified program that includes the acquisition, drilling and development of undeveloped leases, purchases of reserves and exploration activities that currently involve oil-weighted projects.

Our operations are all in the upstream segment of the oil and natural gas industry and are conducted onshore in the United States. Our asset portfolio currently includes activities in the Eagle Ford trend of south Texas and in the Williston Basin of North Dakota and Montana. These regions are a focus for us, as well as other areas in Texas. We also own other operated and non-operated properties in east and south Texas and eastern Oklahoma, which may be divested in the future. We have approximately 21,500 net leasehold acres in the Eagle Ford trend of south Texas, including 18,600 net leasehold acres in the crude oil window in Fayette, Gonzales and Karnes Counties, Texas, and 2,900 net leasehold acres located in the natural gas and condensate window in La Salle County. We serve as the operator for substantially all of our Fayette, Gonzales and Karnes County acreage with working interests ranging from 33% to 50% and we are a non-operator with respect to our La Salle County acreage with working interests ranging typically 10% to 15%. We are also non-operator with respect to the majority of our properties in the Williston Basin. We continuously evaluate opportunities to expand our acreage and our producing assets through acquisitions. Our successful acquisition of assets will depend on the opportunities and the financing alternatives available to us at the time we consider such opportunities.

Our corporate headquarters is located in The Woodlands, Texas. We also have an operating office in Denver, Colorado and two field offices in south Texas. Our common stock is traded on the NYSE MKT under the symbol ESTE. 

Recent Developments 

Acquisitions

On December 16, 2015, we entered into an Arrangement Agreement (the &#8220;Arrangement Agreement&#8221;), among Lynden Energy Corp., a corporation existing under the laws of British Columbia, Canada (&#8220;Lynden&#8221;), Earthstone and 1058286 B.C. Ltd., a company organized under the laws of British Columbia, Canada and wholly-owned subsidiary of Earthstone (&#8220;Merger Sub&#8221;), pursuant to which Merger Sub will acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Lynden (the &#8220;Lynden Shares&#8221;) and as an integral part of such acquisition, Merger Sub and Lynden will amalgamate to continue as one corporate entity with Lynden surviving the amalgamation as part of a plan of arrangement (the &#8220;Transaction&#8221;). Under the Arrangement Agreement, the terms of which were unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of Earthstone, Lynden and Merger Sub, Earthstone will issue approximately 3.7 million shares of its common stock, (&#8220;Earthstone Common Stock&#8221;), to Lynden stockholders.

Under the Arrangement Agreement, Lynden stockholders will receive 0.02842 shares of Earthstone Common Stock in exchange for each share of Lynden common stock held. Following the Transaction, stockholders of Earthstone and Lynden are expected to own approximately 79% and 21%, respectively, of the combined company on a fully diluted basis. The Transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2016.

On December 19, 2014, we acquired three operating subsidiaries of Oak Valley Resources, LLC, a privately-held Delaware limited liability company (&#8220;OVR&#8221;), in exchange for shares of our common stock (the &#8220;Exchange&#8221;), which resulted in a change of control. Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, OVR contributed to us the membership interests of its three subsidiaries, Earthstone Operating, LLC (formerly Oak Valley Operating, LLC) (&#8220;OVO&#8221;), EF Non-Op, LLC (&#8220;EF Non-Op&#8221;) and Sabine River Energy, LLC (&#8220;Sabine&#8221;), each a Texas limited liability company (collectively &#8220;Oak Valley&#8221;), in exchange for approximately 9.124 million shares, representing 84% of our common stock. The Exchange was accounted for as a reverse acquisition whereby Oak Valley was considered the acquirer for accounting purposes. All historical financial information contained in this report is that of Oak Valley. Upon the closing of the Exchange, we changed our fiscal year from March 31 to December 31 in order for our fiscal year end to correspond with the fiscal year end of OVR and its subsidiaries.

Immediately following the Exchange, we acquired an additional 20% undivided ownership interest in certain crude oil and natural gas properties located in Fayette and Gonzales Counties, Texas, in exchange for the issuance of approximately 2.957 million shares of our common stock (the &#8220;Contribution Agreement&#8221;) to Flatonia Energy, LLC (&#8220;Flatonia&#8221;), increasing our ownership in these properties from a 30% undivided ownership to a 50% undivided ownership interest. As a result of the share issuance to Flatonia, OVR&#8217;s ownership in us decreased from 84% to 66%.

&#160;

Our Business Strategy 

We pursue a value-driven growth strategy focused on projects that we believe will generate strong and predictable rates of return and increases in stockholder value. Although we have significant non-operated properties, we believe that we should be the operator of the majority of our properties in order to control costs and direct the efficient development of such properties in an effort to optimize investment returns and profitability. We also believe that a reasonable level of diversification in our asset base is preferable to that of a single basin focused company as it may provide us the ability to take advantage of regional changes in realized prices, service costs, service availability and numerous other factors that may affect the cost-efficient and economic development of our assets. Management concentrates on building production, reserves and cash flows while seeking to expand our undeveloped acreage and drilling inventory in select targeted areas. Further expansion of our asset base will be achieved through cost efficient development, exploitation and operation of our current assets and acreage and through additional leasing, acquisitions, development drilling and exploration activities, currently directed toward oil-weighted projects. Finally, management intends to pursue corporate and asset acquisition opportunities. 

Our business strategy includes the following:

&#160;

&#183; 

pursuing value-accretive corporate merger and acquisition opportunities; 

&#160;

&#183; 

expanding our acreage positions and drilling inventory in our areas of primary interest through acquisitions and farm-in opportunities, with an emphasis on operated positions; 

&#160;

&#183; 

pending adequate commodity prices, continuing the cost-effective development and exploitation of existing acreage positions with a particular attention to properties located in the Eagle Ford, Austin Chalk, Bakken and Three Forks formations; 

&#160;

&#183; 

generating additional development projects in our areas of primary interest; 

&#160;

&#183; 

selectively divesting non-core assets in order to streamline operations and utilize capital and human resources most effectively; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

obtaining additional capital, as available and needed, through the issuance of equity and debt securities or by soliciting industry or financial participants to jointly develop and/or acquire assets. 

Our fundamental operating and technical strategy is complemented by our focus on increasing stockholder value by:

&#160;

&#183; 

maximizing profit margins; 

&#160;

&#183; 

controlling capital expenditures and operating and administrative costs; 

&#160;

&#183; 

promoting industry or institutional participants into projects to manage risk, enhance rates of return and lower net finding and development costs; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

maintaining a sound capital structure. 

Management believes its strategy is appropriate because it:

&#160;

&#183; 

addresses multiple risks of oil and gas operations while providing equity holders with upside potential; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

results in &#8220;staying power,&#8221; which management believes is essential to mitigate the adverse impacts of historically volatile commodity prices and financial markets. 

Our Operations

We are the operator of properties containing approximately 67 % of our proved oil and natural gas reserves and 73% of our proved PV-10 as of December 31, 2015. As operator, we are able to directly influence exploration, development and production of operations of our operating properties. Our producing properties have reasonably predictable production profiles and cash flows, subject to commodity price fluctuations. Our status as an operator has allowed us to pursue the development of undeveloped acreage, further develop existing properties and generate new projects that we believe have the potential to increase stockholder value.

As is common in the industry, we participate in non-operated properties on a selective basis. Decisions to participate in non-operated properties are dependent upon the technical and economic nature of the projects and the operating expertise and financial standing of the operators.

&#160;

D escription of Major Properties 

The following is a brief description of our primary oil and natural gas properties and current focus areas. We also own operated and non-operated properties located in east and south Texas, and eastern Oklahoma. 

Fayette County, Texas and Gonzales County, Texas

Operated Eagle Ford

As of December 31, 2015, we accumulated approximately 38,000 gross (18,600 net) leasehold acres in Gonzales, Fayette and Karnes Counties, Texas. The acreage is located in the crude oil window of the Eagle Ford shale trend of South Texas and is prospective for the Eagle Ford, Austin Chalk, Upper Eagle Ford, Buda, Wilcox and Edwards formations. We serve as the operator with a 50% undivided ownership interest in substantially all of the acreage.

As of December 31, 2015, we operated 62 gross Eagle Ford wells and eight gross Austin Chalk wells and had non-operated interests in two gross producing Eagle Ford wells and one gross producing Austin Chalk well. Twelve gross Eagle Ford wells and one upper Austin Chalk well were in the process of being drilled or were waiting on completion at December 31, 2015. Our plan is to complete four Eagle Ford wells and one upper Austin Chalk well during 2016. We have identified a total of approximately 220 gross Eagle Ford drilling locations in our acreage. The number of Eagle Ford locations could potentially increase subject to future down spacing initiatives. In addition, because our acreage position is prospective for the Austin Chalk, Upper Eagle Ford, Buda, Wilcox and Edwards formations, we may have additional future economic locations. The majority of our acreage is covered by a 173 square mile 3-D seismic survey, which is being used to develop the Eagle Ford and identify Austin Chalk locations and other economic opportunities.

We are currently budgeting $4.5 million to $6.0 million per well to drill and complete Eagle Ford wells with completed lateral lengths of approximately 4,500-7,000 feet, and $4.0 million to $4.5 million per well to drill and complete Austin Chalk wells with lateral lengths of approximately 13,000 feet. 

Non-Operated Eagle Ford

We have a non-operated position in approximately 25,400 gross acres in two areas within the Hawkville Field in La Salle County, Texas. The acreage is operated by BHP Billiton and Lewis Petro Properties, Inc. and is prone to natural gas and condensate produced from the Eagle Ford formation. The two areas are summarized below:

&#160;

a) 

White Kitchen &#8211; We have a 15% working interest in approximately 7,100 gross acres, all of which is held by production. As of December 31, 2015, 30 gross wells were producing, and we have identified approximately 40 additional drilling locations.

&#160;

b) 

Martin Ranch &#8211; We have a 10% working interest in approximately 18,300 gross acres. As of December 31, 2015, 34 gross wells were producing, and we have identified approximately 140 potential drilling locations in the acreage.

Williston Basin

We have a non-operated position in approximately 10,900 net acres in the Williston Basin of North Dakota and Montana. At present, our most active area within the basin is the Banks Field in McKenzie County, North Dakota. In the Banks Field, we have an average working interest of 4.1% in 77 horizontal Bakken/Three Forks producing wells that are primarily operated by Statoil. We have an additional 27 wells waiting on completion in the Banks Field. We have identified approximately 140 potential drilling locations which are in existing producing units throughout the Bakken/Three Forks play.

Competition

The domestic oil and natural gas business is intensely competitive in the exploration for and acquisition of reserves and in the producing and marketing of oil and natural gas production. Our competitors include national oil companies, major oil and natural gas companies, independent oil and natural gas companies, individual producers, natural gas marketers, and major pipeline companies, as well as participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to consumers. 

Seasonality of Business

Weather conditions affect the demand for, and prices of, natural gas and can also delay oil and natural gas drilling activities, disrupting our overall business plans. Demand for natural gas is typically higher during the winter, resulting in higher natural gas prices for our natural gas production during our first and fourth fiscal quarters. Due to these seasonal fluctuations, our results of operations for individual quarterly periods may not be indicative of the results that we may realize on an annual basis.

&#160;

Operational Risks 

Oil and natural gas exploration and development involves a high degree of risk, which even a combination of experience, knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome. There is no assurance that we will discover or acquire additional oil and natural gas in commercial quantities. Oil and natural gas operations also involve the risk that well fires, blowouts, equipment failure, human error and other events may cause accidental leakage or spills of toxic or hazardous materials, such as petroleum liquids or drilling fluids into the environment, or cause significant injury to persons or property. In such event, substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities may be incurred, the satisfaction of which could substantially reduce our available cash and possibly result in loss of oil and natural gas properties. Such hazards may also cause damage to or destruction of wells, producing formations, production facilities and pipeline or other processing facilities.

As is common in the oil and natural gas industry, we do not insure fully against all risks associated with our business either because such insurance is not available or because we believe the premium costs are prohibitive. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material effect on our operating results, financial position or cash flows. For further discussion of risks see Item 1A. Risk Factors of this report.

Title to Properties

We believe that the title to our oil and natural gas properties is good and defensible in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and natural gas industry, subject to such exceptions which, in our opinion, are not so material as to detract substantially from the use or value of such properties. Our properties are typically subject, in one degree or another, to one or more of the following: 

&#160;

&#183; 

royalties and other burdens and obligations, express or implied, under oil and natural gas leases; 

&#160;

&#183; 

overriding royalties and other burdens created by us or our predecessors in title; 

&#160;

&#183; 

a variety of contractual obligations (including, in some cases, development obligations) arising under operating agreements, farmout agreements, production sales contracts and other agreements that may affect the properties or their titles; 

&#160;

&#183; 

back-ins and reversionary interests existing under purchase agreements and leasehold assignments; 

&#160;

&#183; 

liens that arise in the normal course of operations, such as those for unpaid taxes, statutory liens securing obligations to unpaid suppliers and contractors and contractual liens under operating agreements; as well as pooling, unitization and communitization agreements, declarations and orders; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

easements, restrictions, rights-of-way and other matters that commonly affect property. 

To the extent that such burdens and obligations affect our rights to production revenues, they have been taken into account in calculating our net revenue interests and in estimating the size and value of our reserves. We believe that the burdens and obligations affecting our properties are conventional in the industry for properties of the kind that we own.

Regulations

All of the jurisdictions in which we own or operate producing oil and natural gas properties have statutory provisions regulating the exploration for and production of oil and natural gas, including provisions related to permits for the drilling of wells, bonding requirements to drill or operate wells, the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process, and the plugging and abandonment of wells. Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern the size of drilling and spacing units, the density of wells that may be drilled in oil and natural gas properties and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties. In this regard, some states allow the forced pooling or integration of land and leases to facilitate exploration while other states rely primarily or exclusively on voluntary pooling of land and leases. In areas where pooling is primarily or exclusively voluntary, it may be difficult to form spacing units and therefore difficult to develop a project if the operator owns less than 100% of the leasehold. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas, and impose specified requirements regarding the ratability of production. On some occasions, tribal and local authorities have imposed moratoria or other restrictions on exploration and production activities pending investigations and studies addressing potential local impacts of these activities before allowing oil and natural gas exploration and production to proceed.

The effect of these regulations is to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill, although we can apply for exceptions to such regulations or to have reductions in well spacing. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction.

&#160;

Environmental Regulations 

Our operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to health and safety or the protection of the environment. Numerous governmental agencies, such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency, commonly referred to as the EPA, issue regulations to implement and enforce these laws, which often require difficult and costly compliance measures. Among other things, environmental regulatory programs typically govern the permitting, construction and operation of a facility. Many factors, including public perception, can materially impact the ability to secure an environmental construction or operation permit. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may result in the assessment of substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as the issuance of injunctions limiting or prohibiting our activities. In addition, some laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment may, in certain circumstances, impose strict liability for environmental contamination, which could result in liability for environmental damages and cleanup costs without regard to negligence or fault on our part.

Beyond existing requirements, new programs and changes in existing programs, may address various aspects of our business including naturally occurring radioactive materials, oil and natural gas exploration and production, air emissions, waste management, and underground injection of waste material. Environmental laws and regulations have been subject to frequent changes over the years, and the imposition of more stringent requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations to which our business operations are subject and for which compliance in the future may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position.

Hazardous Substances and Wastes

The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, referred to as CERCLA or the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault, on certain classes of persons that are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons may include the current or former owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances that have been released at the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of investigating and cleaning up hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of some health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment.

Under the federal Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, referred to as RCRA, most wastes generated by the exploration and production of oil and natural gas are not regulated as hazardous wastes. Periodically, however, there are proposals to lift the existing exemption for oil and natural gas wastes and reclassify them as hazardous wastes. If such proposals were to be enacted, they could have a significant impact on our operating costs, as well as the oil and natural gas industry in general. In the ordinary course of our operations moreover, some wastes generated in connection with our exploration and production activities may be regulated as solid waste under RCRA, as hazardous waste under existing RCRA regulations or as hazardous substances under CERCLA. From time to time, releases of materials or wastes have occurred at locations we own or at which we have operations. These properties and the materials or wastes released thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we have been and may be required to remove or remediate such materials or wastes.

Water Discharges

Our operations are also subject to the federal Clean Water Act and analogous state laws. Under the Clean Water Act, the EPA has adopted regulations concerning discharges of storm water runoff. This program requires covered facilities to obtain individual permits, or seek coverage under a general permit. Some of our properties may require permits for discharges of storm water runoff. We believe that we will be able to obtain, or be included under, these permits, where necessary, and make minor modifications to existing facilities and operations that would not have a material effect on us. The Clean Water Act and similar state acts regulate other discharges of wastewater, oil, and other pollutants to surface water bodies, such as lakes, rivers, wetlands, and streams. Failure to obtain permits for such discharges could result in civil and criminal penalties, orders to cease such discharges, and costs to remediate and pay natural resources damages. These laws also require the preparation and implementation of Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure Plans in connection with on-site storage of significant quantities of oil.

Our oil and natural gas production also generates salt water, which we dispose of by underground injection. The federal Safe Drinking Water Act (&#8220;SDWA&#8221;), the Underground Injection Control (&#8220;UIC&#8221;) regulations promulgated under the SDWA and related state programs regulate the drilling and operation of salt water disposal wells. The EPA directly administers the UIC program in some states, and in others it is delegated to the state for administering. Permits must be obtained before drilling salt water disposal wells, and casing integrity monitoring must be conducted periodically to ensure the casing is not leaking salt water to groundwater. Contamination of groundwater by oil and natural gas drilling, production, and related operations may result in fines, penalties, and 

&#160;

remediation costs, among other sanctions and liabilities under the SDWA and state laws. In addition, third party claims may be filed by landowners and other parties claiming damages for alternative water supplies, property damages, and bodily injury. 

Hydraulic Fracturing

Our completion operations are subject to regulation, which may increase in the short- or long-term. In particular, the well completion technique known as hydraulic fracturing is used to stimulate production of natural gas and oil has come under increased scrutiny by the environmental community, and local, state and federal jurisdictions. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and additives under pressure, usually down casing that is cemented in the wellbore, into prospective rock formations at depth to stimulate oil and natural gas production.

Under the direction of Congress, the EPA has undertaken a study of the effect of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater. The EPA has also announced its plan to propose pre-treatment standards under the Clean Water Act for wastewater discharges from shale hydraulic fracturing operations. Congress may consider legislation to amend the SDWA to require the disclosure of chemicals used by the oil and natural gas industry in the hydraulic fracturing process. Certain states, including Colorado, Utah and Wyoming, have issued similar disclosure rules. Several environmental groups have also petitioned the EPA to extend toxic release reporting requirements under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act to the oil and natural gas extraction industry. 

Air Emissions

The federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements. In addition, the EPA has developed and continues to develop stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources, including oil and natural gas production. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations. Our operations, or the operations of service companies engaged by us, may in certain circumstances and locations be subject to permits and restrictions under these statutes for emissions of air pollutants.

In 2012, the EPA issued four new regulations for the oil and natural gas industry, including: a new source performance standard for volatile organic compounds (&#8220;VOCs&#8221;); a new source performance standard for sulfur dioxide; an air toxics standard for oil and natural gas production; and an air toxics standard for natural gas transmission and storage. The final rule includes the first federal air standards for natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured, or refractured, as well as requirements for several sources, such as storage tanks and other equipment, and limits methane emissions from these sources. Compliance with these regulations has imposed additional requirements and costs on our operations.

In October 2015, the EPA announced that it was lowering the primary national ambient air quality standards (&#8220;NAAQS&#8221;) for ozone from 75 parts per billion to 70 parts per billion. Implementation will take place over several years; however, the new standard could result in a significant expansion of ozone nonattainment areas across the United States, including areas in which we operate. Oil and natural gas operations in ozone nonattainment areas would likely be subject to increased regulatory burdens in the form of more stringent emission controls, emission offset requirements, and increased permitting delays and costs.

Climate Change

Studies over recent years have indicated that emissions of certain gases may be contributing to warming of the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere. In response to these studies, governments have been adopting domestic and international climate change regulations that require reporting and reductions of the emission of such greenhouse gases. Methane, a primary component of natural gas, and carbon dioxide, a byproduct of burning oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products, are considered greenhouse gases. Internationally, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement address greenhouse gas emissions, and several countries including those comprising the European Union have established greenhouse gas regulatory systems. In the United States, at the state level, many states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, have been implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through the emission inventories, emissions targets, greenhouse gas cap and trade programs or incentives for renewable energy generation, while others have considered adopting such greenhouse gas programs.

At the federal level, the EPA has issued regulations requiring us and other companies to annually report certain greenhouse gas emissions from our oil and natural gas facilities. Beyond its measuring and reporting rules, the EPA has issued an &#8220;Endangerment Finding&#8221; under section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act, concluding greenhouse gas pollution threatens the public health and welfare of current and future generations. The finding served as the first step to issuing regulations that require permits for and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for certain facilities. 

&#160;

In addition, President Obama released a Strategy to Reduce Methane Emis sions in March 2014. Consistent with that strategy, the EPA issue d a proposed rule in 2015 that would set additional standards for methane and VOC emissions from oil and natural gas production sources , including hydraulically fractured oil wells and natura l gas processing and transmission sources. The EPA intends to issue a final rule in 2016. In addition, the federal Bureau of Land Management (&#8220;BLM&#8221;) has proposed standards for reduc ing venting and flaring on public lands. The EPA and BLM actions are part o f a series of steps by the Administration that are intended to result by 2025 in a 40-45% decrease in methane emissions from the oil and natural gas industry as compared to 2012 levels. In the courts, several decisions have been issued that may increase t he risk of claims being filed by governments and private parties against companies that have significant greenhouse gas emissions. Such cases may seek to challenge air emissions permits that greenhouse gas emitters apply for and seek to force emitters to r educe their emissions or seek damages for alleged climate change impacts to the environment, people, and property. 

Any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to incur additional operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems or other compliance costs, and reduce demand for our products.

The National Environmental Policy Act

Oil and natural gas exploration and production activities may be subject to the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA. NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Department of the Interior, to evaluate major agency actions that have the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will prepare an Environmental Assessment that assesses the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed Environmental Impact Statement that may be made available for public review and comment. This process has the potential to delay the development of future oil and natural gas projects.

Threatened and endangered species, migratory birds and natural resources

Various state and federal statutes prohibit certain actions that adversely affect endangered or threatened species and their habitat, migratory birds, wetlands, and natural resources. These statutes include the Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Clean Water Act. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service may designate critical habitat areas that it believes are necessary for survival of threatened or endangered species. A critical habitat designation could result in further material restrictions on federal land use or on private land use and could delay or prohibit land access or development. Where takings of or harm to species or damages to wetlands, habitat, or natural resources occur or may occur, government entities or at times private parties may act to prevent or restrict oil and natural gas exploration activities or seek damages for any injury, whether resulting from drilling or construction or releases of oil, wastes, hazardous substances or other regulated materials, and in some cases, criminal penalties may result.

Hazard communications and community right to know

We are subject to federal and state hazard communication and community right to know statutes and regulations. These regulations govern record keeping and reporting of the use and release of hazardous substances, including, but not limited to, the federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act and may require that information be provided to state and local government authorities and the public.

Occupational Safety and Health Act

We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act and comparable state statues that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration&#8217;s hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees. 

Employees

As of December 31, 2015, we had 50 full-time employees and one part-time employee, 37 of which are management, technical and administrative personnel, and 14 of which are field operations employees. Contract personnel perform some technical and administrative tasks and operate some of our producing fields under the direct supervision of our employees. No employees are covered under a collective bargaining agreement nor are any employees represented by a union. The Company considers all relations with its employees to be good.
