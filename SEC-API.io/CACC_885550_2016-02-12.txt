 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

General 

Since 1972, Credit Acceptance Corporation (referred to as the &#8220;Company&#8221;, &#8220;Credit Acceptance&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;our&#8221; or &#8220;us&#8221;) has offered automobile dealers financing programs that enable them to sell vehicles to consumers, regardless of their credit history. Our financing programs are offered through a nationwide network of automobile dealers who benefit from sales of vehicles to consumers who otherwise could not obtain financing; from repeat and referral sales generated by these same customers; and from sales to customers responding to advertisements for our product, but who actually end up qualifying for traditional financing. 

Credit Acceptance was founded to collect retail installment contracts (referred to as &#8220;Consumer Loans&#8221;) originated by automobile dealerships owned by Donald Foss, our Chairman, founder, and significant shareholder. During the 1980s, we began to market this service to non-affiliated dealers and, at the same time, began to offer dealers a non-recourse cash payment (referred to as an &#8220;advance&#8221;) against anticipated future collections on Consumer Loans serviced for that dealer. 

We refer to automobile dealers who participate in our programs and who share our commitment to changing consumers&#8217; lives as &#8220;Dealers&#8221;. Upon enrollment in our financing programs, the Dealer enters into a Dealer servicing agreement with us that defines the legal relationship between Credit Acceptance and the Dealer. The Dealer servicing agreement assigns the responsibilities for administering, servicing, and collecting the amounts due on Consumer Loans from the Dealers to us. We are an indirect lender from a legal perspective, meaning the Consumer Loan is originated by the Dealer and assigned to us. 

Substantially all of the Consumer Loans assigned to us are made to consumers with impaired or limited credit histories. The following table shows the percentage of Consumer Loans assigned to us with either FICO&#174; scores below 650 or no FICO&#174; scores:

Consumers and Dealers benefit from our programs as follows: 

Consumers. We help change the lives of consumers who do not qualify for conventional automobile financing by helping them obtain quality transportation. Without our financing programs, consumers are often unable to purchase a vehicle or they purchase an unreliable one. Further, as we report to the three national credit reporting agencies, an important ancillary benefit of our programs is that we provide our consumers with an opportunity to improve their lives by improving their credit score and move on to more traditional sources of financing. 

Dealers. Our programs increase Dealers&#8217; profits in the following ways: 

&#8226; 

Enables Dealers to sell cars to consumers who may not be able to obtain financing without our programs. In addition, consumers often become repeat customers, returning to buy cars from the same Dealer over the years. 

&#8226; 

Allows Dealers to share in the profit, not only from the sale of the vehicle, but also from its financing. 

&#8226; 

Enables Dealers to attract consumers who mistakenly assume they do not qualify for conventional financing. 

Business Segment Information 

We currently operate in one reportable segment which represents our core business of offering Dealers financing programs and related products and services that enable them to sell vehicles to consumers, regardless of their credit history. For information regarding our one reportable segment and related entity-wide disclosures, see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference. 

Principal Business 

We offer our Dealers financing programs that enable them to sell vehicles to consumers, regardless of their credit history. We have two programs: the Portfolio Program and the Purchase Program. Under the Portfolio Program, we advance money to Dealers (referred to as a &#8220;Dealer Loan&#8221;) in exchange for the right to service the underlying Consumer Loans. Under the Purchase Program, we buy the Consumer Loans from the Dealers (referred to as a &#8220;Purchased Loan&#8221;) and keep all amounts collected from the consumer. Dealer Loans and Purchased Loans are collectively referred to as &#8220;Loans&#8221;. The following table shows the percentage of Consumer Loans assigned to us based on unit volumes under each of the programs for each of the last three years:

Portfolio Program 

As payment for the vehicle, the Dealer generally receives the following: 

&#8226; 

a down payment from the consumer; 

&#8226; 

a cash advance from us; and 

&#8226; 

after the advance has been recovered by us, the cash from payments made on the Consumer Loan, net of certain collection costs and our servicing fee (&#8220;Dealer Holdback&#8221;). 

We record the amount advanced to the Dealer as a Dealer Loan, which is classified within Loans receivable in our consolidated balance sheets. Cash advanced to the Dealer is automatically assigned to the Dealer&#8217;s open pool of advances. We generally require Dealers to group advances into pools of at least 100 Consumer Loans. At the Dealer&#8217;s option, a pool containing at least 100 Consumer Loans can be closed and subsequent advances assigned to a new pool. All advances within a Dealer&#8217;s pool are secured by the future collections on the related Consumer Loans assigned to the pool. For Dealers with more than one pool, the pools are cross-collateralized so the performance of other pools is considered in determining eligibility for Dealer Holdback. We perfect our security interest in the Dealer Loans by taking possession of the Consumer Loans, which list us as lien holder on the vehicle title. 

The Dealer servicing agreement provides that collections received by us during a calendar month on Consumer Loans assigned by a Dealer are applied on a pool-by-pool basis as follows: 

&#8226; 

First, to reimburse us for certain collection costs; 

&#8226; 

Second, to pay us our servicing fee, which generally equals 20% of collections; 

&#8226; 

Third, to reduce the aggregate advance balance and to pay any other amounts due from the Dealer to us; and 

&#8226; 

Fourth, to the Dealer as payment of Dealer Holdback. 

If the collections on Consumer Loans from a Dealer&#8217;s pool are not sufficient to repay the advance balance and any other amounts due to us, the Dealer will not receive Dealer Holdback. 

Dealers have an opportunity to receive an accelerated Dealer Holdback payment each time 100 Consumer Loans have been assigned to us. The amount paid to the Dealer is calculated using a formula that considers the forecasted collections and the advance balance on the related Consumer Loans. 

Since typically the combination of the advance and the consumer&#8217;s down payment provides the Dealer with a cash profit at the time of sale, the Dealer&#8217;s risk in the Consumer Loan is limited. We cannot demand repayment of the advance from the Dealer except in the event the Dealer is in default of the Dealer servicing agreement. Advances are made only after the consumer and Dealer have signed a Consumer Loan contract, we have received the executed Consumer Loan contract and supporting documentation in either physical or electronic form, and we have approved all of the related stipulations for funding. The Dealer can also opt to repurchase Consumer Loans that have been assigned to us under the Portfolio Program, at their discretion, for a fee. 

For accounting purposes, the transactions described under the Portfolio Program are not considered to be loans to consumers. Instead, our accounting reflects that of a lender to the Dealer. The classification as a Dealer Loan for accounting purposes is primarily a result of (1) the Dealer&#8217;s financial interest in the Consumer Loan and (2) certain elements of our legal relationship with the Dealer. 

Purchase Program 

The Purchase Program differs from our Portfolio Program in that the Dealer receives a one-time payment from us at the time of assignment to purchase the Consumer Loan instead of a cash advance at the time of assignment and future Dealer Holdback payments. For accounting purposes, the transactions described under the Purchase Program are considered to be originated by the Dealer and then purchased by us. 

Program Enrollment 

Dealers may enroll in our Portfolio Program by (1) paying an up-front, one-time fee of $9,850, or (2) agreeing to allow us to retain 50% of their first accelerated Dealer Holdback payment. Access to the Purchase Program is typically only granted to Dealers that meet one of the following: 

&#8226; 

received first accelerated Dealer Holdback payment under the Portfolio Program; 

&#8226; 

franchise dealership; or 

&#8226; 

independent dealership that meets certain criteria upon enrollment. 

Revenue Sources 

Credit Acceptance derives its revenues from the following principal sources: 

&#8226; 

Finance charges, which are comprised of: (1) servicing fees earned as a result of servicing Consumer Loans assigned to us by Dealers under the Portfolio Program, (2) finance charge income from Purchased Loans, (3) fees earned from our third party ancillary product offerings, (4) monthly program fees of $599, charged to Dealers under the Portfolio Program; and (5) fees associated with certain Loans; 

&#8226; 

Premiums earned on the reinsurance of vehicle service contracts; and 

&#8226; 

Other income, which primarily consists of: GPS-SID fees, ancillary product profit sharing, remarketing fees, Dealer support products and services and Dealer enrollment fees. For additional information, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 to this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference. 

The following table sets forth the percent relationship to total revenue of each of these sources:

Our business is seasonal with peak Consumer Loan acceptances and collections occurring during the first quarter of the year. However, this seasonality does not have a material impact on our interim results. 

Operations 

Sales and Marketing . Our target market is approximately 60,000 independent and franchised automobile dealers in the United States. We have market area managers located throughout the United States that market our programs to prospective Dealers, enroll new Dealers, and support active Dealers. The number of Dealer enrollments and active Dealers for each of the last three years are presented in the table below:

Active Dealers are Dealers who have received funding for at least one Loan during the period. 

Once Dealers have enrolled in our programs, the market area managers work closely with the newly enrolled Dealers to help them successfully launch our programs within their dealerships. Market area managers also provide active Dealers with ongoing support and consulting focused on improving the Dealers&#8217; success on our programs, including assistance with increasing the volume and performance of Consumer Loan assignments. 

Dealer Servicing Agreement. As a part of the enrollment process, a new Dealer is required to enter into a Dealer servicing agreement with Credit Acceptance that defines the legal relationship between Credit Acceptance and the Dealer. The Dealer servicing agreement assigns the responsibilities for administering, servicing, and collecting the amounts due on Consumer Loans from the Dealers to us. Under the typical Dealer servicing agreement, a Dealer represents that it will only assign Consumer Loans to us that satisfy criteria established by us, meet certain conditions with respect to their binding nature and the status of the security interest in the purchased vehicle, and comply with applicable state and federal laws and regulations. 

The typical Dealer servicing agreement may be terminated by us or by the Dealer upon written notice. We may terminate the Dealer servicing agreement immediately in the case of an event of default by the Dealer. Events of default include, among other things: 

&#8226; 

the Dealer's refusal to allow us to audit its records relating to the Consumer Loans assigned to us; 

&#8226; 

the Dealer, without our consent, is dissolved; merges or consolidates with an entity not affiliated with the Dealer; or sells a material part of its assets outside the course of its business to an entity not affiliated with the Dealer; or 

&#8226; 

the appointment of a receiver for, or the bankruptcy or insolvency of, the Dealer. 

While a Dealer can cease assigning Consumer Loans to us at any time without terminating the Dealer servicing agreement, if the Dealer elects to terminate the Dealer servicing agreement or in the event of a default, we have the right to require that the Dealer immediately pay us: 

&#8226; 

any unreimbursed collection costs on Dealer Loans; 

&#8226; 

any unpaid advances and all amounts owed by the Dealer to us; and 

&#8226; 

a termination fee equal to 15% of the then outstanding amount of the Consumer Loans assigned to us. 

Upon receipt of such amounts in full, we reassign the Consumer Loans and our security interest in the financed vehicles to the Dealer. 

In the event of a termination of the Dealer servicing agreement by us, we may continue to service Consumer Loans assigned by Dealers accepted prior to termination in the normal course of business without charging a termination fee. 

Consumer Loan Assignment. Once a Dealer has enrolled in our programs, the Dealer may begin assigning Consumer Loans to us. For legal purposes, a Consumer Loan is considered to have been assigned to us after the following has occurred: 

&#8226; 

the consumer and Dealer have signed a Consumer Loan contract; and 

&#8226; 

we have received the executed Consumer Loan contract and supporting documentation in either physical or electronic form. 

For accounting and financial reporting purposes, a Consumer Loan is considered to have been assigned to us after the following has occurred: 

&#8226; 

the Consumer Loan has been legally assigned to us; and 

&#8226; 

we have made a funding decision and generally have provided funding to the Dealer in the form of either an advance under the Portfolio Program or one-time purchase payment under the Purchase Program. 

A Consumer Loan is originated by the Dealer when a consumer enters into a contract with a Dealer that sets forth the terms of the agreement between the consumer and the Dealer for the payment of the purchase price of the vehicle. The amount of the Consumer Loan consists of the total principal and interest that the consumer is required to pay over the term of the Consumer Loan. Consumer Loans are written on a contract form provided by us. Although the Dealer is named in the Consumer Loan contract, the Dealer generally does not have legal ownership of the Consumer Loan for more than a moment and we, not the Dealer, are listed as lien holder on the vehicle title. Consumers are obligated to make payments on the Consumer Loan directly to us, and any failure to make such payments will result in us pursuing payment through collection efforts. 

All Consumer Loans submitted to us for assignment are processed through our Credit Approval Processing System (&#8220;CAPS&#8221;). CAPS allows Dealers to input a consumer&#8217;s credit application and view the response from us via the Internet. CAPS allows Dealers to: (1) receive a quick approval from us; (2) interact with our proprietary credit scoring system to optimize the structure of each transaction prior to delivery; and (3) create, electronically execute and print Consumer Loan documents. All responses include the amount of funding (advance for a Dealer Loan or purchase price for a Purchased Loan), as well as any stipulations required for funding. The amount of funding is determined using a formula which considers a number of factors including the timing and amount of cash flows expected on the related Consumer Loan and our target return on capital at the time the Consumer Loan is submitted to us for assignment. The estimated future cash flows are determined based upon our proprietary credit scoring system, which considers numerous variables, including attributes contained in the consumer&#8217;s credit bureau report, data contained in the consumer&#8217;s credit application, the structure of the proposed transaction, vehicle information and other factors, to calculate a composite credit score that corresponds to an expected collection rate. Our proprietary credit scoring system forecasts the collection rate based upon the historical performance of Consumer Loans in our portfolio that share similar characteristics. The performance of our proprietary credit scoring system is evaluated monthly by comparing projected to actual Consumer Loan performance. Adjustments are made to our proprietary credit scoring system as necessary. For additional information on adjustments to forecasted collection rates, please see the Critical Accounting Estimates section in Item 7 of this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference. 

While a Dealer can submit any legally compliant Consumer Loan to us for assignment, the decision whether to provide funding to the Dealer and the amount of any funding is made solely by us. Through our Dealer Service Center, we perform all significant functions relating to the processing of the Consumer Loan applications and bear certain costs of Consumer Loan assignment, including the cost of assessing the adequacy of Consumer Loan documentation, compliance with underwriting and legal guidelines and the cost of verifying employment, residence and other information provided by the Dealer. 

We audit Consumer Loan files for legal and underwriting guidelines on a daily basis in order to assess whether our Dealers are operating in accordance with the terms and conditions of our Dealer servicing agreement. We occasionally identify breaches of the Dealer servicing agreement and depending upon the circumstances, and at our discretion, we may change pricing or charge the Dealer fees for future Consumer Loan assignments; require the Consumer Loan(s) to be repurchased; or terminate our relationship with the Dealer. 

Our business model allows us to share the risk and reward of collecting on the Consumer Loans with the Dealers. Such sharing is intended to motivate the Dealer to assign better quality Consumer Loans, follow our underwriting guidelines, comply with various legal regulations, meet our credit compliance requirements and provide appropriate service and support to the consumer after the sale. In addition, our Dealer Service Center works closely with Dealers to assist them in resolving any documentation deficiencies or funding stipulations. We believe this arrangement aligns our interests with the interests of the Dealer and the consumer. 

We measure various criteria for each Dealer against other Dealers in their area as well as the top performing Dealers. Dealers are assigned a Dealer rating based upon the performance of their Consumer Loans in both the Portfolio and Purchase Programs as well as other criteria. The Dealer rating is one of the factors used to determine the amount paid to Dealers as an advance or to acquire a Purchased Loan. We provide each Dealer a monthly statement summarizing all activity that occurred on their Consumer Loan assignments.

Servicing. Our largest group of collectors services Consumer Loans that are in the early stages of delinquency. Collection efforts typically consist of placing a call to the consumer within one day of the missed payment due date, although efforts may begin later for some segments of accounts. Consumer Loans are segmented into dialing pools by various phone contact profiles in an effort to efficiently contact the consumer. Our collectors work with consumers to attempt to reach a solution that will help them avoid becoming further past due and get them current where possible. 

The decision to repossess a vehicle is based on policy-based criteria. When a Consumer Loan is approved for repossession, the account is transferred to our repossession team. Repossession personnel continue to service the Consumer Loan as it is being assigned to a third party repossession contractor, who works on a contingency fee basis. Once a vehicle has been repossessed, the consumer can negotiate to redeem the vehicle, whereupon the vehicle is returned to the consumer in exchange for paying off the Consumer Loan balance; or, where appropriate or if required by law, the vehicle is returned to the consumer and the Consumer Loan is reinstated in exchange for a payment that reduces or eliminates the past due balance. If this process is unsuccessful, the vehicle is sold at a wholesale automobile auction. Prior to sale, the vehicle is typically inspected by a representative at the auction who provides repair and reconditioning recommendations. Alternatively, our remarketing representatives may inspect the vehicle directly. Our remarketing representatives then authorize any repair and reconditioning work in order to maximize the net sale proceeds at auction. 

If the vehicle sale proceeds are not sufficient to satisfy the balance owing on the Consumer Loan, the Consumer Loan is serviced by either: (1) our internal collection team, in the event the consumer is willing to make payments on the deficiency balance; or (2) where permitted by law, our external collection team, if it is believed that legal action is required to reduce the deficiency balance owing on the Consumer Loan. Our external collection team generally assigns Consumer Loans to third party collection attorneys who work on a contingency fee basis. 

Collectors service Consumer Loans through our servicing platform, which consists of the following two systems: 

&#8226; 

The collection system, which assigns Consumer Loans to collectors through a predictive dialer and records all collection activity, including: 

&#8226; 

details of past phone conversations with the consumer; 

&#8226; 

collection letters sent; 

&#8226; 

promises to pay; 

&#8226; 

broken promises; 

&#8226; 

repossession orders; and 

&#8226; 

collection attorney activity. 

&#8226; 

The servicing system, which maintains a record of all transactions relating to Consumer Loan assignments and is a primary source of data utilized to: 

&#8226; 

determine the outstanding balance of the Consumer Loans; 

&#8226; 

forecast future collections; 

&#8226; 

establish the amount of revenue recognized by us; 

&#8226; 

calculate Dealer Holdback payments; 

&#8226; 

analyze the profitability of our program; and 

&#8226; 

evaluate our proprietary credit scoring system. 

Ancillary Products 

We provide Dealers the ability to offer vehicle service contracts to consumers through our relationships with Third Party Providers (&#8220;TPPs&#8221;). A vehicle service contract provides the consumer protection by paying for the repair or replacement of certain components of the vehicle in the event of a mechanical failure. The wholesale cost of the vehicle service contract is charged to the Dealer&#8217;s advance balance, and paid to the TPP, net of an administrative fee retained by us. We recognize our fee as part of finance charges on a level-yield basis based upon forecasted cash flows. The difference between the wholesale cost and the retail price to the consumer is paid to the Dealer as a commission. The commission is charged to the Dealer&#8217;s advance balance. TPPs process claims on vehicle service contracts that are underwritten by third party insurers. We bear the risk of loss for claims on certain vehicle service contracts that are reinsured by us. We market the vehicle service contracts directly to our Dealers. Our agreement with one of our TPPs allows us to receive profit sharing payments depending on the performance of the vehicle service contracts. Profit sharing payments from the TPP are received twice a year, if eligible. 

VSC Re Company (&#8220;VSC Re&#8221;), our wholly-owned subsidiary, is engaged in the business of reinsuring coverage under vehicle service contracts sold to consumers by Dealers on vehicles financed by us. VSC Re currently reinsures vehicle service contracts that are underwritten by one of our third party insurers. Vehicle service contract premiums, which represent the selling price of the vehicle service contract to the consumer, less fees and certain administrative costs, are contributed to trust accounts controlled by VSC Re. These premiums are used to fund claims covered under the vehicle service contracts. VSC Re is a bankruptcy remote entity. As such, our exposure to fund claims is limited to the trust assets controlled by VSC Re and our net investment in VSC Re. 

We provide Dealers the ability to offer Guaranteed Asset Protection (&#8220;GAP&#8221;) to consumers through our relationships with TPPs. GAP provides the consumer protection by paying the difference between the loan balance and the amount covered by the consumer's insurance policy in the event of a total loss of the vehicle due to severe damage or theft. The wholesale cost of GAP is charged to the Dealer&#8217;s advance balance, and paid to the TPP, net of an administrative fee retained by us. We recognize our fee as part of finance charges on a level-yield basis based upon forecasted cash flows. The difference between the wholesale cost and the retail price to the consumer is paid to the Dealer as a commission. The commission is charged to the Dealer&#8217;s advance balance. TPPs process claims on GAP contracts that are underwritten by third party insurers. Our agreement with one of our TPPs allows us to receive profit sharing payments depending on the performance of the GAP contracts. Profit sharing payments from the TPP are received once a year, if eligible. 

We provide Dealers in certain states the ability to purchase Global Positioning Systems with Starter Interrupt Devices (&#8220;GPS-SID&#8221;) through our relationships with TPPs. Through this program, Dealers can install GPS-SID on vehicles financed by us that can be activated if the consumer fails to make payments on their account, and can result in the prompt repossession of the vehicle. Dealers purchase GPS-SID directly from the TPPs. The TPPs pay us a fee for each device sold, at which time the fee revenue is recognized in other income within our consolidated statements of income. 

Competition 

The market for consumers who do not qualify for conventional automobile financing is large and highly competitive. The market is currently served by &#8220;buy here, pay here&#8221; dealerships, banks, captive finance affiliates of automobile manufacturers, credit unions and independent finance companies both publicly and privately owned. Many of these companies are much larger and have greater resources than us. We compete by offering a profitable and efficient method for Dealers to finance consumers who would be more difficult or less profitable to finance through other methods. In addition, we compete on the basis of the level of service provided by our Dealer Service Center and sales personnel. 

Customer and Geographic Concentrations 

No single Dealer accounted for more than 10% of total revenues during any of the last three years. Additionally, no single Dealer&#8217;s Loans receivable balance accounted for more than 10% of total Loans receivable balance as of December 31, 2015 &#32;or 2014 . The following tables provide information regarding the five states that were responsible for the largest dollar volume of Consumer Loan assignments and the related number of active Dealers during 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 :

Geographic Financial Information 

For the three years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , all of our revenues were derived from the United States. As of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , all of our long-lived assets were located in the United States. 

Regulation 

Our business is subject to laws and regulations, including the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act and various other state and federal laws and regulations. These laws and regulations, among other things, require licensing and qualification; limit interest rates, fees and other charges associated with the Consumer Loans assigned to us; require specified disclosures by Dealers to consumers; govern the sale and terms of ancillary products; and define the rights to repossess and sell collateral. Failure to comply with these laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on us by, among other things, limiting the jurisdictions in which we may operate, restricting our ability to realize the value of the collateral securing the Consumer Loans, making it more costly or burdensome to do business or resulting in potential liability. The volume of new or modified laws and regulations has increased in recent years and has increased significantly in response to issues arising with respect to consumer lending. From time to time, legislation and regulations are enacted which increase the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among financial services providers. Proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations and taxation of financial institutions and financial services providers are frequently made in the U.S. Congress, in the state legislatures and by various regulatory agencies. This legislation may change our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways and may have a material adverse effect on our business. 

In July 2010 the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) was enacted and a number of its provisions became effective in July 2011. The Dodd-Frank Act restructured and enhanced the regulation and supervision of the financial services industry and created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the &#8220;CFPB&#8221;). The CFPB has rulemaking and enforcement authority over certain non-depository institutions, including us. The CFPB is specifically authorized, among other things, to take actions to prevent companies providing consumer financial products or services and their service providers from engaging in unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with consumer financial products and services, and to issue rules requiring enhanced disclosures for consumer financial products or services. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB also may restrict the use of pre-dispute mandatory arbitration clauses in contracts between covered persons and consumers for a consumer financial product or service. The CFPB also has authority to interpret, enforce and issue regulations implementing enumerated consumer laws, including certain laws that apply to our business. Further, the CFPB has issued rules allowing it to supervise non-depository &#8220;larger participants&#8221; in certain markets for consumer financial services and products. On June 10, 2015, the CFPB released its larger participant rule defining which nonbank automotive finance companies will be subject to supervision. The rule provides that nonbank auto finance companies that make, acquire or refinance 10,000 or more loans or leases in a year will come under CFPB supervision. The rule was officially published in the Federal Register on June 30, 2015, and became effective on August 31, 2015. As expected, we are subject to supervision by the CFPB. 

The Dodd-Frank Act and regulations promulgated thereunder, including by the CFPB, are likely to affect our cost of doing business, may limit or expand our permissible activities, may affect the competitive balance within our industry and market areas and could have a material adverse effect on us. For example, on March 21, 2013, the CFPB issued Bulletin 2013-02 addressing Indirect Auto Lending and Compliance with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, in which the CFPB stated that policies of indirect auto lenders that allow auto dealers to mark up lender-established buy rates and that compensate dealers for those markups in the form of dealer reserve could present a risk that they will result in impermissible pricing disparities on the basis of race, national origin and potentially other prohibited bases. Our management continues to assess the Dodd-Frank Act&#8217;s probable impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and to monitor developments involving the entities charged with promulgating regulations thereunder. However, the ultimate effect of the Dodd-Frank Act on the financial services industry in general, and on us in particular, is uncertain at this time. 

In addition to the CFPB, other state and federal agencies have the ability to regulate aspects of our business. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act provides a mechanism for state Attorneys General to investigate us. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction to investigate aspects of our business. We expect that regulatory investigation by both state and federal agencies will continue and that the results of these investigations could have a material adverse impact on us. 

On December 4, 2014, we received a civil investigative demand from the Office of the Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts relating to the origination and collection of non-prime auto loans in Massachusetts. On December 9, 2014, we received a civil investigative subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice pursuant to the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 directing us to produce certain information relating to subprime automotive finance and related securitization activities. On September 18, 2015, we received a subpoena from the Attorney General of the State of New York, Civil Rights Bureau relating to the Company&#8217;s origination and collection of Consumer Loans in the state of New York. We are cooperating with these inquiries and cannot predict the eventual scopes, durations or outcomes at this time. As a result, we are unable to estimate the reasonably possible losses or range of reasonably possible losses arising from these investigations. We may from time to time become subject to other investigations or regulatory reviews undertaken by governmental authorities. 

In addition, governmental regulations which would deplete the supply of used vehicles, such as environmental protection regulations governing emissions or fuel consumption, could have a material adverse effect on us. 

Our Dealers must also comply with credit and trade practice statutes and regulations. Failure of our Dealers to comply with these statutes and regulations could result in consumers having rights of rescission and other remedies that could have a material adverse effect on us. 

The sale of vehicle service contracts and GAP by Dealers in connection with Consumer Loans assigned to us from Dealers is also subject to state laws and regulations. As we are the holder of the Consumer Loans that may, in part, finance these products, some of these state laws and regulations may apply to our servicing and collection of the Consumer Loans. Although these laws and regulations do not significantly affect our business, there can be no assurance that insurance or other regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which these products are offered by Dealers will not seek to regulate or restrict the operation of our business in these jurisdictions. Any regulation or restriction of our business in these jurisdictions could materially adversely affect the income received from these products. 

We believe that we maintain all material licenses and permits required for our current operations and are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Our agreements with Dealers provide that the Dealer shall indemnify us with respect to any loss or expense we incur as a result of the Dealer&#8217;s failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations. 

Team Members 

Our team members are organized into three operating functions: Originations, Servicing and Support. 

Originations. &#32;The originations function includes team members that are responsible for marketing our programs to prospective Dealers, enrolling new Dealers and supporting active Dealers. Originations also includes team members responsible for processing new Consumer Loan assignments. 

Servicing . The servicing function includes team members that are responsible for servicing the Consumer Loans. The majority of these team members are responsible for collection activities on delinquent Consumer Loans. 

Support . The support function includes team members that are responsible for information technology, finance, corporate legal, quality assurance, analytics, training &#38; development and human resources activities. 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had 1,425 full and part-time team members. Our team members have no union affiliations and we believe our relationship with our team members is in good standing. The table below presents team members by operating function:
