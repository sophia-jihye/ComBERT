On February 28, 2014, Astronics acquired, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Astronics Test Systems, Inc. (&#8220;ATS&#8221;), certain assets and liabilities of EADS North America&#8217;s Test and Services division, located in Irvine, California. ATS is a leading provider of highly engineered automatic test systems, subsystems and instruments for semiconductor and consumer electronics products to both the commercial and defense industries. ATS is included in our Test Systems segment. 

On January 14, 2015, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Armstrong, located in Itasca, Illinois. Armstrong is a leading provider of engineering, design and certification solutions for commercial aircraft, specializing in connectivity, in-flight entertainment, and electrical power systems. Armstrong is included in our Aerospace segment. 

Products and Customers 

Our Aerospace segment designs and manufactures products for the global aerospace industry. Product lines include lighting and safety systems, electrical power generation, distribution and motions systems, aircraft structures, avionics products, systems certification and other products. Our Aerospace customers are the airframe manufacturers ("OEM") that build aircraft for the commercial, military and general aviation markets, suppliers to those OEM&#8217;s, aircraft operators such as airlines and branches of the U.S. Department of Defense as well as the Federal Aviation Administration and airport operators. During 2015 , this segment&#8217;s sales were divided 83% to the commercial transport market, 8% to the military aircraft market, 6% to the business jet market and 3% to other markets. Most of this segment&#8217;s sales are a result of contracts or purchase orders received from customers, placed on a day-to-day basis or for single year procurements rather than long-term multi-year contract commitments. On occasion, the Company does receive contractual commitments or blanket purchase orders from our customers covering multiple-year deliveries of hardware to our customers. 

Our Test Systems segment designs, develops, manufactures and maintains automated test systems that support the semiconductor, aerospace, communications and weapons test systems as well as training and simulation devices for both commercial and military applications. In the Test Systems segment, Astronics&#8217; products are sold to a global customer base including OEMs and prime government contractors for both electronics and military products. During 2015 , this segment&#8217;s sales were divided 65% to the semiconductor market and 35% to the aerospace &#38; defense market. Before the acquisition of ATS in February 2014, this segment&#8217;s sales were all to the military market. 

Sales by segment, geographic region, major customer and foreign operations are provided in Note 18 of Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this report. 

We have a significant concentration of business with three major customers; Panasonic Avionics Corporation (&#8220;Panasonic&#8221;), Apple Inc. (&#8220;Apple&#8221;), and The Boeing Company (&#8220;Boeing&#8221;). Sales to Panasonic accounted for 21.0% of sales in 2015, 17.7% of sales in 2014 and 29.6% of sales in 2013. Sales to Apple accounted for 13.1% of sales in 2015 and 17.9% of sales in 2014. Sales to Boeing accounted for 13.0% of sales in 2015, 14.1% of sales in 2014 and 14.5% of sales in 2013. 

Strategy 

Our strategy is to increase our value by developing technologies and capabilities either internally or through acquisition, and using those capabilities to provide innovative solutions to the aerospace &#38; defense, semiconductor and other markets where our technology can be beneficial. 

Practices as to Maintaining Working Capital 

Liquidity is discussed in Part II, Item 7, Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in the Liquidity section of this report. 

Competitive Conditions 

We experience considerable competition in the market sectors we serve, principally with respect to product performance and price, from various competitors, many of which are substantially larger and have greater resources. Success in the markets we serve depends upon product innovation, customer support, responsiveness and cost management. We continue to invest in developing the technologies and engineering support critical to competing in our markets. 

Government Contracts 

All U.S. government contracts, including subcontracts where the U.S. government is the ultimate customer, may be subject to termination at the election of the government. Our revenue stream relies on military spending. Approximately 14% of our consolidated sales were made to the military aircraft and military test systems markets combined. 

Raw Materials 

Materials, supplies and components are purchased from numerous sources. We believe that the loss of any one source, although potentially disruptive in the short-term, would not materially affect our operations in the long-term. 

Seasonality 

Our business is typically not seasonal. 

Backlog 

At December 31, 2015 , our backlog was $274.4 million. At December 31, 2014, our backlog was $370.7 million. Backlog in the Aerospace segment was $212.7 million at December 31, 2015 , of which $186.8 million is expected to be realized in 2016 . Backlog in the Test Systems segment was $61.7 million at December 31, 2015 , of which $49.3 million is expected to be realized in 2016 . 

Patents 

We have a number of patents. While the aggregate protection of these patents is of value, our only material business that is dependent upon the protection afforded by these patents is our cabin power distribution products. Our patents and patent applications relate to electroluminescence, instrument panels, keyboard technology and a broad patent covering the cabin power distribution technology. We regard our expertise and techniques as proprietary and rely upon trade secret laws and contractual arrangements to protect our rights. We have trademark protection in our major markets. 

Research, Development and Engineering Activities 

We are engaged in a variety of engineering and design activities as well as basic research and development activities directed to the substantial improvement or new application of our existing technologies. These costs are expensed when incurred and included in cost of sales. Research, development and engineering costs amounted to approximately $90.1 million in 2015 , $76.7 million in 2014 &#32;and $52.8 million in 2013 . 

Employees 

We employed approximately 2,300 employees at December 31, 2015 . We consider our relations with our employees to be good. Except for the hourly production workforce at Peco, none of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. 

Stock Distribution 

On September 10, 2015, the Company announced a three-for-twenty &#32;distribution of Class B Stock to holders of both Common and Class B Stock. Stockholders received three &#32;shares of Class B Stock for every twenty &#32;shares of Common and Class B Stock held on the record date of October 8, 2015. Fractional shares were paid in cash. All share quantities, share prices and per share data reported throughout this report have been adjusted to reflect the impact of this distribution.
