Industry and Regulatory Overview 

&#160; 

As of March 14, 2016, 23 states and the District of Columbia allow their citizens to use medical cannabis through de-criminalization. Voters in the States of Oregon, Colorado, Washington, and Alaska have legalized cannabis for adult recreational use; Oregon&#8217;s law took effect on July 1, 2015; Alaska&#8217;s law was effective February 24, 2015; both the Colorado and Washington programs were enacted as of December 31, 2014. In 2016, Nevada California, Vermont, Arizona, Connecticut and Michigan have legislative bills in various stages of progress concerning cannabis legalization.

Additionally, there are active efforts by many advocacy groups seeking to expand the legalization of cannabis, including, but not limited to the Marijuana Policy Project, a leading advocate for major state-level marijuana policy reforms that have resulted in successful efforts to pass 10 of the 15 most recent state medical marijuana laws (in Arizona, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont) and five of the seven most recent decriminalization laws (in Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Vermont).

&#160;

These advocacy groups and others are devoting significant resources to ending prohibition in 12 more states by 2019, including in the States of Arizona, California, Massachusetts, and Nevada, as well as lobbying and building coalitions to regulate marijuana in several states that do not have the option of voter initiatives, including in: Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Texas, and Vermont and are also advocating for medical marijuana-related bills in several other states, including Georgia, Pennsylvania, Texas, and West Virginia.

&#160;

These noted state laws, both proposed and enacted, are in conflict with the federal Controlled Substances Act, which makes cannabis use and possession illegal on a national level. However, on August 29, 2013, the U.S. Department of Justice issued a memorandum providing that where states and local governments enact laws authorizing cannabis-related use, and implement strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems, the federal government will rely upon states and local enforcement agencies to address cannabis activity through the enforcement of their own state and local narcotics laws. The memorandum further stated that the U.S Justice Department&#8217;s limited investigative and prosecutorial resources will be focused on eight priorities to prevent unintended consequences of the state laws, including distribution of cannabis to minors, preventing the distribution of cannabis from states where it is legal to states where it is not, and preventing money laundering, violence and drugged driving.

&#160;

On December 11, 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice issued another memorandum with regard to its position and enforcement protocol with regard to Indian Country, stating that the eight priorities in the previous federal memo would guide the United States Attorneys' cannabis enforcement efforts in Indian Country. On December 16, 2014, as a component of the federal spending bill, the Obama administration enacted regulations that prohibit the Department of Justice from using funds to prosecute state-based legal medical cannabis programs. As of March 9, 2015, in addition to the 23 states and the District of Columbia which had already passed legislation allowing citizens to use cannabis in some form, an additional 13 states had pending legislation or ballot measures to legalize medical cannabis.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; Cannabis Business Planning. Our commercial cannabis business planning services are structured to help those pursuing state based operational licensing to create and implement effective, long-range business plans.

We offer cultivation build-out consulting as part of our Cannabis Business Planning service offerings. We help clients ensure their project timeline is being met, facilities are being designed with compliance and the regulated cannabis industry in mind, and that facilities are built to the highest of quality standards for cannabis production and/or distribution.

Equipment and Supplies 

&#160; 

In addition to professional consulting services, we operate an equipment and supplies division for customers in the cannabis industry, including through American Cultivator CO, our Group Purchasing Organization that enables customers to procure commonly used cultivation supplies at low prices associated with high volume purchases. Our major product offerings include the following: 

&#160; 

&#8226; The Satchel &#8482;. The Satchel was invented in response to regulatory changes in Colorado and elsewhere that require child-proof exit containers. The Satchel is a pouch-like case designed as a high-quality, child-proof exit package solution for the regulated cannabis industry. The Satchel meets child-safety requirements of the Consumer Products Safety Commission (&#8220;CPSC&#8221;), making it compliant in all states. It is also tested and approved by the American Society for Testing and Supplies (&#8220;ASTM&#8221;). There are few products meeting regulatory standards, and even fewer that offer distinctive quality. The Satchel will meet all current exit packaging regulations, featuring a child-proof closure that completely conceals the contents inside. On February 23, 2016 we announced we received notice from the U.S. Patent Office that our claims for the Satchel&#8482; patent application were deemed allowable by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and our patent application for the Satchel&#8482; will now move on to issuance. &#8226; SoHum Living Soil &#8482;. The right grow methodology is critical to the success of any cannabis cultivation operation, and SoHum Living Soil&#8482; is our solution to ensure that our customers can implement an optimal methodology that will maximize quality and yields while simplifying the cultivation process andr educing risk of operator error and test failure. The SoHum medium is a fully amended Just-add-water soil that contains none of the synthetic components found in other potting mixes and requires no chemical additives to spur growth. Compared with comparable methodologies, SoHum Living Soil&#8482; offers a number of key advantages, including: (1) consistent Pyto-pharmaceutical-grade product quality; (2) improved plant resistance to disease; and (3) reduced operator error. &#8226; High Density Racking System. A key metric in the success of a cultivation operation is the maximization of available space to grow. Our High Density Racking System is a solution designed to ensure that space is used in the most efficient manner possible. The system takes advantage of the existence of vertical space, with racks installed vertically and placed on horizontal tracking to eliminate multiple isles and create multiple levels of space with which to grow plants. The High Density Racking System allows customers to increase production capacity without the need to add additional square footage to the operation. &#8226; The Cultivation Cube &#8482;. The Cultivation Cube&#8482; is a self-contained, scalable cultivation system that is compliant with regulatory guidelines. The Cultivation Cube&#8482; allows commercial cannabis cultivation operations to maximize space, yield and profit through an innovative design that provides a fully integrated growing solution. The Cultivation Cube utilizes more lights per square foot than traditional grow systems, which translates to profit increases per square foot. The Cultivation Cube&#8482; is also stackable, which allows customers to achieve vertical gains and effectively doubles productive square-footage. It is an ideal solution for commercial-scale cultivation within limited space, with numerous advantages over other traditional grow systems, including: (1) flexibility to fit customer build-out sites; (2) efficient speed-to-market with fast delivery and set-up; (3) increased security with limited access units; (4) risk mitigation through precision environmental controls; and, (5) is compatible with lean manufacturing principles and operations. &#8226; Other Products . We offer our clients a diverse array of commonly utilized product offerings from across all areas of the regulated cannabis industry, including cultivation operations, medicinal and recreational cannabis dispensary operations, and infused-products. Examples of products available through American Cultivator Co. include HID Ballasts, reflectors, MH and HPS bulbs, T5 fixtures, mediums, nutrients and fertilizers, growing containers, flood tables, reservoirs, and various other supplies, including cleaning products and office supplies. We also offer a Group Purchasing Organization (&#8220;GPO&#8221;) focused on disposables to creates purchasing power by leveraging groups of businesses to obtain discounts from vendors based on the collective buying power of the GPO. &#160; 

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

We sell our services and products throughout the United States in states that have implemented regulated cannabis programs as well as Canada. We intend to expand our offerings as more new countries, states and jurisdictions as they adopt state-regulated or Federal programs. 

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

As a component of our equipment and supplies offerings, from time-to-time we design and develop our own proprietary products to meet demand in markets where current offerings are insufficient. These products include, but are not limited to: the Satchel&#8482;, Cultivation Cube&#8482;, So-Hum Living Soils&#8482; and the HDCS&#8482;. Costs associated with the development of new products are expensed as occurred as research and development operating expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2015, our research and development costs were $51,115 as compared to $12,863 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014. 

&#160; 

Significant Customers 

&#160;

For the year ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, in the aggregate, three customers and two customers, respectively, accounted for 74% and 52% of the Company&#8217;s total revenues for each respective period.

&#160;

On a geographical basis, for the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 91% and 9% of our total revenues were generated from the United States and Canada, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2014, approximately 70% and 30% of our total revenues for the period were generated from the United States and Canada, respectively.

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

On February 23, 2016, we announced that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office informed us that The Satchel&#8482;, our child-proof container invented in response to meet state-mandated regulatory requirements, was deemed allowable, and that our patent application for the Satchel&#8482; will now move on to issuance. We may file for additional patent protection as we deem appropriate to protect new products. We also had trademark applications pending to protect our branding and logos. These pending applications included trademarks for American Cannabis Company (stylized and/or with design logo), American Cannabis Consulting (stylized and/or with design logo), the design and colors used in our leaf logo, the Cultivation Cube (stylized and/or with design logo), our slogan (&#8220;Growing the Next Frontier&#8221;), and two word marks and the logo associated with SoHum Living Soil. 

&#160;

Competition 

&#160; 

Our competitors include professional services firms dedicated to the regulated cannabis industry as well as suppliers of equipment and supplies commonly utilized in the cultivation, processing, or retail sale of cannabis. We compete in markets where cannabis has been legalized and regulated, which includes various states within the United States, it&#8217;s territories and Indian Country therein and Canada. We expect that the quantity and composition of our competitive environment will continue to evolve as the industry matures. Additionally, increased competition is possible to the extent that new states and geographies enter the marketplace as a result of continued enactment of regulatory and legislative changes that de-criminalize and regulate cannabis products. We believe that by being well established in the industry, our experience and success to date, and continued expansion of service and product offerings in new and existing locations are factors that mitigate the risk associated with operating in a developing competitive environment. Additionally, the contemporaneous growth of the industry as a whole will result in new customers entering the marketplace, thereby further mitigating the impact of competition on our operations and results. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we have 9 full-time employees, all of whom are U.S based, primarily in Colorado at our Denver headquarters. None of our U.S employees are represented by a labor union.
