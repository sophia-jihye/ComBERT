 Item 1. Business. 

THE COMPANY 

Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc. (&#8220;Cumberland,&#8221; the &#8220;Company,&#8221; or as used in the context of &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221;), is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the acquisition, development and commercialization of branded prescription products. Our primary target markets are hospital acute care and gastroenterology. These medical specialties are characterized by relatively concentrated prescriber bases that we believe can be penetrated effectively by small, targeted sales forces. Cumberland is dedicated to providing innovative products that improve quality of care for patients and address unmet or poorly met medical needs. We market and sell our approved products through our hospital and gastroenterology sales forces in the United States and are establishing a network of international partners to bring our products to patients in their countries. 

Our product portfolio includes: 

&#8226; 

Acetadote &#174; &#32;( acetylcysteine ) Injection, for the treatment of acetaminophen poisoning; 

&#8226; 

Caldolor &#174; &#32;( ibuprofen ) Injection, for the treatment of pain and fever; recently approved for use in pediatric patients 

&#8226; 

Kristalose &#174; &#32;( lactulose ) for Oral Solution, a prescription laxative, for the treatment of chronic and acute constipation; 

&#8226; 

Omeclamox &#174; -Pak , ( omeprazole, clarithromycin, amoxicillin ) for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori ( H. pylori ) infection and related duodenal ulcer disease; 

&#8226; 

Vaprisol &#174; &#32;( conivaptan ) Injection, to raise serum sodium levels in hospitalized patients with euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia; 

&#8226; 

Hepatoren &#174; &#32;( ifetroban ) Injection, a Phase II candidate for the treatment of critically ill hospitalized patients suffering from liver and kidney failure associated with hepatorenal syndrome ("HRS"); and 

&#8226; 

Boxaban &#174; &#32; (ifetroban) oral capsules, a Phase II candidate for the treatment of patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD). 

We have both product development and commercial capabilities, and believe we can leverage our existing infrastructure to support our expected growth. Our management team consists of pharmaceutical industry veterans experienced in business development, product development, regulatory, manufacturing, sales, marketing and finance. Our business development team identifies, evaluates and negotiates product acquisition, in-licensing and out-licensing opportunities. Our product development team develops proprietary product formulations, manages our clinical trials, prepares all regulatory submissions and manages our medical call center. Our quality and manufacturing professionals oversee the manufacture and release of our products. Our marketing and sales professionals are responsible for our commercial activities, and we work closely with our distribution partners to ensure availability and delivery of our products. 

Cumberland's growth strategy involves maximizing the potential of our existing brands while continuing to build a portfolio of differentiated products. We currently market five products approved for sale in the United States. Through our international partners, we are working to bring our products to patients in countries outside the U.S. We also look for opportunities to expand our products into additional patient populations through clinical trials, new indications, and select investigator-initiated studies. We actively pursue opportunities to acquire additional marketed products as well as late-stage development product candidates in our target medical specialties. Further, we are supplementing these activities with the pipeline drug development activities at Cumberland Emerging Technologies ("CET"), our majority-owned subsidiary. CET partners with universities and other research organizations to identify and develop promising, early-stage product candidates, which Cumberland has the opportunity to further develop and commercialize. 

We were incorporated in 1999 and have been headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee since inception. During 2009, we completed an initial public offering of our common stock and listing on the NASDAQ exchange. Our website address is www.cumberlandpharma.com . We make available through our website our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and all other press releases, filings and amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after their filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, (&#8220;SEC&#8221;). These filings are also available to the public at www.sec.gov.

Acetadote 

Acetadote &#32; is an intravenous formulation of N-acetylcysteine, or ("NAC"), indicated for the treatment of acetaminophen poisoning. Acetadote, has been available in the United States since Cumberland's 2004 introduction of the product through our hospital sales force. Acetadote is typically used in hospital emergency departments to prevent or lessen potential liver damage resulting from an overdose of acetaminophen, a common ingredient in many over-the-counter and prescription pain relieving and fever-reducing products. Acetaminophen continues to be the leading cause of poisonings reported by hospital emergency departments in the United States, and Acetadote has become a standard of care for treating this potentially life-threatening condition. 

Acetadote received U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") approval as an orphan drug, which provided seven years of marketing exclusivity from the date of approval. In connection with the FDA's approval of Acetadote, we committed to certain post-marketing activities for the product. Completion of our first Phase IV commitment resulted in the FDA's 2006 approval of expanded labeling for the product for use in pediatric patients. Completion of our second Phase IV commitment in 2006 resulted in further revised labeling for the product with FDA approval of additional safety data in 2008. Completion of our third and final Phase IV commitment in 2010 culminated in the FDA&#8217;s approval of a new formulation for the product. The next generation formulation, contains no ethylene diamine tetracetic acid ("EDTA") or other stabilization agent, chelating agent or preservative. In early 2011, Cumberland introduced this new Acetadote formulation replacing the original formulation which we no longer manufacture. 

In June 2013, the FDA approved updated labeling for Acetadote revising the product's indication and providing new dosing guidance for specific patient populations. As a result, dosing guidance is now included for patients weighing over 100 kg and new language has been added to alert health care providers that in certain clinical situations, therapy should be extended for some patients. 

Beginning in 2012, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (the "USPTO") issued us a series of patents associated with our Acetadote product. These patents are discussed in Part I, Item I, " Business - Trademarks and Patents " of this Form 10-K. On November 8, 2012, we learned that the FDA approved an abbreviated new drug 

application (ANDA) filed by InnoPharma, Inc. and referencing Acetadote. That product, with the old formulation containing EDTA, was subsequently introduced by APP, a division of Fresenius Kabi USA, at the end of 2012. In early 2013, we entered into an agreement with Perrigo Company resulting in the distribution of our Authorized Generic acetylcysteine injection (the "Authorized Generic") product. Both Acetadote and our Authorized Generic utilize the new, EDTA-free formulation which accounted for continued significant market share during 2015. We are seeking additional claims to protect our intellectual property associated with Acetadote through patent applications which are pending with the USPTO. 

In November 2015, an Illinois judge issued a final ruling in favor of Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc. in a patent case associated with Acetadote. By ruling in Cumberland's favor, the court upheld the validity of the patent which encompasses our EDTA-Free formulation and has a term until August 2025. The court also granted a permanent injunction preventing challengers from marketing a generic version of our Acetadote product before the expiration of Cumberland&#8217;s patent in August 2025. 

Caldolor 

Caldolor, &#32; our intravenous formulation of ibuprofen, was the first injectable product approved in the United States for the treatment of both pain and fever. We conducted a series of clinical studies in over nine hundred adult patients to develop the data to support our submission for FDA approval. The FDA approved Caldolor for marketing in the United States during the middle portion of 2009 following a priority review. The product is indicated for use by adults and pediatric patients six months and older for the management of mild to moderate pain and the management of moderate to severe pain as an adjunct to opioid analgesics, as well as the reduction of fever. It was the first FDA-approved intravenous therapy for fever. At December 31, 2015, Caldolor has been purchased by over 1,300 health care facilities in the United States. 

In late 2009, we launched Caldolor and stocked the product at major wholesalers serving hospitals nationwide. We initially worked to establish a core group of medical facilities approving and purchasing the product and then focused on building more sales volume and treating a broader range of patients within those stocked facilities. We promote Caldolor in the United States through our dedicated hospital sales force. 

We completed a series of Phase IV studies to gather additional data to support our Caldolor product. Those completed studies involved another 1,000 patients. The studies included evaluation of the product for the treatment of pediatric pain and pediatric fever in order to address our Phase IV commitment to the FDA for Caldolor. Also included in these studies was an evaluation of a shortened infusion time for the product and pre-surgical administration. The data from these Phase IV studies, including an updated integrated safety database, was submitted to the FDA in early 2015 with a request for updated labeling for the product. In late 2015, we received FDA approval of Caldolor for use in pediatric patients six months of age and older. Caldolor is the first and only injectable non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) approved for use in pediatric patients. Caldolor&#8217;s pediatric approval came after the FDA&#8217;s review of safety and efficacy data from clinical trials in hospitalized febrile children and in children undergoing tonsillectomy surgery. We also continue to pursue and evaluate potential improvements to the product&#8217;s packaging. 

Kristalose 

Kristalose is a prescription laxative administered orally for the treatment of acute and chronic constipation. An innovative, dry powder crystalline formulation of lactulose, Kristalose is designed to enhance patient compliance and acceptance. Kristalose is the only prescription laxative available in pre-measured powder packets. Kristalose dissolves easily in four ounces of water, offering patients a virtually taste-free, grit-free and essentially calorie-free alternative to lactulose syrups. We conducted a preference study which indicated that seventy seven percent of patients surveyed prefer the taste, consistency and portability of Kristalose over similar products in syrup forms. 

We acquired exclusive U.S. commercialization rights to Kristalose in 2006, assembled a dedicated field sales force and re-launched the product in September 2006 as a Cumberland brand. We direct our sales efforts to physicians who are the most prolific writers of prescription laxatives, including gastroenterologists and internists. Using the preference data as a cornerstone of our marketing efforts, we have made significant gains following our repositioning of the brand 

in early 2014. The new marketing strategy includes an enhanced patient coupon program and expanded managed care coverage for the product. 

In late 2011, through a series of transactions, we entered into an agreement with Mylan Inc. to acquire certain assets associated with the Kristalose brand including the Kristalose trademark and the FDA registration. During 2014, we also entered into a long-term supply agreement and new packaging agreements for the product. By entering into these transactions, we streamlined the supply chain for the product and are exploring opportunities to further develop the brand. 

Omeclamox-Pak 

We launched our promotion and distribution efforts to support Omeclamox-Pak in early 2014. Our field sales force promotes Omeclamox-Pak to the gastroenterologist segment, which accounts for the largest component of the prescriber base for this product. Omeclamox-Pak is a branded prescription product used for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and duodenal ulcer disease. This innovative product combines three well-known and widely prescribed medications: omeprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin. Omeclamox-Pak is the first FDA approved triple therapy combination medication to contain omeprazole as the proton pump inhibitor, which works to decrease the amount of acid the stomach produces. Clarithromycin and amoxicillin are both antibiotic agents which hinder the growth of H. pylori. Interaction of these agents allows the stomach lining to heal effectively. The medications are packaged together on convenient daily dosing cards, making it simple to follow the twice a day dosing before meals. 

While there are competing products, Omeclamox-Pak is one of the few actively marketed products for this condition. In addition, compared to the competing branded products, Omeclamox-Pak combines the lowest pill burden and fewest days of therapy. Our involvement with Omeclamox-Pak began in October 2013, through an agreement with Pernix Therapeutics ("Pernix"). In November 2015, Cumberland entered into an exclusive license and supply agreement with Gastro-Entero Logic, LLC (&#8220;GEL&#8221;) and assumed full commercial responsibility for Omeclamox-Pak in the United States and terminated our Agreement with Pernix. Cumberland is now responsible for the supply chain, national accounts and all sales promotion of Omeclamox-Pak as part of the GEL agreement. Cumberland will also now seek a new co-promotion partner to support the product with primary care physicians. 

Vaprisol 

In early 2014, we entered into an agreement with Astellas Pharma US, Inc. ("Astellas") to acquire Vaprisol, including certain product rights, intellectual property and related assets. Vaprisol is a patented, prescription brand indicated to raise serum sodium levels in hospitalized patients with euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. The product was developed and registered by Astellas and then launched in 2006. It is one of two branded prescription products indicated for the treatment of hyponatremia, and the only intravenously administered branded treatment. 

Hyponatremia, an imbalance of serum sodium to body water, is the most common electrolyte disorder among hospitalized patients. These electrolyte disturbances occur when the sodium ion concentration in the plasma is lower than normal and are often associated with a variety of critical care conditions including congestive heart failure, liver failure, kidney failure and pneumonia. Vaprisol raises serum sodium to appropriate levels and promotes free water secretion. 

We re-launched active promotion of the brand during the middle of 2014 utilizing our hospital sales force, which also features our Caldolor and Acetadote products. 

Hepatoren 

In 2011, we entered into an agreement to acquire the rights to ifetroban, a new Phase II product candidate. Our acquisition of the rights to the ifetroban program includes an extensive clinical database and non-clinical data package as well as manufacturing processes, know-how and intellectual property. Ifetroban was initially developed by a large pharmaceutical company for significant cardiovascular indications. They conducted extensive studies for their target indications and eventually donated the entire program to Vanderbilt University. Researchers at Vanderbilt identified ifetroban as a potentially valuable compound in treating patients for several niche indications. We acquired the rights to the ifetroban program from Vanderbilt through CET and intend to develop the product for several potential indications. 

We have commenced manufacturing of an intravenous formulation of ifetroban and the FDA has cleared our IND application for this product candidate. We have initiated clinical development under the brand name Hepatoren ( ifetroban ) Injection and are evaluating this candidate for the treatment of critically ill hospitalized patients suffering from hepatorenal syndrome ("HRS"), a life-threatening condition involving progressive kidney failure for which there is no U.S. approved pharmaceutical treatment. We would also seek orphan drug status and the associated seven years of marketing exclusivity for this indication. 

Boxaban 

We have also completed the manufacturing of an oral formulation of ifetroban and the FDA has cleared an IND amendment for this product candidate. We have initiated clinical development under the brand name Boxaban ( ifetroban ) capsules and are evaluating this candidate for patients suffering from aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) a condition for which there is no U.S. approved pharmaceutical treatment. Also known as Samter&#8217;s Triad, AERD is a respiratory disease involving chronic asthma and nasal polyposis that is worsened by aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Approximately one in twenty asthmatic adults in the U.S. suffer from AERD and awareness of the disease is growing within the medical community. 

OUR STRATEGY 

Continue to build a high-performance sales organization to address our target markets 

We believe that our commercial infrastructure can help drive prescription volume and product sales. We currently utilize two distinct sales teams to address our primary target markets: a hospital sales force for the acute care market and a field sales force for the gastroenterology market. We believe that active promotion of our products, supported by non-personal promotional activities developed and implemented by our marketing team, can maximize the opportunity for our brands. 

Further develop our existing products and develop new late stage product candidates 

We continue to evaluate our products following FDA approval to determine if further clinical work could expand the potential market opportunities for our products and help new patient populations. In addition, we may explore further clinical work that could be used to support our sales and marketing activities and maximize their efforts to further penetrate existing markets. Our clinical team is also working to develop late stage product candidates that could further expand our product portfolio if approved by the FDA. 

Expand our product portfolio by acquiring rights to additional products and late-stage product candidates 

In addition to our product development activities, we are also seeking to acquire products or late-stage development product candidates to continue to build a portfolio of complementary brands. We focus on under-promoted, FDA-approved drugs as well as late-stage development products that address poorly met medical needs. We plan to continue to target product acquisition candidates that are competitively differentiated, have valuable intellectual property or other protective features, and allow us to leverage our existing infrastructure. We will also continue to explore opportunities for label expansion to bring our products to new patient populations. The Caldolor pediatric approval reflects our successful implementation of this strategy. 

Expand our global presence through select international partnerships 

We have established our own commercial capabilities, including a sales organization to cover the U.S. market for our products. We are building a network of select international partners to register our products and make them available to patients in their countries. We will continue to expand our network of international partners and continue to support our partners&#8217; registration and commercialization efforts in their respective territories. The 2015 launch of Caldolor in Australia by Seqirus is an example of our international partnerships. 

Develop a pipeline of early-stage products through CET 

In order to build our product pipeline, we are supplementing our acquisition and late-stage development activities with the early-stage drug development activities at CET. CET partners with universities and other research organizations 

to develop promising, early-stage product candidates, and Cumberland has the opportunity to negotiate rights to further develop and commercialize them in the U.S and other markets. 

SALES AND MARKETING 

Our sales and marketing team has broad industry experience in selling branded pharmaceuticals. Our sales and marketing professionals manage our dedicated hospital and gastroenterology sales forces, including approximately 50 sales representatives and district managers, direct our national marketing campaigns and maintain key national account relationships. 

Hospital market: &#32;&#32;We promote Caldolor, Vaprisol and Acetadote through our dedicated hospital sales team. This team targets key hospitals across the U.S. and is comprised of sales professionals with substantial experience in the hospital market. Outside market data continues to indicate that the majority of pharmaceutical promotional spending is directed toward large, outpatient markets on drugs intended for chronic use rather than short-term, hospital use. We believe the hospital market is under-served and highly concentrated, and that it can be penetrated effectively by a small, dedicated sales force without large-scale promotional activity. Our position within the acute care market and existing hospital sales team provided the rationale for adding Vaprisol as a third acute care product. Our strategy has been to increase the focus of our hospital sales team on targeted, high priority accounts. 

In November 2015 we announced a co-promotion agreement with Piramal Critical Care ("Piramal"). Through this agreement, Piramal co-promotes two of Cumberland&#8217;s branded hospital products, Caldolor and Vaprisol throughout the United States. Piramal will help expand Cumberland&#8217;s reach for these products by providing coverage to an additional group of hospitals where Piramal&#8217;s critical care sales force has existing relationships. Cumberland will maintain its promotional efforts supporting the products, continue its focus on its existing group of medical centers across the United States and continue to provide the marketing, national accounts, distribution, and medical support for the brands. The multi-year collaboration will provide expanded sales promotion for the two brands, increased communication to medical professionals and enhanced availability of the products to support patient care. 

Gastroenterology market: &#32;&#32;We promote Kristalose and Omeclamox-Pak through a dedicated field sales team addressing a targeted group of physicians who are large prescribers of both products. Because the market for gastrointestinal diseases is broad in patient scope, yet relatively narrow in physician base, we believe it provides product opportunities that can be penetrated with a modest sized sales force. By investing in our sales and marketing activities we believe that we can increase market share for both products. Our focus on the gastroenterology market and our existing field sales infrastructure provided us with the rationale to add Omeclamox-Pak. Our field sales force now features both Kristalose and Omeclamox-Pak during most of their physician calls, expanding our presence in the gastroenterology market. 

Our sales and marketing executives conduct ongoing market analysis to evaluate marketing campaigns and promotional programs. The evaluations include development of product profiles, testing of the profiles against the needs of the market, determining what additional product information or development work is needed to effectively market the products and preparing financial forecasts. We utilize professional branding and packaging as well as promotional items to support our products, including direct mail, sales brochures, journal advertising, educational and reminder leave-behinds, patient educational pieces and product sampling. We also regularly attend targeted trade shows to promote broad awareness of our products. Our national accounts group is responsible for key large buyers and related marketing programs. This group supports sales and marketing efforts by maintaining relationships with our wholesaler customers as well as with third-party payors such as group purchasing organizations, pharmacy benefit managers, hospital buying groups, state and federal government purchasers and health insurance companies. 

INTERNATIONAL PARTNERSHIPS 

We have established our own capabilities to support the commercialization of our products in the U.S. Our international strategy is to identify and partner with other companies that have the appropriate capabilities to support our products in their respective countries. We have entered into a series of agreements to establish a network, which is summarized in the table below, which includes information on the company, licensed product, territory and status:

CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT 

Caldolor Approved for Pediatric Use 

During November 2015, Caldolor received FDA approval for use in pediatric patients six months and older for management of pain and reduction of fever. The approval was based on data submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as part of a post-marketing commitment following approval of Caldolor in adults in 2009. Caldolor is the first and only injectable non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) approved for use in pediatric patients. 

Caldolor&#8217;s pediatric approval came after the FDA&#8217;s review of safety and efficacy data from clinical trials in hospitalized febrile children and in children undergoing tonsillectomy surgery. The pivotal fever study demonstrated a statistically significant greater reduction in temperature for patients receiving Caldolor, as compared to acetaminophen. Seventy-four percent of Caldolor treated patients became afebrile by the end of the first dosing interval. A total of 143 pediatric patients, ages six months and older, have received Caldolor in controlled clinical trials. The most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 2%) in pediatric patients treated with Caldolor were infusion site pain, vomiting, nausea, anemia and headache. 

The recommended dosing for pediatric patients ages six months to twelve years of age is 10 mg/kg up to a maximum single dose of 400 mg Caldolor every four to six hours as necessary. For patients ages twelve to seventeen years of age, the recommended dosing is 400 mg of Caldolor every four to six hours as necessary for management of pain and/or reduction of fever. The product is diluted and administered intravenously over a ten minute infusion and the maximum daily dose in pediatric patients is 2,400 mg. 

Caldolor Safety Summary 

Extensive use and worldwide literature support the strong safety profile of oral ibuprofen. Building on the oral safety profile, we have assembled an integrated intravenous ibuprofen safety database combining data from our clinical trials as well as previously published study data. We used this data to support our NDA filing and continue to use and update the data as a part of our ongoing safety evaluation. We continue to use this data in our marketing materials and to support our sales force in promoting Caldolor. 

In clinical trials supporting our proposed indications, the number and percentage of all patients in pivotal studies who reported treatment emergent adverse events was comparable between IV ibuprofen and placebo treatment groups. Additionally, there have been no safety related differences between Caldolor and placebo involving side effects sometimes observed with oral Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs ("NSAIDs"), such as changes in renal function, bleeding events or gastrointestinal disorders. 

Publication of Caldolor Shortened Infusion Time Studies 

In January 2015, Clinical Therapeutics, The International Peer-Reviewed Journal of Drug Therapy , published two articles with data from two Caldolor ( ibuprofen ) registry studies. One study entitled, " A Multicenter, Open-Label, Surgical Surveillance Trial to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy" &#32;provided for eligible enrolled patients to receive one of two dose strengths (400 mg for treatment of fever, 800 mg for treatment of pain) of intravenous ibuprofen for up to a 24-hour dosing period. One hundred fifty patients from thirteen clinical sites were enrolled in this study. Intravenous ibuprofen reduced fever and pain and the shortened infusion time was well tolerated. 

The other registry study entitled "A Multicenter, Open-Label, Surgical Surveillance Trial to Evaluate Safety" &#32; was a Phase IV multi-center, open-label surveillance clinical study to assess the safety of ibuprofen administered intravenously over five to ten minutes to adult hospitalized patients undergoing surgical procedures. Eligible patients were enrolled to receive 800 mg of intravenous ibuprofen administered at induction of anesthesia and could continue Caldolor therapy for up to 24 hours. Three hundred patients from twenty one clinical sites were enrolled in this study. The shortened infusion time was well tolerated. 

Publication of Caldolor Integrated Safety Analysis 

In October 2015 there was a publication of an integrated safety analysis adding to the growing body of literature that support the safety of Caldolor. &#160; The data in this cumulative safety analysis is derived from ten sponsored clinical studies investigating intravenous ibuprofen for the treatment of pain and/or fever in adult patients. Over 1,750 adult patients have been included in safety and efficacy trials over eleven years. The publication is available as an open access article in the Journal of Pain Research . 

&#32;The incidence of adverse events, changes in vital signs and clinically significant laboratory parameters were summarized and compared to patients receiving placebo or active comparator drug. Patients receiving Caldolor required less morphine and experienced fewer adverse events relative to those who received placebo with morphine rescue. Results from the integrated analysis continue to demonstrate the safety of Caldolor, supporting its use in hospitalized patients. 

Caldolor Label Safety Update 

In July 2015, the FDA decided to strengthen the existing cardiovascular warning for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). This is a class label change for all NSAIDs including over-the-counter and prescription products. It was previously thought that all NSAIDs may have similar cardiovascular risks. While newer information makes it less clear that the cardiovascular risks are similar for all NSAIDs, this information is not sufficient for the FDA to determine that the risk of any particular NSAID is definitely higher or lower than that of any other particular 

NSAID. While we have not seen a cardiovascular side effect in our extensive Caldolor safety database, we will update our Caldolor label for this requested information once it becomes finalized by the FDA. 

Caldolor Continuing Education 

We have extended the availability of a web-based, accredited, continuing education seminar featuring the benefits of preoperative use of Caldolor in the hospital setting. The seminar has been distributed to over 60,000 health providers with a growing number of participants completing the seminar for continuing education credit. 

Hepatoren Top Line Study Results 

We are developing Hepatoren as a potential treatment for Hepatorenal Syndrome ("HRS") - a life threatening condition, with a high mortality rate and no approved pharmaceutical therapy in this country. We initiated a sixty four patient Phase II study to evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of Hepatoren for this unmet medical need. 

The study was designed to evaluate escalating dose levels of Hepatoren in HRS patients. Progression to higher dose levels is reviewed and approved by an independent safety committee. The study was stratified into Type I or Type II patients with HRS based upon the progression of their disease. 

We completed the enrollment of Type II patients at the end of 2014. Top line results from these patients indicate that Hepatoren was overall well tolerated with no safety concerns noted. Furthermore, the patients receiving the higher dose levels of Hepatoren were more likely to experience increases in urine output, a signal of improved kidney function, compared to patients who received placebo. Based on these results, we will proceed with clinical development of this product candidate. 

We subsequently completed enrollment of the Type I patients during the third quarter of 2015 and the analysis of those patient results is underway. 

Boxaban Phase II Program 

During 2015, Cumberland announced an expansion of its pipeline with another Phase II development program. The Company is developing Boxaban for the treatment of Aspirin-Exacerbated Respiratory Disease ("AERD"). AERD is a respiratory disease involving chronic asthma and nasal polyposis that is worsened by aspirin. It is characterized by sharp increases in inflammatory mediators and platelet activity within the respiratory system. Ifetroban, an active thromboxane receptor antagonist, may interfere with these pathways to modify the disease and provide symptomatic relief. 

Cumberland completed manufacturing of Boxaban oral capsules and initiated a Phase II clinical study to evaluate Boxaban in patients suffering AERD. The study was designed to gather initial safety and tolerability data on ifetroban in AERD patients. It was a multicenter study of sixteen patients with enrollment at several U.S. medical centers including the Scripps Clinic. The enrollment in this study was recently completed and top line results indicate that no adverse events were experienced by patients receiving Boxaban when compared to those receiving placebo. Further analysis of the full data set obtained from the study is underway. 

BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT 

Since inception, we have had an active business development program focused on acquiring rights to marketed products and product candidates that fit our strategy and target markets. We source business development opportunities through our international network of advisory firms and individual pharmaceutical industry and medical advisors. A multi-disciplinary internal management team reviews these opportunities on a regular basis using a list of selection criteria. We have historically focused on product opportunities that are a strategic fit with our commercial organization, development expertise and medical focus, employing a variety of transaction structures. Our additions of Omeclamox-Pak and Vaprisol reflect our business development process and follow our selection criteria. 

We intend to continue to build a portfolio of complementary, niche products largely through product acquisitions and late-stage product development. Our primary targets are under-promoted, FDA-approved drugs with existing brand recognition and late-stage development product candidates that address unmet or poorly met medical needs in the 

hospital acute care and gastroenterology markets. We believe that by focusing mainly on approved or late-stage products, we can minimize the significant risk, cost and time associated with drug development. 

Clinigen Strategic Alliance 

In September 2015, we announced our strategic alliance with Clinigen Group plc (AIM: CLIN) ("Clinigen"), a global pharmaceutical and services company. Clinigen is a specialty pharmaceutical and services company focused on providing medicines to patients with high unmet needs through clinical trials, licensed and ethically unlicensed supply. 

The alliance will combine the respective strengths, expertise and geographical footprints of Cumberland and Clinigen with respect to potential future products. Under the agreement, we will have the opportunity to support Clinigen products through distribution, marketing and promotion within the United States. Clinigen will be responsible for the marketing, promotion, distribution and sale of our pharmaceutical products in select markets outside of the United States, allowing us to use Clinigen&#8217;s international reach to enter new markets for our products. During 2016 we entered into an amendment to this strategic alliance agreement that outlines the support Cumberland will provide to one of Clinigen's product in the United States. Cumberland expects to launch the support for the Clinigen product during the second half of 2016. 

CET Collaboration 

Through CET, we collaborate with a select group of academic research institutions located in the mid-south region of the U.S. Our business development team is responsible for identifying appropriate CET product candidates and negotiating with our university partners to secure rights to these candidates. Although we believe that these collaborations may be important to our business in the future, they are not material to our business at this time. 

CET currently has five collaboration agreements with Universities to co-develop promising biomedical technologies, including: Vanderbilt University, Washington University, the University of Virginia, the University of Tennessee and the University of Mississippi. 

These agreements allow us to play an important role in fostering and shaping early-stage biomedical research to improve patient care and provide CET and Cumberland with access to promising pipeline candidates such as Hepatoren and Boxaban. 

CET Financing 

In 2014, we organized an equity financing to recapitalize and strengthen the financial position of CET. This financing included an investment of approximately $1.0 million from Harbin Gloria Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Gloria&#8221;) for their participation in CET. As a result, Gloria received shares in CET and joined the CET ownership group. As part of this transaction, Gloria will have the first right to negotiate a license to CET developed products for the Chinese market. The funds from this new investment are being used to support and accelerate the development of CET product candidates. CET&#8217;s lead product candidate is ifetroban which is being developed by Cumberland under the brand names Hepatoren and Boxaban. 

Prior to April 2014, we owned 85% of CET, with the balance of the enterprise owned by Vanderbilt University and the Tennessee Technology Development Corporation. In connection with Gloria&#8217;s investment in CET, we also provided an additional investment in CET of $1.0 million in cash and $2.4 million in loan forgiveness. Upon completion of the additional investment by Gloria and Cumberland in April 2014, we held an 80% ownership in CET. 

MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION 

We partner with third parties for certain non-core, capital-intensive functions, including manufacturing and distribution. Our executives are experienced in these areas and manage these third-party relationships with a focus on quality assurance and timely delivery. 

Manufacturing 

Our key manufacturing relationships include: 

Caldolor 

&#8226; 

We initiated the manufacturing of Caldolor at two facilities during 2015. Both manufacturers have provided supplies of Caldolor for our international markets. During 2015, we began the process of securing two manufacturers for commercial supply of Caldolor for the United States. All four manufacturers are expected to provide commercial supplies of the product in 2016. 

Acetadote 

&#8226; 

During the fourth quarter of 2014, we entered into an agreement with a U.S. based manufacturer to supply our Acetadote product. We transferred the Acetadote manufacturing process to this supplier, received FDA clearance and began receiving commercial units from this facility during 2015. 

Kristalose 

&#8226; 

We have an agreement for the purchase of Kristalose API with an international supplier. This written agreement formalized and extended our existing relationship with this raw materials supplier. We also have manufacturing relationships with two Kristalose packagers. Under these agreements, we provide Kristalose API to these manufactures and they package the API (for both commercial sale and samples) into 10 gram and 20 gram finished product units for our purchase and distribution. 

Omeclamox-Pak 

&#8226; 

Under the previous agreement, Pernix, was responsible for providing us with the supply of Omeclamox-Pak. Based on our new agreement with GEL, effective in November 2015, Cumberland assumed supply chain responsibilities and now works directly with GEL for the manufacture, packaging and supply of Omeclamox-Pak commercial and sample units. 

Vaprisol 

&#8226; 

As part of the acquisition of Vaprisol, we purchased an existing supply of raw material inventory. In addition, as part of this transaction, we were assigned a commercial supply agreement with the existing manufacturer who provided supplies of Vaprisol. That manufacturer continues to supply commercial inventory to Cumberland under this agreement. 

Distribution 

Like many other pharmaceutical companies, we engage a third party contractor with appropriate facilities and logistical expertise to support our distribution efforts. Since August 2002, Cardinal Health ("Cardinal") has exclusively handled U.S. product logistics efforts, including warehousing, shipping, customer billing and collections. 

We extended our distribution relationship with Cardinal during May 2013, when we entered into the First Amendment ("First Amendment") to the Exclusive Distribution Agreement under which we have operated since August 2010. The Amendment primarily serves to extend the term of the Agreement through June 30, 2016 and revises the fee schedule under the Agreement. Under the Amendment, we have also engaged Cardinal to assist with our physician sample orders based on the Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 (the &#8220;PDMA&#8221;) for samples shipping. After June 30, 2016, the contract is automatically renewed on a year-to-year basis that is terminable by either party with ninety days' notice. Under the Amendment and Agreement, Cardinal agrees to provide various services, including storage, distribution, returns, customer support, and system access support to us in connection with the distribution of our products under certain guidelines at established fees. 

TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS 

We own all the trademarks for each of our branded pharmaceutical products as well as for our corporate name and logo. We have applied for trademark registration for various other names and logos. Over time, we intend to maintain registrations on trademarks that remain valuable to our business. 

We seek to protect our products from competition through a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, FDA exclusivity and contractual restrictions on disclosure. Proprietary rights, including patents, are an important element of our business. We seek to protect our proprietary information by requiring our employees, consultants, contractors and other advisors to execute agreements providing for protection of our confidential information upon 

commencement of their employment or engagement. We also require confidentiality agreements from entities that receive our confidential data or materials. 

Acetadote and related litigation 

We developed a new formulation of Acetadote (acetylcysteine) Injection as part of a Phase IV commitment in response to a request by the FDA to evaluate the reduction of EDTA from the product's formulation. In April 2012, the USPTO issued U.S. Patent number 8,148,356 (the &#8220;356 Acetadote Patent&#8221;) which is assigned to us. The claims of the 356 Acetadote Patent encompasses the Acetadote formulation and includes composition of matter claims. Following its issuance, the 356 Acetadote Patent was listed in the FDA Orange Book. The 356 Acetadote Patent is scheduled to expire in May 2026, which time period includes a 270-day patent term adjustment granted by the USPTO. 

Following the issuance of the 356 Acetadote Patent, we received separate Paragraph IV certification notices from InnoPharma, Inc. ("InnoPharma"), Paddock Laboratories, LLC (&#8220;Paddock&#8221;), Mylan Institutional LLC (&#8220;Mylan&#8221;), Sagent Agila LLC ("Sagent") and Perrigo Company ("Perrigo") challenging the 356 Acetadote Patent on the basis of non-infringement and/or invalidity. We responded by filing five separate infringement lawsuits, in the appropriate United States District Courts, to contest each of the challenges. 

On November 12, 2012, we entered into a Settlement Agreement (the &#8220;Settlement Agreement&#8221;) with Paddock and Perrigo to resolve the challenges and the pending litigation with those two companies. On November 1, 2013, the United States District Court filed opinions granting Sagent&#8217;s and InnoPharma&#8217;s motions to dismiss our suits and we agreed not to file an appeal or motion to reconsider, thereby resolving the challenges and the pending litigation with those two companies. 

Under the Settlement Agreement, Paddock and Perrigo admit that the 356 Acetadote Patent is valid and enforceable and that any Paddock or Perrigo generic Acetadote product (with or without EDTA) would infringe upon the 356 Acetadote Patent. In addition, Paddock and Perrigo will not challenge the validity, enforceability, ownership or patentability of the 356 Acetadote Patent through its expiration currently scheduled for May 2026. On November 12, 2012, in connection with the execution of the Settlement Agreement, we entered into a License and Supply Agreement with Paddock and Perrigo (the &#8220;License and Supply Agreement&#8221;). Under the terms of the License and Supply Agreement, once a third party receives final approval from the FDA for an ANDA to sell a generic Acetadote product and such third party made such generic version available for purchase in commercial quantities in the United States, we supply Perrigo with an Authorized Generic version of our Acetadote product. 

On May 18, 2012, we also submitted a Citizen Petition to the FDA requesting that the FDA refrain from approving any applications for acetylcysteine injection that contain EDTA, based in part on the FDA's request that we evaluate the reduction or removal of EDTA from its original Acetadote formulation. On November 7, 2012, the FDA responded to the Citizen Petition denying our request and on November 8, 2012, we learned that the FDA approved the ANDA referencing Acetadote filed by InnoPharma, Inc. We brought suit against the FDA contesting the FDA's decision to approve the InnoPharma generic on November 13, 2012. On September 30, 2013, the United States District Court filed an opinion granting a summary judgment in favor of the FDA regarding this suit. 

As noted above, during 2012 the FDA approved the ANDA referencing Acetadote filed by InnoPharma, Inc. Upon this condition, in accordance with the License and Supply agreement with Perrigo, we began to supply Perrigo with our Authorized Generic. On January 7, 2013, Perrigo announced initial distribution of our Authorized Generic acetylcysteine injection product. 

On March 19, 2013, the USPTO issued U.S. Patent number 8,399,445 (the &#8220;445 Acetadote Patent&#8221;) which is assigned to us. The claims of the 445 Acetadote Patent encompass the use of the 200 mg/ml Acetadote formulation to treat patients with acetaminophen overdose. On April 8, 2013, the 445 Acetadote Patent was listed in the FDA Orange Book. The 445 Acetadote Patent is scheduled to expire in August 2025. Following the issuance of the 445 Acetadote Patent we received separate Paragraph IV certification notices from Perrigo, Sagent Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Mylan challenging the 445 Acetadote Patent on the basis of non-infringement, unenforceability and/or invalidity. 

On June 10, 2013, we became aware of a Paragraph IV certification notice from Akorn, Inc. challenging the 445 Acetadote Patent and the 356 Acetadote Patent on the basis of non-infringement. On July 12, 2013, we filed a lawsuit for infringement of the 356 Acetadote Patent against Akorn, Inc. in United States District Court. 

On February18, 2014, the USPTO issued U.S. Patent number 8,653,061 (the &#8220;061 Acetadote Patent&#8221;) which is assigned to the Company. The claims of the 061 Acetadote Patent encompass the use of the 200 mg/ml Acetadote formulation to treat patients with acetaminophen overdose. Following its issuance, the 061 Acetadote Patent was listed in the FDA Orange Book. The 061 Acetadote Patent is scheduled to expire in August 2025. 

On May 13, 2014, the USPTO issued U.S. Patent number 8,722,738 (the &#8220;738 Acetadote Patent&#8221;) which is assigned to Cumberland. The claims of the 738 Acetadote Patent encompass administration methods of acetylcysteine injection, without specification of the presence or lack of EDTA in the injection. Following its issuance, the 738 Acetadote Patent was listed in the FDA Orange Book and it is scheduled to expire in April 2032. 

On December 11, 2014 and March 3, 2015, the Company became aware of Paragraph IV certification notices from Aurobindo Pharma Limited and Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA) Inc., respectively, challenging the 356, 445, 061, and 738 Acetadote Patents on the basis of non-infringement. 

On February 10, 2015, the USPTO issued U.S. Patent number 8,952,065 (the &#8220;065 Acetadote Patent&#8221;) which is assigned to us. The claims of the 065 Acetadote Patent encompass the use of the 200 mg/ml Acetadote formulation to treat patients with acute liver failure. The 065 Acetadote Patent is scheduled to expire in August 2025. 

On September 30, 2015, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division ("District Court") ruled in our favor in our lawsuit against Mylan for infringement of the 445 Acetadote Patent. The opinion upheld our 445 Acetadote Patent and expressly rejected Mylan's validity challenge. The District Court ruled that Mylan is liable to us for infringement of the 445 Acetadote patent in light of Mylan's Abbreviated New Drug Application in which Mylan sought to market a generic version of Acetadote. On November 17, 2015, the District Court entered an order enjoining Mylan and its affiliates from selling or using its generic version of Acetadote until August 2025, the date of expiration of the 445 Acetadote Patent. On October 30, 2015, Mylan filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. 

We are considering our legal options and intend to continue to vigorously defend and protect our Acetadote product and related intellectual property rights. 

We also have additional patent applications relating to Acetadote which are pending with the USPTO. 

Caldolor 

We are the owner of U.S. Patent No. 6,727,286, which is directed to ibuprofen solution formulations, methods of making the same, and methods of using the same, and which expires in 2021. This U.S. patent is associated with our completed international application No. PCT/US01/42894. We have filed for international patent protection in association with this PCT application in various countries, some of which have been allowed and some of which remain pending. 

We have an exclusive, worldwide license to clinical data for intravenous ibuprofen from Vanderbilt University, in consideration for royalty obligations related to Caldolor. During 2014, we obtained additional patents for the brand. On May 27, 2014, the USPTO issued U.S. Patent number 8,735,452 (the &#8220;452 Caldolor Patent&#8221;) &#32; which is assigned to us. The claims of the 452 Caldolor Patent encompass methods of treating pain using intravenous ibuprofen. Following its issuance, the 452 Caldolor Patent was listed in the FDA Orange Book and is scheduled to expire in September 2029. 

On October 28, 2014, the USPTO issued U.S. Patent number 8,871,810 (the &#8220;810 Caldolor Patent&#8221;) &#32; which is assigned to us. The claims of the 810 Caldolor Patent encompass methods of treating pain using intravenous ibuprofen. Following its issuance, the 810 Caldolor Patent was listed in the FDA Orange Book and is scheduled to expire in September 2029. 

During the third quarter of 2015, we obtained three additional patents for Caldolor. On July 7, 2015, the USPTO issued U.S. Patent number&#8217;s 9,072,710 (the &#8220;710 Caldolor Patent&#8221;) and 9,072,661 (the &#8220;661 Caldolor Patent&#8221;) which are assigned to us. The claims of the 710 Caldolor Patent and the 661 Caldolor Patent include composition and methods of treating pain, inflammation and fever using intravenous ibuprofen. These Caldolor Patents are scheduled to expire in March 2032. 

On August 25, 2015, the USPTO issued U.S. Patent number 9,114,068 (the &#8220;068 Caldolor Patent&#8221;) which is assigned to us.

Following its issuance, the 068 Caldolor Patent was listed in the FDA Orange Book and is scheduled to expire in September 2029. We also have additional patent applications related to Caldolor which are pending with the USPTO. 

Vaprisol 

We own numerous U.S. patents and related international patents for Vaprisol. These patents were acquired in our February 2014 acquisition of certain product rights, intellectual property and related assets of Vaprisol from Astellas. The primary patent is U.S. Patent No. 5,723,606 (the &#8220;606 Vaprisol Patent&#8221;) which includes composition of matter claims that encompass the Vaprisol formulation as well as methods for the intravenous treatment of patients with euvolemic hyponatremia. The 606 Vaprisol Patent is listed in the FDA Orange Book and expires in December 2019. 

Remaining Products 

We have no issued patents for our Kristalose or Omeclamox-Pak products. We have patent applications relating to our Hepatoren and Boxaban products pending with the USPTO. 

COMPETITION 

The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense competition and rapid innovation. Our continued success in developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products will depend, in part, upon our ability to compete against existing and future products in our target markets. Competitive factors directly affecting our markets include but are not limited to: 

&#8226; 

product attributes such as efficacy, safety, ease-of-use and cost-effectiveness; 

&#8226; 

brand awareness and recognition driven by sales, marketing and distribution capabilities; 

&#8226; 

intellectual property and other exclusivity rights; 

&#8226; 

availability of resources to build and maintain developmental and commercial capabilities; 

&#8226; 

successful business development activities; 

&#8226; 

extent of third-party reimbursements; and 

&#8226; 

establishment of advantageous collaborations to conduct development, manufacturing or commercialization efforts. 

A number of our competitors possess research and development and sales and marketing capabilities as well as financial resources greater than ours. These competitors, in addition to emerging companies and academic research institutions, may be developing, or in the future could develop, new technologies that could compete with our current and future products or render our products obsolete. 

Acetadote 

Acetadote is our injectable formulation of NAC for the treatment of acetaminophen overdose. NAC is accepted worldwide as the standard of care for acetaminophen overdose. Our competitors in the acetaminophen overdose market 

are those companies selling orally administered NAC including, but not limited to, Geneva Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Bedford Laboratories division of Ben Venue Laboratories, Inc., Roxane Laboratories, Inc., InnoPharma Inc. and Hospira Inc. 

In November 2012, InnoPharma Inc. was granted approval by the FDA to distribute their generic form of the old formulation of Acetadote containing EDTA. In late 2012, we entered into the Settlement Agreement with Paddock and Perrigo that included the right to distribute our Authorized Generic Acetadote injection product. Our branded Acetadote now competes with both the EDTA free Authorized Generic Acetadote distributed by Paddock and Perrigo along with generic Acetadote products that contain EDTA. 

Caldolor 

Caldolor is marketed for the treatment of pain and fever, primarily in a hospital setting. A variety of other products address the acute pain market: 

&#8226; 

Morphine, the most commonly used product for the treatment of acute, post-operative pain, is manufactured and distributed by several generic pharmaceutical companies; 

&#8226; 

Other generic injectable opioids, including fentanyl, meperidine and hydromorphone, address this market; 

&#8226; 

Ketorolac (brand name Toradol &#174; ), an injectable NSAID, is also manufactured and distributed by several generic pharmaceutical companies; 

&#8226; 

Ofirmev &#174; , an injectable acetaminophen product is marketed by Mallinckrodt plc; 

&#8226; 

Exparel &#174; , a bupivacaine delivery platform marketed by Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc; and 

&#8226; 

Dyloject, an injectable diclofenac product approved by the FDA during 2015. 

We are aware of other product candidates in development to treat acute pain including injectable NSAIDs, novel opioids, new formulations of existing therapies and extended release anesthetics. We believe non-narcotic analgesics for the treatment of post-surgical pain are the primary potential competitors to Caldolor. 

In addition to the injectable analgesic products above, many companies are developing analgesics for specific indications such as migraine and neuropathic pain, oral extended-release forms of existing narcotic and non-narcotic products, and products with new methods of delivery such as transdermal. We are not aware of any approved injectable products indicated for the treatment of fever in the U.S. other than Caldolor and Ofirmev. There are, however, numerous drugs available to physicians to reduce fevers in hospital settings via oral administration to the patient, including ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and aspirin. These drugs are manufactured by numerous pharmaceutical companies. 

Kristalose 

Kristalose is a dry powder crystalline prescription formulation of lactulose indicated for the treatment of constipation. The U.S. constipation therapy market includes various prescription and over the counter, or OTC, products. The prescription products which we believe are our primary competitors are: 

&#8226; 

Amitiza &#174; , an oral product indicated for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation in adults, and is marketed by Sucampo Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited. 

&#8226; 

Movantik TM , an oral product indicated for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation in adults with chronic non-cancer pain. 

&#8226; 

Linzess &#174; , an oral product indicated for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation and chronic idiopathic constipation. It is marketed by Forest Laboratories, Inc. and Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc; and 

&#8226; 

Liquid lactulose products are marketed by a number of pharmaceutical companies. 

There are several hundred OTC products used to treat constipation marketed by numerous pharmaceutical and consumer health companies. MiraLax (polyethylene glycol 3350), previously a prescription product, was indicated for 

the treatment of constipation and manufactured and marketed by Braintree Laboratories, Inc. Under an agreement with Braintree, Schering-Plough introduced MiraLax as an OTC product in February 2007. 

Omeclamox-Pak 

Omeclamox-Pak is a branded prescription product used for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and duodenal ulcer disease. It combines three well-known and widely prescribed medications packaged together for patient convenience: omeprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin. The three individual components of Omeclamox-Pak are also available through three separate prescriptions. While there are several competitor products, Omeclamox-Pak is one of the few actively marketed products for this condition. In addition, compared to the branded competing products, Omeclamox-Pak has the lowest pill burden, fewest days of therapy and the lowest cost. The prescription combination products, indicated for treatment of H. pylori, which we believe are our primary competitors are: 

&#8226; 

PrevPac &#174; , an oral product marketed by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company. There are also approved generic versions of PrevPac; 

&#8226; 

Pylera &#174; , an oral product marketed by Actavis Pharma, Inc. and Forest Laboratories, Inc.; and 

&#8226; 

Helidac &#174; , an oral product marketed by Prometheus Therapeutics. 

Vaprisol 

Vaprisol is a patented, prescription brand indicated to raise serum sodium levels in hospitalized patients with euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. The product was developed and registered by Astellas and then launched in 2006. It is one of two branded prescription products indicated for the treatment of hyponatremia, and the first and only intravenously administered branded treatment. The other competing product is Samsca, an oral product marketed by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Company. 

GOVERNMENT REGULATION 

Governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries extensively regulate the research, development, testing, manufacturing, distribution, marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products. In the U.S., the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, ("FDCA"), the Public Health Service Act, and other federal statutes and regulations, subjects pharmaceutical products to rigorous review. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs or biologics license applications, ("BLAs"), warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution. 

We, our manufacturers and clinical research organizations may also be subject to regulations under other federal, state and local laws, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act and import, export and customs regulations as well as the laws and regulations of other countries. 

FDA Approval Process 

The FDA is a regulatory agency within the Department of Health and Human Services. A key responsibility is to regulate the safety and effectiveness of drugs sold in the United States. The FDA divides that responsibility into two phases: pre-approval &#32; (premarket) and post approval &#32; (post market). The FDA reviews manufacturers' applications to market drugs in the United States; a drug may not be sold unless it has FDA approval. The agency continues its oversight of drug safety and effectiveness as long as the drug is on the market. 

To market a prescription drug in the United States, a manufacturer needs FDA approval. To get that approval, the manufacturer must demonstrate the drug's safety and effectiveness according to criteria specified in law and agency regulations, ensure that its manufacturing plant passes FDA inspection, and obtain FDA approval for the drug's labeling, a term that includes all written material about the drug, including, for example, packaging, prescribing information for physicians, promotional materials and patient brochures. 

The progression to drug approval begins before FDA involvement. First, basic scientists work in the laboratory and with animals; second, a drug or biotechnology company develops a prototype drug. That company must seek and 

receive FDA approval, by way of an IND application, to test the product with human subjects. Those tests, called clinical trials, are carried out sequentially in Phase I, II, and III studies, which involve increasing numbers of subjects. The manufacturer then compiles the resulting data and analysis in a NDA. The FDA reviews the NDA with three major concerns: (1) safety and effectiveness in the drug's proposed use; (2) appropriateness of the proposed labeling; and (3) adequacy of manufacturing methods to assure the drug's identity, strength, quality, and purity. 

The FDCA and associated regulations detail the requirements at each step. The FDA uses a few special mechanisms to expedite drug development and the review process when a drug might address an unmet need or a serious disease or condition. Those mechanisms include accelerated approval, animal efficacy approval, fast track applications, and priority review. 

The sponsor of the drug typically conducts human clinical trials in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. Phase I clinical trials are generally conducted in a small number of healthy volunteers, primarily to collect and assess pharmacokinetics and safety data at one or more dosages prior to proceeding into patients. In Phase II clinical trials, the sponsor evaluates the early efficacy of the product in short term trials on the targeted indication and identifies possible adverse effects and safety risks in a patient population. Phase III clinical trials typically involve testing for patients in long term trials examining safety and clinical efficacy in an expanded population at geographically-dispersed test sites. 

The FDA requires that clinical trials be conducted in accordance with the FDA's GCP requirements. The FDA may order the partial, temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The institutional review board ("IRB"), or ethics committee (outside of the U.S.), of each clinical site generally must approve the clinical trial design and patient informed consent and may also require the clinical trial at that site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB's requirements, or may impose other conditions. 

The results of the nonclinical and clinical trials, together with detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product and proposed labeling, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA for marketing approval. The NDA undergoes a 60 day validation review period before it is accepted for filing. If the NDA is found to be incomplete it will not be accepted. Once the NDA is validated and accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA (currently PDUFA V - effective October 1, 2012), the FDA has 10 months in which to complete its initial review of a standard NDA and respond to the applicant. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by two months to address deficiencies, or by three months if the FDA requests or the NDA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission at any time during the review clock period. If the FDA's evaluations of the NDA and the clinical and manufacturing procedures and facilities are favorable, the FDA will issue an approval letter. If not, a Complete Response letter will be sent informing applicants of changes that must be made before the application can be approved, with no implication regarding whether the application will ultimately be approved. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug for the proposed indication(s) under study. The General Accounting Office ("GAO") reported that standard NDAs showed a steadier increase with the percentage of first-cycle approval letters rising from 43% for FY 2000 applications to 69% for FY 2010 applications. The percentage of priority NDAs receiving an approval letter at the end of the first review cycle fluctuated from FY 2000 through FY 2010, ranging between 47% and 80% during this time. The time and cost of completing these steps and obtaining FDA approval can vary dramatically depending on the drug. However, to complete these steps for a novel drug can take many years and cost millions of dollars. 

Section 505(b) (2) New Drug Applications 

An NDA may be submitted under different methods, a 505(b)(1), 505(b)(2) or 505(j). Section 505(b) provides for the submission of an NDA to support the approval of a drug. Upon approval, a drug may be marketed only for the FDA-approved indication(s) in the approved dosage form. Further clinical trials may be necessary to gain approval for the use of the product for any additional indications or dosage forms. The FDA also requires post market safety surveillance reporting to monitor the side effects of the drug, which may result in withdrawal of approval after marketing begins. 

Section 505(b)(1) or the 'full' NDA is used for new chemical entities ("NCEs") and requires full clinical and nonclinical development of a compound. Marketing exclusivity assigned to a 505(b)(1) approval is five years. A 505(b)(2) NDA permits the submission of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant using previously reported safety and efficacy data, and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. Generally new studies are required to provide data on the proposed change. Some examples of products that may be allowed to follow a 505(b)(2) path to approval are drugs which have a new dosage form, strength, route of administration, formulation or indication or combination drugs. Marketing exclusivity for a 505(b)(2) submission is three years. Any marketing exclusivity is independent of patent exclusivity. 

We successfully secured FDA approvals for Acetadote in January 2004 and for Caldolor in June 2009 pursuant to the 505(b)(2) pathway. 

Special protocol assessment process 

The special protocol assessment, or SPA, process is designed to assess whether a planned protocol is adequate to meet scientific and regulatory requirements identified by the sponsor. Three types of protocols related to PDUFA products are eligible for this special protocol assessment under the PDUFA goals: (1) animal carcinogenicity protocols, (2) final product stability protocols, and (3) clinical protocols for phase III trials whose data will form the primary basis for an efficacy claim if the trials had been the subject of discussion at an end-of-phase 2/pre-phase 3 meeting with the review division, or in some cases, if the division agrees to such a review because the division is aware of the developmental context in which the protocol is being reviewed and the questions are being answered. The clinical protocols for phase III trials can relate to efficacy claims that will be part of an original NDA or BLA or that will be part of an efficacy supplement to an approved NDA or BLA. 

New section 505(b)(4)(B) of the Modernization Act directs FDA to meet with sponsors, provided certain conditions are met, for the purpose of reaching agreement on the design and size of clinical trials intended to form the primary basis of an efficacy claim in a marketing application submitted under section 505(b) of the Act or section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262).3. Such marketing applications include NDAs, BLAs, and efficacy supplements to approved NDAs and BLAs. Under new sections 505(b)(4)(B) and (C) of the Act, if a sponsor makes a reasonable written request to meet with the FDA for the purpose of reaching agreement on the design and size of a clinical trial, the FDA will meet with the sponsor. If an agreement is reached, the FDA will reduce the agreement to writing and make it part of the administrative record. An agreement may not be changed by the sponsor or FDA after the trial begins, except (1) with the written agreement of the sponsor and FDA, or (2) if the director of the FDA reviewing division determines that "a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the drug" was identified after the testing began (section 505(b)(4)(C) of the Act). If a sponsor and the FDA meet regarding the design and size of a clinical trial under section 505(b)(4)(B) of the Act and the parties cannot agree that the trial design is adequate to meet the goals of the sponsor, the FDA will clearly state the reasons for the disagreement in a letter to the sponsor. However, the absence of an articulated disagreement on a particular issue should not be assumed to represent an agreement reached on that issue. Final determinations by the FDA with respect to a product candidate, including as to the scope of its &#8220;labeling&#8221;, are made after a complete review of the applicable NDA and are based on the entire data in the application. 

On June 14, 2004, we submitted a request for SPA of our Caldolor Phase III clinical study. During a meeting with the FDA on September 29, 2004, the FDA confirmed that the efficacy data from our study of post-operative pain with a positive outcome was considered sufficient to support a 505(b)(2) application for the pain indication. 

Orphan drug designation 

The Orphan Drug Act of 1983, ("Orphan Drug Act"), encourages manufacturers to seek approval of products intended to treat &#8220;rare diseases and conditions&#8221; with a prevalence of fewer than 200,000 patients in the U.S. or for which there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the development costs for the product. For products that receive orphan drug designation by the FDA, the Orphan Drug Act provides tax credits for clinical research, FDA assistance with protocol design, eligibility for FDA grants to fund clinical studies, waiver of the FDA application fee, and a period of seven years of marketing exclusivity for the product following FDA marketing approval. Acetadote received Orphan Drug designation in October 2001 and in 2004 the FDA approved the product to prevent or lessen hepatic injury after 

ingestion of a potentially hepatotoxic quantity of acetaminophen. Acetadote was entitled to marketing exclusivity until January 2011 for the treatment of this approved indication. 

Section 505(j) abbreviated new drug applications 

An ANDA is a type of NDA where approval of a generic drug is based on demonstrating comparability to an innovator drug product (the RLD or Reference Listed Drug). Applications are "abbreviated" because they generally don't include preclinical and clinical data to establish safety and effectiveness. Generics must demonstrate that the product is bioequivalent (i.e., performs in the same manner and is comparable to the 'innovator' product in active ingredient, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, quality, performance characteristics and intended use). Abbreviated applications may be submitted for drug products that are the same as a listed drug and must be identical in active ingredient(s), form, strength, route of administration, and identical in conditions of use (non-exclusive uses). Products are declared suitable based on a suitability petition to the FDA. If the petition is approved, the Sponsor may then submit the ANDA. 

The Hatch-Waxman Act 

The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act, informally known as the "Hatch-Waxman Act", is a 1984 United States federal law which established the modern system of generic drugs. Hatch-Waxman amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Section 505(j) 21 U.S.C. 355(j) sets forth the process by which would-be marketers of generic drugs can file ANDAs to seek FDA approval of the generic. Section 505(j)(2)(A)(vii)(IV), the so-called Paragraph IV, allows 180 day exclusivity to companies that are the "first-to-file" an ANDA against holders of patents for branded counterparts. 

Hatch-Waxman Amendments grant generic manufacturers the ability to mount a validity challenge without incurring the cost of entry or risking enormous damages flowing from any possible infringement. Hatch-Waxman essentially redistributes the relative risk assessments and explains the flow of settlement funds and their magnitude. Hatch-Waxman gives generics considerable leverage in patent litigation. 

Health care legislation 

On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA. On March 30, 2010, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or HCERA, was enacted into law, which modified the revenue provisions of the PPACA. The PPACA as amended by the HCERA constitutes the healthcare reform legislation. The following highlights certain provisions of the legislation that may affect us. 

Pharmaceutical Industry Fee: Beginning in calendar-year 2011, an annual fee was imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs (e.g., Medicare Part D, Medicare Part B, Medicaid, Department of Veterans Affairs programs, Department of Defense programs and TRICARE). The annual fee is allocated to companies based on their previous calendar-year market share using sales data that the government agencies that purchase the pharmaceuticals will provide to the Treasury Department. Although we participate in governmental programs that subject us to this fee, our sales volume in such programs is less than $10 million, with the first $5 million of sales being exempt from the fee. This fee has not had a material impact and is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations. 

Physician Payments Sunshine Act: The Affordable Care Act also includes provisions known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, or Sunshine Act, which require manufacturers of pharmaceuticals and medical devices covered under Medicare and Medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS for aggregation and subsequent public disclosure. Under the Sunshine Act, beginning August 1, 2013, we have collected data regarding reportable transfers of value and have reported such data to CMS. Failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines and/or penalties. In addition to the Federal Sunshine Act, similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level requiring transparency of interactions with health care professionals. 

Medicaid Rebate Rate: We currently provide rebates for products sold to Medicaid beneficiaries. 

Post Approval Activities 

Once a drug is on the U.S. market (following FDA approval of the NDA), the FDA continues to address drug production, distribution, and use. FDA activities are based on ensuring drug safety and effectiveness, and address product integrity, labeling, reporting of research and adverse events, surveillance, drug studies, risk management, information dissemination, off-label use, and direct-to-consumer advertising. 

If we amend the NDA for an FDA approved product, such as adding safety or efficacy labeling claims, promoting those new claims, making certain manufacturing changes or product enhancements we will need FDA review and approval before the change can be implemented. While physicians may use products for indications that have not been approved by the FDA, we may not label or promote the product for an indication that has not been approved. Securing FDA approval for new indications, product enhancements, and manufacturing and labeling changes may require us to conduct additional clinical trials under FDA's IND regulations. Even if such studies are conducted, they are still subject to the same requirements and timelines as an original NDA. 

The FDA continuously gathers information about possible adverse reactions to the products it has approved for use. The FDA requires all manufacturers to report adverse events. It also provides a procedure for consumers and physicians to voluntarily report their concerns about drugs. The agency collects those reports through MedWatch and uses its Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) to store and analyze them. Because some events may occur after the use of a drug for reasons unrelated to the product, the FDA reviews the events to assess which ones may indicate a problem with that particular drug. They then use information gleaned from the surveillance data to determine a course of action. They might recommend a change in drug labeling to alert users to a potential problem, or, perhaps, to require the manufacturer to study the observed association between the drug and the adverse event. 

In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include anti-kickback statutes and false claims statutes. The federal health care program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any health care item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed health care programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Violations of the anti-kickback statute are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal health care programs. 

Federal False Claims Act 

The Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. A number of pharmaceutical and other health care companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. 

ICH - International Committee on Harmonization 

Outside of the U.S., our ability to market our products will depend on receiving marketing authorizations from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The International Committee on Harmonization (ICH) provides a set of standards that most Regulatory Authorities adhere to (e.g. U.S., Europe, and Japan) allowing greater harmonization in the interpretation and application of technical guidelines and requirements for pharmaceutical product registration, thereby reducing or obviating duplication of testing carried out during the research and development of new human medicines. Regulatory harmonization offers many direct benefits to both regulatory authorities and the pharmaceutical industry with beneficial impact for the protection of public health. 

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 

We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations and we believe that our operations comply with such regulations. We anticipate that the effects of compliance with federal, state and local laws and 

regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the environment will not have any material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. 

SEASONALITY 

There are no significant seasonal aspects to our business. 

BACKLOG 

Due to the relatively short lead-time required to fill orders for our products, backlog of orders is not considered material to our business. 

EMPLOYEES 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 78 full-time employees. We believe that our future will depend in part on our continued ability to attract, hire, and retain qualified personnel, including hospital and field sales personnel in particular.
