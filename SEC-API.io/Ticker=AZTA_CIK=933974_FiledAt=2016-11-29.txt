 Item 1. Business &#32; 

Overview 

We are a leading global provider of automation and cryogenic solutions for multiple applications and markets. We primarily serve the semiconductor capital equipment market and sample management market for life sciences. We believe our leadership position and global support structure in these markets makes us a valued business partner to the largest semiconductor capital equipment and device makers and pharmaceutical and life science research institutions in the world. Our offerings are also applied to industrial capital equipment and other adjacent technology markets. We are headquartered in Chelmsford, Massachusetts, employ approximately 1,300 full-time employees worldwide, have sales in more than 50 countries, and provide customer support services globally. 

In our early days in the 1980s, our Company developed and marketed automated handling equipment for semiconductor manufacturers. We have since enhanced our portfolio in the semiconductor capital equipment market to include cryogenic vacuum equipment, integrated automated handling systems, and automated contamination control solutions specific to the cleaning of wafer carrier devices. We have made several key acquisitions in recent years to strengthen our semiconductor market portfolio, including certain integrated handling system assets of Crossing Automation, Inc. acquired in fiscal year 2013, and the automated contamination cleaning equipment of Dynamic Micro Systems Semiconductor Equipment GmbH in fiscal year 2014 and Contact Co., Ltd. in fiscal year 2015. We have also invested in research and development initiatives to advance the offerings from each of these acquisitions. Our key divestitures in recent years were made within the semiconductor offerings portfolio and included the sale of our contract manufacturing business in fiscal year 2011 and Granville-Phillips Instruments business in fiscal year 2014. Our business supporting the semiconductor capital equipment and adjacent markets provided approximately 81% of our revenue in fiscal year 2016. 

In fiscal year 2010, we identified life sciences sample management as an underserved market in which we could leverage our core competencies of automation and cryogenics in order to diversify our business and provide us the potential for higher growth and profit margins. Our strategic objective was to provide offerings to assist customers in managing the &#8216;cold chain of custody&#8217; of their compound and biological samples, including storage, work flow solutions, transportation, handling, and informatics and services. By fiscal year 2011, we were making strategic investments via acquisitions and research and development initiatives to fulfill our goal of becoming a leader in the life science sample management market. We acquired three providers of large automated ultra cold storage freezers which operate at -80&#176;C and -20&#176;C and bench-top instruments for sample management: RTS Life Sciences and Nexus BioSystems, Inc. both completed in fiscal year 2011; and Matrical, Inc in 

fiscal year 2013. Internally, we initiated an internal design for an improved freezer system that launched in fiscal year 2013 and successfully combined large automated systems into our single Twinbank platform manufactured in Manchester, United Kingdom. Our market research led to our development of the BioStore III Cryo offering, a smaller, automated, liquid nitrogen-cooled freezer that operates at -150&#176;C, which became available to the market in fiscal year 2016. Additionally, we acquired FluidX Ltd., a consumable sample tube and bench-top instruments business, in October 2014 and BioStorage Technologies, a full-service outsourcing sample management business, in November 2015. The BioStorage acquisition provided us with the capability to support customers with an integrated, comprehensive set of sample management products, services and solutions. All of these acquired businesses have been fully integrated into our life science systems operations. We have also made certain non-acquisitive investments, including investments in BioCision, LLC, as well as another small private technology company from which we obtained an exclusive license of certain silicon chip-based technology to track samples. In fiscal year 2015, we jointly developed a liquid nitrogen-charged carrier device for transporting biological specimens at cryogenic temperatures with BioCision. We also added to our portfolio consumable sample tubes and additional instrument offerings, as well as a full outsource service offering that provides customers with full care of their samples. Our business supporting the life science sample management market provided approximately 19% of our revenue in fiscal year 2016. 

As discussed above, we have made acquisitions over the years which accelerated our product development cycle, broadened our installation base and added customer relationships to our business. We have also divested certain of our products that were not in leadership positions in our core markets. As such, we use acquisitions and divestitures to strengthen our offerings portfolio and to achieve increased growth and profitability. For further information on our acquisitions, divestitures, and equity investments, please refer to Note 4, "Acquisitions," and Note 8, "Equity Method and Other Investments," to our Consolidated Financial Statements included under "Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K. 

The demand for semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment is cyclical, resulting in periodic expansions and contractions of this market. While the services element of our semiconductor business is generally more stable, the cyclical nature of the capital equipment business causes sales from products to vary quarterly based on short term market demands. It is not unusual for these variations in sales to be up or down 10% to 20% in sequential quarters. We believe the life science sample management market is generally more stable than the semiconductor capital equipment market and is expected to grow as a result of the expanding need for storage and retention of compound and biological samples. However, even in this market, there is more stable revenue streams in the area of storage service, in contrast to the sale of freezers and other equipment, which has exhibited periods of robust growth but also decline. As we have expanded our offerings of consumables, infrastructure services, and storage services, we have seen these revenue streams in life sciences increase to account for approximately 66% of Brooks Life Science Systems revenue in fiscal year 2016. 

Segments 

Prior to fiscal year 2016, we had three operating and reportable segments that consisted of Brooks Product Solutions, Brooks Global Services and Brooks Life Science Systems. During fiscal year 2016, we reorganized our reporting structure into two operating and reportable segments consisting of: (i) Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group; and (ii) Brooks Life Science Systems. Subsequently, we have reported financial results for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014 based on the revised segment structure. The change in the segments was a result of restructuring actions initiated during fiscal year 2016 to streamline business operations to improve profitability and competitiveness and reflects a change in the manner in which our chief operating decision maker reviews information to assess our performance and make decisions about resource allocation. As part of these actions, we transitioned to a new internal management structure whereby the operating management responsible for Brooks Product Solutions and Brooks Global Services operating segments was brought under common leadership in the newly formed Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment. The restructuring actions were completed during fiscal year 2016. 

For further information on our operating segments and the restructuring actions, please refer to Note 17, "Restructuring and Other Charges" and Note 20, "Segment and Geographic Information," to our Consolidated Financial Statements included under "Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K. Our prior period reportable segment information has been reclassified to reflect the current segment structure and conform to the current period presentation.

Markets and Customers 

The principal markets served by the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment include the following: 

&#8226; 

Semiconductor capital equipment market 

Each year, the global semiconductor industry makes significant capital investments in equipment to keep up with advancements in semiconductor technology, to add capacity and to improve productivity within existing semiconductor fabrication plants, or fabs. We are recognized as a market leading provider of vacuum automation, wafer carrier contamination control and cryogenic solutions to the global semiconductor capital equipment industry. As discussed above, the global semiconductor capital equipment industry is cyclical, but we believe that it possesses a long-term growth profile driven by the demand for increasingly sophisticated consumer electronics, automotive and smart appliance products, growth in data centers, the expansion of Internet-of-Things which increasingly connects various appliances and devices to servers, and mobile platforms. The demand for higher performance, lower power consumption and reduced size for all such products is enabled by advancements in the technology and processes used for the manufacturing of the devices. We believe this trend continues to provide market opportunities for the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group to be a valued partner in providing vacuum automation, carrier contamination control and cryogenic solutions to support the industry&#8217;s needs. 

We have been a long-term partner to device manufacturers and the original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, who are the providers of complex processing equipment, or tools, to fabs. We maintain collaborative relationships with our customers in the innovative design of new automation, vacuum and contamination control solutions that are critical to the success of their products. Our comprehensive global network of technical specialists provides extensive support to our customers in new equipment installation and existing equipment support in all regions, including the key semiconductor markets in Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and China. 

The production of advanced semiconductor chips requires many complex and logistically challenging manufacturing activities. Silicon wafers must go through hundreds of process steps performed by tools in order to create billions of microscopic transistors and connect them in both horizontal and vertical layers to produce a functioning integrated circuit, or IC. These steps, which comprise the initial fabrication of the IC and are referred to in the industry as front-end processes, are repeated many times on a single wafer to create the desired pattern on the silicon wafer. Up to 50% of these processes are performed in tools that operate under vacuum conditions, such as removing, depositing, or measuring materials on wafer surfaces. As the complexity of semiconductors has increased, the number of process steps that occur in a vacuum environment have also increased, resulting in a greater need for both automation and vacuum technology solutions. 

Once the fabrication of the wafer is complete, the wafer is divided into individual components and applies additional processes and materials to form the final semiconductor chip device. The increase in packing density of components in mobile devices has led the industry to devise new techniques for chip interconnectivity using what is called wafer level packaging, or WLP. This new technology is a process of combining multiple wafers together prior to cutting them into pieces and then forming them onto a packaging substrate where they are ultimately divided into the multitude of chips. The recent increased adoption of WLP has increased the need for a contaminant free and high purity manufacturing environment, which is providing new demand across our semiconductor offerings which are tailored to handle full wafer forms expanding our opportunity with existing and new customers. For example, throughout the fabrication and packaging processes noted above, the demand for clean processing extends to increased demand for wafer carrier devices which are used for the safe and clean transport of wafers between tools during the manufacturing process. Large scale semiconductor fabs may use thousands of these carriers. There is also growing demand for wafer carrier cleaning and conditioning tools used to remove microscopic particles, organic compounds and water that are attracted to the inside surface of the carrier. Automated cleaning and conditioning of the carrier devices are also in demand by customers looking to improve yields. 

&#8226; 

Adjacent capital equipment markets 

In addition to the semiconductor manufacturing industry, there are a variety of adjacent and industrial manufacturing operations that use similar manufacturing processes. Frequently, these markets have common customers and similar technology applications. A few of the adjacent markets which we serve include light-emitting diodes, or LED, which are manufactured using vacuum systems and handling processes similar to semiconductor manufacturing. Organic Light Emitting Diode, or OLED, applications are also gaining traction in the mobile computing and telecommunications device markets because of their high quality display and low power consumption. Touch screen technology found in mobile devices requires either a vacuum or significant cooling for effective deposition of films or coatings during the production process. 

We believe the desire for efficient, higher throughput and extremely clean manufacturing for semiconductor wafer fabs, the chip packaging process and other industrial or high performance electronic-based products and processes have created a substantial market for us in the following offerings: (i) substrate handling automation, which is related to moving the wafers in a semiconductor fab, (ii) tool automation, which is related to using robots and modules in conjunction with and inside process tools that move wafers from station-to-station, (iii) vacuum systems technology to create and sustain the clean environment 

necessary for fabricating various products, and (iv) automated contamination control systems to condition and clean wafer carriers. 

Product and Service Offerings 

The principal offerings of the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment consist of: (i) wafer handling robotics and systems, (ii) semiconductor contamination control solutions, and (iii) cryogenic pumps and compressors. The segment also provides support services, including repair, diagnostic and installation, as well as spare parts and productivity enhancement upgrades to maximize tool productivity. 

Wafer handling robotics and systems offerings include atmospheric and vacuum robots, robotic modules, as well as tool automation systems that provide precision handling and clean wafer environments. In the semiconductor industry, wafer handling robotics have emerged as a critical technology in the highly complex production tools in the world's most advanced wafer fabs. A typical customer tool is designed and built around a process chamber and uses automation technology to move wafers in and out of the chamber. We specialize in developing and building the automated handling systems, as well as the vacuum technologies used in these tools. We provide individual components within an OEM customer system as well as complete integrated handling systems. We provide automation products that are used for both atmospheric pressure and vacuum-based tools and are designed to improve performance and productivity of the manufacturing process. 

Contamination control solutions- &#32;include automated cleaning and inspection systems for wafer carriers, as well as reticle pod cleaners and stockers, which are automated systems that store wafers or reticles. Our products use enhanced technology to remove critical airborne contamination within the workflow of the manufacturing process. Our solutions contribute to improving yields, productivity and process stability in the manufacturing process which requires an ultra-clean manufacturing environment. 

Cryogenic pumps and compressors- &#32;provide vacuum pump and thermal management solutions that are used in critical vacuum process applications. Certain process steps require our vacuum pumps to create and optimize the process environment by maintaining pressure consistency throughout the manufacturing process. Semiconductor manufacturers need to ensure that each process operates at carefully controlled pressure levels to achieve optimal production yields. Impurities or incorrect pressure levels can lower production yields, thereby significantly increasing manufacturing costs. Our cryogenic vacuum pumps are considered the industry standard by many leading semiconductor device manufacturers for ion implant and physical vapor deposition, or PVD, applications, both of which require high vacuum pumping capability. 

Within the semiconductor industry, we sell our products and services to the world's major semiconductor chip and original equipment manufacturers. Our customers outside the semiconductor industry are broadly diversified. We have major customers in North America, Europe and Asia. Although much of our equipment sales ship to OEMs in the United States, a large percentage of these OEM tools are ultimately installed in semiconductor fabs that are outside of North America. We also provide support services to leading OEMs, fabs and foundries across the globe.

We believe we are materially in compliance with all such laws and regulations. 

Compliance with foreign, federal, state, and local laws and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, an adverse effect on our capital expenditures, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations. 

Employees 

At September 30, 2016, we had 1,310 full time employees. In addition, we employ part time workers and contractors. We consider our relationships with these and all employees to be good. 

Approximately 50 employees in our facility in Jena, Germany are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. During fiscal year 2016, we committed to a restructuring plan to consolidate our Jena, Germany repair facility into our Chelmsford, Massachusetts repair operation as a part of our strategy to reduce our global footprint and streamline our cost structure. The restructuring plan includes the elimination of 44 positions within the service and administrative functions as a part of this initiative. A collective bargaining agreement with a German labor union imposed a legal restriction on our ability to complete the restructuring plan. During fiscal year 2016, we entered into the negotiations with the Workers Council concerning the amount of involuntary termination benefits payable to employees impacted by this restructuring action, timing of these payments and the related terms of this arrangement. As of September 30, 2016, we reached an agreement with the Workers Council regarding the terms of this action and we have communicated termination benefit amounts to the majority of employees that will be impacted by the restructuring action along with their expected termination dates. The restructuring action is expected to be completed by March 31, 2017.
