 Item 1. Business 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160;

We are a specialty pharmaceutical company developing proprietary therapeutics for the treatment of serious medical disorders. Our product development programs utilize our proprietary long-term drug delivery platform, ProNeura&#174;, and focus primarily on innovative treatments for select chronic diseases for which steady state delivery of a drug provides an efficacy and/or safety benefit. All share and per share amounts give retroactive effect to a 1 for 5.5 reverse stock split effected in September 2015.

&#160;

Probuphine&#174;, our first product candidate to utilize ProNeura, is being developed for the long term maintenance treatment of opioid dependence and is designed to maintain a stable, around the clock blood level of the medicine buprenorphine in patients for six months following a single treatment. We have licensed the rights to commercialize Probuphine in the U.S. and Canada to Braeburn Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (&#8220;Braeburn&#8221;) and during 2015 we have been supporting Braeburn to complete the program developed in cooperation with the FDA to address the items in the Complete Response Letter (&#8220;CRL&#8221;) issued in April 2013. This included the completion in June 2015 of a double blind, double dummy clinical study of a four implant dose of Probuphine in clinically stable patients previously receiving maintenance treatment with an approved sublingual formulation containing buprenorphine at a daily dose of 8mg or less. This clinical study comparing the Probuphine dose to a dose of 8mg or less of a sublingual buprenorphine formulation, was funded and managed by Braeburn, and met the primary and secondary endpoints. This new data was incorporated into the Probuphine New Drug Application (&#8220;NDA&#8221;) which was resubmitted to the FDA at the end of August 2015. The FDA convened a meeting of the Psychopharmacologic Advisory Committee (&#8220;PDAC&#8221;) on January 12, 2016 to review data from the Probuphine NDA and following presentations and discussions the PDAC voted 12-5 in favor of approval of the product. Following the PDAC meeting, the FDA requested additional changes to the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (&#8220;REMS&#8221;) portion of the NDA, which were promptly provided by Braeburn. The FDA determined that the submission qualified as a major amendment to the NDA during the review process and elected to extend the FDA action date from February 27, 2016 to May 27, 2016. Pursuant to our license agreement with Braeburn, as amended to date, we are entitled to receive a $15 million milestone payment upon FDA approval of the Probuphine NDA and royalties on net sales of Probuphine ranging in percentage from the mid-teens to the low twenties. The agreement also provides for up to $165 million in sales milestones and $35 million in regulatory milestones and entitles us to royalty rates in the low single digit on sales by Braeburn, if any, of other future competing products in the addiction market.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

We believe that our ProNeura long term drug delivery technology has the potential to be used in the treatment of other chronic conditions where maintaining stable, around the clock blood levels of a medication may benefit the patient and improve medical outcomes. We have two products in early development using the ProNeura platform, an implant designed to provide long-term delivery of ropinirole, a dopamine agonist approved as a daily dosed oral formulation for the treatment of Parkinson&#8217;s disease (&#8220;PD&#8221;), and an implant designed to provide long-term delivery of triiodothyronine (&#8220;T3&#8221;), a synthetic thyroid hormone approved as a daily dosed oral formulation for the treatment of hypothyroidism. In December 2015, we submitted briefing material to the FDA on the development plans for the ropinirole implant in support of the pre-Investigational New Drug (IND), meeting request, and we have recently received feedback from the FDA on our product development plans. We have commenced the required non-clinical studies with the ropinirole implant, and following the potential approval of Probuphine, our goal is to complete the non-clinical development plan required in support of an IND application during this year, submit the IND in the fourth quarter of 2016 and enable commencement of a &#8216;proof of concept&#8217; clinical study shortly thereafter. Early stage development of the T3 implant continues and we are currently conducting non-clinical studies to help optimize the formulation. We expect to finalize the initial development plans for the T3 implant and request a pre-IND meeting with the FDA by the fourth quarter of 2016 and hope to commence a &#8216;proof of concept&#8217; clinical study in the second half of 2017. Our goal is to further expand the product pipeline and we are also currently evaluating other drugs and disease settings for opportunities to use the ProNeura platform in other potential treatment applications, especially in situations where conventional treatment is limited by variability in blood drug levels and poor patient compliance.

&#160;

We operate in only one business segment, the development of pharmaceutical products. We make available free of charge through our website, www.titanpharm.com, our periodic reports as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC.

&#160; 

ProNeura Continuous Drug Delivery Platform 

&#160;

Our ProNeura continuous drug delivery system consists of a small, solid rod made from a mixture of ethylene-vinyl acetate (&#8220;EVA&#8221;) and a drug substance. The resulting product is a solid matrix that is placed subdermally, normally in the inside part of the upper arm in a simple office procedure, and is removed in a similar manner at the end of the treatment period. The drug substance is released continuously through the process of dissolution. This results in a steady rate of release generally similar to intravenous administration. We believe that such long-term, linear release characteristics are desirable by avoiding peak and trough level dosing that may pose problems for many disease settings.

&#160;

The ProNeura platform was developed to address the need for a simple, practical method to achieve continuous long-term drug delivery, and, depending on the characteristics of the compound to be delivered, potentially can provide treatment on an outpatient basis over extended periods of up to 12 months. We believe that the benefits of this technology have been demonstrated by the clinical results to date with Probuphine and this drug delivery platform has the potential to be useful in the treatment of other diseases. We have commenced two product development programs, the first one with a ropinirole implant for the treatment of PD and the second one with a T3 implant for the treatment of hypothyroidism. We have also been evaluating opportunities to develop this drug delivery platform for other potential treatment applications in which conventional treatment is limited by variability in blood drug levels and poor patient compliance and where existing therapeutic compounds have sufficient potency to be effective at low doses. 

&#160; 

Our Product Pipeline 

&#160; 

Probuphine 

&#160;

We are developing Probuphine for the maintenance treatment of opioid dependence. Probuphine utilizes ProNeura, our novel, proprietary, long-term drug delivery platform. Upon subdermal insertion in a patient, Probuphine is designed to release medication continuously and maintain a stable, around the clock blood level of the drug buprenorphine, an approved agent for the treatment of opioid dependence. Probuphine is expected to provide six months of medication following a single treatment and is being developed for the maintenance treatment of opioid dependence in clinically stable patients who are receiving treatment with an oral formulation of buprenorphine at a dose of 8mg/day or less. The clinical development was completed in mid-2015 and the NDA submitted in late August 2015. The FDA organized a meeting of the PDAC to review and discuss the information contained in the NDA. This meeting was held on January 12, 2016, and following the committee review and discussion of the information provided by the FDA and Braeburn, voted 12-5 in favor of approval of Probuphine. The NDA is currently under review by the FDA with an action date of May 27, 2016.

&#160;

Pursuant to the license agreement with Braeburn, as amended to date, we are entitled to receive a $15 million milestone payment upon FDA approval of the Probuphine NDA and royalties on net sales of Probuphine ranging in percentage from the mid-teens to the low twenties. The agreement also provides for up to $165 million in sales milestones and $35 million in regulatory milestones and entitles us to low single digit royalties on sales by Braeburn, if any, of other future products in the addiction market.

&#160;

The goal of any therapy for an addictive disorder is to reduce the use of the addictive substance over time and to engage the patient in treatment long enough for therapeutic gains to be consolidated. In a clinical study, the effectiveness of a treatment for opioid dependence is primarily evaluated by testing a patient&#8217;s urine samples for the presence of illicit opioids over the treatment period along with self-reports by the patient of illicit opioid use. The final Phase 3 study requested by the FDA was a double blind, double dummy study evaluating Probuphine in comparison to an orally dosed buprenorphine formulation in clinically stable patients receiving a dose of 8mg/day or less. The objective of the study was to show non-inferiority between the two treatment groups and the primary efficacy analysis was a non-inferiority comparison of the proportions of treatment responders in each group. A responder was defined as having at least four out of six months free of illicit opioids based on urine testing and subject self-report. Topline results of this study were reported in June 2015. The analyses conducted according to the pre-planned Statistical Analysis Plan indicated that the primary and all secondary endpoints were met. The overall safety and tolerability profiles for each treatment group were also comparable. The implantation procedures were also generally well tolerated and comparable to observations from earlier studies with Probuphine.

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In addition to the final Phase 3 clinical study mentioned above, Probuphine has been evaluated previously in the following Phase 3 clinical studies:

&#160;

&#8226; Two six-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled safety and efficacy trials; one of which included an open label, active control (Suboxone). In both studies, Probuphine demonstrated superiority to placebo implants, and in the second study, established non-inferiority in comparison to Suboxone; &#160;

&#8226; Two six-month, open-label re-treatment safety trials; and &#160;

&#8226; A pharmacokinetic (relative bioavailability) safety study. &#160;

In both placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies of Probuphine, the patients were new to buprenorphine treatment (no treatment during at least the prior 90 days) and inducted at a dose of 12-16mg/day of Suboxone over a short period. Every participant was required to provide urine samples three times a week and any missed sample was considered a positive result (i.e. urine testing positive for illicit opioid). In these studies, the primary effectiveness of the treatment with Probuphine (i.e. the primary endpoint) was established by comparing the negative urine results between the Probuphine and placebo arms using a statistical technique, specifically &#8216;the cumulative distribution function of negative urines&#8217;, which basically performs a comparative analysis on the relative proportions of negative urines between treatment groups over the time period of treatment. The patients in the Probuphine arm showed statistically significant difference in the negative urines as compared to the placebo arm in both studies demonstrating that the treatment with Probuphine was successful in reducing their usage of illicit opioids as compared to the treatment with placebo. These favorable results for Probuphine were also confirmed by a significant difference over the placebo arm in other secondary measures such as retention in treatment, withdrawal symptoms and craving for opioids, all of which are monitored by clinicians to see if a treatment is providing benefit to the patients.

&#160;

Results for the first double-blind, placebo-controlled safety and efficacy study have been published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA, October 2010) and results of the follow-on randomized three arm study with Probuphine, placebo and sublingual treatment have been published in the journal Addiction (Addiction, September 2013).

&#160;

Patients who completed the controlled studies were eligible for enrollment in six-month re-treatment studies, which provided data on up to one full year of treatment. The pharmacokinetic safety study has provided important data on the level of buprenorphine in the blood during the treatment period and gives a good profile of the safety of Probuphine. Data from all of these studies was presented at several scientific meetings, including the International Society of Addiction Medicine Annual Meetings in November 2008 and September 2011, the American Society of Addiction Medicine Annual Meetings in May 2009 and 2012, American Society of Addiction Medicine Education Forum in October 2011, and the American College of Neuropharmacology in November 2009 and 2012.

&#160;

These earlier studies were reviewed at a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA in October 2011 and together with the chemistry, manufacturing and controls (&#8220;CMC&#8221;) information formed the basis of the NDA submitted in October 2012. In March 2013, the PDAC met to review and discuss the briefing material provided by the FDA and Titan, and at the end of the meeting voted (10-4-1) in favor of approval of Probuphine. On April 30, 2013, the FDA issued a complete response letter to our NDA stating that it cannot approve the application in its present form and outlining the FDA&#8217;s request for additional clinical data demonstrating adequate clinical benefit to patients from this treatment, data from human factors testing of the training program for insertion and removal of the implant, as well as recommendations regarding product labeling, REMS and non-clinical safety data. Following a meeting with the FDA in November 2013 and subsequent communications, there was general agreement on the next steps which included the final Phase 3 study mentioned above, validation of the training program through human factor testing, and a non-clinical bridging study. All of these were successfully completed and included in the NDA which was resubmitted to the FDA at the end of August 2015.

&#160;

ProNeura-Ropinirole for Parkinson&#8217;s Disease 

&#160; 

Parkinson&#8217;s disease (PD) is a disease of the central nervous system characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons, which leads to increasing activity in the brain region that influences movement and motor function. According to the Parkinson&#8217;s Disease Foundation, more than one million people in the U.S. suffer from PD, and this number is projected to double by 2030. Early stage PD patients are treated with daily doses of drugs designed to replace dopamine in the brain. However, these therapeutics typically lose their benefits after several years of chronic treatment, and trigger serious side effect. About one-third of the treated patients develop motor response fluctuations and/or drug-induced dyskinesias within only 3 &#8722; 5 years of treatment, and these symptoms are present in almost all patients after 10 &#8722; 12 years. Clinical and nonclinical research indicates that these motor side effects arise from the pulsatile dopaminergic stimulation resulting from current oral treatment. Continuous dopaminergic stimulation (CDS) by subcutaneous infusion has been shown to palliate these motor complications, as well as to delay or prevent the onset of dyskinesias. We believe our ProNeura drug delivery technology provides a clinically-validated platform to safely and conveniently provide CDS for several months from a single treatment. Further, the subdermal placement of these implants eliminates many of the device-related complications associated with existing treatment modalities.

&#160;

We have previously conducted a non-clinical study in an MPTP Parkinsonian primate model and demonstrated that a sustained non-fluctuating plasma level of ropinirole could be delivered safely for several months following implantation and could control PD symptoms without triggering dyskenesias in severely lesioned primates. This data was presented in a poster at the 19th International Congress of Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorders in San Diego in June 2015. During 2015 we completed the following steps to advance the ropinirole implant program:

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; Optimized the implant formulation of ropinirole &#160;

&#160; &#8226; Developed the non-clinical study plan to support an IND application &#160;

&#160; &#8226; Designed a proof of concept clinical study &#160;

&#160; &#8226; Submitted the briefing material for a pre-IND meeting with the FDA in support of the ropinirole implant development program &#160;

In late February 2016 we received written comments from the FDA on the pre-IND submission, and we are now in the process of finalizing the non-clinical studies and preparing to implement the program. Our goal is to complete the non-clinical studies necessary to enable timely submission of the IND and commence a &#8216;proof of concept&#8217; clinical study in late 2016, following the potential approval of Probuphine.

&#160;

ProNeura-Triiodothyronine (T3) for hypothyroidism 

&#160;

Hypothyroidism is a disorder that occurs when the thyroid gland does not make enough thyroid hormone to meet the body&#8217;s needs.

&#160;

Thyroid hormone regulates metabolism and affects nearly every organ in the body. It is a disease affecting about 15 million Americans, mostly women. Symptoms include chronic fatigue, weight gain and obesity, dry skin, impaired mental activity, and depression. The majority of patients are diagnosed with standard blood tests and receive treatment typically consisting of synthetic prohormone thyroxine (T4) given as a once-daily oral medication (Synthroid&#174;, Levoxyl&#174;, generics), which in turn is converted in the body to the active T3. Based upon symptoms and blood tests, it is estimated that as many as 15-20 percent of hypothyroid patients are not adequately treated with this therapy, resulting in a persistent deficiency in the primary active form of thyroid hormone, T3, and physicians typically add an oral T3 regimen to the treatment of these patients.

&#160;

Once-daily synthetic T3 (Cytomel&#174;) is an effective medication for hypothyroidism but can cause potential side effects such as headache, nervousness, irritability, sweating, and cardiac arrhythmias, which are caused by the peak-and-trough blood-level fluctuations of T3 associated with standard oral delivery. Continuous delivery of T3 by the oral or parenteral route is highly desirable, but has been difficult to achieve because of the unique solubility characteristics of the compound. Thus, an implantable T3 product utilizing the ProNeura platform that more closely replicates normal thyroid physiology and avoids the unwanted side effects associated with the current pulsatile-release oral formulation could benefit patients and serve a great, unmet medical need.

&#160;

During 2015 we completed initial formulation development of the implant and conducted in-vitro and in-vivo drug release studies to further define the implant formulation. In-vivo non-clinical studies in small and large animal models are currently in progress evaluating implant formulations for drug release characteristics.

&#160;

Next steps in this program are as follows:

&#160;

&#8226; Establish proof of concept in a non-clinical model of hypothyroidism &#160;

&#8226; Establish the non-clinical study plan that will provide safety data for the IND &#160;

&#8226; Target meeting with the FDA for a pre-IND meeting before the end of 2016 &#160;

The goal is to start a proof of concept clinical study in H2-2017

&#160;

Fanapt&#174; (iloperidone) 

&#160;

Fanapt (iloperidone) is an atypical antipsychotic approved in 2009 by the FDA for the treatment of schizophrenia and in 2014 was marketed by Novartis in the U.S. Under a sublicense agreement with Novartis, we are entitled to a royalty of 8 &#8211; 10% of net sales, based on a U.S. patent that we licensed from Sanofi-Aventis. The U.S. patent expires in October 2016 (excluding a six-month pediatric extension). On December 31, 2014 Vanda Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (&#8220;Vanda&#8221;) acquired the rights to Fanapt for the U.S. and Canada from Novartis and is now marketing Fanapt in the U.S. Vanda already owned the development and commercialization rights to the oral and depot formulations of this product for the rest of the world, and by acquiring the U.S. and Canadian rights from Novartis, effectively replaces Novartis in the sublicense agreement with Titan. Patent coverage on the compound has now expired in the significant markets outside of the U.S. and no patent term extensions are possible since the product was not approved in these countries prior to patent expiration, and hence we do not expect any royalties on any future sales in such markets.

&#160;

We have entered into several agreements with Deerfield, which entitle Deerfield to most of the future royalty revenues related to Fanapt in exchange for cash and debt considerations, the proceeds of which have been used to advance the development of Probuphine and for general corporate purposes. We have retained a portion of the royalty revenue from net sales of Fanapt in excess of specified annual threshold levels; however, based on sales levels to date, it is unlikely that we will ever receive any future revenue from Fanapt. We do not incur any ongoing expenses associated with this product.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

License Agreements 

&#160;

In December 2012, we entered into a license agreement (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;) with Braeburn pursuant to which we granted Braeburn an exclusive right and license to commercialize Probuphine in the United States of America and its territories, including Puerto Rico, and Canada (the &#8220;Territory&#8221;). Under the Agreement, Braeburn made a non-refundable up-front license fee payment of $15.75 million and agreed to pay us tiered royalties on a percentage of net sales of Probuphine ranging from the mid-teens to the low twenties. Additionally, the Agreement provided for us to receive $45 million upon FDA approval of the NDA for Probuphine and at such time ownership of the NDA will transfer to Braeburn, as well as up to an additional $130 million upon the achievement of specified sales milestones and up to $35 million in regulatory milestones. We will retain all of the rights to Probuphine outside the Territory. Unless earlier terminated, the Agreement will expire on the later of (i) the 15 th anniversary of the date of product launch in the Territory or (ii) the expiration of the last to expire patent in the Territory covered by the Agreement (the &#8220;Term&#8221;). Either party may terminate the Agreement prior to the expiration of the Term in the event of a material breach by the other party that remains uncured or in the event of the other party&#8217;s bankruptcy. We may terminate the Agreement if, for reasons other than force majeure, regulatory, safety, manufacturing or product quality issues, Braeburn discontinues commercial sale of the product and fails to resume sales within 30 days following notice or in the event Braeburn or any of its affiliates or sublicensees commences any legal proceeding seeking to challenge or dispute the validity or ownership of the licensed patents. Braeburn may terminate the Agreement in the event that Braeburn, notwithstanding good faith efforts to do so, is unable to enter into an agreement for the supply of EVA or if such a supply agreement is terminated by Braeburn due to a material breach by the supplier or the supplier fails to provide EVA to Braeburn for a period of at least three months. Braeburn may also terminate the Agreement (i) on a country by country basis upon six months&#8217; notice following the occurrence of any &#8220;significant competition&#8221; in such country, as such term is defined in the Agreement; (ii) immediately upon notice if Braeburn determines in good faith that it is inadvisable to continue commercialization as a result of any actual or perceived safety issues.

&#160;

In May 2013, we entered into an amendment to the Agreement (the &#8220;Amendment&#8221;) primarily to modify certain of the termination provisions of the Agreement. The Amendment gives Braeburn the right to terminate the Agreement in the event that (A) after May 28, 2013, based on written or oral communications from or with the FDA, Braeburn reasonably determines either that the FDA will require significant development to be performed before approval of the Probuphine TM NDA can be given, such as, but not limited to, one or more additional controlled clinical studies with a clinical efficacy endpoint, or substantial post-approval commitments that may materially impact the products financial returns or that the FDA will require one or more changes in the proposed label, which change(s) Braeburn reasonably determines will materially reduce the authorized prescribed patient base, or (B) the NDA has not been approved by the FDA on or before June 30, 2014. The Amendment also provides that we will share in legal and consulting expenses in excess of a specified amount prior to approval of the NDA.

&#160;

In July 2013, we entered into a second amendment to the Agreement (the &#8220;Second Amendment&#8221;) primarily to establish and provide the parameters for a committee comprised of representatives of Titan and Braeburn responsible for and with the authority to make all decisions regarding the development and implementation of a strategic plan to seek approval from the FDA of Probuphine&#174; for subdermal use in the maintenance treatment of adult patients with opioid dependence, including development of the strategy for all written and oral communications with the FDA. The Second Amendment also makes Braeburn the primary contact for FDA communications regarding the Probuphine NDA.

&#160;

In November 2013, we entered into a stock purchase agreement pursuant to which Braeburn made a $5 million equity investment in our company and a third amendment to the Agreement (the &#8220;Third Amendment&#8221;) primarily to modify the amount and timing of the approval and sales milestone payments payable under the Agreement. Under the Third Amendment, we are entitled to receive a $15 million payment upon FDA approval of the NDA and royalties on net sales of Probuphine ranging in percentage from the mid-teens to the low twenties. The agreement also provides for up to $165 million in sales milestones and $35 in regulatory milestones. In addition, we are entitled to receive royalties on a percentage of sales in the low single digit by Braeburn, if any, of other continuous delivery treatments for opioid dependence as defined in the Third Amendment and can elect to receive low single digit royalties on sales by Braeburn, if any, of other products in the addiction market in exchange for a similar reduction in our royalties on Probuphine.

&#160;

In February 2016, Braeburn informed us that it has entered in a sublicense agreement with Knight Therapeutics, Inc.(&#8220;Knight&#8221;), a specialty pharmaceutical company, whereby Braeburn has granted to Knight the rights to commercialize Probuphine in Canada.

&#160;

In January 1997, we acquired an exclusive worldwide license under U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications relating to the use of iloperidone for the treatment of psychiatric and psychotic disorders and analgesia from Sanofi-Aventis SA (&#8220;Sanofi-Aventis&#8221;) (formerly Hoechst Marion Roussel, Inc.). The Sanofi-Aventis agreement provides for the payment of royalties on future net sales. In November 1997, we granted a worldwide sublicense, exclusive of Japan, to Novartis under which Novartis continued, at its expense, all further development of iloperidone. In April 2001, that sublicense was extended to include Japan. Under this agreement, Novartis agreed to pay Titan a royalty on future net sales of the product equal to 8% of annual worldwide net sales up to $200 million and 10% of annual worldwide net sales above $200 million, in addition to royalty payments owed by us to Sanofi-Aventis. In June 2004, Novartis granted Vanda the worldwide rights to develop and commercialize iloperidone. In October 2009, Vanda and Novartis amended and restated their sub-license agreement whereby Novartis acquired the U.S. and Canadian rights to commercialize Fanapt, the oral formulation of iloperidone approved in the U.S. Novartis also acquired the U.S. and Canadian development and commercialization rights to the depot formulation previously under development by Vanda and retained the right of first negotiation to co-market Fanapt and the depot formulation in the rest of the world. On December 31, 2014, Vanda, via a settlement transaction, reacquired from Novartis its rights and obligations relating to Fanapt in the U.S. and Canada. All of our rights and economic interests in iloperidone, including royalties on sales, remained essentially unchanged under these agreements and, as previously stated, we have entered into several agreements with a third party to sell the future royalty revenues related to Fanapt in exchange for cash and debt considerations.

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our product candidates, formulations, processes, methods and any other proprietary technologies, preserve our trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and in other countries. Our policy is to actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, the broadest intellectual property protection possible for our current product candidates and any future product candidates, proprietary information and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents, both in the United States and abroad. However, patent protection may not afford us with complete protection against competitors who seek to circumvent our patents.

&#160;

We also depend upon the skills, knowledge, experience and know-how of our management and research and development personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors. To help protect our proprietary know-how, which may not be patentable, and for inventions for which patents may be difficult to enforce, we currently rely and will in the future rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. To this end, we require all of our employees, consultants, advisors and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business.

&#160;

In June 2010, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (&#8220;USPTO&#8221;) issued a patent covering methods of using Probuphine for the treatment of opiate addiction. Titan is the owner of this patent which claims a method for treating opiate addiction with a subcutaneously implanted device comprising buprenorphine and EVA, a biocompatible copolymer that releases buprenorphine continuously for extended periods of time. This patent will expire in June 2024. A U.S. continuation application is currently pending which includes claims related to Probuphine for the treatment of chronic pain. Related patents covering use of Probuphine with the continuous delivery technology for the treatment of opiate addiction have also issued in Australia, Canada, India, Japan, Mexico and New Zealand. Further prosecution of Probuphine applications is currently proceeding at the USPTO and corresponding agencies in Europe and Hong Kong. Patents covering certain dopamine agonist implants, including ropinirole implant, have already been issued or allowed in the United States, Europe, Japan, China, Australia, Canada, South Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa, Israel and Hong Kong, while prosecution of the patent application continues in India.

&#160;

We have filed additional patent applications for a heterogeneous implant designed with some unique properties that may provide benefits to the structural integrity of the implants and potentially enhance drug delivery.

&#160;

We hold a license from Sanofi-Aventis under certain issued U.S. patents and certain issued foreign patents relating to iloperidone and its methods of use in the treatment of psychiatric disorders, psychotic disorders and analgesia. The term of the U.S. patent that covers certain aspects of our iloperidone product expires in October 2016, excluding a six month extension possible if an approval of pediatric indication is obtained.

&#160;

Future court decisions or changes in patent law might materially affect the patents or patent applications, including, but not limited to, their expiration dates.

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160;

The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition. Many companies of all sizes, including major pharmaceutical companies and specialized biotechnology companies, are engaged in the development and commercialization of therapeutic agents designed for the treatment of the same diseases and disorders that we target. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources, larger research and development staff and more experience in the regulatory approval process. Moreover, potential competitors have or may have patents or other rights that conflict with patents covering our technologies.

&#160;

With respect to Probuphine, there are no six-month implant formulations of buprenorphine on the market or in development, and the primary competition will be Indivior, PLC (formerly the Pharmaceutical business of Reckitt Benckiser Group, PLC (&#8220;Reckitt&#8221;) which markets globally a sublingual buprenorphine product (tablet and film formulations) for the treatment of opioid dependence. This product (Subutex&#174;, Suboxone&#174;), which is administered daily, holds the dominant market share of global sales and it will compete with our six-month implantable product for the maintenance treatment of opioid dependence. Additionally, two proprietary daily dosed formulations have been approved by the FDA in the past two years; the first is a sublingual tablet called Zubsolv marketed by Orexo and the second is a buccal patch called Bunavail marketed by Bio Delivery Sciences International, which, if successful in capturing market share, would compete with Probuphine. Also, during 2013 and 2014, several generic sublingual tablet formulations of buprenorphine similar to Suboxone and Subutex were approved by the FDA which are expected to compete in the opioid addiction treatment market. Other forms of buprenorphine are also in development by other companies, including intramuscular and intradermal one week and one month depot injections which, if approved, will also compete with our product. Braeburn has licensed rights to certain of such potential products and Titan is entitled to a low single digit royalty on net sales of competing products, if commercialized. The one-month depot formulations of buprenorphine are in mid-stage clinical development for the treatment of opioid dependence, and are likely to take another 2-3 years prior to approval. In 2010, Alkermes, Inc. received FDA approval to market Vivitrol&#174;, a one-month depot injection of naltrexone as a maintenance treatment for opioid dependent patients who have successfully achieved abstinence.

With respect to our potential ProNeura ropinirole product for Parkinson&#8217;s disease, the competition is primarily from numerous daily dosed dopamine agonist treatments currently in use that provide symptom relief from disease related immobility, and the complications associated with long-term levodopa therapy (e.g. dyskinesias, tolerance). Approved products in the U.S. in addition to Requip XL&#174;, which is marketed by GlaxoSmithKline, include Apokyn&#174; (US WorldMeds LLC), Parlodel&#174; (Novartis Pharmaceuticals Inc.), Mirapex ER&#174; (Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals Inc.) and Neupro&#174; (UCB Inc.). There is a strong need for products providing continuous, stable, long term delivery of dopamine and dopamine agonists and, recently, the U.S. FDA approved a product called Duodopa&#174; which is the first and only treatment delivered via catheters directly into the duodenum which is capable of providing 16 continuous hours of carbidopa and levodopa for treatment of motor fluctuations in advanced Parkinson's disease. Duodopa is marketed globally by the company Abbvie. Also, we are aware of products in development that are capable of short to medium term subcutaneous and subdermal delivery of levodopa/carbidopa using pumps, however these are still in mid-stage clinical development.

&#160;

With respect to our ProNeura T3 product for hypothyroidism, the competition is primarily from the daily dosed oral triiodothyronine (T3) liothyronine sodium tablet product; which is marketed by King Pharmaceuticals (Pfizer) as Cytomel&#174;. Generic liothyronine sodium tablet is also available from Coastal Pharmaceuticals, Mylan, and Sigma Pharmaceuticals. We are also aware of products that are being formulated for short to medium term delivery of T3; however, these are still in nonclinical development. There is a strong need for a product providing continuous, stable, long term delivery of T3 to provide physiological replacement.

&#160; 

Manufacturing 

&#160;

The manufacturing of Probuphine has primarily been conducted at DPT Laboratories, Inc., or DPT, and we have expanded the manufacturing facility at this contract manufacturer to establish commercial scale capability to support the future market launch of Probuphine and ongoing demand following potential approval by the FDA. To date, we have been operating with DPT under an arrangement pursuant to which batches of product needed for validation studies, stability testing or clinical trial purposes are acquired pursuant to purchase orders on a time and product cost basis. We have entered into a commercial manufacturing agreement with DPT that will govern the terms of the production and supply of Probuphine at such time, if ever, as the product is launched commercially. We anticipate that following approval of Probuphine, we will continue to supply and support Braeburn for a period of time until an agreement between Braeburn and DPT is established for the supply of Probuphine. We will continue to manufacture Probuphine as needed for ex-US markets.

&#160;

To date, we have obtained the supply of bupenorphine from Teva Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Teva, under an arrangement similar to the one with DPT. We have entered into a commercial supply agreement with Teva; however, we anticipate that as the product is launched commercially, Braeburn will establish an agreement with Teva for the supply of buprenorphine and our requirements of buprenorphine will be only for the ex-US markets.

&#160;

Sales and Marketing 

&#160;

We do not currently have and do not intend to establish any sales and marketing capability at this time. As our licensee, Braeburn will have sole responsibility for sales and marketing of Probuphine within the United States and, through its sublicensee, Canada. We intend to seek comparable partnering arrangements for Probuphine outside the Territory, and our current plans are to make similar arrangements for the commercialization of any additional products we may successfully develop based on our ProNeura technology.

&#160;

Government Regulation and Product Approval 

&#160;

Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing.

&#160;

FDA Approval Process 

&#160;

In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDC Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending new drug applications, or NDAs, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.

&#160;

Pharmaceutical product development in the U.S. typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of either a notice of claimed investigational exemption or an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease.

&#160;

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. 

&#160;

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practice, or GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.

&#160;

The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB&#8217;s requirements, or may impose other conditions.

&#160;

Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance, and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug.

&#160;

After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product&#8217;s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial.

&#160;

Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. Priority review can be applied to drugs that the FDA determines offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee &#8212; typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts &#8212; for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one, or more, clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP &#8212; a quality system regulating manufacturing &#8212; is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.

&#160;

After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug&#8217;s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.

&#160;

The Hatch-Waxman Act 

&#160;

In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant&#8217;s product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA&#8217;s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, pre-clinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as &#8220;generic equivalents&#8221; to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug.

&#160;

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA&#8217;s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product&#8217;s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. The ANDA application also will not be approved until any non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired. Federal law provides a period of five years following approval of a drug containing no previously approved active ingredients during which ANDAs for generic versions of those drugs cannot be submitted, unless the submission contains a Paragraph IV challenge to a listed patent &#8212; in which case the submission may be made four years following the original product approval. Federal law provides for a period of three years of exclusivity during which the FDA cannot grant effective approval of an ANDA based on the approval of a listed drug that contains previously approved active ingredients but is approved in a new dosage form, route of administration or combination, or for a new use; the approval of which was required to be supported by new clinical trials conducted by, or for, the applicant.

&#160;

Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications 

&#160;

Most drug products obtain FDA marketing approval pursuant to an NDA or an ANDA. A third alternative is a special type of NDA, commonly referred to as a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, that enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA&#8217;s previous approval of a similar product, or published literature, in support of its application. Our NDA for Probuphine was submitted under Section 505(b)(2) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and we anticipate that we will pursue this pathway for any additional therapeutic products we may develop based on our ProNeura technology. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA&#8217;s previous approval is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.

&#160;

Advertising and Promotion 

&#160;

Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for physician-directed advertising, direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet.

&#160;

Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, for example, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.

&#160;

Adverse Event Reporting and GMP Compliance 

&#160;

Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, risk minimization action plans, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality-control, drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.

&#160;

Pediatric Information 

&#160;

Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.

&#160;

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, provides NDA holders a six-month extension of any exclusivity &#8212; patent or non-patent &#8212; for a drug if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA&#8217;s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, the FDA making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers.

&#160;

Physician Drug Samples 

&#160;

As part of the sales and marketing process, pharmaceutical companies frequently provide free samples of approved drugs to physicians. The Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or the PDMA, imposes requirements and limitations upon the provision of drug samples to physicians, as well as prohibits states from licensing distributors of prescription drugs unless the state licensing program meets certain federal guidelines that include minimum standards for storage, handling, and record keeping. In addition, the PDMA sets forth civil and criminal penalties for violations.

&#160;

Controlled Substances 

&#160;

Manufacturers of controlled substances, including buprenorphine, are also subject to the licensing, quota, and regulatory requirements of the Controlled Substances Act both on the federal and state levels. Failure to comply with the Controlled Substances Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder could subject companies to loss or suspension of those licenses and to civil or criminal penalties.

&#160;

Anti-Kickback, False Claims Laws &#38; The Prescription Drug Marketing Act 

&#160;

In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include anti-kickback statutes and false claims statutes. The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce; or in return for; purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Violations of the anti-kickback statute are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor.

&#160;

Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.

&#160;

Foreign Regulatory Issues 

&#160;

Sales of pharmaceutical products outside the United States are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by a comparable regulatory authority of a foreign country must generally be obtained prior to the commencement of marketing in that country. Although the time required to obtain such approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval, the requirements for FDA approval are among the most detailed in the world and FDA approval generally takes longer than foreign regulatory approvals.
