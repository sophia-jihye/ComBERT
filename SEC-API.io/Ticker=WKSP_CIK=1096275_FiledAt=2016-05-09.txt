Narrative Description of the Business 

&#160;

Our History 

&#160;

We were originally incorporated as FSGI Corporation under the laws of the State of Florida in 1997 as a holding company for the purpose of acquiring Financial Standards Group, Inc. (FSG). That year FSGI Corporation acquired FSG, a Florida company organized in October 1989, to assist credit unions in performing financial services. FSG offered financial services to credit unions as a wholly-owned subsidiary until its sale in January 2000. 

&#160;

On December 21, 1998, FSGI Corporation, at the time a publicly traded company trading on the OTCBB as FSGI, acquired all of the outstanding common stock of The Martial Arts Network On-Line, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of The Martial Arts Network, Inc. The Martial Arts Network On-Line, Inc., a company organized under the laws of the State of Florida, was developed in 1996 by its parent company The Martial Arts Network, Inc. as an electronic forum dedicated to promoting education and awareness of martial arts through its web site. Upon issuance of shares, and options to purchase shares of FSGI Corporation's common stock to The Martial Arts Network, Inc., that company became the controlling stockholder of FSGI Corporation. 

&#160;

FSGI then changed its name to TMANglobal.com, Inc. ("TMAN") as the result of a merger between FSGI Corporation and The Martial Arts Network On-Line, Inc. on December 21, 1998. 

&#160;

Franchise Holdings was incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 2, 2003. Franchise Holdings International, Inc. completed a merger with TMAN Global.com Inc. on April 30, 2003. This merger was in the nature of a change in domicile of the Florida corporation to the State of Nevada, as well as the acquisition of a new business. Since the inception of our current business operations, we have been in the business of acquiring franchise, license and distribution rights in new and emerging growth companies. 

&#160;

On December 16, 2014, Franchise Holdings International, Inc. (FNHI) entered into a three party Definitive Share Exchange Agreement (the "Agreement") to acquire all issued and outstanding shares of TruXmart Ltd. (The Company" or TruXmart"), an Ontario (Canada) corporation located at 8820 Jane St, Vaughan, Ontario, L4K 2M9 Canada, for 40,0000,000 shares of FNHI (the "FNHI Shares"), when sufficient authorized shares are available, which will represent 75.32% of the outstanding shares of FNHI (the "Share Exchange"), calculated post-issuance. The Agreement was with Steven Rossi ("Rossi"), the sole shareholder of TruXmart and with TruXmart. Prior to the Share Exchange, Rossi held all outstanding shares of TruXmart, consisting of 4,791 Class A common shares and TruXmart owned 2,300,000 common shares of FNHI, representing an 80.961285% ownership stake in FNHI. Pursuant to the Share Exchange, Rossi acquired from TruXmart, its 2,300,000 FNHI common shares and is to acquire an additional 37,700,000 shares of FNHI from FNHI, when sufficient authorized shares are available, in exchange for all 4,791 outstanding common shares of TruXmart. TruXmart is now the wholly-owned subsidiary of FNHI, with FNHI holding all 4,791 outstanding shares of TruXmart common stock.

Operations 

&#160;

General 

&#160;

TruXmart was founded in 2011 to take advantage of the limited innovation provided by existing tonneau cover manufacturers. Tonneau covers have remained much the same in price and design since 2005 with one main company controlling a majority of the tonneau cover market. This dynamic market segment is in need of a new innovative manufacturer of high quality, functional, and aggressively priced tonneau covers. TruXmart has developed multiple products for all of the most prominent pick up trucks available in North America. Details of each product can be found at www.truxmartcovers.com. TruXmart sells its products through wholesalers in Canada and the U.S. and through third-party online retailers. 

&#160;

We completed a private placement, pursuant to Rule 506(b) of Regulation D, and raised $910,000. We are hoping to raise up to an additional $1,000,000 over the next twelve months. Also, working capital will be generated from internal operations. We also reserve the right to examine possible additional sources of funds, including, but not limited to, equity or debt offerings, borrowings, or joint ventures. Limited market surveys have never been conducted to determine demand for our now former products and services. Therefore, there can be no assurance that any of its objectives will be achieved. 

&#160;

Nature of Products and Services 

&#160;

In 2015, Full-size pickup truck sales increased 6% to 2,187,173 units in the United States in calendar year 2015, an increase of more than 120,000 units compared with 2014, in the United States. Canadian pickup truck sales stumbled at the tail end of 2015 but increased at a 5% clip in calendar year 2015, growth that was twice as fast as the overall industry, with total sales of 349,575 pickup trucks. Canadian consumers and businesses registered 333,522 new pickup trucks over the course of 2014's twelve months, a 5.4% increase compared with the 2013 calendar year. US consumers and businesses registered 1,888,665 new pickup trucks over the course of 2014's twelve months, a 4.9% increase compared with 2013. ( www.goodcarbadcar.net ) 

&#160;

Background 

&#160;

For many years, consumers have had very limited options available to them from tonneau cover manufacturers. The leading manufacturers in the North American market have had very few new model developments. The tonneau cover market can be divided into four main styles of covers: 

&#160;

1. Soft Folding &#38; Roll-up covers (Vinyl covers)

2. Hard Folding &#38; Standing Covers (Aluminum and FRP)

3. Solid one piece caps and lids (Plastic &#38; Fiberglass)

4. Retractable Covers (Plastic &#38; Aluminum)

We believe the consumer favors models that are the least cumbersome, most functional, and lowest initial cost. Solid one piece covers and retractable covers are the least desirable because of their limited functionality and overall cost. Therefore, the most popular covers in today's market are soft and hard folding/rolling tonneau covers.

Market Analysis and Distribution 

&#160;

The Specialty Equipment (aftermarket) consists of three major types of customers which include; master warehouse distributor, dealer / wholesaler, and end retail consumer. Master warehouse distributors will stock and distribute product to their customers, which are usually local dealers and wholesalers. Dealers and wholesalers are local stores which sell product to some businesses and retail consumers in their area and online. Dealers will purchase most of their product from their local distributor who will deliver to them regularly. Retail end consumers are simply the end user of your product. TruXmart currently sells its product line through distributors and dealer networks. 

&#160; The OEM market consists of vehicle manufactures with corporate offices and distribution points globally. Specifically, within North America the OEM market would consist of corporate offices and warehouses in Canada, USA, and Mexico. Target OEM's for TruXmart would be: Toyota Motor Co. Ford Motor Co. 

Nissan Motor Co. General Motors FCA Automotive (RAM Trucks) 

&#160;

Presently (2016), each vehicle manufacture above purchases their OEM brand tonneau covers (tonneau cover installed at the factory) from an independent accessory manufacturer, such as TruXmart. No vehicle manufacturer designs and manufacturers their own tonneau covers. 

&#160;

TruXmart's target market includes master warehouse distributors and dealers. 

&#160;

In the Canadian market, TruXmart does the majority of its business with warehouse distributors, and select dealer customers. In the US market, TruXmart's customer base is mostly dealers and wholesalers. 

&#160;

TruXmart USA is a supplying member of one of the largest aftermarket buying groups in the USA. American Aftermarket Group (AAG), owned by Line-X coatings, consists of over 700 car and truck accessory stores. Being a supplying member of AAG gives TruXmart access to most of the large truck accessory dealers, wholesalers, and online stores in the USA. Our products are sold to AAG members by the sales staff at AAG and all customer service and maintenance is done through phone calls, emails, and infrequent visits. 

&#160;

TruXmart Canada sells to only select dealers in Ontario as well as the largest warehouse distributor in eastern Canada. Robert Thibert in Ch&#226;teauguay, QC has over 600,000 square feet of warehouse space in three provinces in Canada. Robert Thibert is responsible for stocking and selling our product to their customer base in Canada. TruXmart dealer sales in Ontario are to only select dealers who assist with product feedback.

&#160;

The Extang (TruckHero) Trifecta retails in the USA for $425. The Tonno Pro Tri Fold retails for $269. The Rugged Liner Tri Fold retails for $329. Whereas the TruXmart Tri Fold retails for CAD$259; US$239.

They account for the majority of the competing brands in North America. 

&#160;

The area of biggest growth in the tonneau cover market is in the area of aggressively priced hard folding tonneau covers. Currently, the market distribution is shared by three primary participants, with LKQ/Keystone considered the market leader. 

&#160;

Sales, Marketing and Distribution Strategy 

&#160;

TruXmart's sales strategy is constantly changing and dynamic. Sales are made through warehouse distributors, as they typically handle product sales and promotion through their in-house sales department. To fully saturate the market a business must entice the retail consumer to purchase its product by way of a strong internet presence which will consist of YouTube videos and commercials, an interactive website, search engine optimization, social media, etc. The next step is to have strong working relationships and reputations among dealers and wholesalers who purchase TruXmart's product, either directly or through distributors. 

&#160;

TruXmart hopes to become the leader in the tonneau cover market through innovation. Our main objective is to design and engineer our products to better suit todays new, dynamic, and innovative models of light trucks. 

&#160;

TruXmart hopes to become a significant player in our market segment by always maintaining a strong emphasis on customer service, innovation, quality, and a robust global branding. 

&#160;

&#160; 7 

&#160; 

&#160; TruXmart's target market is North, Central, and South America with future plans to expand globally to other market opportunities. TruXmart intends to earn revenues from both the automotive specialty equipment market as well as OEM production for vehicle manufactures, globally. 

&#160;

TruXmart also plans to gain market share and core value by internally engineering our products to best suit the evolving needs of the consumer as well as a strong intellectual property portfolio (1 Granted Patent, 3 provisional patents &#8211; as of 2015) 

&#160;

The Company's current product lines are as follows: 

&#160;

1. TruXmart Tri Fold (introduced in 2011) 

&#160;

The TruXmart Tri Fold is our staple soft folding tonneau cover. The Tri Fold is made with features such as stainless steel hardware, double coated vinyl tarp, and all aluminum and plastic coated front clamps. The Tri Fold is made available to our customer base at an average cost savings of 5% over competing products. 

&#160;

2. TruXmart Smart Fold (introduced in 2012) 

&#160;

The TruXmart Smart Fold is our second product to market and offers our patented rear Smart Latch system. The Smart Fold is the first innovation in the rear latching system offered on soft folding tonneau covers. The Smart Fold cover comes with all of the same features as the Tri Fold but with a new rear latch system that allows the cover to be opened by simply pulling a release cable which is a new innovation in the soft tri fold segment of our market. 

&#160;

The Company introduced three new products at the Specialty Equipment Manufacturers Association (SEMA) show in Las Vegas in November 2014. These products were the following: 

&#160;

3. TruXmart Forte (DISCONTINUED DECEMBER 1, 2015 ) 

&#160;

The TruXmart Forte was the world's first completely solid folding tonneau cover to be constructed using powder coated galvanized steel. The TruXmart Forte was also the first tonneau cover to come with a removable tool bag that acts as a cargo divider when installed. This tool bag could be removed from the tonneau cover, zippered together, and carried using a shoulder or hand strap. 

&#160;

4. TruXmart Quad-Fold 

&#160;

The TruXmart Quad-Fold will be the first vinyl wrapped tonneau cover to fold in four sections. This cover will also allow its users full bed access by being foldable upwards towards the rear window of the truck. We chose to make the world's first quad folding cover so this cover is more compact when standing parallel to the back window of a truck, thus eliminating wind resistance and rear window obstruction. 

&#160;

5. TruXmart Roll-Up 

&#160;

The TruXmart Roll-Up cover takes from a long history of roll up covers in our market place. Although roll-up style covers have been in the market since the early 90's, the TruXmart Roll-Up will offer a sleek, low-profile design, superior side seals, and rear smart latches that will allow its user to open this cover by simply pulling on the rear release loop. 

&#160;

&#160; &#160;

6. TruXmart Forte (2 st Gen &#8211; Estimated launch in Q2, 2016 ) 

&#160;

Taking valuable information learned from the launch of the first generation TruXmart Forte. The all-new redesigned TruXmart Forte "GEN2" has been engineered to be easy to install and operate while being offered at an MAP price that fills a much needed void between soft and hard tonneau covers. 

&#160;

The GEN2 Forte cover will now be built using 6MM thick aluminum panels with a robust honeycomb core, coated in a durable matte-black scratch resistant powder coating. The GEN2 Forte cover will be 30% lighter and cost 25-30% less to manufacture. With robust packaging, the lighter weight GEN2 Forte will also save time and money with up to 10% more load quantity in a standard 40' HC container, therefore maximizing value and product profitability. Notably, the GEN2 Forte will not come with the same cargo-division and tool bags as its predecessor, as cargo division and storage solutions are being closely reviewed and implemented with the TruXmart Alpha series of products. 

&#160;

The GEN2 Forte will be manufactured as a TruXmart branded product as well as a cornerstone product for private label manufacturing in North, Central, and South American markets. 

&#160;

In addition, we are currently re-engineering the TruXmart Smart Fold latch system based on consumer feedback. As a consequence, the next generation Smart Fold covers will be far easier to install and will be available for both domestic and imported light trucks. 

&#160;

TruXmart also launched its new Alpha series of tonneau covers at SEMA 2015. The Alpha products are set to be released late 2016. 

&#160;

Production and Delivery 

&#160;

TruXmart products are manufactured to our specifications and design in China. All of our soft (vinyl) covers are made in a factory in Ningbo, China. All future TruXmart hard products are expected to be manufactured in Jiangsu, China. Our soft cover factory is capable of producing 3,000 pieces per month and our hard cover factory is capable of producing 1,500 pieces per month. Production at both factories can be increased within thirty days to facilitate volumes up to ten times the Chinese contract manufacturers' current output without any stress on their capacity. 

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

Currently, we employ 2 full-time persons. We may hire additional employees in the future to facilitate anticipated growth projections. We reimburse our employee for all necessary and customary business related expenses. 

&#160;

We have no plans or agreements which provide health care, insurance or compensation on the event of termination of employment or change in our control.
