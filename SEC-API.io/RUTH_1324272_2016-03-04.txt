BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Introduction 

&#160; 

Ruth&#8217;s Hospitality Group, Inc. develops and operates fine dining restaurants under the trade name Ruth&#8217;s Chris Steak House. As of December 27, 2015, there were 148 Ruth&#8217;s Chris Steak House restaurants, including 67 Company-owned restaurants, one restaurant operating under a management agreement and 80 franchisee-owned restaurants, including 20 international franchisee-owned restaurants in Aruba, Canada, China, Hong Kong, El Salvador, Japan, Mexico, Panama, Singapore, Taiwan and the United Arab Emirates. 

&#160; 

The Company previously operated eighteen Mitchell&#8217;s Fish Markets and three Mitchell&#8217;s/Cameron&#8217;s Steakhouse restaurants (the Mitchell&#8217;s Restaurants), located primarily in the Midwest and Florida. On January 21, 2015, the Company sold the Mitchell&#8217;s Restaurants to a third party. For financial reporting purposes, the Mitchell&#8217;s Restaurants are classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented and, as of December 28, 2014, the assets are classified as held for sale. 

&#160; 

The Company has a 52/53-week fiscal year ending the last Sunday in December. The 2015 fiscal year ended December 27, 2015, the 2014 fiscal year ended December 28, 2014, and the 2013 fiscal year ended December 29, 2013. Fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013 all had 52 weeks.

Background 

&#160; 

The year 2015 marked the 50th anniversary of the founding of Ruth&#8217;s Chris Steak House. The Company was founded in 1965 when Ruth Fertel mortgaged her home for $22 thousand to purchase the &#8220;Chris Steak House,&#8221; a 60-seat restaurant located near the New Orleans Fair Grounds racetrack. After a fire destroyed the original restaurant, Ruth relocated her restaurant to a new 160-seat facility nearby. As the terms of the original purchase prevented the use of the &#8220;Chris Steak House&#8221; name at a new restaurant, Ruth added her name to that of the original restaurant&#8212;thus creating the &#8220;Ruth&#8217;s Chris Steak House&#8221; brand. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s expansion began in 1972, when Ruth opened a second restaurant in Metairie, a suburb of New Orleans. In 1976, the first franchisee-owned Ruth&#8217;s Chris Steak House opened in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. In 2005, the Company and certain selling shareholders completed an initial public offering of the Company&#8217;s common stock, which is currently listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol &#8220;RUTH&#8221;. 

&#160;

Additionally, many of our restaurants continue to be ranked best steakhouse by local publications in the areas in which they operate.

The menu features a broad selection of high-quality USDA Prime and Choice grade steaks and other premium offerings served in Ruth&#8217;s Chris&#8217; signature fashion&#8212;&#8220;sizzling&#8221;&#8212;complemented by other traditional menu items inspired by its New Orleans heritage. Ruth&#8217;s Chris complements its distinctive food offerings with an award-winning wine list. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The Ruth&#8217;s Chris brand reflects its 50-year commitment to the core values instilled by its founder, Ruth Fertel, of caring for guests by delivering the highest quality food, beverages and genuine hospitality in a warm and inviting atmosphere. 

&#160; 

Mitchell&#8217;s Restaurants 

&#160; 

The Company acquired the Mitchell&#8217;s Restaurants in 2008. Mitchell&#8217;s Fish Market is an eighteen-restaurant upscale seafood concept and Mitchell&#8217;s/Cameron&#8217;s Steakhouse is a modern American steakhouse concept. 

&#160; 

In November 2014, the Company and Landry&#8217;s, Inc. and Mitchell&#8217;s Entertainment, Inc., an affiliate of Landry&#8217;s Inc. (together with Landry&#8217;s Inc., Landry&#8217;s), entered into an asset purchase agreement (the Agreement). Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company agreed to sell the Mitchell&#8217;s Restaurants and related assets to Landry&#8217;s for $10 million. The sale of the Mitchell&#8217;s Restaurants closed on January 21, 2015. The assets sold consisted primarily of leasehold interests, leasehold improvements, restaurant equipment and furnishings, inventory, and related intangible assets, including brand names and trademarks associated with the 21 Mitchell&#8217;s Restaurants. Under the terms of the Agreement, Landry&#8217;s assumed the Mitchell&#8217;s Restaurants&#8217; facility lease obligations and the Company will reimburse Landry&#8217;s for gift cards sold prior to the closing date and used at the Mitchell&#8217;s Restaurants during the eighteen months following the closing date. Landry&#8217;s offered employment to substantially all of the employees of the Mitchell&#8217;s Restaurants. 

&#160; 

Strengths 

&#160; 

The Company believes that the key strengths of its business model are the following: 

&#160; 

Premier Upscale Steakhouse Brand 

&#160; 

The Ruth&#8217;s Chris Steak House brand is one of the strongest in the upscale steakhouse segment of the restaurant industry, with high levels of brand awareness. In 2015, Ruth&#8217;s Chris Steak House was again the #1 Consumer Pick in the Nation&#8217;s Restaurant News annual survey for the fine dining category. Additionally, many of our restaurants continue to be ranked best steakhouse by local publications in the areas in which they operate. In addition, the Company has been recognized for its award-winning core wine list, for which a majority of its Company-owned restaurants received &#8220;Awards of Excellence&#8221; from Wine Spectator magazine. 

&#160; 

Appealing Dining Experience 

&#160; 

At the Ruth&#8217;s Chris restaurants, the Company seeks to exceed guests&#8217; expectations by offering high-quality food with warm, friendly service. The Company&#8217;s entire restaurant staff is dedicated to ensuring that guests enjoy a superior dining experience. The Company&#8217;s team-based approach to table service is designed to enhance the frequency of guest contact and speed of service without intruding on the guest experience. 

&#160; 

Strategy 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s strategy is to deliver a total return to shareholders by maintaining a healthy core business, growing with a disciplined investment approach and returning excess capital to shareholders. The Company strives to maintain a healthy core business by growing sales through traffic, managing operating margins and leveraging infrastructure. The Company is committed to disciplined growth in markets with attractive sales attributes and solid financial returns. The Company believes that its franchisee program is a point of competitive differentiation and looks to grow its franchisee-owned restaurant locations as well. The Company also will consider acquiring franchisee-owned restaurants at terms that it believes are beneficial to both the Company and the franchisee. 

&#160; 

Improve Sales/Profitability 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Expand Relationships with New and Existing Franchisees and Others 

&#160; 

The Company intends to grow its franchising business by developing relationships with a limited number of new franchisees and by expanding the rights of existing franchisees to open new restaurants. The Company believes that building relationships with quality franchisees is a cost-effective way to grow and strengthen the Ruth&#8217;s Chris brand and generate additional revenues. The Company intends to continue to focus on providing operational guidance to its franchisees, including the sharing of &#8220;best practices&#8221; from Company-owned Ruth&#8217;s Chris restaurants. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Franchisees opened 57 Ruth&#8217;s Chris restaurants from 1999 through the end of 2015.

In addition, a franchise restaurant opened in 2013 in Las Vegas, NV under a licensing agreement with Harrah&#8217;s Casino under which we receive a fee based on a percentage of sales. Franchisees are expected to open six new restaurants by the end of fiscal year 2017. 

&#160; 

The Company and its franchise and licensing partners will have opened or relocated nineteen new Ruth&#8217;s Chris Steak Houses worldwide during the three year period ended December 2015. 

&#160; 

Menu 

&#160; 

The Ruth&#8217;s Chris menu features a broad selection of high-quality USDA Prime grade steaks and other premium offerings served in Ruth&#8217;s Chris signature fashion&#8212;&#8220;sizzling&#8221; on a 500 degree plate and topped with butter&#8212;complemented by other Classic American steakhouse menu items. USDA Prime is the highest meat grade level, which refers to the superior quality and evenly distributed marbling that enhances the flavor of the steak. The Ruth&#8217;s Chris menu also includes premium quality lamb chops, fish, shrimp, crab, chicken and lobster. Dinner entr&#233;es are generally priced from $28 to $85. Ruth&#8217;s Chris is predominantly open dinner hours only with a limited number of restaurants open for lunch. The lunch menu offers entr&#233;es generally ranging in price from $13 to $27. The blended guest check average at Ruth&#8217;s Chris was approximately $79 during fiscal year 2015. While the Ruth&#8217;s Chris core menu is similar at all of its restaurants, the Company seasonally introduces new items such as specials and prix fixe offerings that allow it to give its guests additional choices while taking advantage of fresh sourcing and advantageous cost opportunities. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s Ruth&#8217;s Chris restaurants offer ten to thirteen standard appetizer items, including New Orleans-style barbequed shrimp, mushrooms stuffed with crabmeat, shrimp remoulade, lobster bisque and osso bucco ravioli, as well as six to eight different salads. They also offer a variety of potatoes and vegetables as side dishes. For dessert, cr&#232;me br&#251;l&#233;e, bread pudding, cheesecake, fresh seasonal berries with sweet cream sauce and other selections are available. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s wine list features bottles typically ranging in price from $40 to over $1,000. Individual restaurants supplement their 250-bottle core wine list with approximately 20 additional selections that reflect local market tastes. Most of the Company&#8217;s Ruth&#8217;s Chris restaurants also offer approximately 39 wines-by-the-glass and numerous beers, liquors and alcoholic dessert drinks. Wine sales account for approximately 58% of the total beverage sales. 

&#160; 

Restaurant Operations and Management 

&#160; 

The Ruth&#8217;s Chris President and Chief Operating Officer has primary responsibility for managing Company-owned restaurants and participates in analyzing restaurant-level performance and strategic planning. The Company has nine regional vice presidents that oversee restaurant operations at Company-owned restaurants and one vice president that has oversight responsibility for franchisee-owned restaurants. In addition, restaurant education and training is overseen by a regional staff dedicated to the ongoing training and development of customer service employees and kitchen staff. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s typical Company-owned restaurant employs five managers, including a general manager, two front-of-the-house managers, an executive chef and a sous chef. The Company-owned restaurants also typically have approximately 70 hourly employees. 

&#160; 

Purchasing 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s ability to maintain consistent quality throughout its restaurants depends in part upon its ability to acquire food and other supplies from reliable sources in accordance with its specifications. Purchasing at the restaurant level is directed primarily by the executive chef, who is trained in the Company&#8217;s purchasing philosophy and specifications, and who works with regional and corporate managers to ensure consistent sourcing of meat, fish, produce and other supplies. 

&#160; 

During fiscal year 2015, the Company purchased substantially all of the beef it used in Company-owned Ruth&#8217;s Chris restaurants from two vendors, Sysco Food Services and Stock Yards Packing (a subsidiary of US Foods). Each vendor supplied about half of the Company&#8217;s beef requirements. In addition, the Company has a distribution arrangement with a national food and restaurant supply distributor, Distribution Market Advantage, Inc. (DMA), which purchases products for the Company from various suppliers and through which all of the Company-owned Ruth&#8217;s Chris Steak House restaurants receive a significant portion of their food supplies. 

&#160; 

Quality Control 

&#160; 

The Company strives to maintain quality and consistency in its Company-owned restaurants through careful training and supervision of personnel and standards established for food and beverage preparation, maintenance of facilities and conduct of personnel. The primary goal of the Company&#8217;s training and supervision programs is to ensure that its employees display the characteristics of its brand and values that distinguish it from its competitors. Restaurant managers in Company-owned restaurants must complete a training program that is typically seven to eight weeks long, during which they are instructed in multiple areas of restaurant management, including food quality and preparation, guest service, alcoholic beverage service, liquor regulation compliance and employee relations. Restaurant managers also receive operations manuals relating to food and beverage preparation and restaurant operations. Restaurant managers are certified by the National Restaurant Association Educational Foundation for food safety. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

The Ruth&#8217;s Chris Steak House restaurants also employ an independent third-party food safety firm to ensure proper training, food safety and the achievement of the highest standards for cleanliness throughout the restaurant through routine quarterly unannounced inspections. The Company instructs chefs and assistants on safety, sanitation, housekeeping, repair and maintenance, product and service specifications, ordering and receiving food products and quality assurance. 

&#160; 

Throughout each day at the Ruth&#8217;s Chris restaurants, the executive chef, together with the restaurant managers, oversees a line check system of quality control and must complete a quality assurance checklist verifying the flavor, presentation and proper temperature of the food and beverages. 

&#160; 

Marketing and Promotions 

&#160; 

The goals of the Company&#8217;s marketing efforts are to increase restaurant sales by attracting new guests, increasing the frequency of visits by current guests, improving brand recognition in new markets or markets where it intends to open a restaurant and to communicate the overall uniqueness, value and quality exemplified by our restaurants. The Company uses multiple media channels to accomplish these goals and complements its national advertising with targeted local media such as print, digital media, radio and outdoor billboards. 

&#160; 

Advertising 

&#160; 

In fiscal year 2015, the Company spent $10.9 million, or 2.9% of its revenues, in total marketing and advertising expenditures, which included spending on national media, consisting primarily of national cable television advertisements, online initiatives and consumer research. During fiscal year 2015, the Company continued to optimize its online marketing efforts, using a variety of tactics. The Company&#8217;s online strategy also included an emphasis on targeted emails with special offers and announcements, as well as emails regarding seasonal specials, holiday offers and personalized birthday and anniversary invitations. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, the Company ran national television advertising across a targeted selection of cable channels and invested in online advertising. In fiscal year 2015, Ruth&#8217;s Chris Steak House continued its participation in co-branded campaign with American Express Membership Rewards program. Many of the Company&#8217;s restaurants also schedule events to strengthen community ties and increase local market presence. The Company&#8217;s franchisees also conduct their own local media and advertising plans. 

&#160; 

Gift Cards 

&#160; 

The Company sells Ruth&#8217;s Chris gift cards at most of its Ruth&#8217;s Chris Steak House restaurants, including franchises, on its website and through its toll-free number. Ruth&#8217;s Chris patrons frequently purchase gift cards for holidays, including Christmas, Hanukkah, Valentine&#8217;s Day, Mothers&#8217; Day and Fathers&#8217; Day, and other special occasions. In December 2013, Ruth&#8217;s Chris began offering e-gift cards to purchasers on its e-commerce gift card website. The e-gift card is emailed directly to the recipient and is redeemable in the same manner as a plastic gift card. E-gift cards give Ruth&#8217;s Chris the opportunity to maximize last-minute gift-giving and address its patrons&#8217; requests for convenient, immediate purchases. In fiscal year 2015, system-wide gift card Company and franchise sales of Ruth&#8217;s gift cards aggregated approximately $59 million. Ruth&#8217;s Chris gift cards are redeemable at both Company and franchisee owned Ruth&#8217;s Chris restaurants. 

&#160; 

Franchise Program and Relationship 

&#160; 

Under the Company&#8217;s franchise program, the Company offers certain services and licensing rights to the franchisee to help maintain consistency in system-wide operations. The Company&#8217;s services include training of personnel, construction assistance, providing the new franchisee with standardized operating procedures and manuals, business and financial forms, consulting with the new franchisee on purchasing and supplies and performing supervisory quality control services. The Company conducts reviews of its franchisee-owned restaurants on an ongoing basis in order to ensure compliance with its standards. 

&#160; 

As of December 27, 2015, the Company&#8217;s 80 franchisee-owned Ruth&#8217;s Chris restaurants are owned by 30 franchisees with the three largest franchisees owning 29 restaurants in total. Currently, franchisees have agreed to open six additional Ruth&#8217;s Chris restaurants, which are expected to open by the end of fiscal year 2017. 

&#160; 

Under the Company&#8217;s current franchise program, each franchise arrangement consists of a development agreement, if multiple restaurants are to be developed, with a separate franchise agreement executed for each restaurant. The Company&#8217;s current form of development agreement grants exclusive rights to a franchisee to develop a minimum number of restaurants in a defined area, typically during a three-to-five-year period. Individual franchise agreements govern the operation of each restaurant opened and have a 20-year term with two renewal options each for additional ten-year terms if certain conditions are met. The Company&#8217;s current form of franchise agreement requires franchisees to pay a 5% royalty on gross revenues plus up to a 1% advertising fee applied to national advertising expenditures. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Under the Company&#8217;s current form of development agreement, and unless agreed otherwise, the Company collects a $50 thousand development fee, which is credited toward the $150 thousand franchise fee, for each restaurant the franchisee has rights to develop. Under the Company&#8217;s current form of the franchise agreement, it collects up to $150 thousand of the full franchise fee at the time of executing the franchise agreement for each restaurant. If one restaurant is to be developed, a single unit franchise agreement is executed and the $150 thousand franchise fee is collected at signing. 

&#160; 

Information Systems and Restaurant Reporting 

&#160; 

All of the Company&#8217;s restaurants use computerized point-of-sale systems, which are designed to promote operating efficiency, provide corporate management timely access to financial and marketing data and reduce restaurant and corporate administrative time and expense. These systems record each order and print the food requests in the kitchen for the cooks to prepare. The data captured for use by operations and corporate management includes gross sales amounts, cash and credit card receipts and quantities of each menu item sold. Sales and receipts information is generally transmitted to the corporate office daily. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s corporate systems provide management with operating reports that show Company-owned restaurant performance comparisons with budget and prior year results. These systems allow the Company to monitor Company-owned restaurant sales, food and beverage costs, labor expense and other restaurant trends on a regular basis. 

&#160; 

Service Marks 

&#160; 

The Company has registered the main service marks &#8220;Ruth&#8217;s Chris&#8221; and its &#8220;Ruth&#8217;s Chris Steak House, U.S. Prime &#38; Design&#8221; logo, as well as other service marks used by its restaurants, with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in the foreign countries in which its restaurants operate. The Company has also registered in other foreign countries in anticipation of new store openings within those countries. The Company is not aware of any infringing uses that could materially affect its business. The Company believes that its service marks are valuable to the operation of its restaurants and are important to its marketing strategy. 

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Historically, the percentage of its annual revenues earned during the first and fourth fiscal quarters have been higher due, in large part, to increased restaurant sales during the year-end holiday season and the popularity of dining out in the fall and winter months. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 27, 2015, the Company employed 4,350 persons, of whom 434 were salaried and 3,916 were hourly personnel, who were employed in the positions set forth in the table below. None of the Company&#8217;s employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement .

Financial Information about Segments 

&#160; 

The Company-owned Ruth&#8217;s Chris Steak House restaurants in North America are managed as an operating segment. The Ruth&#8217;s Chris restaurants operate within the full-service dining industry, providing similar products to similar customers. The franchise operations are also considered to be an operating segment. Financial information concerning the Company&#8217;s segments for financial reporting purposes appears in Note 17 of the consolidated financial statements. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

The Company is subject to extensive federal, state and local government regulation, including regulations relating to public health and safety, zoning and fire codes and the sale of alcoholic beverages and food. The Company maintains the necessary restaurant, alcoholic beverage and retail licenses, permits and approvals. Federal and state laws govern the Company&#8217;s relationship with its employees, including laws relating to minimum wage requirements, overtime, tips, tip credits and working conditions. A significant number of the Company&#8217;s hourly employees are paid at rates related to the federal or state minimum wage. During 2015, governmental entities acted to increase minimum wage rates in several jurisdictions wherein Company-owned restaurants are located. Additionally, the federal government may act to increase the U.S. federal minimum wage rate. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The offer and sale of franchises are subject to regulation by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and many states. The FTC requires that the Company furnish to prospective franchisees a franchise disclosure document containing prescribed information. A number of states also regulate the sale of franchises and require state registration of franchise offerings and the delivery of a franchise disclosure document to prospective franchisees. The Company&#8217;s noncompliance could result in governmental enforcement actions seeking a civil or criminal penalty, rescission of a franchise, and loss of its ability to offer and sell franchises in a state, or a private lawsuit seeking rescission, damages and legal fees. 

&#160; 

The Company is subject to laws and regulations relating to the preparation and sale of food, including regulations regarding product safety, nutritional content and menu labeling. The Company is, or will become, subject to laws and regulations requiring disclosure of calorie, fat, trans fat, salt and allergen content. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA) requires restaurant companies, such as the Company, to disclose calorie information on their menus beginning in December 2016. The Food and Drug Administration has rules to implement this provision that would require restaurants to post the number of calories for most items on menus or menu boards and to make available more detailed nutrition information upon request. A number of states, counties and cities have also enacted menu labeling laws requiring restaurant companies, such as the Company, to disclose certain nutrition information on their menus, or have enacted legislation restricting the use of certain types of ingredients in restaurants. Although the ACA is intended to preempt conflicting state and local laws regarding nutrition labeling, the Company will be subject to a patchwork of state and local laws and regulations regarding nutritional content disclosure requirements until the Company is required to comply with the federal law. Many of the current requirements are inconsistent or are interpreted differently from one jurisdiction to another. The effect of such labeling requirements on consumer choices, if any, is unclear at this time. 

&#160; 

The Company maintains an employee benefits program that provides self-insured and insured coverage to employees that meet the applicable requirements under the program. Employees can elect to enroll dependents that meet eligibility criteria. Coverage includes health, dental, vision, short- and long-term disability, life insurance and other voluntary ancillary benefits. Employees share in the cost of other coverage at varying levels. The Company has historically funded a majority of the cost of employee health benefits. The ACA requires that employers offer health care coverage that is qualified and affordable. Coverage must be offered to all &#8220;full-time&#8221; employees, as defined by the ACA. The Company routinely reviews its health benefit plans to assure conformity with the ACA. The hours of service eligibility criteria the Company requires for health benefits are lower than required under the ACA. Approximately 65% of eligible employees elect to participate in the Company&#8217;s health benefit plans. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The restaurant business is highly competitive and highly fragmented, and the number, size and strength of the Company&#8217;s competitors vary widely by region. The Company believes that restaurant competition is based on, among other things, quality of food products, customer service, reputation, restaurant location, atmosphere, name recognition and price. The Company&#8217;s restaurants compete with a number of upscale steakhouses and upscale casual seafood restaurants within their markets, both locally owned restaurants and restaurants within regional or national chains. The principal upscale steakhouses with which the Company competes are Fleming&#8217;s, The Capital Grille, Smith &#38; Wollensky, The Palm, Del Frisco&#8217;s Double Eagle Steakhouse, Fogo de Ch&#227;o and Morton&#8217;s The Steakhouse. The Company&#8217;s competitors may be better established in certain of the Company&#8217;s existing markets and/or markets into which the Company intends to expand. 

&#160;
