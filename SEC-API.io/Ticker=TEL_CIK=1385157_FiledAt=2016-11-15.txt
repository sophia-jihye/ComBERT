Customers 

As an industry leader, we have established close working relationships with many of our customers. These relationships allow us to better anticipate and respond to customer needs when designing new products and new technical solutions. By working with our customers in developing new products and technologies, we believe we are able to identify and act on trends and leverage knowledge about next-generation technology across our products. 

Our approach to our customers is driven by our dedication to further develop our product families and ensure that we are globally positioned to best provide our customers with sales and engineering support. We believe that as electronic component technologies continue to proliferate, our broad product portfolio and engineering capability give us a potential competitive advantage when addressing the needs of our global customers. 

We manufacture and sell a broad portfolio of products to customers in various industries. Our customers include many of the leaders in their respective industries, and our relationships with them typically date back many years. We believe that this diversified customer base provides us an opportunity to leverage our skills and experience across markets and reduce our exposure to individual end markets, thereby reducing the variability of our financial performance. Additionally, we believe that the diversity of our customer base reduces the level of cyclicality in our results and distinguishes us from our competitors. 

There is no single customer that accounted for a significant amount of our net sales in fiscal 2016, 2015, or 2014. 

Sales and Distribution 

We maintain a strong local presence in each of the geographic regions in which we operate. Our net sales by geographic region (1) as a percentage of our total net sales were as follows: 

&#160; &#160; Fiscal &#160; &#160; &#160; 2016 &#160; 2015 &#160; 2014 &#160; Americas (2) &#160; &#160; 34 % &#160; 34 % &#160; 30 % Europe/Middle East/Africa ("EMEA") &#160; &#160; 34 &#160; &#160; 33 &#160; &#160; 35 &#160; Asia&#150;Pacific &#160; &#160; 32 &#160; &#160; 33 &#160; &#160; 35 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Total &#160; &#160; 100 % &#160; 100 % &#160; 100 % &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; 

(1) Net sales to external customers are attributed to individual countries based on the legal entity that records the sale. (2) The Americas region includes our subsea communications business. 

See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional geographic information relating to our business. 

We sell our products into approximately 150 countries primarily through direct selling efforts to manufacturers. We also sell some of our products indirectly via third-party distributors. In fiscal 2016, our direct sales represented 80% of total net sales. 

We maintain distribution centers around the world. Our global coverage positions us near our customers' locations and allows us to assist them in consolidating their supply base and lowering their production costs. We believe our balanced sales distribution lowers our exposure to any particular geography and improves our financial profile. 

Products are generally delivered to distribution centers by our manufacturing facilities and then subsequently delivered to the customer. In some instances, however, product is delivered directly from our manufacturing facility to the customer. We contract with a wide range of transport providers to deliver our products via road, rail, sea, and air. 

Seasonality and Backlog 

We experience a slight seasonal pattern to our business. Overall, the third and fourth fiscal quarters are typically the strongest quarters of our fiscal year, whereas the first fiscal quarter is negatively affected by winter holidays and the second fiscal quarter may be affected by adverse winter weather conditions in some of our markets. 

Certain of our end markets experience some seasonality. Our sales into the automotive market are dependent upon global automotive production, and seasonal declines in European production may negatively impact net sales in the fourth fiscal quarter. Also, our sales into the energy market typically increase in the third and fourth fiscal quarters as customer activity increases. 

Customer orders typically fluctuate from quarter to quarter based upon business conditions and cancellation of unfilled orders prior to shipment of goods. Backlog by reportable segment was as follows: 

&#160; &#160; Fiscal Year End &#160; &#160; &#160; 2016 &#160; 2015 &#160; &#160; &#160; (in millions) &#160; Transportation Solutions &#160; $ 1,343 &#160; $ 1,208 &#160; Industrial Solutions &#160; &#160; 875 &#160; &#160; 814 &#160; Communications Solutions (1) &#160; &#160; 1,387 &#160; &#160; 1,310 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Total &#160; $ 3,605 &#160; $ 3,332 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; 

(1) Includes our subsea communications business' backlog of $1,047 million and $995 million at fiscal year end 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

We expect that the majority of our backlog at fiscal year end 2016 will be filled during fiscal 2017. 

Competition 

The industries in which we operate are highly competitive, and we compete with thousands of companies that range from large multinational corporations to local manufacturers. Competition is generally on the basis of breadth of product offering, product innovation, price, quality, delivery, and service. Our markets have generally been growing but with downward pressure on prices. 

Raw Materials 

We use a wide variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products. The principal raw materials that we use include plastic resins for molding; precious metals such as gold and silver for plating; and other metals such as copper, aluminum, brass, and steel for manufacturing cable, contacts, and other parts that are used for cable and component bodies and inserts. Many of these raw materials are produced in a limited number of countries around the world or are only available from a limited number of suppliers. The prices of these materials are driven by global supply and demand. 

Research and Development 

We are engaged in both internal and external research and development in an effort to introduce new products to enhance the effectiveness, ease of use, safety, and reliability of our existing products, and to expand the applications for which the uses of our products are appropriate. We continually evaluate developing technologies in areas where we may have technological or marketing expertise for possible investment or acquisition. 

Our research and development expense was as follows: 

&#160; &#160; Fiscal &#160; &#160; &#160; 2016 &#160; 2015 &#160; 2014 &#160; &#160; &#160; (in millions) &#160; Transportation Solutions &#160; $ 312 &#160; $ 262 &#160; $ 196 &#160; Industrial Solutions &#160; &#160; 136 &#160; &#160; 128 &#160; &#160; 128 &#160; Communications Solutions &#160; &#160; 118 &#160; &#160; 150 &#160; &#160; 160 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Total &#160; $ 566 &#160; $ 540 &#160; $ 484 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; 

Our capital spending and investment in product and process engineering and development enable us to consistently provide innovative, high-quality products with efficient manufacturing methods. In fiscal 2016, we derived approximately 20% of our net sales from new products, including product extensions, introduced within the previous three fiscal years. 

Intellectual Property 

Patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business. We also rely upon trade secrets, manufacturing know-how, continuing technological innovations, and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position. We review third-party proprietary rights, including patents and patent applications, as available, in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy, avoid infringement of third-party proprietary rights, identify licensing opportunities, and monitor the intellectual property claims of others. 

We own a large portfolio of patents that relate principally to electrical, optical, and electronic products. We also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents and trademarks. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. Trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the trademarks. 

While we consider our patents and trademarks to be valued assets, we do not believe that our competitive position or our operations are dependent upon or would be materially impacted by any single patent or group of related patents. 

TE Connectivity and TE Connectivity (logo) are trademarks. &#169; 2016 TE Connectivity Ltd. All Rights Reserved. 

Management Team and Employees 

We believe our management team has the experience necessary to effectively execute our strategy and advance our product and technology leadership. Our chief executive officer, president, and segment leaders average over 25 years of industry experience. They are supported by an experienced and talented management team who is dedicated to maintaining and expanding our position as a global leader in the industry. 

Our strong employee base, along with their commitment to uncompromising values, provides the foundation of our company's success. We continue to emphasize employee development and training, and we embrace diversity and inclusion. 

We have employees located throughout the world. As of fiscal year end 2016, we employed approximately 75,000 people worldwide, of whom 23,000 were in the Americas region, 28,000 were in the EMEA region, and 24,000 were in the Asia&#150;Pacific region. Of our total employees, approximately 46,000 were employed in manufacturing. 

Government Regulation and Supervision 

The import and export of products are subject to regulation by the United States ("U.S.") and other countries. A small portion of our products, including defense-related products, may require governmental import and export licenses, whose issuance may be influenced by geopolitical and other events. We have a trade compliance organization and other systems in place to apply for licenses and otherwise comply with such regulations. Any failure to maintain compliance with domestic and foreign trade regulation could limit our ability to import and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction. 

Environmental 

Our operations are subject to numerous environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, including those regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, greenhouse gas emissions, hazardous materials in products, and chemical usage. We are committed to complying with these laws 

and to the protection of our employees and the environment. We maintain a global environmental, health, and safety program that includes appropriate policies and standards; staff dedicated to environmental, health, and safety issues; periodic compliance auditing; training; and other measures. We also have a program for compliance with the European Union ("EU") Restriction of Hazardous Substances and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directives, the China Restriction of Hazardous Substances law, the EU Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals ("REACH") Regulation, and similar laws. 

Compliance with these laws has increased our costs of doing business in a variety of ways and may continue to do so in the future. For example, laws regarding product content and chemical registration require extensive and costly data collection, management, and reporting, and laws regulating greenhouse gas emissions are likely to increase our costs for energy and certain materials and products. We also have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations. Based upon our experience, current information, and applicable laws, we believe that it is probable that we will incur remedial costs in the range of $17 million to $42 million, and that the best estimate within this range is $20 million. We do not anticipate any material capital expenditures during fiscal 2017 for environmental control facilities or other costs of compliance with laws or regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions.
