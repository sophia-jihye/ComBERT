Overview 

&#160;

Brownie&#8217;s Marine Group, Inc., a Florida corporation (referred to herein as &#8220;BWMG&#8221;, &#8220;the Company&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221;, or &#8220;Brownie&#8217;s&#8221;), does business through its wholly owned subsidiary, Trebor Industries, Inc., d/b/a Brownie&#8217;s Third Lung, a Florida corporation. The Company designs, tests, manufactures and distributes recreational hookah diving, yacht based scuba air compressor and Nitrox Generation Systems, and scuba and water safety products. BWMG sells its products both on a wholesale and retail basis, and does so from its headquarters and manufacturing facility located at 3001 NW 25 th Avenue, Suite 1, Pompano Beach, Florida 33069. The Company&#8217;s common stock is quoted on the OTC Markets under the symbol &#8220;BWMG&#8221;. The Company&#8217;s website is www.Browniesmarinegroup.com . Information on the website is not a part of this report.

&#160;

Mr. Robert Carmichael, our Chief Executive Officer, has operated Trebor as its President since 1986. Since April 16, 2004, Mr. Carmichael has served as President, Acting Principal Accounting Officer and Acting Chief Financial Officer of the Company. From March 23, 2004 to April 16, 2004, Mr. Carmichael served as the Company&#8217;s Executive Vice-President and Chief Operating Officer. The company was organized under the laws of the State of Nevada and effective October 22, 2015, the Company reincorporated to the State of Florida pursuant to a plan of conversion, effective October 22, 2015.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s diving and marine based products are generally marketed under the Brownie&#8217;s Third Lung, Brownie&#8217;s Tankfill, and Brownie&#8217;s Public Safety trade names.

&#160; 

Executive Summary and Business Strategy 

&#160;

From a garage based business making hookah diving systems in the late 1960s, the Company has grown into a niche manufacturing and distribution company with dive-oriented products loosely classified into three categories: Brownie&#8217;s Third Lung (low pressure hookah systems), Brownie&#8217;s Tankfill (high pressure and mixed gas systems), and Brownie&#8217;s Public Safety (first-responder/emergency personnel systems). The Company serves middle income boat owners, higher income yacht owners, and recreational, military and public safety divers.

&#160;

The Company strives for meticulous attention to detail and high quality product innovation. We believe that within the boating/diving industry Brownie&#8217;s Marine Group is known as the industry standard for surface supplied &#8220;family&#8221; dive systems and Scuba Tankfill Systems for yacht diving. Brownie&#8217;s products and support services range from shallow-water dive systems and extend into deep-water with mixed gas support systems for exploration divers and submersibles/submarines.

&#160;

2&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The Company holds numerous patents and is dedicated to designing and building the world&#8217;s finest and most innovative products, and to setting the industry standard for the world&#8217;s best yacht-based diving systems. While Brownie&#8217;s Third Lung hookah diving units were the very first product sold by the Company, the Company recognized early on that there was a need for tank filling systems and unique diving applications. This realization was the catalyst for the addition of the two product categories: Brownie&#8217;s Tankfill and Brownie&#8217;s Public Safety. Brownie&#8217;s Tankfill designs, builds, and sells diving solutions from marine-ready tank filling compressors, Nitrox Makers&#8482;, complete dive lockers, and full submarine support systems. Brownie&#8217;s Public Safety features highly specialized diving gear for rescue and safety professionals and a unique automatic floatation device for body-armor that can also be integrated into foul weather jackets, traditional load bearing harnesses and other garments, such as the Garment Integrated Personal Flotation Device (GI-PFD) for use with body armor. The following paragraphs further describe the business and sales models for each of the categories of products sold:

&#160;

Brownie&#8217;s Third Lung hookah systems have long been a dominant figure in gasoline powered, high-performance, and feature rich hookah systems. Taking full advantage of the proprietary compressor system, a complete series of traditional &#8220;fixed speed&#8221; electric compressors were developed for the built-in-boat market in 2005. Prior to 2010, Brownie&#8217;s did not offer for sale a floating battery powered hookah due to the inadequate performance/runtime afforded by previous technology. After years of inventing, testing and development, Brownie&#8217;s introduced multiple battery powered models in 2010 that we believe provide performance and runtimes as great as 300% better than the best devices previously on the market by utilizing a variable speed technology that controls battery consumption based on diver demand. Our variable-speed battery powered hookah system provides divers with gasoline-free all day shallow diving experiences.

&#160;

Brownie&#8217;s Tankfill designs, manufactures, sells and installs Scuba tank fill systems for on-board yacht use under the brand &#8220;Yacht-Pro&#8482;&#8221;. Brownie&#8217;s Tankfill provides complete diving packages and dive training solutions for yachts. Brownie&#8217;s Tank Fill installs Nitrox systems which allow yacht owners to fill tanks with oxygen enriched air on board. The Yacht-Pro&#8482; compressor systems offer a completely marine-prepared, VFD (variable frequency drive)-driven, automated alternative to other compressors on the market. Brownie&#8217;s Tankfill also designs complete dive lockers, mixed gas production and distribution systems, and the unique Nitrox Maker&#8482;. Nitrox is oxygen-enriched air, which reduces the effects of nitrogen on divers; it is the industry standard for dive professionals. The Nitrox Maker&#8482; continuously generates the oxygen rich breathing gas directly from low-pressure air; no stored oxygen or other gases are required onboard. We believe a parallel product analogy to this device is the fresh water-maker that swept through the yachting industry over the last two-decades. While less yacht owners may opt for diving systems then fresh water-makers, there is a broad market potential for yacht owners that will want to have an uninterrupted supply of the premium breathing gas. Recently, an increase in commercial NitroxMaker&#8482; system sales has been seen as more diving operations and operators are responding to the demand from their customers to provide nitrox at diving destinations. In addition to the traditional yacht-based NitroxMaker&#8482; systems the Company has now established a full line of commercial products to meet this need, the NMCS series.

&#160;

Brownie&#8217;s Public Safety designs, manufactures, distributes, and sells the RES (Rapid Entry System)/ HELO&#8482; system, a complete mini SCUBA system designed for quick water rescues. The HELO&#8482; system can be donned in less than 60 seconds and stored in a briefcase-size padded bag. Brownie's Public Safety includes the GI-PFD&#8482; (Garment Integrated Personal Flotation Device&#8482;) System for body armor flotation. This system can reliably support the distressed or unconscious wearer in a true life-saving position. This patented device addresses a need as law-enforcement, coast guard and military personnel are beginning to wear heavy (life-threatening in the water) body armor during waterborne patrol, inspection, and surveillance missions. The system helps the personnel float in heavy armor, hopefully saving their lives. The Company is not currently pursuing aggressive expansion into this market until it has sufficient working capital to do so.

&#160;

Some of the Company&#8217;s Products in Depth 

&#160;

Surface Supplied Air Systems: The Company produces a line of Surface Supplied Diving products, commonly called hookah systems. These systems allow one to four divers to enjoy the marine environment up to a depth of 90 feet/27 meters without the bulk and weight of conventional SCUBA gear. We believe that hookah diving holds greater appeal to families with children of diving age than does conventional SCUBA. The reduction of weight by eliminating the tank allows smaller divers, especially children, to participate more actively and enjoyably. The design of our product also reduces the effort required for both its transport and use. We believe the PELETON&#8482; Hose System revolutionizes hose management for recreational surface supplied diving. It reduces the work required of any single diver by dispersing the load over the entire group. We use a single, larger diameter hose as a main downline with up to four individual hoses attached to it. This configuration not only reduces the weight and bulk of the hose required, but also reduces drag and entanglement. An entire line of deck-mounted systems is available for commercial applications that demand extremely high performance. In addition to the gasoline-powered units and the Variable Speed battery powered units mentioned above, a series of electric powered systems is also available for light to commercial duty. Powered by battery for portability or household current for virtually unlimited dive duration, these units are used primarily by businesses that work in a marine environment.

&#160;

3&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

E-Reel and Built-in Battery Systems: The Company developed two surface supplied air products that it believes makes boat diving even easier. The Built-in Battery System builds a battery powered electric unit into the boat, eliminating the need to transport the compressor/motor assembly. The need for a flotation tube is also removed, as the boat itself serves in that capacity. The E-Reel advances this idea by adding a reel system to provide compact storage of up to 150 feet/46 meters of hose. Boaters can perform their own in-water maintenance and inspections, or just dive for enjoyment. The hose is manually pulled from the reel supporting up to two divers to a depth of 50 feet/15 meters. When the dive is complete, the hose is automatically recoiled and stowed by the simple activation of a switch.

&#160;

Brownie&#8217;s Integrated Air Systems (BIAS&#8482;): Compressed air can have many uses on a boat. The E-Reel and Built in Battery Systems discussed above are just a few examples of BIAS. In addition to supplying air to divers, integrated air systems provide for the inflating fenders, opening of doors, blowing of air horns, flushing toilets and more.

&#160;

Kayak Diving Hose Kits: This product allows the use of a conventional SCUBA cylinder, but does not require the diver to wear it. The cylinder remains above the surface, in a kayak or boat, and a hose ranging from 20 feet/6 meters to 150 feet/46 meters allow the diver to explore the surrounding area.

&#160;

Drop Weight Cummerbelt: The patented Drop Weight Cummerbelt is available with all our diving systems, and brings a new dimension to weighting systems. The belt will accommodate waist sizes from 24 to 54 inches and is depth compensating. It features two pockets, each capable of holding up to 10 pounds of block or shot weight. Each pocket can be instantly released by either hand, allowing the diver to achieve positive buoyancy in an emergency while retaining the belt itself. Additionally, the design of this belt provides for expanded capability. By adding an optional sleeve that zips onto the back of the belt, an egress, or bailout system, can be added. The Egressor Add-on Kit contains the sleeve, a 6 or 13 cubic foot SCUBA cylinder, and a SCUBA regulator. In addition to the added safety inherent in this design, many other uses for this present themselves, such as propeller clearing, overboard item retrieval and pool maintenance, to name only a few.

&#160;

Tankfill Compressors: Many yacht owners enjoy the convenience and freedom of filling their own diving tanks with air, NITROX or custom mixed gases while out on cruise, freeing them from carrying extra cylinders or the need to locate a reputable source in various ports-of-call. Brownie&#8217;s Tankfill specializes in the design and installation of high-end custom systems to do just that. From surveying the vessel for installation requirements to custom fabrication of the necessary components, Tankfill provides all the services necessary to satisfy this market. We believe that every large vessel currently in service, being re-fitted, or being built is a potential customer. Through OEM relationships we have expanded our market to reach these customers. Our light duty compressor, the Yacht Pro&#8482;25 is specifically designed and built to withstand the marine environment with all components and hardware impervious to spray from the elements. The Yacht Pro&#8482; series contains models for both medium-duty applications, such as recreational divers and small groups, and heavy-duty use as found on research vessels, commercial operations and live-aboard dive boats. All Yacht Pro&#8482; models come with the Digital Frequency Drive, which is a Brownie&#8217;s Tankfill innovation. The Digital Frequency Drive eliminates the spike previously experienced in starting the compressor, eliminating the need to ration the boat&#8217;s electrical usage by shutting down components when the compressor is needed. Custom design work is done in-house for major product installations and in conjunction with other entities.

&#160;

NitroxMaker&#8482;: We believe Nitrox has become the gas of choice for informed recreational divers the world over. What was once only available from land-based gas mixing facilities is now easily accessible to the yacht diver. With a Brownie&#8217;s NitroxMaker&#8482;, the user dials-in a desired oxygen level from 21% to 40%, eliminating the need to transport and handle pure oxygen. The resulting diving gas mix is monitored with digital oxygen analyzers, removing the calculations required to blend or mix the gas.

&#160;

4&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Rapid Entry System (RES) and HELO &#8482; System: The Brownie&#8217;s Public Safety product line exists to address the needs of the public safety dive market. The inherent speed and ease of donning our patented Drop Weight Cummerbelt with Egressor Add-on Kit identified it as a choice for rapid response for water-related emergencies. A first-responder or officer on-scene can initiate the location and extraction of victims while the dive team is en-route, saving valuable time and increasing the chances for survival of victims. The RES is a small SCUBA system that can be quickly donned over clothes, usually in less than sixty seconds. Its small size allows it to be stored in areas that do not accommodate a full set of SCUBA gear. The 13 cubic foot aluminum tank can provide up to 15 minutes of air at the surface. The air cell remains stowed under the protective cover and can be partially inflated to achieve positive flotation. The cover&#8217;s specially designed break-away zipper bursts open to provide instant inflation yet &#8220;heals&#8221; and can be repacked and fastened quickly in the field. The HELO offers all the same features, but has been specially designed and modified for rescue divers working from helicopters. By placing the cylinder in the front and adding leg straps, the HELO allows divers to use the standard seating configurations. The advantages of this system over full sized SCUBA rigs are increased mobility for the diver and diminished space requirements for the gear. Since the bottle is mounted at the diver&#8217;s waist, the diver can more easily control his gear during deployment, further adding to the comfort and safety.

&#160;

The Dive Industry and Growth Strategy 

&#160;

Currently, we believe that no company in the dive industry offers a complete line of products and services to serve all divers&#8217; needs. The dive equipment manufacturing industry is highly fragmented with multiple manufacturers producing very similar products. The top-ten volume leaders in the dive manufacturing industry provide the same product mix: Scuba BC&#8217;s (buoyancy compensators), regulators, gauges, masks, fins, snorkels, wetsuits, and a few of the necessary accessories. These mature companies offer the product selection to the &#8220;diving&#8221; market.

&#160;

New markets and classes of divers have developed over the years. The sport sector of Third Lung and Kayak diving have emerged as a result of snorkel divers that wanted to sustain depth or Scuba divers that wanted more time in shallow waters with enhanced efficiency.

&#160; 

Diving and Boating Markets 

&#160;

The diving and boating markets are key to the expansion of the Brownie&#8217;s brand. Each of these industries has experienced growth over the past several decades, but we believe each industry also has significant weaknesses. The dive industry has focused on the initial certification of divers for revenue. According to industry data, follow up has been poor; causing many divers to quit diving after their first experience. When the Company&#8217;s working capital reaches a sufficient level, BWMG intends to implement a follow-up program, facilitate proper selection of equipment for divers, and institute mentoring programs.

&#160;

The boating industry was hard hit a couple years ago by the economic downturn coupled with the increase in fuel prices. We continue to work with boaters to enhance their on-water experience by exploiting the diving activities that they can easily add as an accessory to their investment in boating. Brownie&#8217;s OEM BIAS program will improve the overall value at the manufacturing level and consumer experience by elimination of waste during the design/build phase. They can blow their horns, open air-powered doors and dive directly from a BIAS package.

&#160;

Statistics 

&#160;

According to Global Certification and Membership Statistics as updated February 2014 on the Professional Association of Diver Instructors (PADI) website, www.padi.com, worldwide PADI certifications of divers has grown annually from over 500,000 certifications in 1992, to consistently over 900,000 annual certifications annually from 2003 to 936,149 certifications in 2013. There are other scuba training organizations also issuing scuba dive training certifications, but PADI is the training organization issuing the largest number of certifications annually.

&#160;

Approximately 88.5 million people went boating in the US in 2013; this represents approximately 37% of the adult population in the United States. There were approximately 15.9 million boats in use in 2013, down slightly from approximately 16.0 million in use in 2012. (source: National Marine Manufacturers Association)

&#160;

&#160; 

Product Research and Development (R&#38;D) 

&#160;

We continuously work to provide our customers with both new and improved products. We offer research and development services to not only the related entities we license our patents and trademarks from, but also to other customers as well. R&#38;D services for customers and the related entities are invoiced in the normal course of business. In addition, we are working on internal research and development projects as well as collaborating with others toward the goal of developing some of our own patentable products. Research and development costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, were $8,739 and $4,087, respectively.

&#160;

Government Regulations 

&#160;

The SCUBA industry is self-regulating; therefore, the Company is not subject to government industry specific regulation. Nevertheless, the Company strives to be a leader in promoting safe diving practices within the industry and believes it is at the forefront of self-regulation through responsible diving practices. The Company is subject to all regulations applicable to &#8220;for profit&#8221; companies as well as all trade and general commerce governmental regulation. All required federal and state permits, licenses, and bonds to operate its facility have been obtained. There can be no assurance that the Company&#8217;s operation and profitability will not be subject to more restrictive regulation or increased taxation by federal, state, or local agencies in the future.

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160;

We are predominantly a wholesale distributor to retail dive stores, marine stores, and shipyards. This includes approximately 160 active independent Brownie dealers. We retail our products to including, but not limited to, boat owners, recreational divers and commercial divers. The Company sells to three entities owned by the brother of Robert Carmichael, the Company&#8217;s Chief Executive officer, and two Company&#8217;s owned by the Chief Executive Officer. Combined sales to these five entities for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, represented 31.75% and 43.34%, respectively, of total net revenues. A single non-related party entity represented 18.7% of revenues for 2015. Sales to no other customers for the year ended December 31, 2014 represented greater than 10% of net revenues.

&#160; 

Raw Materials 

&#160;

Principal raw materials for our business include machined parts such as rods, pistons, bearings; hoses; regulators; compressors; engines; high-pressure valves and fittings; sewn goods; and various plastic parts including pans, covers, intake staffs, and quick release connections. Most materials are readily available from multiple vendors. Some materials require greater lead times than other materials. Accordingly, we strive to avoid out of stock situations through careful monitoring of these inventory lead times, and through avoiding single source vendors whenever possible.

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160;

We consider the most significant competitive factors in our business to be fair prices, feature advantages, shopping convenience, the variety of available of products, knowledgeable sales personnel, rapid and accurate fulfillment of orders, and prompt customer service. We currently recognize one significant competitor in hookah sales and a variety of competitors in high-pressure tankfill systems sales. Products from the hookah competitor and those from one of the tankfill competitors appear to be very similar to ours at first glance, but lack many of what we believe are our patently superior feature advantages. Brownie&#8217;s competitors in the high pressure tankfill market are typically focused on traditional dive stores and fire department air service. Several are large multi-national companies that do not offer adaptation to the yacht market or Nitrox integration; both areas that Brownie&#8217;s long-term investments rise to a level to suit the buyer&#8217;s needs.

&#160;

Overall, we are operating in a moderately competitive environment. We believe that the price structure for all the products we distribute compares favorably with the majority of our competitors based on quality and available features.

&#160; 

Personnel 

&#160;

We currently have eleven (11) full time employees and three (3) part time employees at our facility in Pompano Beach, Florida. Three (3) are classified as exempt sales and administrative or management, and eleven (11) are classified as nonexempt factory or administrative support. We utilize consultants when needed in the absence of available in-house expertise. Our employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160;

The main product categories of our business, Brownie&#8217;s Third Lung and Brownie&#8217;s Tankfill, are seasonal in nature. The peak season for Brownie&#8217;s Third Lung&#8217;s products is the second and third quarters of the year. The peak season for Brownie&#8217;s Tankfill&#8217;s products is the fourth and first quarters of the year. Since the seasons complement one another, we are able to shift cross-trained factory and warehouse personnel between the two product categories as needed. Thus, the Company is able to avoid the down time normally associated with seasonal business.
