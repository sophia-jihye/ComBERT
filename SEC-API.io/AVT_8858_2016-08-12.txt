 Item 1. Business 

Avnet, Inc., incorporated in New York in 1955, together with its consolidated subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;Avnet&#8221;), is a global value-added distributor of electronic components, enterprise computer, networking and storage products and software, IT solutions and services and embedded subsystems. Avnet creates a vital link in the technology supply chain that connects the world&#8217;s leading electronic component and computer product manufacturers and software developers with a global customer base of original equipment manufacturers (&#8220;OEMs&#8221;), electronic manufacturing services (&#8220;EMS&#8221;) providers, original design manufacturers (&#8220;ODMs&#8221;), systems integrators (&#8220;SIs&#8221;), independent software vendors (&#8220;ISVs&#8221;) and value-added resellers (&#8220;VARs&#8221;). Avnet distributes electronic components, computer products and software, as received from its suppliers or through a customized solution, and offers assembly and other value-added services. 

Organizational Structure 

Avnet has two primary operating groups &#8212; Electronics Marketing (&#8220;EM&#8221;) and Technology Solutions (&#8220;TS&#8221;). Both operating groups have operations in each of the three major economic regions of the world: the Americas; Europe, the Middle East and Africa (&#8220;EMEA&#8221;); and Asia/Pacific, consisting of Asia, Australia and New Zealand (&#8220;Asia&#8221;). Each operating group has its own management team led by a group president and includes regional leaders and senior executives within the operating group who manage various functions within such businesses. Each operating group also has distinct financial reporting that is evaluated at the executive level on which operating decisions and strategic planning for the Company as a whole are made. Divisions (&#8220;business units&#8221;) exist within each operating group that serve primarily as sales and marketing units to further streamline the sales and marketing efforts within each operating group and enhance each operating group&#8217;s ability to work with its customers and suppliers, generally along more specific product lines or geographies. However, each business unit relies heavily on the support services provided by the operating groups as well as centralized support at the Corporate level. 

A description of each operating group is presented below. Further financial information by operating group and region i s provided in Note 16 &#8220;Segment i nformation&#8221; to the consolidated financial statements appearing in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Avnet&#8217;s foreign operations are subject to a variety of risks. These risks are discussed further under Risk Factors in Item 1A and under Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in Item 7A of this Report. Additionally, the specific translation impacts of foreign currency fluctuations, most notably the Euro, on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements are further discussed in Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Report.

Acquisitions

Avnet expects to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions to expand its market presence, increase its scale and scope, and increase its product and service offerings. 

During fiscal 2016, the Company completed two acquisitions with aggregate annualized sales of approximately $120.0 million. See Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on acquisitions completed during fiscal 2016. 

&#160;

Major Products 

One of Avnet&#8217;s competitive strengths is the breadth and quality of the suppliers whose products it distributes. IBM products accounted for approximately 11%, 11% and 13% of the Company&#8217;s consolidated billings during fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and was the only supplier from which billings of its products, software and services exceeded 10% of consolidated billings. Listed in the table below are the major product categories and the Company&#8217;s approximate sales of each during the past three fiscal years. Fiscal 2016 contained 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in the other fiscal years presented.

Competition &#38; Markets 

The electronic components and IT solutions industries continue to be extremely competitive and are subject to rapid technological advances. The Company&#8217;s major competitors include Arrow Electronics, Inc., Future Electronics and World Peace Group, and, to a lesser extent, Ingram Micro, Inc. and Tech Data Corp. There are also certain smaller, specialized competitors who generally focus on narrower regions, markets, products or particular sectors. In addition, the Company may compete with its own suppliers that maintain a direct salesforce. As a result of these factors, Avnet must remain competitive in its pricing of products and services. 

A key competitive factor in the electronic component and IT solutions distribution industry is the need to carry a sufficient amount of inventory to meet customers&#8217; rapid delivery requirements. To minimize its exposure related to inventory on hand, the majority of the Company&#8217;s products are purchased pursuant to non-exclusive distributor agreements, which typically provide certain protections for product obsolescence and price erosion. These agreements are generally cancelable upon 30 to 180 days&#8217; notice and, in most cases, provide for or require inventory return privileges upon cancellation. In addition, the Company enhances its competitive position by offering a variety of value-added services, which entail the performance of services and/or customer support tailored to individual customer specifications and business needs such as point of use replenishment, testing, assembly, supply chain management and materials management. For the last three fiscal years ended July 2, 2016, sales of services constituted less than 10% of the Company&#8217;s total sales. 

A competitive advantage is the breadth of the Company&#8217;s supplier product line card. Because of the number of Avnet&#8217;s suppliers, many customers can simplify their procurement process and make all of their required purchases from Avnet, rather than purchasing from several different vendors. 

Seasonality 

Historically, Avnet&#8217;s business has not been materially impacted by seasonality, with the exception of a relatively minor impact on consolidated results from the growth in sales at the TS business during the December quarter primarily driven by the calendar year end selling and buying patterns of key suppliers and customers, respectively. 

&#160;

Number of Employees 

At July 2, 2016, Avnet had approximately 17,700 employees compared to 18,800 employees at June 27, 2015, and 19,000 at June 28, 2014.
