 Item 1. Business.

&#160; 

The Company was incorporated in the State of New York on July 22, 1955 and is engaged in the design, development, manufacture and marketing of shock absorption, rate control, and energy storage devices for use in various types of machinery, equipment and structures. In addition to manufacturing and selling existing product lines, the Company continues to develop new and advanced technology products.

&#160;

Principal Products 

&#160;

The Company manufactures and sells a single group of very similar products that have many different applications for customers. These similar products are included in one of six categories; namely, Seismic Dampers, Fluidicshoks&#174;, Crane and Industrial Buffers, Self-Adjusting Shock Absorbers, Liquid Die Springs, and Vibration Dampers. Management does not track or otherwise account for sales broken down by these categories. The following is a summary of the capabilities and applications for these products.

&#160;

Seismic Dampers are designed to ameliorate the effects of earthquake tremors on structures, and represent a substantial part of the business of the Company. Fluidicshoks&#174; are small, extremely compact shock absorbers with up to 19,200 inch-pound capacities, produced in 15 standard sizes for primary use in the defense, aerospace and commercial industry. Crane and industrial buffers are larger versions of the Fluidicshoks&#174; with up to 60,000,000 inch-pound capacities, produced in more than 60 standard sizes for industrial application on cranes, ships, container ships, railroad cars, truck docks, ladle and ingot cars, ore trolleys and car stops. Self-adjusting shock absorbers, which include versions of Fluidicshoks&#174; and crane and industrial buffers, automatically adjust to different impact conditions, and are designed for high cycle application primarily in heavy industry. Liquid die springs are used as component parts of machinery and equipment used in the manufacture of tools and dies. Vibration dampers are used primarily by the aerospace and defense industries to control the response of electronics and optical systems subjected to air, ship, or spacecraft vibration.

&#160;

Distribution 

&#160;

The Company uses the services of more than 50 sales representatives and distributors in the United States and Canada along with more than 20 representatives and distributors throughout the rest of the world. Specialized technical sales in aerospace and custom marketing activities are serviced by three sales agents, under the direction and with the assistance of Douglas P. Taylor, the Company's President. Sales representatives typically have non-exclusive, yearly agreements with the Company, which, in most instances, provide for payment of commissions on sales at 10% of the product's net aggregate selling price. Distributors also have non-exclusive, yearly agreements with the Company to purchase the Company's products for resale purposes.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The Company faces competition on mature aerospace and defense programs which may use more conventional products manufactured under less stringent government specifications. Two foreign companies are the Company's competitors in the production of crane buffers.

&#160;

The Company's principal competitor for the manufacture of products in the aerospace and commercial aerospace industries field is UTC Aerospace Systems Division of United Technologies in Ft. Worth, Texas. While the Company is competitive with this company in the areas of pricing, warranty and product performance, due to limited financing and manufacturing facilities, the Company cannot compete in the area of volume production.

&#160;

The Company competes directly against two other firms supplying seismic damping devices, as well as numerous other firms which supply alternative seismic protection technologies.

&#160;

Raw Materials and Supplies 

&#160;

The principal raw materials and supplies used by the Company in the manufacture of its products are provided by numerous U.S. and foreign suppliers. The loss of any one of these would not materially affect the Company's operations.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Dependence Upon Major Customers 

&#160;

The Company is not dependent on any one or a few major customers. Sales to seven customers approximated 55% (10%, 8%, 8%, 8%, 7%, 7% and 7%, respectively) of net sales for 2016. The loss of any or all of these customers, unless the business is replaced by the Company, could result in an adverse effect on the results for the Company.

&#160;

Patents, Trademarks and Licenses 

&#160;

The Company holds 12 patents expiring at different times until the year 2034.

&#160;

Terms of Sale 

&#160;

The Company does not carry significant inventory for rapid delivery to customers, and goods are not normally sold with return rights such as are available for consignment sales. The Company had no inventory out on consignment and no consignment sales for the years ended May 31, 2016 and 2015. No extended payment terms are offered. During the year ended May 31, 2016, delivery time after receipt of orders averaged 8 to 10 weeks for the Company's standard products. Due to the volatility of construction and aerospace/defense programs, progress payments are usually required for larger projects using custom designed components of the Company.

&#160; 

Need for Government Approval of Principal Products or Services 

&#160;

Contracts between the Company and the federal government or its independent contractors are subject to termination at the election of the federal government. Contracts are generally entered into on a fixed price basis. If the federal government should limit defense spending, these contracts could be reduced or terminated, which management believes would have a materially adverse effect on the Company.

&#160;

Research and Development 

&#160;

The Company does not generally engage in major product research and development activities in connection with the design of its products, except when funded by aerospace customers or the federal government. The Company, however, engages in research testing of its products. For the fiscal years ended May 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company expended $428,000 and $268,000, respectively, on manufacturing research. For the years ended May 31, 2016 and 2015, defense sponsored research and development totaled $56,000 and $49,000, respectively.

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160;

Compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations which have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment has had no material effect on the Company, and the Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with such provisions.

&#160;

The Company is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Act (&#34;OSHA&#34;) and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, which establish strict standards for the protection of employees, and impose fines for violations of such standards. The Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with OSHA provisions and does not anticipate any material corrective expenditures in the near future. The Company currently incurs only moderate costs with respect to disposal of hazardous waste and compliance with OSHA regulations.

&#160;

The Company is also subject to regulations relating to production of products for the federal government. These regulations allow for frequent governmental audits of the Company's operations and fairly extensive testing of Company products. The Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with these regulations and does not anticipate corrective expenditures in the future.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

Exclusive of Company sales representatives and distributors, as of May 31, 2016, the Company had 114 employees, including three executive officers, and four part time employees. The Company has good relations with its employees.
