Business 

Our Company 

Altra Industrial Motion Corp. (&#8220;Altra&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) (formerly Altra Holdings, Inc.) is a leading global designer, producer and marketer of a wide range of mechanical power transmission, or MPT components. Our products are used to control and transmit power and torque in virtually any industrial application involving movement. With our global footprint, we sell our products in over 70 countries and serve customers in a diverse group of industries, including energy, general industrial, material handling, metals, mining, special machinery, transportation, and turf and garden. Our product portfolio includes clutches and brakes, couplings and gearing and other power transmission components. Our products are used in a wide variety of high-volume manufacturing processes, where the reliability and accuracy of our products are critical in both avoiding costly down time and enhancing the overall efficiency of manufacturing operations. Our products are also used in non-manufacturing applications where product quality and reliability are especially critical, such as clutches and brakes for elevators and residential and commercial lawnmowers. Altra was incorporated in 2004 in the State of Delaware and became a publicly traded company in 2006. Altra is headquartered in Braintree, Massachusetts. 

We market our products under well recognized and established brands, many of which have been in existence for over 50 years. We believe many of our brands, when taken together with our brands in the same product category, have achieved the number one or number two position in terms of consolidated market share and brand awareness in their respective product categories. Our products are either incorporated into products sold by original equipment manufacturers, (&#8220;OEMs&#8221;), sold to end users directly, or sold through industrial distributors. 

During the quarter ended September 30, 2015, the Company realigned its reporting and management structure and corresponding reportable business segments as part of its business simplification efforts (see &#32;Business Segments ). The segment information presented below for the prior periods has been reclassified to conform to the new presentation. The following table shows the percentage of net sales and operating income generated by each of our three segments for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 :

History and Acquisitions 

Formation of Altra 

Although Altra was incorporated in Delaware in 2004, much of our current business has its roots with the prior acquisition by Colfax Corporation, or Colfax, of the MPT (mechanical power transmission) group of Zurn Technologies, Inc. in December 1996. Colfax subsequently acquired Industrial Clutch Corp. in May 1997, Nuttall Gear Corp. in July 1997 and the Boston Gear and Delroyd Worm Gear brands in August 1997 as part of Colfax&#8217;s acquisition of Imo Industries, Inc. In February 2000, Colfax acquired Warner Electric, Inc., which sold products under the Warner Electric, Formsprag Clutch, Stieber, and Wichita Clutch brands. Colfax formed Power Transmission Holding, LLC or &#8220;PTH&#8221; in June 2004 to serve as a holding company for all of these power transmission businesses. Boston Gear was established in 1877, Warner Electric, Inc. in 1927, and Wichita Clutch in 1949. 

On November 30, 2004, we acquired our original core business through the acquisition of PTH from Colfax. We refer to this transaction as the PTH Acquisition. 

On October 22, 2004, The Kilian Company, or Kilian, a company formed at the direction of Genstar Capital, then the largest stockholder of Altra, acquired Kilian Manufacturing Corporation from Timken U.S. Corporation. At the completion of the PTH Acquisition, (i) all of the outstanding shares of Kilian capital stock were exchanged for shares of our capital stock and (ii) Kilian and its subsidiaries were transferred to our former wholly owned subsidiary Altra Power Transmission, Inc. 

Recent Acquisitions and Transactions 

On May 29, 2011, we acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of Danfoss Bauer GmbH relating to its gear motor business, or Bauer. We refer to this transaction as the Bauer Acquisition. Bauer is a European manufacturer of high-quality gear motors, offering engineered solutions to a variety of industries, including material handling, metals, food processing, and energy. 

On July 11, 2012, we acquired 85% of privately held Lamiflex do Brasil Equipamentos Industriais Ltda., now known as Altra Industrial Motion do Brasil S.A., or Lamiflex. Lamiflex is a premier Brazilian manufacturer of high-speed disc couplings, providing engineered solutions to a variety of industries, including oil and gas, power generation, metals and mining. On June 19, 2015, we acquired the remaining 15% of Lamiflex. 

On November 22, 2013, we changed our legal corporate name from Altra Holdings, Inc. to Altra Industrial Motion Corp. 

On December 17, 2013, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Svendborg Brakes A/S and S.B. Patent Holding ApS (together &#8220;Svendborg&#8221;). Svendborg is a leading global manufacturer of premium quality caliper brakes. 

On July 1, 2014, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Guardian Ind., Inc., now known as Guardian Couplings LLC or Guardian Couplings. Guardian Couplings is a manufacturer and supplier of flywheel, motion control and general industrial couplings. 

On December 31, 2014, Altra Power Transmission, Inc., our former wholly owned subsidiary, was merged into Altra Industrial Motion Corp. 

Our Industry 

Based on industry data supplied by the Power Transmission Distributors Association in collaboration with Industrial Market Information, we estimate that industrial power transmission products generated sales in the United States of approximately $36.1 billion &#32;in 2015 . These products are used to generate, transmit, control and transform mechanical energy. The industrial power transmission industry can be divided into three areas: MPT products; motors and generators; and adjustable speed drives. We compete primarily in the MPT area which, based on industry data, we estimate was a $21.1 billion &#32;market in the United States in 2015 . 

The global MPT market is highly fragmented, with over 1,000 small manufacturers. While smaller companies tend to focus on regional niche markets with narrow product lines, larger companies that generate annual sales of over $100 million generally offer a much broader range of products and have global capabilities. Buyers of MPT products are broadly diversified across many sectors of the economy and typically place a premium on factors such as quality, reliability, availability, and design and application engineering support. We believe the most successful industry participants are those that leverage their distribution network, their products&#8217; reputations for quality and reliability and their service and technical support capabilities to maintain attractive margins on products and gain market share. 

Company Goals and Operational Excellence 

Operational Excellence is our comprehensive business management system designed to achieve world class performance. It reflects our quest to improve the flow of value to our customers with the goal of securing long-term growth and prosperity for our company, our employees and our partners. Operational Excellence applies to every function and every aspect of how we do business. 

We are committed to driving shareholder return by leveraging Operational Excellence to achieve superior organic growth and operating margins, creating a market-focused culture that drives growth through innovation and maintaining a disciplined approach to acquisitions. 

Our Business Strategy 

With a strong long-term focus on Operational Excellence, organic growth and strategic acquisitions, we strive to create superior value for our customers, shareholders and associates. We seek to achieve this vision through the following strategies: 

Capitalize on Operational Excellence to Drive Margin Expansion and Organic Growth. We believe we can continue to improve profitability through cost control, overhead rationalization, global process optimization, continued implementation of lean manufacturing techniques and strategic pricing initiatives. Our operating plan, based on manufacturing centers of excellence, provides additional opportunities to consolidate purchasing processes and reduce costs by sharing best practices across geographies and business lines. 

Collaborate with Customers to Create New Opportunities. We focus on aggressively developing new products across our business in response to customer needs in various markets. Our extensive application-engineering know-how drives both new and repeat sales and we have an established history of innovation with over 200 granted patents and pending patent applications worldwide. In total, new products developed by us during the past three years generated approximately $66.2 million &#32;in revenues during 2015 . 

Capturing the Benefits of Common Ownership. We foster the sharing of best practices throughout the organization. We challenge our businesses to work together to identify cross-selling opportunities to increase customer and distributor penetration as well as to expand into new markets and geographic regions. We expect the recent realignment of our three divisions to further develop these initiatives. Leveraging our global buying power, we expect our businesses to work together to identify cost saving opportunities and to improve supply chain management. Utilizing our common ERP system, we are working to implement a shared services structure that supports all of our business units in the United States. This will allow our businesses to receive the benefits of expanded customer service, cohesive marketing services and consolidated accounting functions which will increase efficiency and help to reduce cost. 

Selectively Pursue Strategic Acquisitions that Complement Our Strong Platform. We have a successful track record of identifying, acquiring and integrating acquisitions. We believe that in the future there may be a number of attractive potential acquisition candidates, in part due to the fragmented nature of the industry. We plan to continue our disciplined pursuit of strategic acquisitions to strengthen our product portfolio, enhance our industry leadership, leverage fixed costs, expand our global footprint, and create value in products and markets that we know and understand. 

Focus on Key Niche End Markets to Increase Organic Growth. We emphasize strategic marketing to focus on new growth opportunities in key end-user and OEM markets. Through a systematic process that leverages our core brands and products, we seek to identify attractive markets and product niches, collect customer and market data, identify market drivers, tailor product and service solutions to specific market and customer requirements, and deploy resources to gain market share and drive future sales growth. 

Disciplined Capital Allocation. &#32;&#32;&#32;We expect that our businesses typically will generate annual free cash flow. We are focused on the most efficient allocation of our capital to maximize investment returns. To do this, we grow and support our existing businesses through annual investment in capital spending with a focus on internal projects to expand markets, develop products, and boost productivity. We continue to evaluate our portfolio for strategic fit and intend to make additional strategic acquisitions focused on our key markets. We have consistently provided shareholder returns by paying regular dividends, which have increased by 200% since being introduced during the quarter ended March 31, 2012. During the quarter ended June 30, 2014, we initiated purchases under our $50 million share repurchase program. Through December 31, 2015 , we have repurchased approximately $34.9 million &#32;of Altra common stock under the program. 

Our Strengths 

Operational Excellence. We benefit from an established culture of lean management emphasizing quality, delivery and cost control through our Operational Excellence program. Operational Excellence is at the core of our performance-driven culture and drives both our strategic development and operational improvements. We continually evaluate every aspect of our business to identify possible productivity improvements and cost savings. 

Leading Market Shares and Brand Names. We believe we hold the number one or number two market position in key products across many of our core platforms. In addition, we believe we have recently captured additional market share in several product lines due to our innovative product development efforts and exceptional customer service and product delivery. 

Customized, Engineered Products Serving Niche Markets. We employ approximately 285 &#32;non-manufacturing engineers involved with product design, research and development, testing and technical customer support, and we often participate in lengthy design and qualification processes with our customers. Many of our product lines involve a large number of unique parts, are delivered in small order quantities with short lead times, and require varying levels of technical support and responsive customer service. As a result of these characteristics, as well as the essential nature of our products to the efficient operations of our customers, we generate a significant amount of recurring sales with repeat customers. 

Aftermarket Sales Supported by Large Installed Base. With a history dating back to 1857 with the formation of TB Wood&#8217;s, we believe we benefit from one of the largest installed customer bases in the industry. The moving, wearing nature of our products necessitates regular replacement and our large installed base of products generates significant aftermarket replacement demand. This has created a recurring revenue stream from a diversified group of end-user customers. For 2015 , we estimate that approximately 38% &#32;of our revenues were derived from aftermarket sales. 

Diversified End Markets. Our revenue base has a balanced exposure across a diverse mix of end-user industries, including energy, food processing, general industrial, material handling, mining, transportation, and turf and garden. We believe our diversified end markets insulate us from volatility in any single industry or type of end-user. In 2015 , no single industry represented more than 8% &#32;of our total sales. In addition, we are geographically diversified with approximately 42% &#32;of our sales coming from outside North America during 2015 . 

Strong Relationships with Distributors and OEMs. We have over 1,000 direct OEM customers and enjoy established, long-term relationships with the leading industrial MPT distributors, critical factors that contribute to our high base of recurring aftermarket revenues. We sell our products through more than 3,000 distributor outlets worldwide. We believe our scale, expansive product lines and end-user preference for our products make our product portfolio attractive to both large and multi-branch distributors, as well as regional and independent distributors in our industry. 

Experienced, High-Caliber Management Team. We are led by a highly experienced management team with over 250 years of cumulative industrial business experience and an average of over 15 years with our companies. Our CEO, Carl Christenson, has over 30 years of experience in the MPT industry, while our CFO, Christian Storch, has more than 25 years of experience. Our management team has established a proven track record of execution, successfully completing and integrating major strategic acquisitions and delivering significant growth and profitability. 

Business Segments 

During the quarter ended September 30, 2015, the Company realigned its reporting and management structure and corresponding reportable business segments as part of its business simplification efforts. This new structure is better aligned across the Company&#8217;s end markets and will better facilitate the Company&#8217;s strategic initiatives for growth, procurement and facility consolidation. 

We operate three business segments that are aligned by our product offerings: 

Couplings, Clutches and Brakes business segment 

Couplings. Couplings are the interface between two shafts, which enable power to be transmitted from one shaft to the other. Because shafts are often misaligned, we design our couplings with a measure of flexibility that accommodates various degrees of misalignment. Altra manufactures a diverse variety of couplings suitable for many industrial and specialty applications. Our various coupling products include: gear couplings, high performance diaphragm and disc couplings, elastomeric couplings, miniature and precision couplings, as well as universal joints, mill spindles and shaft locking devices. These products are sold into many different markets, including: food processing, oil and gas, power generation, material handling, medical, metals, mining, and mobile off-highway. Our couplings are primarily manufactured under the Ameridrives, Ameridrives Power Transmission, Bibby, Lamiflex, TB Wood's, Huco Dynatork, and Guardian brands in our facilities in Indiana, Pennsylvania, Texas, Wisconsin, Brazil, the United Kingdom, China and Mexico. 

Clutches and Brakes. Primarily utilized in heavy duty industrial, mining and energy applications, clutches are devices which use mechanical, magnetic, hydraulic, pneumatic, or friction type connections to facilitate engaging or disengaging two rotating members. Brakes are combinations of interacting parts that work to slow or stop machinery. We manufacture a variety of clutches and brakes in two main product categories: heavy duty and overrunning. Our core clutch and brake manufacturing facilities are located in Michigan, Texas, Denmark, Germany, the United Kingdom and China. 

&#8226; 

Heavy Duty Clutches and Brakes. Our heavy duty clutch and brake product lines serve various markets including metal forming, off-shore and land-based oil and gas drilling platforms, mining, material handling, marine, wind turbine applications and various off-highway and construction equipment segments. Our line of heavy duty pneumatic, hydraulic and caliper clutches and brakes are marketed under the Wichita Clutch, Twiflex, Industrial Clutch and Svendborg Brakes brand names. 

&#8226; 

Overrunning Clutches. Products include overrunning, indexing and backstopping clutches which are generally used as a mechanical means of prohibiting a shaft&#8217;s rotation in one direction while enabling its rotation in the opposite direction. Primary industrial applications include conveyors, gear reducers, hoists and cranes, mining machinery, machine tools, paper machinery, and other specialty machinery. We also sell our overrunning clutch products into the aerospace and defense market for fixed and rotary wing aircraft. We market and sell these products under the Formsprag, Marland, and Stieber brand names. 

Engineered Belted Drives. Belted drives incorporate both a rubber-based belt and at least two sheaves or synchronous sprockets. Belted drives typically change the speed of an electric motor or engine to the level required for a particular piece of equipment. Our belted drive line includes three types of v-belts, three types of synchronous belts, standard and made-to-order sheaves and synchronous sprockets, and split taper bushings. We sell belted drives to a wide range of end markets, including aggregate, energy, chemical and material handling. Our engineered belted drives are primarily manufactured under the TB Wood&#8217;s brand in our facilities in Pennsylvania and Mexico. 

Electromagnetic Clutches and Brakes business segment 

Products in this segment include brakes and clutches that are used to electronically slow, stop, engage or disengage equipment utilizing electromagnetic friction type connections. Our industrial products include clutches and brakes with specially designed controls for material handling, forklift, elevator, medical mobility, mobile off-highway, baggage handling and plant productivity applications. We also offer a line of clutch and brake products for walk-behind mowers, residential lawn tractors and commercial mowers. While industrial applications are predominant, we also manufacture products for several niche vehicular applications including on-road refrigeration compressor clutches and agricultural equipment clutches. We market our electromagnetic products under the Warner Electric, Inertia Dynamics and Matrix brand names. Our core electromagnetic clutches and brakes manufacturing facilities are located in Connecticut, Indiana, France, the United Kingdom and China. 

Gearing business segment 

Gearing . Gears reduce the output speed and increase the torque of an electric motor or engine to the level required to drive a particular piece of equipment. These products are used in various industrial, material handling, mixing, transportation and food processing applications. Specific product lines include vertical and horizontal gear drives, speed reducers and increasers, high-speed compressor drives, enclosed custom gear drives, various enclosed gear drive and gear motor configurations and open gearing products such as spur, helical, worm and miter/bevel gears. We design and manufacture a broad range of gearing and gear motor products under the Boston Gear, Nuttall Gear, Delroyd, and Bauer Gear Motor brand names. We manufacture our gearing products at our facilities in New York, North Carolina, Germany, Slovakia, and China, and sell to a wide variety of end markets. 

Engineered Bearing Assemblies. Bearings are components that support, guide and reduce friction of motion between fixed and moving machine parts. Our engineered bearing assembly product line includes ball bearings, roller bearings, thrust bearings, track rollers, stainless steel bearings, polymer assemblies, housed units and custom assemblies. We manufacture a broad range of engineered bearing products under the Kilian brand name. We sell bearing products to a wide range of end industries, including the general industrial and automotive markets, with a particularly strong OEM customer focus. We manufacture our bearing products at our facilities in New York and Canada. 

Research and Development and Product Engineering 

We closely integrate new product development with marketing, manufacturing and product engineering in meeting the needs of our customers. We have product engineering teams that work to enhance our existing products and develop new product applications for our growing base of customers that require custom solutions. We believe these capabilities provide a significant competitive advantage in the development of high quality industrial power transmission products. Our product engineering teams focus on: 

&#8226; 

lowering the cost of manufacturing our existing products; 

&#8226; 

redesigning existing product lines to increase their efficiency or enhance their performance; and 

&#8226; 

developing new product applications. 

Our continued investment in new product development is intended to help drive customer growth as we address key customer needs. We spend approximately 2.0% - 2.5% of net sales on our annual research and development efforts. 

Sales and Marketing 

We sell our products in over 70 countries to over 1,000 direct OEM customers and over 3,000 distributor outlets. We offer our products through our direct sales force comprised of 181 &#32;company-employed sales associates as well as independent sales representatives. Our worldwide sales and distribution presence enables us to provide timely and responsive support and service to our customers, many of which operate globally, and to capitalize on growth opportunities in both developed and emerging markets around the world. While the Company did not have any individual customers that represented total sales of greater than 10.0% , the Gearing business segment had one customer that approximated 1 0.5% &#32;of total sales during the year ended December 31, 2015. 

We employ an integrated sales and marketing strategy concentrated on both key industries and individual product lines. We believe this dual vertical market and horizontal product approach distinguishes us in the marketplace allowing us to quickly identify trends and customer growth opportunities and deploy resources accordingly. Within our key industries, we market to OEMs, encouraging them to incorporate our products into their equipment designs, to distributors and to end-users, helping to foster brand preference. With this strategy, we are able to leverage our industry experience and product breadth to sell MPT and motion control solutions for a host of industrial applications. 

Distribution 

Our MPT components are either incorporated into end products sold by OEMs or sold through industrial distributors as aftermarket products to end users and smaller OEMs. We operate a geographically diversified business. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , we derived approximately 58% &#32;of our net sales from customers in North America, 26% &#32;from customers in Europe and 16% &#32;from customers in Asia and the rest of the world. Our global customer base is served by an extensive global sales network comprised of our sales staff as well as our network of over 3,000 distributor outlets. 

Rather than serving as passive conduits for delivery of product, our industrial distributors are active participants in influencing product purchasing decisions in the MPT industry. In addition, distributors play a critical role through stocking inventory of our products, which amplifies the accessibility of our products to aftermarket buyers. It is for this reason that distributor partner relationships are so critical to the success of the business. We enjoy strong established relationships with the leading distributors as well as a broad, diversified base of specialty and regional distributors. 

Competition 

We operate in highly fragmented and very competitive markets within the MPT market. Some of our competitors have achieved substantially more market penetration in certain of the markets in which we operate, such as helical gear drives, and some of our competitors are larger than us and have greater financial and other resources. In particular, we compete with Rexnord Corporation and Regal-Beloit Corporation. In addition, with respect to certain of our products, we compete with divisions of our OEM customers. Competition in our business lines is based on a number of considerations including quality, reliability, pricing, availability and design and application engineering support. Our customers increasingly demand a broad product range and we must continue to develop our expertise in order to manufacture and market these products successfully. To remain competitive, regular investment in manufacturing, customer service, and support, marketing, sales, research and development and intellectual property protection is required. We may have to adjust the prices of some of our products to stay competitive. In addition, some of our larger, more sophisticated customers are attempting to reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase in order to increase their efficiency. There is substantial and continuing pressure on major OEMs and larger distributors to reduce costs, including the cost of products purchased from outside suppliers such as us. As a result of cost pressures from our customers, our ability to compete depends in part on our ability to generate production cost savings and, in turn, find reliable, cost-effective outside component suppliers or manufacturers for our products. See &#8220; Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Related to our Business &#8212; We operate in the highly competitive mechanical power transmission industry and if we are not able to compete successfully our business may be significantly harmed.&#8221; 

Intellectual Property 

We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyright, and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements, license arrangements, and domain name 

registrations to protect our intellectual property. We sell our products under a number of registered and unregistered trademarks, which we believe are widely recognized in the MPT industry. With the exception of Boston Gear, Warner Electric, TB Wood&#8217;s, Svendborg and Bauer we do not believe any single patent, trademark or trade name is material to our business as a whole. Any issued patents that cover our proprietary technology and any of our other intellectual property rights may not provide us with adequate protection or be commercially beneficial to us and, patents applied for, may not be issued. The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity or its enforceability. Competitors may also be able to design around our patents. If we are unable to protect our patented technologies, our competitors could commercialize technologies or products which are substantially similar to ours. 

With respect to proprietary know-how, we rely on trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions and on confidentiality agreements. Monitoring the unauthorized use of our technology is difficult and the steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology. The disclosure or misappropriation of our intellectual property could harm our ability to protect our rights and our competitive position. 

Some of our registered and unregistered trademarks include: Warner Electric, Boston Gear, TB Wood&#8217;s, Kilian, Nuttall Gear, Ameridrives, Wichita Clutch, Formsprag, Bibby Transmissions, Stieber, Matrix, Inertia Dynamics, Twiflex, Industrial Clutch, Huco Dynatork, Marland, Delroyd, Warner Linear, Bauer Gear Motor, PowerFlex, Svendborg Brakes and Guardian Couplings. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had 3,855 &#32;full-time employees, of whom approximately 50% &#32;were located in North America (primarily U.S.), 33% &#32;in Europe, and 17% &#32;in Asia and the rest of the world. Approximately 15% &#32;of our full-time factory U.S. employees are represented by labor unions. In addition, approximately 718 &#32;employees or 56% &#32;of our European employees are represented by labor unions or works councils. Approximately 52 &#32;employees in the Lamiflex production facilities in Brazil are represented by a works council. Additionally, approximately 62 &#32;employees in the TB Wood&#8217;s production facility in Mexico are unionized under a collective bargaining agreement that is subject to annual renewals. 

We are a party to four U.S. collective bargaining agreements. The agreements will expire in July 2016 , October 2016 , June 2017 &#32;and February 2018 . 

We are also party to a collective bargaining agreement with approximately 68 &#32;union employees at our Toronto, Canada manufacturing facility. That agreement will expire in July 2018 . 

One of the four U.S. collective bargaining agreements contains provisions for additional, potentially significant, lump-sum severance payments to all employees covered by that agreement who are terminated as the result of a plant closing and one of our collective bargaining agreements contains provisions restricting our ability to terminate or relocate operations. See &#8220;Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Related to Our Business &#8212; We may be subject to work stoppages at our facilities, or our customers may be subjected to work stoppages, which could seriously impact our operations and the profitability of our business.&#8221; 

Our facilities in Europe and Brazil have employees who are generally represented by local or national social works councils. Social works councils meet with employer industry associations periodically to discuss employee wages and working conditions. Our facilities in Denmark, France, Germany, Slovakia, and Brazil often participate in such discussions and adhere to any agreements reached. 

Suppliers and Raw Materials 

We obtain raw materials, component parts and supplies from a variety of sources, generally from more than one supplier. Our suppliers and sources of raw materials are based in both the United States and other countries and we believe that our sources of raw materials are adequate for our needs for the foreseeable future. We do not believe the loss of any one supplier would have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. Our principal raw materials are steel and copper. We generally purchase our materials on the open market, where certain commodities such as steel and copper have fluctuated in price significantly in recent years. We have not experienced any significant shortage of our key materials and have not historically engaged in hedging transactions for commodity suppliers. 

Our ability, including manufacturing or distribution capabilities, and that of our suppliers, business partners and contract manufacturers, to make, move and sell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our or their manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather, natural disaster, fire or explosion, terrorism, pandemics, strikes, repairs or enhancements at our facilities, excessive demand, raw material shortages, or other reasons, could impair our ability, and that of our suppliers, to manufacture or sell our products. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain. 

Seasonality 

We experience seasonality in our turf and garden business, which represented approximately 8% &#32;of our net sales in 2015 . As our large OEM customers prepare for the spring season, our shipments generally start increasing in December, peak in February and March, and begin to decline in April and May. This allows our customers to have inventory in place for the peak consumer purchasing periods for turf and garden products. The June-through-November period is typically the low season for us and our customers in the turf and garden market. Seasonality can also be affected by weather and the level of housing starts. 

Regulation 

We are subject to a variety of government laws and regulations that apply to companies engaged in international operations. These include compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, U.S. Department of Commerce export controls, local government regulations and procurement policies and practices (including regulations relating to import-export control, investments, exchange controls and repatriation of earnings). We maintain controls and procedures to comply with laws and regulations associated with our international operations. In the event we are unable to remain compliant with such laws and regulations, our business may be adversely affected. 

Environmental and Health and Safety Matters 

We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local, foreign and provincial environmental laws and regulations, including those governing health and safety requirements, the discharge of pollutants into the air or water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the responsibility to investigate and cleanup contaminated sites that are or were owned, leased, operated or used by us or our predecessors. Some of these laws and regulations require us to obtain permits, which contain terms and conditions that impose limitations on our ability to emit and discharge hazardous materials into the environment and periodically may be subject to modification, renewal and revocation by issuing authorities. Fines and penalties may be imposed for non-compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and the failure to have or to comply with the terms and conditions of required permits. From time to time, our operations may not be in full compliance with the terms and conditions of our permits. We periodically review our procedures and policies for compliance with environmental laws and requirements. We believe that our operations generally are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and requirements and that any non-compliance would not be expected to result in us incurring material liability or cost to achieve compliance. Historically, our costs of achieving and maintaining compliance with environmental laws and requirements have not been material. 

Certain environmental laws in the United States, such as the federal Superfund law and similar state laws, impose liability for the cost of investigation or remediation of contaminated sites upon the current or, in some cases, the former site owners or operators and upon parties who arranged for the disposal of wastes or transported or sent those wastes to an off-site facility for treatment or disposal, regardless of when the release of hazardous substances occurred or the lawfulness of the activities giving rise to the release. Such liability can be imposed without regard to fault and, under certain circumstances, can be joint and several, resulting in one party being held responsible for the entire obligation. As a practical matter, however, the costs of investigation and remediation generally are allocated among the viable responsible parties on some form of equitable basis. Liability also may include damages to natural resources. In addition, from time to time, we are notified that we are a potentially responsible party and may have liability in connection with off-site disposal facilities. To date, we have generally resolved matters involving off-site disposal facilities for a nominal sum although there can be no assurance that we will be able to resolve pending and future matters in a similar fashion.
