The term "California Companies" refers to MCC, MIC, CAIC, and CGU. 

(2) 

WAIC was acquired on January 2, 2015. For more detailed information, see Note 20. Acquisition, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." 

Production and Servicing of Business 

The Company sells its policies through approximately 9,700 &#32;independent agents, its 100% owned insurance agents, AIS and Poliseek, and directly through internet sales portals. All of the independent agents collectively accounted for more than 87% of the Company's direct premiums written in 2015, and no independent agent accounted for more than 1% of the Company&#8217;s direct premiums written during the last three years. Approximately 1,900 of the independent agents are located in California and approximately 1,500 are located in Florida. The independent agents are independent contractors selected and contracted by the Company and generally also represent competing insurance companies. AIS and Poliseek represented the Company as independent agents prior to their acquisition in 2009, and continue to act as independent agents selling policies for a number of other insurance companies. Policies sold directly through the internet sales portals are assigned to and serviced by the Company's agents. 

The Company believes that it compensates its agents above the industry average. Net commissions incurred in 2015 were approximately 16% of net premiums written. 

The Company&#8217;s advertising budget is allocated among television, radio, newspaper, internet, and direct mailing media with the intent to provide the best coverage available within targeted media markets. While the majority of these advertising costs are borne by the Company, a portion of these costs are reimbursed by the Company&#8217;s independent agents based upon the number of account leads generated by the advertising. The Company believes that its advertising program is important to generate leads, create brand awareness, and remain competitive in the current insurance climate. In 2015, the Company launched a national 

advertising campaign resulting in net advertising expenditures of $44 million for the year. In 2016, the Company expects to spend up to $42 million on advertising. 

Underwriting 

The Company sets its own automobile insurance premium rates, subject to rating regulations issued by the Department of Insurance or similar governmental agency of each state in which it is licensed to operate ("DOI"). Each state has different rate approval requirements. See "Regulation&#8212;Department of Insurance Oversight." 

The Company offers standard, non-standard, and preferred private passenger automobile insurance in 13 states. The Company also offers homeowners insurance in 12 states, commercial automobile insurance in 10 states, and mechanical breakdown insurance in most states. 

In California, "good drivers," as defined by the California Insurance Code, accounted for approximately 82% of all California voluntary private passenger automobile policies-in-force at December 31, 2015 , while higher risk categories accounted for approximately 18%. The private passenger automobile renewal rate in California (the rate of acceptance of offers to renew) averages approximately 95%. 

Claims 

The Company conducts the majority of claims processing without the assistance of outside adjusters. The claims staff administers all claims and manages all legal and adjustment aspects of claims processing. 

Losses and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves ("Loss Reserves") and Reserve Development 

The Company maintains loss reserves for both reported and unreported claims. Loss reserves for reported claims are estimated based upon a case-by-case evaluation of the type of claim involved and the expected development of such claims. Loss reserves for unreported claims are determined on the basis of historical information by line of insurance business. Inflation is reflected in the reserving process through analysis of cost trends and review of historical reserve settlement. 

The Company&#8217;s ultimate liability may be greater or less than management estimates of reported loss reserves. The Company does not discount to a present value that portion of loss reserves expected to be paid in future periods. However, the Company is required to discount loss reserves for federal income tax purposes. 

The following table provides a reconciliation of beginning and ending estimated reserve balances for the years indicated:

The increase in the provision for insured events of prior years in 2015 of approximately $12.7 million &#32;primarily resulted from the California homeowners and automobile lines of business outside of California, which was partially offset by favorable development in the California automobile line of business. 

The decrease in the provision for insured events of prior years in 2014 of approximately $3.2 million &#32;primarily resulted from lower than expected loss severity on California personal automobile lines of insurance business partially offset by adverse development in other states. 

The increase in the provision for insured events of prior years in 2013 of approximately $3.0 million &#32;primarily resulted from Florida claims that were re-opened from prior years due to a state supreme court ruling that was adverse to the insurance industry. 

The Company experienced estimated pre-tax catastrophe losses and loss adjustment expenses from severe weather events of $19 million , $11 million , and $17 million &#32;in 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively. The losses in 2015 were primarily the result of severe storms outside of California, and rainstorm and wildfire losses in California. The losses in 2014 were primarily related to winter freeze events on the East Coast and severe rainstorms in California. The losses in 2013 were primarily due to tornadoes in Oklahoma and severe storms in the Midwest and the Southeast regions during the second quarter. 

The following table presents the development of loss reserves for the period 2005 through 2015. The top section of the table shows the reserves at the balance sheet date, net of reinsurance recoverable, for each of the indicated years. This amount represents the estimated net losses and loss adjustment expenses for claims arising from the current and all prior years that are unpaid at the balance sheet date, including an estimate for loss reserves that had been incurred but not reported ("IBNR") to the Company. The second section shows the cumulative amounts paid as of successive years with respect to that reserve liability. The third section shows the re-estimated amount of the previously recorded reserves based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year, including cumulative payments made since the end of the respective year. Estimates change as more information develops about the frequency and severity of claims for individual years. The bottom line shows favorable (unfavorable) development that exists when the original reserve estimates are greater (less) than the re-estimated reserves at December 31, 2015 . 

In evaluating the cumulative development information in the table, it should be noted that each amount includes the effects of all changes in development amounts for prior periods. This table does not present accident or policy year development data. Conditions and trends that have affected development of the liability in the past may not necessarily occur in the future. Accordingly, it may not be appropriate to extrapolate future favorable or unfavorable development based on this table.

Under statutory accounting principles ("SAP"), reserves are stated net of reinsurance recoverable whereas under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), reserves are stated gross of reinsurance recoverable. 

The Company experienced unfavorable development of approximately $13 million on the 2014 and prior accident years&#8217; loss reserves due primarily from the California homeowners and automobile lines of business outside of California, which was partially offset by favorable development in the California personal automobile line of business. See "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Reserves" in "Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." 

For the years 2005 through 2013, the cumulative reserves developed worse than what was originally expected. The primary causes relate to increasing bodily injury severity trends beyond expectations, higher than expected losses on personal automobile lines of insurance business in the Northeastern states where the Company relied on industry data for reserving purposes because it had limited historical data, an unfavorable court decision that was adverse to the insurance industry for Florida PIP losses, and unfavorable development on the Florida homeowners line of insurance business due to a surge in claims related to sinkholes. 

Statutory Accounting Principles 

The Company&#8217;s results are reported in accordance with GAAP, which differ in some respects from amounts reported under SAP prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities. Some of the significant differences under GAAP are described below: 

&#8226; 

Policy acquisition costs such as commissions, premium taxes, and other costs that vary with and are primarily related to the successful acquisition of new and renewal insurance contracts, are capitalized and amortized on a pro rata basis over the period in which the related premiums are earned, whereas under SAP, these costs are expensed as incurred. 

&#8226; 

Certain assets are included in the consolidated balance sheets, whereas under SAP, such assets are designated as "nonadmitted assets," and charged directly against statutory surplus. These assets consist primarily of premium receivables that are outstanding for more than 90 days, deferred tax assets that do not meet statutory requirements for recognition, furniture, equipment, leasehold improvements, capitalized software, and prepaid expenses. 

&#8226; 

Amounts related to ceded reinsurance are shown gross as prepaid reinsurance premiums and reinsurance recoverables, whereas under SAP, these amounts are netted against unearned premium reserves and losses and loss adjustment expenses reserves. 

&#8226; 

Fixed-maturity securities are reported at fair value, whereas under SAP, these securities are reported at amortized cost, or the lower of amortized cost, or fair value, depending on the specific type of security. 

&#8226; 

Equity securities are marked to market through the consolidated statements of operations, whereas under SAP, these securities are marked to market through unrealized gains and losses in surplus. 

&#8226; 

Goodwill is reported as the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the underlying assets and assessed periodically for impairment. Intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives. Under SAP, goodwill is reported as the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the statutory book value and amortized over 10 years. Its carrying value is limited to 10% of adjusted surplus. Under SAP, intangible assets are not recognized. 

&#8226; 

The differing treatment of income and expense items results in a corresponding difference in federal income tax expense. Changes in deferred income taxes are reflected as an item of income tax benefit or expense, whereas under SAP, changes in deferred income taxes are recorded directly to statutory surplus as regards policyholders. Admittance testing under SAP may result in a charge to unassigned surplus for non-admitted portions of deferred tax assets. Under GAAP, a valuation allowance may be recorded against the deferred tax assets and reflected as an expense. 

&#8226; 

Certain assessments paid to regulatory agencies that are recoverable from policyholders in future periods are expensed, whereas under SAP, these assessments are recorded as receivables. 

Operating Ratios (SAP basis) 

Loss and Expense Ratios 

Loss and expense ratios are used to interpret the underwriting experience of property and casualty insurance companies. Under SAP, losses and loss adjustment expenses are stated as a percentage of premiums earned because losses occur over the life of a policy, while underwriting expenses are stated as a percentage of premiums written rather than premiums earned because most underwriting expenses are incurred when policies are written and are not spread over the policy period. The statutory underwriting profit margin is the extent to which the combined loss and expense ratios are less than 100%. 

The following table presents, on a statutory basis, the Insurance Companies&#8217; loss, expense and combined ratios, and the private passenger automobile industry combined ratio. Although the Insurance Companies&#8217; ratios include lines of insurance business other than private passenger automobile that accounted for 22.1% of direct premiums written in 2015, the Company believes its ratios can be compared to the industry ratios.

Investments 

The Company&#8217;s investments are directed by the Chief Investment Officer under the supervision of the Board of Directors. The Company&#8217;s investment strategy emphasizes safety of principal and consistent income generation, within a total return framework. The investment strategy has historically focused on maximizing after-tax yield with a primary emphasis on maintaining a well diversified, investment grade, fixed income portfolio to support the underlying liabilities and achieve a return on capital and profitable growth. The Company believes that investment yield is maximized by selecting assets that perform favorably on a long-term basis and by disposing of certain assets to enhance after-tax yield and minimize the potential effect of downgrades and defaults. The Company believes that this strategy maintains the optimal investment performance necessary to sustain investment income over time. The Company&#8217;s portfolio management approach utilizes a market risk and asset allocation strategy as the primary basis for the allocation of interest sensitive, liquid and credit assets as well as for monitoring credit exposure and diversification requirements. Within the ranges set by the asset allocation strategy, tactical investment decisions are made in consideration of prevailing market conditions. 

Tax considerations, including the impact of the alternative minimum tax ("AMT"), are important in portfolio management. Changes in loss experience, growth rates, and profitability produce significant changes in the Company&#8217;s exposure to AMT liability, requiring appropriate shifts in the investment asset mix between taxable bonds, tax-exempt bonds, and equities in order to maximize after-tax yield. The Company closely monitors the timing and recognition of capital gains and losses and the generation of ordinary income to maximize the realization of any deferred tax assets arising from capital losses or AMT credit carryforwards, respectively. The Company had no &#32;capital loss carryforward at December 31, 2015 .

Fixed maturities and short-term bonds at amortized cost; and equities and other short-term investments at cost. Average invested assets at cost are based on the monthly amortized cost of the invested assets for each respective period. 

(2) 

For 2015, n et investment income before income taxes increased slightly due to higher average invested asset balances. Net investment income and average annual yields on investments after income taxes decreased slightly primarily due to the maturity and replacement of higher yielding investments purchased when market interest rates were higher, with lower yielding investments purchased during low interest rate environments, and a higher effective tax rate on investment income due to a greater proportion of taxable investments in 2015 compared to 2014. &#32; 

(3) 

At December 31, 2015, fixed maturity securities with call features totaled $2.9 billion and $2.8 billion at fair value and amortized cost, respectively. 

Competitive Conditions 

The Company operates in the highly competitive property and casualty insurance industry subject to competition on pricing, claims handling, consumer recognition, coverage offered and product features, customer service, and geographic coverage. Some 

of the Company&#8217;s competitors are larger and well-capitalized national companies that have broad distribution networks of employed or captive agents. 

Reputation for customer service and price are the principal means by which the Company competes with other insurers. In addition, the marketing efforts of independent agents can provide a competitive advantage. Based on the most recent regularly published statistical compilations of premiums written in 2015 , the Company was the fourth largest writer of private passenger automobile insurance in California and the fifteenth largest in the United States. 

The property and casualty insurance industry is highly cyclical, with alternating hard and soft market conditions. The Company has historically seen premium growth during hard market conditions. The Company believes that the market is hardening with carriers generally raising rates, although this also depends on individual state profitability and the carriers&#8217; growth appetite. 

Reinsurance 

The Company is party to a Catastrophe Reinsurance Treaty ("Treaty") that is effective through June 30, 2016. The Treaty provides for $100 million coverage on a per occurrence basis after covered catastrophe losses exceed a $100 million Company retention limit, excludes coverage in Florida, and limits certain coverages to 37% of catastrophe losses resulting from earthquakes and fire following earthquakes. The annual premium is $4.1 million. 

The Company has reinsurance for PIP claims in Michigan through the Michigan Catastrophic Claims Association, a private non-profit unincorporated association created by the Michigan Legislature. The reinsurance covers losses in excess of $545,000 per person and has no maximum limit. Michigan law provides for unlimited lifetime coverage for medical costs caused by automobile accidents. 

For California homeowners policies, the Company has reduced its catastrophe exposure from earthquakes by placing earthquake risks directly with the California Earthquake Authority ("CEA"). However, the Company continues to have catastrophe exposure to fires following an earthquake. For more detailed discussion, see "Regulation&#8212;Insurance Assessments" below. 

The Company carries a commercial umbrella reinsurance treaty and seeks facultative arrangements for large property risks. In addition, the Company has other reinsurance in force that is not material to the consolidated financial statements. If any reinsurers are unable to perform their obligations under a reinsurance treaty, the Company will be required, as primary insurer, to discharge all obligations to its policyholders in their entirety. 

Regulation 

The Insurance Companies are subject to significant regulation and supervision by insurance departments of the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled or licensed to operate business. 

Department of Insurance Oversight 

The powers of the DOI in each state primarily include the prior approval of insurance rates and rating factors and the establishment of capital and surplus requirements, solvency standards, restrictions on dividend payments and transactions with affiliates. DOI regulations and supervision are designed principally to benefit policyholders rather than shareholders. 

California Proposition 103 requires that property and casualty insurance rates be approved by the California DOI prior to their use and that no rate be approved which is excessive, inadequate, unfairly discriminatory, or otherwise in violation of the provisions of the initiative. The proposition specifies four statutory factors required to be applied in "decreasing order of importance" in determining rates for private passenger automobile insurance: (1) the insured&#8217;s driving safety record, (2) the number of miles the insured drives annually, (3) the number of years of driving experience of the insured and (4) whatever optional factors are determined by the California DOI to have a substantial relationship to risk of loss and are adopted by regulation. The statute further provides that insurers are required to give at least a 20% discount to "good drivers," as defined, from rates that would otherwise be charged to such drivers and that no insurer may refuse to insure a "good driver." The Company&#8217;s rate plan operates under these rating factor regulations. 

Insurance rates in California, Georgia, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Nevada require prior approval from the state DOI, while insurance rates in Illinois, Texas, Virginia, Arizona, and Michigan must only be filed with the respective DOI before they are implemented. Oklahoma and Florida have a modified version of prior approval laws. In all states, the insurance code provides that rates must not be excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory. 

The DOI in each state in which the Company operates is responsible for conducting periodic financial and market conduct examinations of the Insurance Companies in their states. Market conduct examinations typically review compliance with insurance statutes and regulations with respect to rating, underwriting, claims handling, billing, and other practices. For more detailed information on the Company&#8217;s current financial and market conduct examinations, see "Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Regulatory Capital Requirements" in "Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." 

For a discussion of current regulatory matters in California, see "Regulatory and Legal Matters" in "Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." 

The operations of the Company are dependent on the laws of the states in which it does business and changes in those laws can materially affect the revenue and expenses of the Company. The Company retains its own legislative advocates in California. The Company made direct financial contributions of approximately $21,000 and $167,000 to officeholders and candidates in 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. The Company believes in supporting the political process and intends to continue to make such contributions in amounts which it determines to be appropriate. 

The Insurance Companies must comply with minimum capital requirements under applicable state laws and regulations. The risk-based capital ("RBC") formula is used by insurance regulators to monitor capital and surplus levels. It was designed to capture the widely varying elements of risks undertaken by writers of different lines of insurance business having differing risk characteristics, as well as writers of similar lines where differences in risk may be related to corporate structure, investment policies, reinsurance arrangements, and a number of other factors. The Company periodically monitors the RBC level of each of the Insurance Companies. As of December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, each of the Insurance Companies exceeded the minimum required RBC levels . For more detailed information, see "Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Regulatory Capital Requirements" in "Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." 

Own Risk and Solvency Assessment 

Beginning in 2015, insurance companies were required to file an Own Risk and Solvency Assessment ("ORSA") with the insurance regulators in their domiciliary states. The ORSA is required to cover, among many items, a company&#8217;s risk management policies, the material risks to which the company is exposed, how the company measures, monitors, manages and mitigates material risks, and how much economic and regulatory capital is needed to continue to operate in a strong and healthy manner. The ORSA is intended to be used by state insurance regulators to evaluate the risk exposure and quality of the risk management processes within insurance companies to assist in conducting risk-focused financial examinations and for determining the overall financial condition of insurance companies. The Company filed its ORSA Summary Report with the California DOI in November 2015. Compliance with the ORSA requirements did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 

Insurance Assessments 

The California Insurance Guarantee Association ("CIGA") was created to pay claims on behalf of insolvent property and casualty insurers. Each year, these claims are estimated by CIGA and the Company is assessed for its pro-rata share based on prior year California premiums written in the particular line. These assessments are currently limited to 2.0% of premiums written in the preceding year and are recouped through a mandated surcharge to policyholders in the year after the assessment. There were no CIGA assessments in 2015. 

The CEA is a quasi-governmental organization that was established to provide a market for earthquake coverage to California homeowners. The Company places all new and renewal earthquake coverage offered with its homeowner policy directly with the CEA. The Company receives a small fee for placing business with the CEA, which is recorded as other revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. Upon the occurrence of a major seismic event, the CEA has the ability to assess participating companies for losses. These assessments are made after CEA capital has been expended and are based upon each company&#8217;s participation percentage multiplied by the amount of the total assessment. Based upon the most recent information provided by the CEA, the Company&#8217;s maximum total exposure to CEA assessments at April 1, 2015, the most recent date at which information was available, was $64.3 million . There was no assessment made in 2015. 

The Insurance Companies in other states are also subject to the provisions of similar insurance guaranty associations. There were no material assessments or payments during 2015 in other states. 

Holding Company Act 

The California Companies are subject to California DOI regulation pursuant to the provisions of the California Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act (the "Holding Company Act"). The California DOI may examine the affairs of each of the California Companies at any time. The Holding Company Act requires disclosure of any material transactions among affiliates within a Holding Company System. Some transactions and dividends defined to be of an "extraordinary" type may not be made if the California DOI disapproves the transaction within 30 days after notice. Such transactions include, but are not limited to, extraordinary dividends; management agreements, service contracts, and cost-sharing arrangements; all guarantees that are not quantifiable; derivative transactions or series of derivative transactions; certain reinsurance transactions or modifications thereof in which the reinsurance premium or a change in the insurer&#8217;s liabilities equals or exceeds 5% of the policyholders&#8217; surplus as of the preceding December 31; sales, purchases, exchanges, loans, and extensions of credit; and investments, in the net aggregate, involving more than the lesser of 3% of the respective California Companies&#8217; admitted assets or 25% of statutory surplus as regards policyholders as of the preceding December 31. An extraordinary dividend is a dividend which, together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding 12 months, exceeds the greater of 10% of the insurance company&#8217;s statutory policyholders&#8217; surplus as of the preceding December 31 or the insurance company&#8217;s statutory net income for the preceding calendar year. 

California-domiciled insurance companies are also required to notify the California DOI of any dividend after declaration, but prior to payment. There are similar limitations imposed by other states on the Insurance Companies&#8217; ability to pay dividends. As of December 31, 2015 , the Insurance Companies are permitted to pay in 2016, without obtaining DOI approval for extraordinary dividends, $163.7 &#32;million in dividends to Mercury General, of which $136.4 &#32;million may be paid by the California Companies. 

The Holding Company Act also provides that the acquisition or change of "control" of a California domiciled insurance company or of any person who controls such an insurance company cannot be consummated without the prior approval of the California DOI. In general, a presumption of "control" arises from the ownership of voting securities and securities that are convertible into voting securities, which in the aggregate constitute 10% or more of the voting securities of a California insurance company or of a person that controls a California insurance company, such as Mercury General. A person seeking to acquire "control," directly or indirectly, of the Company must generally file with the California DOI &#160; an application for change of control containing certain information required by statute and published regulations and provide a copy of the application to the Company. The Holding Company Act also effectively restricts the Company from consummating certain reorganizations or mergers without prior regulatory approval. 

Each of the Insurance Companies is subject to holding company regulations in the state in which it is domiciled. These provisions are substantially similar to those of the Holding Company Act. 

Assigned Risks 

Automobile liability insurers in California are required to sell BI liability, property damage liability, medical expense, and uninsured motorist coverage to a proportionate number (based on the insurer&#8217;s share of the California automobile casualty insurance market) of those drivers applying for placement as "assigned risks." Drivers seek placement as assigned risks because their driving records or other relevant characteristics, as defined by Proposition 103, make them difficult to insure in the voluntary market. In 2015, assigned risks represented less than 0.1% of total automobile direct premiums written and less than 0.1% of total automobile direct premium earned. The Company attributes the low level of assignments to the competitive voluntary market. Many of the other states in which the Company conducts business offer programs similar to that of California. These programs are not a significant contributor to the business written in those states.
