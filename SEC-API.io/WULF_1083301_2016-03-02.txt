 Item 1. Business 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

IKONICS Corporation (&#8220;IKONICS&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was incorporated in Minnesota as Chroma-Glo, Inc. in 1952 and changed its name to The Chromaline Corporation in 1982. In December 2002, the Company changed its name to IKONICS Corporation. The Company&#8217;s three traditional businesses, Domestic, IKONICS Imaging and Export, have been the development, manufacture and selling of photosensitive liquids (&#8220;emulsions&#8221;) and films for the screen printing and awards and recognition industries. These sales have been augmented with inkjet receptive films, ancillary chemicals and related equipment to provide a full line of products and services to its customers. These products are sold worldwide primarily through distributors. In 2006, the Company began a major effort to diversify and expand its business to industrial markets. These efforts now include the Company&#8217;s Advanced Material Solutions (&#8220;AMS&#8221;) business unit &#160; which uses the Company&#8217;s proprietary processes and photoresist film for the abrasive etching of composite materials, industrial ceramics, silicon wafers, and glass wafers. The customer base for AMS is primarily the aerospace and electronics industries. Based on its expertise in ultraviolet curable fluids and inkjet receptive substrates, the Company has also developed a patented digital texturing technology (&#8220;DTX&#8221;) for putting patterns and textures into steel molds for the plastic injection molding industry. The ultimate original equipment manufacturer (&#8220;OEM&#8221;) for the Company&#8217;s DTX technology is primarily the automotive industry. The Company offers a suite of products to the mold making industry. Industrial inkjet printers, which are integral to the DTX system, are manufactured and sold by a strategic partner. The Company&#8217;s business plan is to sell consumable fluids and transfer films. For most markets , these sales are direct to the mold maker. The DTX technology is being expanded to prototyping where the Company&#8217;s technology offers a unique combination of high definition, large format prints, and abrasion resistance. 

&#160; 

Products 

&#160; 

The Company has four primary technology platforms: Ultraviolet (UV) chemistry, film coating and construction, technical abrasive etching, and industrial inkjet printing. The Company&#8217;s traditional products and new initiatives are based on these platforms and their combinations. The Company&#8217;s Chromaline branded products for the screen printing industry and I KONICS Imaging products for the awards and recognition market are based on UV chemistry and film coating and construction capabilities; the AMS offering is a combination of UV chemistry, film coating and construction and technical abrasive etching capabilities; DTX is a combination of UV chemistry, film coating and construction, and industrial inkjet printing. There is overlap and synergy in the market between the Domestic, Ikonics Imaging, AMS and DTX product offerings, and the Company offers ancillary products, including equipment to provide customers with a total solution. The Company considers this combination of core technologies and product offerings to be unique. 

&#160; 

Distribution and Customers 

&#160; 

The Company currently has approximately 2 00 domestic and international distributors for its Chromaline and ImageMate screen printing emulsions and films. The Company&#8217;s abrasive etching products are mainly sold directly to end users in the awards and recognition market under the Ikonics Imaging brand. AMS products are sold either directly to users or the Company offers AMS as a service. DTX includes the sales of consumable inks and films to customers that have purchased specialized industrial inkjet printers from the Company&#8217;s strategic partner. DTX sales are both direct to users and through distributors. The Company markets and sells its products through magazine advertising, trade shows and the internet. 

&#160; 

The Company has a diverse customer base both domestically and abroad , with international sales accounting for 2 7 . 9 % of total sales in 201 5 , and does not depend on one or a few customers for a material portion of its revenues. In 201 5 and 201 4 , no one customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales. 

&#160; 

Quality Control in Manufacturing 

&#160; 

In March 1994, IKONICS became the first firm in northern Minnesota to receive ISO 9001 certification. ISO 9000 is a worldwide standard issued by the International Organization for Standardization that provides a framework for quality assurance. The Company has been recertified every three years beginning in 

&#160;

1997. IKONICS&#8217; quality function goal is to train all employees properly in both their work and in the importance of their work. Internal records of quality, including related graphs and tables, are reviewed regularly and discussions are held among management and employees regarding how improvements might be realized. The Company has rigorous materials selection procedures and also uses testing procedures to assure its products meet quality standards. 

&#160; 

Research and Development and Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

The Company spent 3. 8 % of sales , or $66 0 ,000 , on research and development in 201 5 , and 3. 6 % of sales , or $6 65 ,000 , in 201 4 . In its research program, IKONICS has developed ultraviolet light-sensitive chemistries used in the manufacture of screen print stencils, photoresists for abrasive etching and acid resist and prototyping ink jet fluids and ink jet receptive films. The Company has a number of patents and patent applications on these chemistries and applications. There can be no assurance that any patent granted to the Company will provide adequate protection to the Company&#8217;s intellectual property. Within the Company, steps are taken to protect the Company&#8217;s trade secrets, including physical security, confidentiality and non-competition agreements with employees, non-disclosure agreements where applicable, and confidentiality agreements with vendors. Over the past few years, the Company has directed a larger portion of it research and development resources towards industrial inkjettable fluids and ink jet receptive substrates. The Company has also invested significant resources for personnel and equipment to develop proprietary products and techniques for the etching of composite materials, industrial ceramics and electronic wafers. 

&#160; 

In addition to its patents, the Company has various trademarks including the &#8220;IKONICS,&#8221; &#8220;Chromaline,&#8221; &#8220;IKONICS Imaging,&#8221; &#8220;Precision Abrasive Machining,&#8221; &#8220;SmartFlex,&#8221; &#8220;PhotoBrasive,&#8221; &#8220;AccuArt,&#8221; &#8220;Nichols,&#8221; &#8220;image mate,&#8221; &#8220;Alpha FlexTrace,&#8221; &#8220;Alpha MicroCap,&#8221; and &#8220;DTX&#8221; trademarks. 

&#160; 

Raw Materials 

&#160; 

The primary raw materials used by IKONICS in its production are photopolymers, polyester films, polyvinylacetates, polyvinylalcohols and water. The Company&#8217;s purchasing staff leads in the identification of both domestic and foreign sources for raw materials and negotiates price and terms for all domestic and foreign markets. IKONICS&#8217; involvement in foreign markets has given it the opportunity to become a global buyer of raw materials at lower overall cost. The Company has a number of suppliers for its operations. Some suppliers provide a significant amount of key raw materials to the Company, but the Company believes alternative sources are available for most materials. For those raw materials where an alternative source is not readily available, the Company has contingency raw material replacement plans. To date, there have been no significant shortages of raw materials. The Company believes it has good supplier relations. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The Company competes in its markets based on product development capability, quality, reliability, availability, technical support and price. Though the screen printing market is much larger than the awards and recognition market, IKONICS commands significantly more market share in the latter. IKONICS has two primary domestic competitors in its screen printing film business. They are larger than IKONICS and possess greater resources than the Company in many areas. The Company has numerous competitors in the market for screen print emulsions, many of whom are larger than IKONICS and possess greater resources. The market for the Company&#8217;s abrasive etching products in the awards and recognition market has one significant competitor. IKONICS considers itself to be the leader in this market. There are significant competitors, using different technologies in the new markets being entered by the Company. The primary competition for AMS is from other machining methods, most of which are well established. The primary competition for DTX comes from old, well-established technologies based on wax and screen printing and new competition from laser technologies.
