 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 

&#160;

COMPANY OVERVIEW

Discovery Laboratories, Inc. (referred to as &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a Delaware corporation, with our principal offices located at 2600 Kelly Road, Suite 100, Warrington, Pennsylvania. We were incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 1992. Our telephone number is 215-488-9300 and our corporate website address is www.discoverylabs.com . Our common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market &#174; , where our symbol is DSCO. 1 

We are a biotechnology company focused on developing novel KL 4 surfactant therapies for respiratory diseases and other potential applications. Surfactants are produced naturally in the lung and are essential for normal respiratory function and survival. Our proprietary technology platform includes a synthetic, peptide-containing surfactant (KL 4 surfactant) that is structurally similar to endogenous pulmonary surfactant, and novel drug delivery technologies being developed to enable noninvasive administration of aerosolized KL 4 surfactant. We believe that our proprietary technology platform may make it possible to develop a pipeline of surfactant products to address a variety of respiratory diseases for which there are few or no approved therapies.

Initial Focus &#8211; Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) in Premature Infants

Our core development program, AEROSURF &#174; (lucinactant for inhalation), is focused on improving the management of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in premature infants, a serious respiratory condition that can result in long-term respiratory problems, developmental delay and death. Premature infants born prior to 37 weeks gestational age may not have fully developed natural lung surfactant and therefore may need surfactant therapy to sustain life. Higher incidence and severity of RDS are correlated with younger gestational ages; however, RDS can occur at any premature gestational age. RDS is the most prevalent respiratory disease in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). We estimate that 120,000 to 150,000 premature infants are given respiratory support after birth each year in the United States because they have or are at risk for RDS.

Surfactant therapy is a life-saving treatment for RDS and the primary therapy to address an underlying surfactant deficiency. Surfactants currently available in the U.S. are animal-derived and must be administered using invasive endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, each of which may result in serious respiratory conditions and other complications. Intubation is associated with airway trauma and clinical instability that can extend beyond the respiratory system such as increased intracranial pressure and risk for brain injury. Mechanical ventilation is associated with ventilator-associated lung injury, chronic lung disease and increased risk of infection. &#160; To avoid these risks, many premature infants are initially treated with noninvasive respiratory support, such as nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP). &#160; Unfortunately, since nCPAP does not address the underlying surfactant deficiency, many premature infants respond poorly to nCPAP (typically within the first 72 hours of life) and may require intubation and delayed surfactant therapy (an outcome referred to as nCPAP failure). 

In addition, many premature infants with RDS who receive surfactant therapy as initial therapy are capable of breathing without mechanical ventilation, but require surfactant therapy for RDS. Because surfactant therapy requires intubation, these infants generally are supported with mechanical ventilation for either a limited or extended period of time. If surfactant therapy could be administered noninvasively, neonatologists would be able to provide surfactant therapy to these premature infants without exposing them to the risks associated with intubation and mechanical ventilation.

AEROSURF is an investigational combination drug/device product that combines our proprietary KL 4 surfactant with our novel aerosol delivery system (ADS), which is based primarily on our capillary aerosol generator technology. We are developing AEROSURF to enable administration of aerosolized KL 4 surfactant to premature infants receiving nCPAP, without invasive intubation and mechanical ventilation. We believe that, if approved, AEROSURF will have the potential to transform the treatment of RDS, allow for earlier treatment of those premature infants who currently receive surfactants later in their course of treatment, decrease the morbidities and complications currently associated with surfactant administration, and reduce the number of premature infants who are subjected to invasive intubation and delayed surfactant therapy as a result of nCPAP failure.

1 &#160; Information concerning the shares of our common stock and related share prices in this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been adjusted to reflect a 1-for-14 reverse split of our common stock and a change in the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, that were made effective on January 22, 2016. 

&#160;

The current surfactant market for RDS is estimated to be approximately $75 million annually in the U.S. and $250 to $300 million annually worldwide; however, we believe that this market has been constrained, in part, by the risks associated with surfactant administration and lack of medical innovation. Treatment options for RDS have not improved significantly, nor have mortality and morbidity rates for RDS meaningfully improved over the last few decades. We believe that the neonatal medical community would respond favorably to the introduction of a synthetic, peptide-containing (KL 4 ) surfactant and a less-invasive method of surfactant administration. By enabling delivery of our aerosolized KL 4 surfactant using noninvasive methods, we believe that AEROSURF, if approved, will address a serious unmet medical need and potentially provide transformative clinical and pharmacoeconomic benefits. We believe that AEROSURF has the potential to create a worldwide annual market opportunity of $600 million to a $1 billion per year. See, &#8220;&#8211; Surfactant Therapy &#8211; The RDS Market.&#8221; 

The drug product component of our AEROSURF product candidate is a lyophilized (freeze-dried) dosage form of our KL 4 surfactant liquid instillate drug product that was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2012 under the name SURFAXIN &#174; (lucinactant) Intratracheal Suspension for the prevention of RDS in premature infants at high risk for RDS. In the second quarter of 2015, we determined to cease commercial and manufacturing activities for SURFAXIN to focus our limited resources on advancing the AEROSURF clinical development program and our aerosolized KL 4 surfactant pipeline. We believe that gaining the approval of SURFAXIN provided us valuable experience to support the further development of our KL 4 surfactant product candidates, beginning with AEROSURF.

Beyond RDS

In the future, we believe that we may be able to leverage the data and know-how that we gain from our development activities for our KL 4 surfactant, in liquid, lyophilized and aerosolized dosage forms, to support a potential product pipeline of KL 4 surfactant products to address serious critical care respiratory and other conditions in children and adults in pediatric and adult intensive care units. While we remain focused on AEROSURF, we have supported and plan in the future to support potential opportunities to explore the utility of our KL 4 surfactant to address a variety of respiratory conditions. Although there can be no assurance, we would consider supporting such efforts in the future if we are able to secure separate funding, including through potential government-supported and other grant programs that are dedicated to advancing research and development initiatives.

We believe that our aerosolized KL 4 surfactant, alone or in combination with other pharmaceutical compounds, has the potential to be developed to address a range of serious respiratory conditions and may be an effective intervention for such conditions as acute lung injury (ALI), including acute radiation exposure to the lung (acute pneumonitis and delayed lung injury), chemical-induced ALI, and influenza-induced ALI. In addition, although there can be no assurance, we may explore opportunities to apply KL 4 surfactant therapies to treat conditions such as chronic rhinosinusitis, complications of certain major surgeries, mechanical ventilator-induced lung injury (often referred to as VILI), pneumonia, diseases involving mucociliary clearance disorders, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cystic fibrosis (CF). There can be no assurance, however, that we will secure the additional capital needed to undertake such explorations, that we will undertake such explorations or that, even if we do, that we will be successful.

&#160;

BUSINESS STRATEGY

We continue to focus our drug research and development activities on the management of RDS in premature infants. We are currently conducting a clinical development program for AEROSURF for the treatment of RDS. Our strategy to achieve our goals includes:

&#183; We are focusing our efforts on advancing the AEROSURF clinical development program and our aerosolized KL 4 surfactant pipeline candidates. We opened an investigational new drug application (IND) with the FDA and initiated a phase 2 clinical program for AEROSURF for the treatment of RDS in premature infants in November 2013. 

&#160;

o In May 2015, we announced the results of our initial AEROSURF phase 2a open label clinical trial conducted in 48 premature infants 29 to 34 week gestational age who were receiving nCPAP for RDS. The primary goal of this trial was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single exposure of aerosolized KL 4 surfactant administered in three escalating inhaled doses (15, 30 and 45 minutes) to premature infants with RDS, compared to infants receiving nCPAP alone. &#160; In addition, a key objective of this trial was to establish proof of concept for our proprietary technology platform with (1) physiological data indicating that aerosolized KL 4 surfactant is being delivered into the lung of premature infants, and (2) acceptable performance of the novel ADS in the NICU. Physiological data from this clinical trial suggest that, with AEROSURF, KL 4 surfactant is being delivered to the lungs of premature infants with RDS and potentially improves gas exchange. In addition, parameters related to timing and frequency of the need for invasive surfactant therapy suggest that a single dose of AEROSURF may delay the time to invasive surfactant therapy due to nCPAP failure. Based on these encouraging results, we initiated a study to explore whether multiple or increased doses of AEROSURF may potentially reduce the need for invasive surfactant therapy. 

&#160;

o In October 2015, we completed enrollment in an AEROSURF phase 2a clinical expansion study in 32 premature infants 29 to 34 week gestational age who were receiving nCPAP for RDS. This trial was designed to evaluate safety and tolerability of aerosolized KL 4 surfactant administered in higher (60 and 90 minutes) doses compared to infants receiving nCPAP alone. In November 2015, we announced top line data from our overall phase 2a clinical program in premature infants 29 to 34 week gestational age, including the previously announced data from the initial phase 2a clinical trial. The data suggest &#160; that aerosolized KL 4 surfactant delivered to premature infants with RDS is generally safe and well tolerated and may be reducing the incidence of nCPAP failure. The reported adverse events and serious adverse events were those that are common and expected among premature infants with RDS and comparable to the control group. Through 72 hours after the start of treatment, AEROSURF treated patients, predominantly receiving a single dose, had lower rates of nCPAP failure compared to control in each of the last three dose groups studied. nCPAP failure rates were 53% in the control group (n=40) compared to 38% (n=8) , 14% ( n=7, excluding one patient who was inappropriately enrolled) and 38% (n=8) in the 45, 60 and 90 minute AEROSURF dose groups, respectively. 

&#160;

o We also are enrolling a phase 2a multicenter, randomized, open-label, controlled clinical study in 32 premature infants 26 to 28 week gestational age receiving nCPAP for RDS that is designed to evaluate safety and tolerability of aerosolized KL 4 surfactant administered in two escalating (30 and 45 minutes) doses, with potential repeat doses, compared to infants receiving nCPAP alone. &#160; We anticipate completing enrollment in the second quarter of 2016 and releasing top-line results in the third quarter of 2016. As with the previous phase 2a clinical trials, the primary objective of this 2a clinical trial is to evaluate safety and tolerability and we are also assessing performance of the ADS in the NICU and available physiological data for information that indicates that aerosolized KL 4 surfactant is being delivered to the lungs and potentially reducing or delaying the time to invasive surfactant therapy due to nCPAP failure. 

&#160;

o Based on the safety and tolerability profile observed in the phase 2a clinical program, we initiated the AEROSURF phase 2b &#160; clinical trial in premature infants 26 to 32 weeks gestational age receiving nCPAP for RDS. The trial is a multicenter, randomized, controlled study with masked treatment assignment in approximately 240 premature infants and is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of aerosolized KL 4 surfactant (including with potential repeat doses) administered in two dose groups (25 and 50 minutes), compared to infants receiving nCPAP alone. We plan to evaluate the following endpoints: time to nCPAP failure (defined as the need for intubation and delayed surfactant therapy), incidence of nCPAP failure and physiological parameters indicating the effectiveness of lung function. The trial is expected to be conducted in up to 60 clinical sites in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Latin America. Enrollment is beginning with premature infants 29 to 32 week gestational age, and will include premature infants 26 to 28 weeks gestational age after completion of the ongoing phase 2a clinical trial in this age group. We anticipate completing enrollment for this clinical trial by the end of 2016 and releasing top-line results in the first quarter of 2017. 

&#160;

&#183; We are also planning for the manufacture of a sufficient number of ADSs to support the AEROSURF phase 2b clinical trial. We are working with Battelle Memorial Institute (Battelle), which assisted us in the development and manufacture of our phase 2a clinic-ready ADS to manufacture a sufficient number of ADSs to support our continuing development activities and our phase 2b clinical trial. The ADS has been demonstrated to produce consistent and controlled output rates, particle size, and other aerosol characteristics throughout extended KL 4 surfactant dosing periods. We believe the ADS represents a robust platform to support reliable and reproducible clinical development, potential commercialization of our AEROSURF combination drug / device product, if approved, and, in the future, further life-cycle product development. 

&#183; We are developing a lyophilized (freeze-dried) dosage form of our KL 4 surfactant that can be stored as a dry substance and reconstituted to liquid form just prior to use and is being developed potentially to improve ease of use for healthcare providers, prolong shelf life and reduce the need for cold-chain storage. We are developing lyophilized KL 4 surfactant initially for our AEROSURF development program. In the first quarter of 2015, we completed a technology transfer of our lyophilized surfactant manufacturing process to our contract manufacturing organization (CMO), Patheon Manufacturing Services LLC (Patheon), which manufactured a sufficient supply of clinical drug product to support our AEROSURF phase 2 clinical program. We are currently engaged in a second technology transfer to a new facility at Patheon. We also have entered into a manufacturing development agreement with Patheon for the further development of this lyophilized KL 4 surfactant, potentially for our AEROSURF phase 3 program and, if approved, commercial supply. 

&#183; To achieve our business objectives over time, we will require significant additional capital and resources to support our operations, advance our development programs, manufacture our drug product and medical devices, and support the commercialization of our approved products in markets around the world. We continue to assess potential opportunities that could provide capital resources and strengthen our capabilities. 

&#160;

o In October 2014, we entered into a Collaboration Agreement with Battelle providing for further development of our ADS for use in our planned AEROSURF phase 3 clinical program and, if AEROSURF is approved, initial commercial supply. The collaboration involves a sharing of development expense and provides us the continued benefit of Battelle&#8217;s expertise in developing and integrating aerosol devices using innovative and advanced technologies. See, &#8220;&#8211; Business Operations &#8211; Strategic Alliances and Collaboration Arrangements &#8211; Battelle Collaboration Agreement.&#8221; 

&#160;

o We plan in the future to seek opportunities to enter into a significant strategic alliance, collaboration or other strategic transaction that would support our AEROSURF development activities, potentially by providing development, regulatory and commercial market expertise as well as financial resources, and, if approved, support the commercial introduction of AEROSURF in selected markets outside the U.S. Financial resources provided by such an alliance could take the form of upfront payments, milestone payments, commercialization royalties and a sharing of research and development expenses. 

&#160;

&#183; 

We plan to closely manage our cash resources and will seek additional capital, including potentially from strategic transactions and through future debt and equity financings, as we deem necessary to maintain and strengthen our financial position. However, with our current market capitalization, we may be constrained in our efforts by several factors, including: (i) our ability to conduct primary offerings, including under the ATM Program, is constrained by a restriction under our universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-196420), which was declared effective on June 13, 2014 (2014 Universal Shelf), that limits the value of primary securities offerings we may conduct in any 12-month period to no more than one-third of our public float; (ii) the number of authorized shares currently available for issuance under our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, likely would be insufficient to fund our activities through equity offerings; (iii) if in a financing, we seek to issue more than 20% of our outstanding shares of common stock, we may be required to first seek approval of our stockholders, a time-consuming and expensive process; (iv) if we fail to maintain compliance with Nasdaq listing requirements, including without limitation the minimum bid price, minimum market capitalization or minimum stockholders&#8217; equity requirements, our common stock may be subject to delisting, which could affect the liquidity and value of our common stock.

&#160;

o We continue to pursue non-dilutive funding opportunities, including in the form of U.S. Government-funded research and preclinical development initiatives that explore the use of our KL 4 surfactant in the treatment of a range of respiratory diseases. Since 2012, we have received $4.1 million in funding, including approximately $1.9 million to fund our AEROSURF phase 2a clinical program. 

&#160;

o 

In July 2015, we completed a registered public offering of 1,791,667 Series A units and 3,000,000 Series B units each at a price per unit of $8.40, resulting in gross proceeds of $40.25 million ($37.6 million net after underwriting discount and expenses). The proceeds included $5.0 million in non-cash consideration from affiliates of Deerfield Management, L.P. (Deerfield) in the form of a reduction in future interest payments due under the Deerfield Loan (discussed below). Each Series A unit consists of one share of common stock and a Series A warrant to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $9.80 per share. Each Series B unit consists of a fully paid pre-funded Series B warrant to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $8.40 per share, and a Series B warrant to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $9.80 per share. See, Item 7 &#8211; Management Discussion and Analysis &#8211; Liquidity and Capital Resources &#8211; Financings Pursuant to Common Stock Offerings &#8211; Registered Public Offerings.&#8221; 

&#160;

o In February 2013, we entered into an At-the-Market Equity Offering Sales Agreement (Sales Agreement) with Stifel, Nicolaus &#38; Company, Incorporated (Stifel), pursuant to which Stifel, as our exclusive agent, may sell through an &#8220;at-the-market&#8221; program (ATM Program), at such times that we may elect during a three-year term, up to a maximum of $25,000,000 of shares of our common stock. In February 2016, we entered into an amendment to the Sales Agreement to extend the term three years to February 11, 2019. As of December 31, 2015, approximately $23.0 million remains available under the ATM Program. 

&#160;

o 

In February 2013, we entered into a secured loan agreement with Deerfield, under which we secured long-term debt of $30 million (Deerfield Loan). In July 2015, we entered into two amendments to the loan agreement, pursuant to which we prepaid $5 million of the outstanding principal amount, eliminated the initial principal payment due in February 2017; increased each of the remaining principal payments due in February 2018 (which may be deferred one year if we achieve a market capitalization milestone) and February 2019 to $12.5 million; agreed to pay $5 million in satisfaction of future interest obligations through issuance to Deerfield of $5 million securities in the July 2015 public offering; and reduced the rate of any remaining interest accruing under the Deerfield Loan from 8.75% to 8.25%. The loan agreement also includes certain negative covenants that may require us to seek Deerfield&#8217;s consent before entering into certain strategic transactions, which could impair our ability to enter into certain strategic transactions. &#160; See , &#8220;Item 7 &#8211; Management Discussion and Analysis &#8211; Liquidity and Capital Resources &#8211; Deerfield Loan.&#8221; 

&#160;

&#183; We plan to continue prosecuting and protecting our rights in our KL 4 surfactant drug products and drug delivery technologies through patents, patent term restoration, trademarks and trade secrets. We expect that, as we advance our development programs, we may identify opportunities to extend the duration of our market exclusivities, through new patents and other intellectual property. We also plan to utilize and seek regulatory designations that may provide post-approval market exclusivity for our approved products. See, &#8220;&#8211; Licensing, Patents and Other Proprietary Rights and Regulatory Designations.&#8221; 

&#160;

&#183; We believe that our KL 4 surfactant technology may potentially support a product pipeline to address a variety of debilitating respiratory conditions and diseases that could represent potentially significant market opportunities. While we remain focused on RDS, we have participated in investigator-initiated research programs and government-funded research and preclinical development initiatives that explore the use of our KL 4 surfactant in the treatment of a range of respiratory diseases. For example, since 2012, we have participated in a U.S. Government-funded study to assess whether aerosolized KL 4 surfactant may mitigate radiation-induced lung injury in an animal model. Although there can be no assurance, we may in the future support development activities to establish a proof-of-concept and, if successful, thereafter determine whether to seek strategic alliances or collaboration arrangements or pursue other financial alternatives to fund further development and, if approved, commercialization of additional KL 4 surfactant indications. 

Although we currently believe that we will be successful in completing our ongoing AEROSURF clinical trials within the time frames set forth above and that the results will support our planned AEROSURF phase 3 clinical program and registration of AEROSURF in the U.S.; that we will be able to manufacture a sufficient supply of lyophilized KL 4 surfactant and ADSs and related components to support our AEROSURF clinical program; and that we will be able to secure the additional capital that we will require to achieve our business objectives, including through a strategic alliance or other strategic transaction, there can be no assurance that we will be successful. Our activities involve significant risks and uncertainties that could cause the results of our efforts to differ from our expectations. See, &#8220;Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors.&#8221;

&#160;

&#160;

SURFACTANT THERAPY

The RDS Market

Prior to the FDA&#8217;s approval of SURFAXIN, the only pulmonary surfactants commercially available in the U.S. were introduced in the 1990&#8217;s. All of the available pulmonary surfactants were animal-derived and approved for RDS in premature infants. SURFAXIN was the first synthetic, peptide-containing surfactant approved for use in neonatal medicine in the U.S.

We estimate that approximately 300,000 to 350,000 low birth weight premature infants are born annually in the U.S. (and approximately 500,000 to 600,000 in the major U.S., European and Japanese medical markets). In addition, our current market data suggests that the number of low birth weight premature infants born annually in the Latin America, Asia and the Pacific markets may represent opportunities similar to Europe and Japan and we plan to conduct further market research on this topic. In the U.S., we estimate that approximately 120,000 to 150,000 premature infants are given respiratory support because they have or are at risk for RDS. Approximately 40% (50,000 to 60,000) of these infants currently are treated with surfactant as the initial therapy for RDS, usually within the first hours of life , generally because the perceived benefits of surfactant therapy for these very fragile infants outweigh the increased risks associated with invasive intubation and mechanical ventilation . The remaining infants are usually initially supported with nCPAP alone. As discussed above, a large percentage of these patients (approximately 25%) experience nCPAP failure and require delayed surfactant therapy administered via intubation and mechanical ventilation. We estimate that approximately 20,000 to 25,000 infants will receive delayed surfactant therapy (post-nCPAP failure), bringing the total number of premature infants in the U.S. who are treated with surfactants for RDS to approximately 70,000 to 85,000. 

Market research conducted with clinicians for us by third parties suggests that, if AEROSURF were approved, a significant number of the 120,000 to 150,000 premature infants given respiratory support because they have or are at risk for RDS would receive aerosolized KL 4 surfactant as the initial treatment for RDS.

&#160;

We estimate t he surfactant market to be approximately $75 million annually in the U.S. and $250 to $300 million annually worldwide; however, we believe that this market has been constrained, in part, by the risks associated with surfactant administration and lack of medical innovation. By enabling delivery of aerosolized KL 4 surfactant using noninvasive means, we believe that, over time, AEROSURF has the potential to expand the current RDS estimated worldwide annual market to a $600 million to a $1 billion per year market opportunity. See, &#8220;&#8211; Potential Pharmacoeconomic Benefits of AEROSURF.&#8221;) 

Potential Pharmacoeconomic Benefits of AEROSURF 

In addition to the potential clinical benefits of aerosolized KL 4 surfactant, AEROSURF has the potential to provide significant pharmacoeconomic benefits for hospitals, payers and healthcare systems. In the U.S., for example, the cost to support a mechanically ventilated premature infant (an estimated $55,000 per patient), is much greater than the cost to manage a premature infant who does not need mechanical ventilation (an estimated $8,500 per patient). These costs increase even more if complications associated with intubation and mechanical ventilation should develop, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Other healthcare system costs include the need to transport RDS patients who require intubation and mechanical ventilation to tertiary care neonatal intensive care units as well as family relocation costs. Accordingly, by providing clinical and pharmacoeconomic benefits through the reduction or elimination of the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation to treat RDS, we estimate that AEROSURF may, over time, expand the size of the global surfactant market.

Serious Respiratory Indications Associated with Inflammation of the Lungs

Many respiratory diseases are associated with an inflammatory event that causes surfactant dysfunction and a loss of patency of the conducting airways. Scientific data support the premise that the therapeutic use of surfactants in aerosol form has the ability to reestablish airway patency, improve pulmonary mechanics and act as an anti-inflammatory. For this reason, we believe that AEROSURF is a highly promising program and that, with the knowledge that we gain from developing AEROSURF, we may be able to apply our technology platform to potentially address serious respiratory conditions affecting pediatric and adult patient populations. We believe that our proprietary aerosolized KL 4 surfactant technology potentially may be effective as a preventive measure to treat patients at risk for ALI and, possibly in the future, other conditions, such as COPD and CF.

Acute lung injury (ALI) is associated with conditions that either directly or indirectly injure the air sacs of the lung. ALI is a syndrome of inflammation and increased permeability of the lungs with an associated breakdown of the lungs&#8217; surfactant layer. Among the causes of ALI are complications typically associated with certain major surgeries, mechanical ventilator-induced lung injury (often referred to as VILI), smoke inhalation, pneumonia and sepsis. There are a significant number of patients at risk in the U.S. for ALI annually and there are no currently approved therapies other than supportive respiratory care.

We have collaborated in a number of preclinical studies funded through various U.S. government-sponsored, biodefense-related initiatives, including without limitation: (i) University of Pennsylvania, funded by the NIH&#8217;s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) to assess the ability of KL 4 surfactant to mitigate effects of acute radiation exposure to the lung (award number R44AI102308); (ii) University of Rochester, to evaluate the use of KL 4 surfactant to protect the lung in a radiation-induced multi-organ dysfunction animal model; (iii) a facility&#8217;s contract with the U.S. Department of Defense through the NIH Office of the Director and the Countermeasures Against Chemical Threats (CounterACT) program, to assess the utility of KL 4 surfactant for the treatment of chemical-induced ALI; (iv) a program funded by NIAID, to investigate the use of KL 4 surfactant as a treatment for influenza-induced ALI. We received additional awards of $1.0 million each from NIAID to support continued work with University of Pennsylvania to study (i) in 2014, how KL 4 surfactant may mitigate radiation-induced lung injury, and in 2015, to support continued development of our aerosolized KL 4 surfactant as a potential medical countermeasure to mitigate acute and chronic/late-phase radiation-induced lung injury. We recently received from NIAID $225,000 fixed-price contract (contract HHSN272201500027C) to study KL 4 surfactant aerosol to reduce influenza lung injury. The foregoing content concerning these initiatives is solely the responsibility of Discovery Labs and does not necessarily represent the official views of the NIH.

&#160;

We may in the future invest in or support third-party studies of these and other indications. If a proof-of-concept should be established, we would then determine whether to seek strategic alliances or collaboration arrangements or utilize other financial alternatives to fund their further development. There can be no assurance that we will invest or support studies in these indications, that we will secure the necessary capital, whether through government-sponsored grants or otherwise, that any such efforts will be successful, or that we will be able to conclude any such strategic alliance, collaboration arrangement or secure any financial alternative.

PROPRIETARY PLATFORM &#8211; KL 4 SURFACTANT AND AEROSOL TECHNOLOGIES

Our KL 4 Surfactant Technology

Pulmonary surfactants are protein and phospholipid compositions that form naturally in the human lung and are critical to survival and normal respiratory function. They spread in a thin mono-layer to cover the entire surface of the air sacs, or alveoli, of the lungs and the terminal conducting airways that lead to the alveoli. Surfactants facilitate breathing by continually modifying the surface tension of the fluid that lines the inside of the lungs. If the lungs have a surfactant deficiency, as frequently occurs in premature infants, or experience surfactant degradation, generally due to disease, lung insult or trauma, the alveoli in the lungs will tend to collapse and will not absorb enough oxygen, resulting in severe respiratory diseases and disorders. In addition to lowering alveolar surface tension, surfactants contribute in other important ways to respiration including, for example, by lowering the surface tension of the conducting airways and maintaining airflow and airway patency (keeping the airways open and expanded). Many respiratory disorders are associated with surfactant deficiency or surfactant degradation. However, surfactant therapy is currently approved by the FDA only to manage RDS in premature infants.

Our proprietary KL 4 surfactant technology produces a synthetic surfactant that is structurally similar to human pulmonary surfactant and contains a proprietary synthetic peptide, KL 4 (sinapultide), a 21-amino acid peptide that is designed to imitate the essential attributes of the human surfactant protein B (SP-B), one of four known surfactant proteins and the most important for proper functioning of the respiratory system. Our synthetic surfactant is manufactured to rigorous specifications, with minimal lot-to-lot variability, is currently approved by the FDA in liquid instillate form, and is being developed in lyophilized (freeze-dried) and aerosolized forms. We hold an exclusive worldwide license and sublicense to this technology, which was invented at The Scripps Research Institute and exclusively licensed to Johnson &#38; Johnson, Inc. (J&#38;J) and further developed by an affiliate of (J&#38;J).

We previously demonstrated in preclinical studies that our KL 4 surfactant may possess certain beneficial properties, including modulation of the inflammatory process, antimicrobial properties and non-immunogenicity. (Wolfson, M.R., Wu, J., Hubert, T.L., Gregory, T.J., Mazela, J., &#38; Shaffer, T.H. (2012), &#8220;Lucinactant attenuates pulmonary inflammatory response, preserves lung structure, and improves physiologic outcomes in a preterm lamb model of RDS.&#8221; Pediatr Res , 72(4), 375-383; Black C, Leon C, Pluim J. Bactericidal properties of the novel, peptide-containing surfactant - Surfaxin&#174;. Pediatric Academic Societies, Honolulu, HI, May, 2008. E&#8209;PAS2008:633756.11; and Clayton RG, Cochrane CG, Gregory TJ. Surfaxin&#174; (lucinactant) does not induce an immune response in a standardized preclinical model. Pediatric Academic Societies, Honolulu, HI, May, 2008. E&#8209;PAS2008:633756.12.) We believe these properties may be important attributes as we seek to develop our KL 4 surfactant technology pipeline potentially to address a broad range of respiratory conditions that represent significant unmet medical needs. However, the clinical relevance of such attributes has not been adequately established and, accordingly, warrants further study.

KL 4 Surfactant Dosage Forms 

Surfactants currently marketed in the U.S. are liquid instillate and must be stored in refrigerated conditions, warmed prior to use, and administered using endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Our KL 4 surfactant can be lyophilized (freeze-dried) and reconstituted to a liquid just prior to administration. We have demonstrated in laboratory experiments that our lyophilized KL 4 surfactant retains many of the key attributes and characteristics of our liquid instillate. We believe that it may provide additional benefits in a clinical setting, including potentially:

&#160;

&#183; improved ease of use for healthcare practitioners, including potential elimination of the drug warming process allowing for shortened preparation time; and potential reduction of continuous cold chain storage and refrigeration requirements; 

&#160;

&#183; potential for extended shelf life; and 

&#160;

&#183; relatively lower viscosity than that of a liquid instillate, which may aid and/or improve the distribution of KL 4 surfactant throughout the lung and potentially may reduce the frequency of transient peri-dosing events typically observed during administration of surfactants. 

&#160;

We have demonstrated that we can aerosolize both the liquid and lyophilized dosage forms of our KL 4 surfactant and that our aerosolized KL 4 surfactant product candidate has the following important characteristics:

&#160;

&#183; full retention of the surface-tension lowering properties of a functioning surfactant necessary to restore lung function and maintain patency of the conducting airways; 

&#160;

&#183; full retention of the surfactant composition upon aerosolization; and 

&#160;

&#183; drug particle size believed to be suitable for deposition into the lung. 

We are using lyophilized KL 4 surfactant to develop aerosolized KL 4 surfactant in our AEROSURF development program to treat RDS in premature infants. Thereafter, we potentially will be able to address a range of indications in neonatal, pediatric and adult critical care patient populations.

The Safety and Efficacy Profile of SURFAXIN for the Prevention of RDS in Premature Infants at High Risk for RDS 

Our new drug application (NDA) for SURFAXIN was supported by a phase 3 pivotal trial (SELECT) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SURFAXIN for the prevention of RDS in premature infants. Co-primary endpoints were the incidence of RDS at 24 hours and RDS-related mortality at 14 days. The primary comparator was Exosurf &#174; (colfosceril palmitate) with the intent of demonstrating superiority. SURFAXIN demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in both RDS at 24 hours and RDS-related mortality through day 14. Survanta &#174; (beractant) served as an additional active comparator. SURFAXIN demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in RDS-related mortality through day 14 versus Survanta. We also conducted a multicenter, double-blind, active-controlled, phase 3 clinical trial (STAR) which was designed as a non-inferiority trial comparing SURFAXIN to Curosurf &#174; (poractant alfa), a surfactant derived from pig lung, and was used to support the safety of SURFAXIN.

The SELECT and STAR trials, as well as a pooled phase 3 analysis, have been presented at several international medical meetings and the results from the two studies were published in Pediatrics , the Official Journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics and a premier medical journal for pediatric healthcare practitioners. Post-hoc analysis of data from our SELECT and STAR phase 3 clinical trials indicates that premature infants with RDS who were extubated after treatment with surfactant and who later required reintubation had a significantly higher rate of mortality than those infants who did not require reintubation. The data also indicate that premature infants treated with SURFAXIN may require less reintubation than currently approved animal-derived surfactants. Moreover, pharmacoeconomic analysis suggests that lower reintubation rates may result in significant hospital cost savings associated with reduction in time spent on mechanical ventilation and reduced rates of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), air leak, sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), or intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). 

SURFAXIN was approved by the FDA in 2012. In the second quarter of 2015, we decided to cease our commercial and manufacturing activities for SURFAXIN and focus our capital resources on advancing the AEROSURF clinical development program and our aerosolized KL 4 surfactant pipeline.

Our Aerosolization Delivery Technologies

Aerosol Delivery System (ADS) 

We have worldwide exclusive rights to our ADS, which consists of a capillary aerosol generator and related components, for use with pulmonary surfactants (alone or in combination with any other pharmaceutical compound(s)) for all respiratory diseases and conditions. In addition, we hold in the U.S. exclusive rights to this technology for use with non-surfactant drugs to treat certain other pediatric and adult respiratory indications in hospitals and other health care institutions. Our ADS is protected by a portfolio of patents covering the core components of the system.

&#160;

Our proprietary ADS is designed to aerosolize our KL 4 surfactant. An aerosol is created by pumping our KL 4 surfactant through a heated capillary, after which the aerosol cools and slows in velocity, yielding a dense aerosol with a defined particle size suitable for respiration. In studies conducted with our initial capillary aerosol generator and our KL 4 surfactant, we generated aerosolized KL 4 surfactant at consistent and reproducible volumes that could support delivery of therapeutic doses in reasonable periods of time. In our AEROSURF phase 2a clinical program, we assessed physiological data suggesting that AEROSURF may be delivering surfactant into the lung (where it needs to act) and reducing the incidence of nCPAP failure. We believe that our ADS is capable of delivering our KL 4 surfactant to the lung of premature infants with RDS without having to resort to invasive intubation and mechanical ventilation, procedures that are currently required to administer surfactants.

AFECTAIR &#174; Aerosol-Conducting Airway Connector 

We also developed AFECTAIR, a novel disposable aerosol-conducting airway connector for infants that is intended to simplify the delivery of aerosolized medications (including our aerosolized KL 4 surfactant) and other inhaled therapies to critical-care infants requiring ventilatory support. This device introduces aerosolized medications directly at the patient interface and minimizes the number of connections in the ventilator circuit. In vitro studies have demonstrated that this connector improves the delivery of inhaled therapies to infants requiring ventilatory support. We therefore believe that using our AFECTAIR device with our ADS will improve the delivery of our KL 4 surfactant to premature infants. Although we initially implemented a plan in 2013 to separately market AFECTAIR, we later concluded that it may provide a potential competitive advantage and decided to reserve AFECTAIR for use with our ADS in our AEROSURF development program.

&#160;

BUSINESS OPERATIONS

Research and Development

Our research and development activities are focused on developing our proprietary KL 4 surfactant, ADS, and aerosol delivery technologies into a series of KL 4 surfactant pipeline programs that potentially could support a significant respiratory critical care franchise. We are initially focused on the management of RDS in premature infants. We continually reassess our research and development priorities in light of a number of factors, including the results obtained in our clinical trials, preclinical research and related activities, advances in technology and progress in our device development programs, and relationship of a project to our near-term objectives; our cash flow requirements, financial liquidity and ability to secure necessary capital; and the potential for development partnerships, collaboration agreements and other strategic transactions. As part of our assessments, we expect to modify and adapt our research and development plans from time to time and anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future.

Our research and development resources are focused in the near term primarily on our AEROSURF development program to address RDS. We are presently engaged in a phase 2 clinical programs and have initiated our phase 2b clinical trial. Battelle assisted us in the development of a phase 2 clinic-ready ADS and has manufactured and will continue to manufacture a supply of ADS to support our preclinical activities and our phase 2 clinical program. We also are working with Battelle under a collaboration agreement to develop a phase 3 clinic-ready ADS to support additional research and development activities, our phase 3 clinical program and potential commercial supply. We are also working with Patheon to manufacture a supply of lyophilized KL 4 surfactant to support our phase 2 activities and conduct further manufacturing development work for the planned phase 3 clinical trial.

In markets outside the U.S., for AEROSURF, we plan to seek regulatory advice and discuss with international regulatory authorities a potential AEROSURF development plan to advance AEROSURF in selected major markets around the world. We also would invest in research and development activities to support a significant strategic alliance focused on the EU and/or other selected markets outside the U.S. for the development and, if approved, commercial introduction of AEROSURF.

To support our research and development activities, we have:

&#160;

&#183; physicians and scientists on staff and available under consulting arrangements who have expertise in pediatric and pulmonary medicine and extensive contacts in the neonatal medical community; 

&#160;

&#183; expertise in the design and execution of preclinical experiments and studies to support drug development. We conduct certain development-related experiments and bench studies in-house and also engage professional research laboratories and collaborate with academic scientific centers to conduct animal studies and experiments requiring specialized equipment and expertise; 

&#160;

&#183; expertise in the design, development and management of clinical trials. We have our own scientific, medical, biostatistics, and trial and data management capabilities. For the initial phase of the AEROSURF program, we have managed our clinical trial data, supported by third-party technology systems and independent consultants, and monitored all clinical activities using our clinical operations capabilities. We rely on scientific advisory committees and other medical and consulting experts to assist in the design and monitoring of clinical trials. We also have retained contract research organizations (CROs) to support our ongoing multi-center AEROSURF trials, including in the U.S., EU, Latin America and Canada; 

&#160;

&#183; regulatory personnel with expertise in FDA regulatory matters. We also consult extensively with independent FDA and international regulatory experts, including former senior scientific staff of the FDA; 

&#160;

&#183; engineering expertise to support development of our ADS and aerosol delivery technologies. In addition to our collaboration with Battelle, which has significant expertise in developing and integrating aerosol device technologies, we have our own engineering team that is focused on further optimizing our ADS; 

&#160;

&#183; quality operations capabilities to assure compliance of our drug and device development activities with applicable regulations; 

&#160;

&#183; we rely on CMOs to produce our lyophilized KL 4 surfactant, APIs and other materials for our drug product. We plan to rely on third-party manufacturers to manufacture and assemble our ADS and related components; and 

&#160;

&#183; our own analytical testing laboratory and research and medical device development laboratory. We also rely on a number of third-party analytical and testing laboratories to support our research activities and provide certain laboratory services in support of our manufacturing activities. 

Research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred. During the years ended December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, we invested approximately $28.9 million and 26.7 million, respectively, for research and development expense, which includes (i) product development and manufacturing, (ii) medical and regulatory operations, and (iii) direct preclinical and clinical programs. 

Manufacturing and Distribution

We use third parties for the manufacture of our lyophilized KL 4 surfactant, ADS and related components, AFECTAIR aerosol-conducting airway connector and related components, certain analytical and laboratory services in support of our manufacturing activities, clinical supply labeling, packaging warehousing and distribution. To support our manufacturing operations, we maintain our own analytical and technical support laboratory at our headquarters in Warrington, Pennsylvania (Warrington Laboratory).

KL 4 Surfactant 

We believe that our KL 4 surfactant product is manufactured in compliance with current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) established by the FDA and other international regulatory authorities, as applicable. Our KL 4 surfactant is a complex drug product comprised of four active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). It must be aseptically manufactured as a sterile, liquid suspension that requires ongoing monitoring of drug product stability and conformance to specifications. We currently rely on single source suppliers under separate product supply agreements for KL 4 and POPG, two of our APIs, and source the other two APIs from a single source supplier under purchase orders that we issue from time to time. To mitigate our risk, we plan to qualify secondary suppliers for our APIs over the next several years. Our risk of losing a source of supply is currently somewhat mitigated by our decision to enlarge our safety stock of all APIs.

We manufacture our lyophilized KL 4 surfactant at Patheon under a development agreement that expires October 24, 2016. We completed development work for the technology transfer of our lyophilized KL 4 surfactant manufacturing process to Patheon in 2013. We have since manufactured a sufficient clinical supply of KL 4 surfactant to support our phase 2 clinical program and other development activities. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we began a technology transfer of our lyophilized KL 4 surfactant manufacturing process to another facility at Patheon, where we expect to manufacture our lyophilized KL 4 surfactant for use in our AEROSURF phase 3 clinical program. Under our arrangement with Patheon, we provide the APIs and Patheon purchases excipients and other materials required to manufacture our lyophilized KL 4 surfactant.

&#160;

In our Warrington Laboratory, we conduct certain analytical development and quality control activities, including release testing of all APIs and release and stability testing of our lyophilized KL 4 surfactant clinical drug product. Our Warrington Laboratory also provides analytical testing and quality system support for our lyophilized and aerosolized KL 4 surfactant dosage forms, our research to identify and protect our intellectual property, including studying other potential formulations of our KL 4 surfactant and other potential KL 4 surfactant product candidates.

We also work with a number of third-party institutions and laboratories that perform various studies as well as quality control release and stability testing and other activities related to our KL 4 surfactant development and manufacturing activities. At the present time, several of these laboratories are single-source providers.

We previously manufactured our commercial supply of SURFAXIN, our KL 4 surfactant in liquid instillate form, at our manufacturing operations located in a leased facility in Totowa New Jersey (Totowa Facility). In connection with our decision to cease commercialization activities for SURFAXIN, we allowed our lease for this facility to expire in June 2015. Our Totowa facility consisted of pharmaceutical manufacturing space that was designed for the manufacture and filling of sterile liquid pharmaceuticals in compliance with cGMP. To support our manufacturing activities, we also operated a microbiology laboratory at our Totowa Facility.

Aerosol Delivery System (ADS) 

AEROSURF is an investigational combination drug/device product that produces aerosolized KL 4 surfactant by combining our lyophilized KL 4 surfactant with our aerosol delivery technologies. We are developing and, if approved, plan to commercialize AEROSURF in the U.S. for the treatment of premature infants with RDS. We believe that in the future our aerosolized KL 4 surfactant may be used to address a broad range of serious respiratory conditions in the NICU as well as in children and adults in the PICU and ICU.

The ADS includes a durable, reusable aerosol control unit and a disposable AEROSURF delivery pack (ADP). The ADP includes the critical drug product-contact components that are either cleaned or manufactured in an environmentally-controlled, clean area. The control unit and ADPs are assembled and packaged in a clean area. Each of the ADPs is tested for conformance to designated product specifications during assembly and each of the assembled control units must meet quality control standards prior to release and conform to designated product specifications.

Beginning in 2012, Battelle assisted us in a multi-phase development program focused on design and testing of clinic-ready ADS for use in our AEROSURF phase 2 clinical trials, and manufactured a sufficient number of ADSs for the phase 2a clinical trial in premature infants 29 to 34 week gestational age. Battelle also agreed to manufacture and assemble a sufficient supply of control units, ADPs and related components to support our ongoing phase 2a clinical trial in premature infants 26 to 28 week gestational age, our phase 2b clinical trial in premature infants 26 to 32 week gestational age and development activities. We expect to arrange for additional control units, ADPs and related components from Battelle, as needed . For our planned phase 3 clinical program, we and Battelle are collaborating to further develop the phase 2 ADS. Under our Collaboration Agreement, we and Battelle have agreed to negotiate in good faith for the manufacture of phase 3 control units, ADPs and related components. We are also assessing other potential partners to assure continued availability of ADS for our clinical and development activities through our phase 3 clinical program, and, if approved, initial commercial distribution. See, &#8220;&#8211; Business Operations &#8211; Strategic Alliances and Collaboration Arrangements &#8211; Battelle Collaboration Agreement.&#8221; 

Our AFECTAIR aerosol-conducting airway connector has been manufactured by Lacey Manufacturing Company, a division of Precision Products, LLC (Lacey), which also provided labeling and packaging services. We hold sufficient quantities of this device to support our AEROSURF phase 2b clinical trial.

Distribution 

We currently receive labeling, packaging and distribution services to support our AEROSURF clinical activities in the U.S., European Union and Latin America from Almac Group Limited under an agreement that expires October 15, 2016.

&#160;

We received warehousing, distribution and related services for SURFAXIN from ASD Specialty Healthcare Inc. (ASD) and Integrated Commercialization Solutions, Inc. (ICS), affiliates of AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group. ICS provided third-party logistics and assisted us with inventory tracking, customer service, order management, distribution, returned goods, contract and accounts receivable management, certain financial management services and other similar services for SURFAXIN and AFECTAIR. ASD acted as our exclusive specialty distributor for SURFAXIN in the U.S. and provided related services. Following the cessation of commercial activities for SURFAXIN, we terminated the arrangement with ASD. ICS continues to provide limited inventory services for AFECTAIR in support of our clinical activities under an agreement that will expire in October 2016.

Our collaboration with Laboratorios del Dr. Esteve, S.A. (Esteve) provides that Esteve has responsibility for distribution of specified KL 4 surfactant products in Andorra, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain. See, &#8220;&#8211; Strategic Alliances and Collaboration Arrangements &#8211; Laboratorios del Dr. Esteve, S.A.&#8221; In other parts of the world, we expect to contract for third-party distribution services prior to commercializing in those regions.

Strategic Alliances and Collaboration Arrangements

Battelle Collaboration Agreement 

On October 10, 2014, we entered into the Collaboration Agreement with Battelle providing for the further development of our ADS for potential use in our planned phase 3 clinical program for AEROSURF for the treatment of RDS in premature infants and, if AEROSURF is approved for commercial sale by the FDA or other regulatory authority, initial commercial supply. In August 2015, we agreed to amend the Collaboration Agreement to adjust the anticipated Project Plan Cost (as defined in the Agreement) and change the date for completion of Stage 3 (&#8220;Milestone Date&#8221;) as defined in the Collaboration Agreement from May 31, 2016 to July 15, 2016. As of December 31, 2015, if this development project is successfully completed, we expect to fund development activities of approximately $6.6 million through 2016, subject to certain rights of termination outlined in the Collaboration Agreement.

Pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, we and Battelle (i) have defined the requirements of the phase 3 ADS and agreed upon a detailed project plan for the next two stages of the project (Stage 1), (ii) are developing the ADS in accordance with the project plan (Stage 2), and (iii) plan to complete all required testing, verification and documentation to be in a position to manufacture a sufficient supply of ADSs (Stage 3) to support our phase 3 clinical program. Upon completion of the three-stage project plan, we and Battelle intend to negotiate in good faith potentially to enter into an agreement for the manufacture of a sufficient number of ADS to support the planned AEROSURF phase 3 clinical program, and, if AEROSURF is approved, to negotiate in good faith potentially to enter into a supply agreement providing for an initial commercial supply of ADSs.

A Steering Committee, comprised of an equal number of members appointed by each party, oversee the work of the project. The foregoing notwithstanding, we will retain final decision-making authority on all matters related to the design, registration, manufacture, packaging, marketing, distribution and sale of ADSs. We and Battelle shared equally in the costs of Stage 1 activities. Following completion of Stage 1, we and Battelle agreed on a detailed project plan, including projected costs, for Stages 2 and 3. The parties will share equally in the costs of the project plan for Stages 2 and 3 as set forth in the project plan. Battelle will bear the entire cost of any cost overruns associated with execution of the project plan and we will bear the entire cost of any increase in the agreed upon project plan costs resulting from changes in the scope of the product requirements as agreed in Stage 1 and set forth in the project plan.

In connection with the Collaboration Agreement, we issued to Battelle two warrants to purchase shares of our common stock, each having an exercise price of $70 per share and a term of 10 years, subject to earlier termination under certain circumstances set forth therein, including (i) a warrant to purchase up to 71,429 shares of our common stock, exercisable upon successful completion by Battelle of the Stage 3 activities (Initial Warrant), and (ii) a warrant to purchase up to 35,714 shares of our common stock (Additional Warrant; and together with the Initial Warrant, the Battelle Warrants), exercisable if and only if Battelle successfully completes the Stage 3 activities no later than July 15, 2016 (Milestone Date), which date may be adjusted as provided in the Collaboration Agreement. We and Battelle have agreed to execute a registration rights agreement providing for the registration of the resale of shares underlying the Battelle Warrants. The Battelle Warrants may be exercised for cash only, except that, in the event a registration statement is not effective at the time of exercise and if an exemption from registration is otherwise available at that time, the Battelle Warrants may be exercised on a cashless basis.

&#160;

In addition, if Battelle successfully completes the Stage 3 activities, we have agreed to pay Battelle royalties equal to a low single-digit percentage of the worldwide net sales and license royalties on sales of AEROSURF for the treatment of RDS in premature infants, up to an aggregate limit of $25 million.

The term of the Collaboration Agreement will end at the time we fulfill our payment obligations to Battelle, unless sooner terminated by a party as provided in the Collaboration Agreement, including for a &#8220;failure of purpose&#8221; (as defined therein) or a material breach by either party.

Laboratorios del Dr. Esteve, S.A. 

We have a strategic alliance with Laboratorios del Dr. Esteve, S.A. (Esteve) for the development, marketing and sales of a broad portfolio of potential KL 4 surfactant products in Andorra, Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain (collectively, the territory). Antonio Esteve, Ph.D., a principal of Esteve, served as a member of our Board of Directors from May 2002 until January 2013. Under the alliance, Esteve will pay us a transfer price on sales of our KL 4 surfactant products. We will be responsible for the manufacture and supply of all of the covered products and Esteve will be responsible for all sales and marketing in the territory. Esteve is obligated to make stipulated cash payments to us upon our achievement of certain milestones, primarily upon receipt of marketing regulatory approvals for the covered products. In addition, Esteve has agreed to contribute to phase 3 clinical trials for the covered products by conducting and funding development performed in the territory. As part of a 2004 restructuring in which Esteve returned certain rights to us in certain territories (Former Esteve Territories), we agreed to pay Esteve 10% of any cash up front and milestone fees (up to a maximum aggregate of $20 million) that we receive in connection with any strategic collaborations for the development and/or commercialization of certain of our KL 4 surfactant products in the Former Esteve Territories. The alliance will terminate as to each covered product, on a country-by-country basis, upon the latest to occur of: the expiration of the last patent claim related to a covered product in such country; the first commercial sale in such country of the first-to-appear generic formulation of the covered product, and the tenth anniversary of the first sale of the covered product in such country. In addition to customary termination provisions for breach of the agreement by a party, the alliance agreement may be terminated by Esteve on 60 days&#8217; prior written notice, up to the date of receipt of the first marketing regulatory approval, or, on up to six months&#8217; written notice, if the first marketing regulatory approval has issued. We may terminate the alliance agreement in the event that Esteve acquires a competitive product (as defined in the agreement).

Potential Alliances and Collaboration Arrangements 

We continue to enter into discussions with entities with a view to enter into strategic alliances, collaboration arrangements and other opportunities to support our AEROSURF development activities and resources and expertise to support the registration and commercialization of AEROSURF and potentially support the development and, if approved, commercialization of our other KL 4 surfactant product candidates in markets outside the U.S.

&#160;

LICENSING, PATENTS AND OTHER PROPRIETARY RIGHTS AND REGULATORY DESIGNATIONS 

We continue to invest in maintaining and enforcing our potential competitive position through a number of means: (i) by protecting our exclusive rights in our KL 4 surfactant, ADS and aerosol-conducting airway connector technologies through patents and patent term restorations, (ii) by seeking regulatory exclusivities, including potential orphan drug and new drug product exclusivities, and (iii) through protecting our trade secrets and proprietary methodologies that support our manufacturing and analytical processes.

&#160;

Philip Morris USA Inc. and Philip Morris Products S.A. 

In 2008, to restructure a December 2005 strategic alliance, we entered into an Amended and Restated License Agreement with Philip Morris USA, Inc. (PMUSA) with respect to the U.S. (U.S. License Agreement), and, as PMUSA had assigned its ex-U.S. rights to Philip Morris Products S.A. (PMPSA), we entered into a license agreement with PMPSA with respect to rights outside of the U.S., effective on the same date and on substantially the same terms and conditions as the U.S. License Agreement. These agreements licensed to us all rights in and to PMUSA and PMPSA proprietary aerosol technology. In addition to customary termination provisions for breach of the agreements, we may terminate the License Agreements, in whole or in part, upon advance written notice to the licensor. In addition, either party to each License Agreement may terminate upon a material breach by the other party (subject to a specified cure period). Our license under each License Agreement, unless terminated earlier, will expire as to each licensed product, on a country-by-country basis, upon the latest to occur of: the date on which the sale of such licensed product ceases to be covered by a valid patent claim in such country; the date a generic form of the product is introduced in such country; or the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of such licensed product.

Under the License Agreements, we are obligated to pay royalties at a rate equal to a low single-digit percent of sales of products sold in the Exclusive Field ( see, &#8220;&#8211; Aerosol Technology Patents and Patent Rights.&#8221;) in the territories. In connection with exclusive undertakings of PMUSA and PMPSA not to exploit the aerosol technology for all licensed uses, we are obligated to pay royalties on all product sales, including sales of certain aerosol devices that are not based on the licensed aerosol technology; provided, however, that no royalties are payable to the extent that we exercise our right to terminate the license with respect to a specific indication. We also have been required to pay minimum royalties quarterly beginning in 2014, but are entitled to reduce future quarterly royalties above the quarterly minimums in the amount of the true-up payments we make to satisfy minimum royalties for prior quarters. Our license rights extend to innovations to the aerosol technology that are made under the License Agreements. We believe that our AEROSURF aerosolized KL 4 surfactant can be developed to potentially address a broad range of serious respiratory conditions. We are developing AEROSURF to treat premature infants with RDS using the proprietary aerosol technology.

&#160;

Aerosol Technology Patents and Patent Rights 

We currently hold exclusive licenses to the aerosol technology, which is the core technology in our ADS. This technology is based on a capillary aerosol generator and is licensed both in and outside of the U.S. for use with pulmonary surfactants (alone or in combination with any other pharmaceutical compound(s)) for all respiratory diseases and conditions. In addition, under the U.S. License Agreement, our license to use the aerosol technology includes certain non-surfactant drugs to treat certain designated pediatric and adult respiratory indications in hospitals and other health care institutions. The aerosol technology patents expire on various dates beginning in May 2016 and ending in 2031, or, in some cases, possibly later.

Aerosol-Conducting Airway Connector Technology Patents and Patent Rights 

In March 2009, we filed International patent application (PCT US/2009/037409, now entered national phase) directed to aerosol-conducting airway connectors and improvements of an aerosol delivery system using AFECTAIR. The claims of this application are directed to a novel ventilation circuit adaptor (an aerosol-conducting airway connector) and related aerosol circuitry that are intended to increase the efficiency of aerosol delivery to the patient by allowing more efficient delivery of aerosols to the patient, reduce drug compound dilution and wastage and result in more precise aerosol dosing. In this patent family, U.S. Patent No. 8,701,658 was issued on April 22, 2014, European patent No. 2265309 was issued on December 16, 2015 and several foreign patents have issued during 2011 through 2015. U.S. Patent No. 8,701,658 will expire on March 17, 2029.

Other Regulatory Designations

Orphan Drug and Orphan Medicinal Product Designations 

&#8220;Orphan Drugs&#8221; are pharmaceutical products that are intended to address diseases affecting fewer than 200,000 patients in the U.S. The Office of Orphan Products Development of the FDA determines whether to designate a drug as an Orphan Drug. If a drug is designated as an Orphan Drug, it is eligible to obtain certain benefits, including, but not limited to, seven years of market exclusivity upon approval of the drug for the orphan indication, certain tax incentives for clinical research and grants to fund testing of the drug. The FDA has granted Orphan Drug designation for our KL 4 surfactant for the treatment of RDS in premature infants. If we develop AEROSURF or SURFAXIN LS for the treatment of RDS, this Orphan Drug designation may apply for those indications. We are currently seeking confirmation from the FDA. The FDA has also granted Orphan Drug designation to (i) our KL 4 surfactant for the prevention and treatment of BPD in premature infants, (ii) our KL 4 surfactant for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in adults, and (iii) our KL 4 surfactant for the treatment of CF.

&#160;

The European Commission grants &#8220;Orphan Medicinal Product&#8221; designation for pharmaceutical products for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting no more than 5 in 10,000 people which provides for exclusive marketing rights for indications in Europe for 10 years (subject to revision after six years) following marketing approval by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). In addition, the designation would enable us to receive regulatory assistance in the further development process, and to access reduced regulatory fees throughout its marketing life. We have received Orphan Medicinal Product designation for (i) our KL 4 surfactant for the prevention of RDS in premature infants of less than 32 weeks gestational age, (ii) our KL 4 surfactant for the treatment of RDS in premature infants of less than 37 weeks gestational age, (iii) our KL 4 surfactant for the treatment of ALI (which in this circumstance encompasses ARDS), and (iv) our KL 4 surfactant for the treatment of CF. In submitting our request to the EMA for Orphan Medicinal Product designations, instead of listing the drug product under the USAN name (lucinactant) as we have in the U.S., we were required to submit our request under the names of the four APIs in our KL 4 surfactant (lucinactant) as follows: sinapultide (KL 4 ), dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphatidylglycerol and palmitic acid.

Fast Track Designations and Priority Review 

Designation as a &#8220;Fast Track&#8221; product means that the FDA has determined that the drug is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs, and that the FDA will facilitate and expedite the development and review of the application for the approval of the product. The FDA may grant priority review for an NDA for a drug granted Fast Track designation if relevant criteria are met, and rolling review, which means that the review goal for the NDA would be six months.

The FDA has granted &#8220;Fast Track&#8221; designation for (i) SURFAXIN for the prevention and treatment of BPD in premature infants, and (ii) our KL 4 surfactant for the treatment of ARDS in adults. We believe that other of our products may qualify for Fast Track or other designations, including potentially breakthrough therapy, accelerated approval and priority review. These designations and programs are intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of an NDA to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening conditions.

COMPETITION

We are engaged in the highly competitive fields of pharmaceutical research and development. Competition from numerous existing companies and others entering the fields in which we operate is intense and expected to increase. We compete with conventional pharmaceutical companies, among others. Most of these companies have substantially greater research and development, manufacturing, marketing, financial, technological personnel and managerial resources than we do. Acquisitions of competing companies by large pharmaceutical or health care companies could further enhance such competitors&#8217; financial, marketing and other resources. Moreover, competitors that are able to complete clinical trials, obtain required regulatory approvals and commence commercial sales of their products before we do may enjoy a significant competitive advantage over us. There are also existing therapies that may compete with the products we are developing. See, &#8220;Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors &#8211; Our industry is highly competitive and we have less capital and resources than many of our competitors, which may give them an advantage in developing and marketing products similar to ours or make our products obsolete.&#8221;

Currently, the FDA has approved surfactants as replacement therapy only for the prevention and/or treatment of RDS in premature infants. Administration of these surfactants requires invasive intubation and mechanical ventilation. The most commonly used of these approved surfactants are Curosurf &#160; (poractant alfa), which is derived from a chemical extraction process of porcine (pig) lung, and Survanta (beractant), which is derived from a chemical extraction process of bovine (cow) lung. Curosurf is marketed in Europe by Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A. and in the U.S. by its wholly-owned subsidiary, Chiesi USA, Inc. In addition, Chiesi has published the results of a preclinical study in an early-stage effort to develop a synthetic surfactant (Sato A, Ikegami M (2012) SP-B and SP-C Containing New Synthetic Surfactant for Treatment of Extremely Immature Lamb Lung. PLoS ONE 7(7): e39392.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0039392). Chiesi has also completed a first-in-human clinical trial to study the safety and tolerability of intratracheal administration of two different single doses of its investigational synthetic surfactant in preterm infants with RDS (clinicaltrials.gov). Survanta is marketed internationally by AbbVie, Inc. ONY, Inc. markets Infasurf &#174; , a surfactant derived from calf lung surfactant lavage, in the U.S.

&#160;

With respect to our aerosolized surfactant drug delivery technologies, we believe that efforts to aerosolize animal-derived surfactants have not been satisfactory due to limitations with conventional technologies. Recent studies suggest that to aerosolize a surfactant for delivery to premature infants, it is necessary to optimize the aerosol to a particular particle size range, use an aerosol generator with characteristics that are compatible with the patient&#8217;s breathing, and employ a delivery system that delivers sufficient drug product to the patient (Mazela, et. al., Aerosolized Surfactants, Current Opinion in Pediatrics 2007, 19:155&#8211;162; Finer, et. al., An Open Label, Pilot Study of AEROSURF Combined with nCPAP to Prevent RDS in Preterm Neonate, Journal of Aerosol, Medicine and Pulmonary Drug Delivery, Volume 23, Number 5, 2010). In addition, aerosol particle size and output consistency is important throughout the aerosolized surfactant dosing period. In particular, for clinical registration trials, a surfactant aerosol delivery system needs to deliver a consistent dose to the patient throughout the individual dosing period as well as consistent dose from device to device. There are a number of device manufacturers with aerosolization expertise, including PARI and Aerogen, Inc. These companies manufacture aerosol devices such as nebulizers, aerosol masks, and compressors. Pari, for example, has provided nebulizers for use in clinical research and in commercial products for several companies. Chiesi has recently investigated the use of nebulized Curosurf using a PARI eFlow &#174; Neonatal Nebulizer System (CureNeb study; PAS 2013 abstract). Aerogen manufactures a number of aerosolization devices, including a disposable, single patient nebulizer and a reusable, multi-patient nebulizer. Aerogen nebulizers have also been used in surfactant aerosolization clinical trials including, see Finer, et al , JAMP, Volume 23, Number 5, 2010 and in the ongoing study by Sood, et al (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02294630?term=sood+surfactant&#38;rank=1). Another potential competitor to our aerosolized surfactant drug technology may be other minimally invasive surfactant therapies (MIST). MIST is delivery of exogenous surfactant to the lung via brief catheterization of the trachea with an instillation catheter in a preterm infant, followed by reinstitution of CPAP. Currently, a phase 4 clinical trial is being conducted to assess the efficacy of this therapy versus CPAP alone (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02140580). Unlike AEROSURF, these approaches would still require invasion of the vocal cords with a surfactant administration apparatus. A further potential competitor to our aerosolized surfactant drug technology may be administration of surfactant via laryngeal mask airway (LMA).

&#160;

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

In the U.S., drug products, medical devices, and drug-device combination products are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDC Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, clearance, labeling, promotion, advertising and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of drug products, medical devices, and drug-device combination products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve or clear pending new submissions to market drugs or devices warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution. Drug products, medical devices, and drug-device combination products must receive all relevant regulatory approvals or clearances before it may be marketed in the U.S. Drug products, medical devices, and drug-device combination products are subject to extensive regulation, including premarket review and marketing authorization, by similar agencies in other countries.

Drug Products

Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the U.S. typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease.

&#160;

Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.

&#160;

A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.

&#160;

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practice, or GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.

&#160;

The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB&#8217;s requirements, or may impose other conditions.

&#160;

Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance, and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases FDA requires two adequate and well&#8209;controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible.

&#160;

After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product&#8217;s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, currently exceeding $2,374,000 for fiscal year 2016, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved new drug application are also subject to annual product and establishment user fees, currently exceeding $114,000 per product and $585,000 per establishment for fiscal year 2016. These fees are typically increased annually.

&#160;

The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be filed based on the agency&#8217;s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. If the NDA submission is filed, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of new drug applications. Most such applications for standard review drug products are reviewed within ten to twelve months; most applications for priority review drugs are reviewed in six to eight months. Priority review can be applied to drugs that the FDA determines offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.

&#160;

The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee&#8212;typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts&#8212;for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.

&#160;

After FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included.

&#160;

An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug&#8217;s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.

&#160;

Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.

&#160;

Orphan Drugs

&#160;

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition &#8211; generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active moiety to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the U.S. for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.

&#160;

Fast Track Designation

&#160;

FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the fast track program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a fast track drug concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor&#8217;s request.

&#160;

Under the fast track program, sponsors have the opportunity to engage in more frequent interactions with FDA. In addition, FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track drug&#8217;s NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, FDA&#8217;s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. Additionally, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by FDA if FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.

&#160;

The Hatch-Waxman Act

&#160;

Orange Book Listing : In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims covering the applicant&#8217;s product or method of using the product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA&#8217;s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown to be bioequivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, pre-clinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as &#8220;generic equivalents&#8221; to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug.

&#160;

The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA&#8217;s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a section viii statement certifying that its proposed ANDA labeling does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.

&#160;

A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product&#8217;s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been received by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.

&#160;

An applicant submitting an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDC Act, which permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required from approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference, is required to certify to the FDA regarding any patents listed in the Orange Book for the approved product it references to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would.

&#160;

Market Exclusivity : Market exclusivity provisions under the FDC Act also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDC Act provides a five-year period of non-patent exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity, or NCE. A drug is entitled to NCE exclusivity if it contains a drug substance no active moiety of which has been previously approved by the FDA. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not receive for review an ANDA or file a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a Paragraph IV certification. The FDC Act also provides three years of market exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions for use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs for the original conditions of use, such as the originally approved indication. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all the non-clinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.

&#160;

Patent Term Extension : After NDA approval, the owner of a relevant drug patent may apply for up to a five-year patent extension. Only one patent may be extended for each regulatory review period, which is composed of two parts: a testing phase, and an approval phase. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug&#8217;s testing phase - the time between the day the IND becomes effective and NDA submission &#8211; and all of the review phase &#8211; the time between NDA submission and approval &#8211; up to a maximum of five years. The time can be shortened if FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years.

&#160;

For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a drug for which an NDA has not been submitted.

&#160;

Post-Approval Requirements

&#160;

Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling.

&#160;

Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, or REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality-control, drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. In addition, prescription drug manufacturers in the U.S. must comply with applicable provisions of the Drug Supply Chain Security Act and provide and receive product tracing information, maintain appropriate licenses, ensure they only work with other properly licensed entities, and have procedures in place to identify and properly handle suspect and illegitimate products.

&#160;

Pediatric Information

&#160;

Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.

&#160;

The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, provides NDA holders a six-month extension of any exclusivity&#8212;patent or non-patent&#8212;for a drug if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA&#8217;s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, FDA making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers.

Medical Device Products

&#160;

A medical device is an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including any component part, or accessory which is: (i) recognized in the official National Formulary, or the U.S. Pharmacopoeia, or any supplement to them; (ii) intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or other animals; or (iii) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals, and which does not achieve any of its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or other animals and which is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of any of its primary intended purposes.

&#160;

The FDC Act classifies medical devices into one of three categories based on the risks associated with the device and the level of control necessary to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are deemed to be low risk and are subject to the fewest regulatory controls. Class III devices are generally the highest risk devices and are subject to the highest level of regulatory control to provide reasonable assurance of the device&#8217;s safety and effectiveness. Class III devices must typically be approved by FDA before they are marketed.

&#160;

Generally, establishments that manufacture and/or distribute devices, including manufacturers, contract manufacturers, sterilizers, repackagers and relabelers, specification developers, reprocessors of single-use devices, remanufacturers, initial importers, manufacturers of accessories and components sold directly to the end user, and U.S. manufacturers of export-only devices, are required to register their establishments with the FDA and provide FDA a list of the devices that they handle at their facilities.

&#160;

Pre-market Authorization and Notification

&#160;

While most Class I and some Class II devices can be marketed without prior FDA authorization, most medical devices can be legally sold within the U.S. only if the FDA has: (i) approved a premarket approval application, or PMA, prior to marketing, generally applicable to Class III devices; or (ii) cleared the device in response to a premarket notification, or 510(k) submission, generally applicable to Class I and II devices. Some devices that have been classified as Class III are regulated pursuant to the 510(k) requirements because FDA has not yet called for PMAs for these devices. Other less common regulatory pathways to market for Class III devices include the humanitarian device exception, or HDE, or a product development protocol or PDP.

&#160;

Exempt Devices

&#160;

If a manufacturer&#8217;s device falls into a generic category of Class I or Class II devices that FDA has exempted by regulation, a premarket notification is not required before marketing the device in the U.S. Manufacturers of such devices are required to register their establishments and list the generic category or classification name of their devices. Some 510(k)-exempt devices are also exempt from Quality System Regulation, or QSR, requirements.

&#160;

Postmarket Requirements

&#160;

After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include: the QSR, labeling regulations, the FDA&#8217;s general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or &#8220;off&#8209;label&#8221; uses, the Medical Device Reporting regulation (which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur), and the Reports of Corrections and Removals regulation (which requires manufacturers to report recalls and field actions to the FDA if initiated to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDC Act).

&#160;

FDA enforces these requirements by inspection and market surveillance. If the FDA finds a violation, it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions such as: fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; recall or seizure of products; operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusing requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new products; withdrawing 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals already granted; and criminal prosecution.

&#160;

Combination Products

&#160;

A combination product is a product comprised of (i) two or more regulated components, i.e., drug/device, biologic/device, drug/biologic, or drug/device/biologic, that are physically, chemically, or otherwise combined or mixed and produced as a single entity; (ii) two or more separate products packaged together in a single package or as a unit and comprised of drug and device products, device and biological products, or biological and drug products; (iii) a drug, device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its investigational plan or proposed labeling is intended for use only with an approved individually specified drug, device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect and where upon approval of the proposed product the labeling of the approved product would need to be changed, e.g., to reflect a change in intended use, dosage form, strength, route of administration, or significant change in dose; or (iv) any investigational drug, device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its proposed labeling is for use only with another individually specified investigational drug, device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect.

&#160;

FDA is divided into various branches, or Centers, by product type. Different Centers typically review drug, biologic, or device applications. In order to review an application for a combination product, the FDA must decide which Center should be responsible for the review. FDA regulations require that FDA determine the combination product&#8217;s primary mode of action, or PMOA, which is the single mode of a combination product that provides the most important therapeutic action of the combination product. The Center that regulates that portion of the product that generates the PMOA becomes the lead evaluator. If there are two independent modes of action, neither of which is subordinate to the other, the FDA makes a determination as to which Center to assign the product based on consistency with other combination products raising similar types of safety and effectiveness questions or to the Center with the most expertise in evaluating the most significant safety and effectiveness questions raised by the combination product. When evaluating an application, a lead Center may consult other Centers but still retain complete reviewing authority, or it may collaborate with another Center, by which the Center assigns review of a specific section of the application to another Center, delegating its review authority for that section. Typically, the FDA requires a single marketing application submitted to the Center selected to be the lead evaluator, although the agency has the discretion to require separate applications to more than one Center. One reason to submit multiple evaluations is if the applicant wishes to receive some benefit that accrues only from approval under a particular type of application, like new drug product exclusivity. If multiple applications are submitted, each may be evaluated by a different lead Center.

&#160;

International Approvals

&#160;

Drug products, medical devices, and drug-device combination products are subject to extensive regulation, including premarket review and marketing authorization, by similar agencies in other countries. Regulatory requirements and approval processes are similar in approach to that of the U.S. but are not harmonized. International regulators are independent and not bound by the findings of the FDA and there is a risk that foreign regulators will not accept clinical trial design/results or may require additional data or other information not requested by the FDA. In addition, international regulators may require different manufacturing practices than the FDA&#8217;s cGMPs.

&#160;

Anti-Kickback, False Claims Laws

In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, medical devices, and combination products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the medical product industry in recent years. These laws include anti-kickback statutes, false claims statutes, and other statutes pertaining to health care fraud and abuse. The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally financed healthcare programs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, amended the intent element of the federal statute so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Violations of the anti-kickback statute are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor.

&#160;

Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. This includes claims made to programs where the federal government reimburses, such as Medicaid, as well as programs where the federal government is a direct purchaser, such as when it purchases off the Federal Supply Schedule. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. Additionally, PPACA amended the healthcare program anti-kickback statute such that a violation can serve as a basis for liability under the federal false claims law. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.

&#160;

Other federal statutes pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse include the civil monetary penalties statute, which prohibits the offer or payment of remuneration to a Medicaid or Medicare beneficiary that the offeror/payor knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order a receive a reimbursable item or service from a particular supplier, and the healthcare fraud statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises any money or property owned by or under the control of any healthcare benefit program in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services.
