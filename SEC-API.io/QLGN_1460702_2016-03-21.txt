Overview 

&#160; 

Ritter Pharmaceuticals, Inc. develops novel therapeutic products that modulate the human gut microbiome to treat gastrointestinal diseases. We are advancing human gut health research by exploring the metabolic capacity of the gut microbiota and translating the functionality of prebiotic-based therapeutics into applications intended to have a meaningful impact on a patient&#8217;s health. 

&#160; 

Our first novel microbiome modulator, RP-G28, an orally administered, high purity galacto-oligosaccharide, is currently under development for the reduction of symptoms associated with lactose intolerance. RP-G28 is designed to stimulate the growth of lactose-metabolizing bacteria in the colon, thereby effectively adapting the gut microbiome to assist in digesting the lactose that reaches the large intestine. RP-G28 has the potential to become the first drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) for the reduction of symptoms associated with lactose intolerance. RP-G28 has been studied in a Phase 2a clinical trial and is a first-in-class compound. 

&#160; 

The Gut Microbiome 

&#160; 

The human gut is a relatively under-explored ecosystem but provides a great opportunity for using dietary intervention strategies to reduce the impact of gastrointestinal disease. The human body carries about 100 trillion microorganisms in the intestines, which is 10 times greater than the number of cells in the human body. This microbial population is responsible for a number of beneficial activities such as fermentation, strengthening the immune system, preventing growth of pathogenic bacteria, providing nutrients, and providing hormones. The increasing knowledge of how these microbial populations impact human health provides opportunities for novel therapies to treat an assortment of diseases such as neurological disease, cardiovascular disease, obesity, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, colon cancer, allergies, autism and depression. 

&#160; 

Platform Approach 

&#160; 

Our platform is based on selectively colonizing microbiota (increasing beneficial bacteria) in the colon, and thus changing the colon&#8217;s composition of microbiota. This process has been shown to stimulate the growth of endogenous bifidobacteria, which after a short feeding period become predominant in the colon. The result is believed to reduce inflammation and improve digestion, thereby potentially reducing digestive symptoms. 

&#160; 

RP-G28 selectively increases colonization of lactose-metabolizing bacteria in the colon, such as bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, without increasing the growth of harmful bacteria, such as Escherichia coli (&#8220;E. coli&#8221;). Increased colonization of lactose-metabolizing colonic microbiota is associated with increased lactase activity, thereby increasing the fermentation of lactose into galactose, glucose and short chain fatty acids. We believe this process could reduce lactose-derived gas production and thereby mitigate the symptoms of lactose intolerance. 

&#160; 

Lactose Intolerance 

&#160; 

Studies have suggested that lactose intolerance is a widespread condition affecting over one billion people worldwide and over 40 million people in the United States (or 15% of the U.S. population), with an estimated nine million of those individuals demonstrating moderate to severe symptoms. 

&#160; 

Current annual spending on over-the-counter lactose intolerance aids in the United States has been estimated at approximately $2.45 billion . However, these options are limited and there is no long-term treatment available. 

&#160; 

Lactose intolerance develops in lactose maldigesters when consuming too much lactose or when lactose is added to a previously low-lactose diet. People with lactose maldigestion have a low activity level of lactase, the enzyme responsible for breaking down human lactose, located in the brush border membrane of the small intestine. Lactose intolerance is characterized by one or more of the cardinal symptoms; including abdominal pain/cramps, bloating, gas, and diarrhea following the ingestion of lactose or lactose-containing foods. 

&#160; 

In lactose maldigesters, unhydrolyzed lactose passes into the large intestine, where it is fermented by the indigenous microflora into gases and short chain fatty acids. The excessive gas production and the osmotic effects of excessive undigested lactose cause the symptoms of lactose intolerance. Symptoms begin about 30 minutes to two hours after eating or drinking foods containing lactose. The severity of symptoms depends on many factors, including the amount of lactose a person can tolerate and a person&#8217;s age, ethnicity, and digestion rate. The symptoms of lactose intolerance are caused by gases and toxins produced by anaerobic bacteria in the large intestine. The problem of lactose intolerance has been exacerbated because many foods and drinks contain traces of lactose without lactose being clearly stated on the product&#8217;s label. 

&#160; 

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

Diagnosis 

&#160; 

Lactose intolerance is often diagnosed by evaluating an individual&#8217;s clinical history, which reveals a relationship between lactose ingestion and onset of symptoms. Hydrogen breath tests may also be utilized to diagnose lactose malabsorption and a milk challenge may be used to differentiate between lactose malabsorption and lactose intolerance. Further tests can be conducted to rule out other digestive diseases or conditions, including: stool examination to document the presence of a parasite, blood tests to determine the presence of celiac disease, and intestinal biopsies to determine mucosal problems leading to malabsorption, such as inflammatory bowel disease or ulcerative colitis. 

&#160; 

Health Consequences 

&#160; 

Substantial evidence indicates that lactose intolerance is a major factor in limiting calcium intake in the diet of individuals who are lactose intolerant. Studies suggest that these individuals avoid milk and dairy products, resulting in an inadequate intake of calcium and significant nutritional and health risks. 

&#160; 

Research shows that lactose intolerant individuals have a higher prevalence and risk for osteoporosis, hypertension, decreased bone mineral density and several cancers, including colon and breast cancer from the lack of milk consumption . 

&#160; 

Decreased Calcium Intake Increases the Risk for Hypertension 

&#160; 

Over 30 published reports show that chronic calcium depletion may lead to increased arterial blood pressure. Many additional papers have corroborated this relationship between hypertension and a low calcium intake. 

&#160; 

A growing body of evidence indicates that a nutritionally sound diet rich in fruits, vegetables and a generous component of low-fat dairy foods (sometimes referred to as the DASH diet) is optimal for reducing the risk of hypertension. Several reports have confirmed this finding in middle-aged and elderly women. Further, it appears that the DASH diet with generous low-fat dairy is associated with low prevalence of metabolic syndrome. Studies have suggested that the levels of dairy foods (three-four servings per day) required to achieve these effects are well above current U.S. averages and even further above that of lactose intolerant individuals who are avoiding dairy due to symptoms . 

&#160; 

Decreased Calcium Intake Increases the Risk for Colon and Breast Cancers 

&#160; 

A national symposium as long ago as 1993 reported that there was a relationship between dietary calcium and both colon and breast cancer. Clearly, several other factors are involved, and the role of calcium has not yet been fully elucidated from the others. Nonetheless, there is evidence of a relationship. 

&#160; 

Our History 

&#160; 

We were formed as a Nevada limited liability company on March 29, 2004 under the name Ritter Natural Sciences, LLC. Our first prototype, Lactagen &#8482; , was an alternative lactose intolerance treatment method. In 2004, clinical testing was conducted, which included a 60 subject double-blind placebo controlled clinical trial. The results were published in the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology in May 2005 and demonstrated Lactagen &#8482; to be an effective and safe product for reducing symptoms for nearly 80% of the clinical participants who were on Lactagen &#8482; . 

&#160; 

In 2008, we expanded our focus by developing a prescription drug development program. We initiated the program by developing RP-G28, a second generation edition of Lactagen &#8482; . We believe that RP-G28 enables us to state stronger claims, garner more medical community support and reach a wider market in the effort to treat lactose intolerance. 

&#160; 

To help fund the development of RP-G28, we were awarded a grant from the United States government&#8217;s Health Care Bill program, the Qualifying Therapeutic Discovery Project, in 2008. The grant program provides support for innovative projects that are determined by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to have reasonable potential to result in new therapies that treat areas of unmet medical need and/or prevent, detect or treat chronic or acute diseases and conditions. 

&#160; 

On September 16, 2008, we converted into a Delaware corporation under the name Ritter Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Our Leading Product Candidate &#8212; RP-G28 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

RP-G28 is a novel highly purified galacto-oligosaccharide (&#8220;GOS&#8221;), which is synthesized enzymatically. The product is being developed to reduce the symptoms and frequency of episodes of abdominal pain associated with lactose intolerance. The therapeutic is taken orally (a powder solution mixed in water) for 30 consecutive days. The proposed mechanism of action of RP-G28 is to increase the intestinal growth and colonization of bacteria that can metabolize lactose to compensate for a patients intrinsic inability to digest lactose. Once colonization of bacteria has occurred, it is hypothesized that patients will continue to tolerate lactose as long as they maintain their microflora balance. RP-G28 has the potential to become the first FDA-approved drug for the reduction of symptoms associated with lactose intolerance. 

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

Galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) 

&#160; 

RP-G28 is a &#62;95% purified GOS product. GOS refers to a group of compounds containing undefined-linkages of 1 to 6 galactose units with a single glucose on the terminal end and are found at low levels in human milk. GOS products resist hydrolysis by salivary and intestinal enzymes because of the configuration of their glycosidic bonds and reach the colon virtually intact. The undigested GOS enhances the growth of beneficial, lactose metabolizing, colonic bacteria that already exist in the subject&#8217;s digestive track, including multiple species and strains of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. Once colonies of these bacteria have increased, continued lactose exposure should maintain tolerability of lactose without further exposure to RP-G28. 

&#160; 

The significance of a higher purity GOS, namely RP-G28, was highlighted in a 2010 study by Klaenhammer. The in vitro study concluded that RP-G28 promoted growth of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, but did not promote multiple strains of E. coli. In contrast, lower purity GOS stimulated both bifidobacteria as well as the strains of E. coli evaluated. (As seen below in Figure 1, NCK 430 (e. coli) grew in the presence of low purity GOS (GOS 2). Alternatively, the higher purity GOS (RP-G28/GOS 1) did not promote the growth of E. coli.). 

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

Mechanism of Action 

&#160; 

RP-G28 selectively increases colonization of lactose-metabolizing bacteria in the colon, such as bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, without increasing the growth of harmful bacteria, such as E. coli . Increased colonization of lactose-metabolizing colonic bacteria is associated with increased lactase activity and GOS utilization, thereby increasing the fermentation of lactose into galactose, glucose and short chain fatty acids. Digestion of lactose reduces lactose-derived gas production and thereby mitigates the symptoms of lactose intolerance. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Safety &#38; Toxicology of GOS 

&#160; 

Clinical studies of GOS products were reviewed as part of the safety evaluation to support our Investigational New Drug (&#8220;IND&#8221;) Application for RP-G28. The safety of GOS products in humans has been evaluated in 486 adults at doses of 2.5 to 15 gm/day for up to 14 weeks, 342 children at doses of 2.0 &#8211; 2.4 gm/day for up to 1 year, and in 2415 newborns and infants for up to 6 months. Overall, no reports of severe adverse events attributable to the consumption of GOS were reported in the literature. 

&#160; 

Among the studies that included tolerance endpoints, side effects were limited to reports of flatulence, fullness, gastronintestinal symptoms, and changes in stool consistency and frequency when GOS was consumed on a repeat basis at quantities of between 5.5 to 15 g/day (Ito 1990; Deguchi 1997; Teuri 1998); however, this effect was not consistently reported in all studies (Teuri and Korpela 1998; Depeint 2008; Drakoularako 2010; van de Heuval 1998; van Dokkum 1999; Bouhnik 2004; Sairanen and Piirainen 2007; Shadid 2007). Similar observations of increased flatulence have been reported following the consumption of fructooligosaccharides (15 gm/day) over a 7-day period (Alles 1996), and this symptom represents a localized effect that is expected in association with the consumption of indigestible fiber in large quantities. There were no reports of events in other System Organ Class (SOC) suggestive of systemic toxicity. 

&#160; 

RP-G28 Clinical Safety 

&#160; 

In addition to the nonclinical studies evaluating GOS products, the safety of RP-G28 for clinical investigation is supported by clinical safety results from our Phase 2a study, G28-001. In this study, RP-G28 was escalated from 1.5 grams per day to 15 grams per day over a 35-day dosing period. 

&#160; 

RP-G28 was well-tolerated. There were no serious adverse effects. The most common adverse effects were headache, dizziness, nausea, upper respiratory tract infection, nasal congestion and pain. All adverse effects were mild or moderate in severity, and event occurrence was distributed over the treatment and post-treatment follow-up phase. No clinically significant changes or findings were noted from clinical lab evaluations, vital sign measurements, physical exams, or 12-lead electrocardiograms.

Our Market Opportunity 

&#160; 

Unmet Medical Needs 

&#160; 

Lactose intolerance is a challenging condition to manage. According to a market research study conducted by Objective Insights in April 2012, approximately 60% of lactose intolerant sufferers reported experiencing symptoms daily, or bi-weekly. Not only can symptoms be painful and embarrassing, they can also dramatically affect one&#8217;s quality of life, social activities, and health. Currently there are few reliable, or effective, treatments available that provide consistent or satisfactory relief. 

&#160; 

Currently, there is no approved prescription treatment for lactose intolerance. Most persons with lactose intolerance avoid ingestion of milk and dairy products while others substitute non-lactose-containing foods in their diet. However, complete avoidance of lactose-containing foods is difficult to achieve (especially for those with moderate to severe symptoms) and can lead to significant long-term morbidity ( i.e. , dietary deficiencies of calcium and vitamin D). 

&#160; 

At the 2010 National Institute of Health (&#8220;NIH&#8221;) Consensus Development Conference: Lactose Intolerance and Health, the NIH highlighted numerous health risks tied to lactose intolerance such as: osteoporosis; hypertension; and low bone density . There is substantial evidence indicating that lactose intolerance is a major factor in limiting calcium and nutrient intake in the diet of people who are lactose intolerant. Adequate calcium intake is essential to reducing the risks of osteoporosis and hypertension . In addition, chronic calcium depletion has been linked to increased arterial blood pressure, thereby establishing a relationship between hypertension and low calcium intake . Moreover, there is evidence of a correlation between calcium intake and both colon and breast cancer . 

&#160; 

Treatment Options 

&#160; 

Doctors generally recommend the following treatments for the management of lactose intolerance: (1) dairy avoidance; (2) lactase supplements; (3) probiotics/dietary supplements; and (4) dairy substitutes/lactose free products. Despite educating their patients on all viable treatment options, physicians tend to advise their patients to refrain from consuming any dairy products whatsoever. However, in a 2008 survey conducted by Engage Health, 47% of lactose intolerance sufferers reported that this method was not effective (largely due to hidden dairy products in ingredients), and only 30% of lactose intolerance sufferers reported lactase supplements as being effective in managing their lactose intolerance . Further, while probiotics/dietary supplements have been demonstrated to aid and support one&#8217;s digestive system, helping break down general foods consumed, they don&#8217;t directly help with lactose intolerance. The 2008 survey by Engage Health suggests that the majority of lactose intolerance patients are dissatisfied with current treatment options.

Growing Awareness 

&#160; 

Lactose intolerance is a condition that continues to expand as society advances and evolves. Education and awareness have increased, and the American diet has greatly changed over the past decade to include more dairy-based goods. As the populace is growing older, the prevalence of lactose intolerance is increasing because more people tend to develop lactose intolerance later in life. Increased education and diagnosis is making more people aware of their allergies and digestive conditions. Physicians may compound the growth of lactose intolerance prevalence and its associated disorders by recommending individuals to avoid dairy products, a practice which in and of itself may increase severity of the intolerance. 

&#160; 

It has been estimated that gastroenterologists see approximately 15 new patients with lactose intolerance each month . 

&#160; 

Doctors tend to diagnose lactose intolerance in a patient before the patient is able to self-diagnose it . However, patients tend to initiate discussion about lactose intolerance with their doctors. This is indicative of broad public awareness of lactose intolerance. Doctors often administer two tests for diagnosing lactose intolerance: (i) a symptom history test and (ii) a hydrogen breath test. 

&#160;

Clinical and Regulatory 

&#160; 

IND Application/Phase 1 

&#160; 

We submitted an IND application for RP-G28 to the FDA in June 2010. Because the safety and tolerability profile, pharmacokinetics and dose response curve of GOS products is generally well understood, as part of our IND submission, we proposed that the data supporting the IND was sufficient to support a Phase 2 proof-of-concept study in a small number of lactose-intolerant patients. The FDA agreed with this proposal and the typical Phase 1 clinical program in healthy volunteers was replaced by a Phase 2a program in subjects with lactose intolerance. 

&#160; 

On June 28, 2010, we received an advice letter from the FDA regarding our IND submission. The FDA suggested that we (1) consider expanding our inclusion criteria to include females of childbearing potential who are willing to use appropriate contraception throughout the duration of the protocol; (2) follow the FDA&#8217;s guidance regarding Patient-Reported Outcome Measures; and (3) include a pharmacokinetic study in our proposed Phase 2a trial to determine the extent of systemic exposure of RP-G28. 

&#160; 

Phase 2a Study 

&#160; 

In June 2011, we began a Phase 2a clinical trial on RP-G28 to validate the efficacy, safety, and tolerance of RP-G28 compared to placebo when administered to subjects with symptoms of lactose intolerance. The clinical results from the study, which concluded at the end of 2011, showed that RP-G28 improved lactose digestion versus placebo as measured by the improvement in digestive symptoms associated with lactose intolerance and decline in hydrogen production present in a hydrogen breath test. 

&#160; 

On June 12, 2013, we announced positive data from our Phase 2a first-in-human, proof of concept clinical study of RP-G28. The purpose of the study was to assess the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of RP-G28 compared to a placebo when administered to subjects with symptoms associated with lactose intolerance. The results were presented at Digestive Diseases Week and the New York Academy of Sciences Conference on Probiotics, Prebiotics and the Host Microbiome: The Science of Translation, and co-sponsored by the Sackler Institute for Nutrition Science and the International Scientific Association of Probiotics and Prebiotics. 

&#160; 

The double-blinded, randomized, multi-center, placebo-controlled Phase 2a study evaluated RP-G28 in 62 patients with lactose intolerance over a treatment period of 35 consecutive days. Post-treatment, subjects reintroduced dairy into their diets and were followed for an additional 30 days to evaluate lactose digestion, as measured by hydrogen production and symptom improvements. In order to confirm lactose intolerance and study participation, subjects underwent a 25-gram lactose challenge in the clinic. Lactose intolerance symptoms and hydrogen production via hydrogen breath test were assessed for six hours post-lactose dose. Eligible subjects were required to demonstrate a minimum symptom score and a &#8220;positive&#8221; hydrogen breath test in order to be eligible for randomization. A &#8220;positive&#8221; breath test was defined as a hydrogen gas elevation of 20 parts per million (ppm) at two time-points within the six hours following a lactose-loading dose. The primary endpoints included tracking patients&#8217; gastrointestinal symptoms via a patient-reported symptom assessment instrument (a Likert Scale, measuring individual symptoms of flatulence, bloating, cramping, abdominal pain and diarrhea, on a scale of 0 (none) to 10 (worst)) at baseline, day 36 and day 66; as well as the measurement of hydrogen gas levels in their breath following a 25-gram lactose challenge. 

&#160; 

RP-G28 was well tolerated, with no significant adverse events reported. The Phase 2a study demonstrated clinically meaningful benefits to patients on treatment, whereas treated subjects reported increased tolerance to lactose and dairy foods: reduced lactose intolerance symptoms (gas, bloating, cramping and abdominal pain) were reported in subjects on RP-G28, a durable reduction in abdominal pain (p=0.019) was reported, and treated patients were six times more likely to describe themselves as lactose tolerant (p=0.039). In sum, positive trends were seen when the entire per protocol study population was analyzed, including some statistically significant subgroup analysis, suggesting that a therapeutically positive effect is seen. Although there were few primary and secondary efficacy endpoints with statistically significant results, the combined data suggest that RP-G28 is exerting a positive therapeutic effect. We believe these positive drug effect trends combined with the benign safety profile support continued drug development of RP-G28. 

&#160; 

Key findings of the Phase 2a study include: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; RP-G28 was well tolerated with no significant study-drug related adverse effects. The benign adverse event safety profile of RP-G28 with dose levels up to 15 gm/day observed in this study is consistent with the known safety of GOS products administered up to 20 gm/day reported in literature. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Subjects in the RP-G28 group reported a reduction in total symptoms after treatment. Reported symptom improvement continued 30 days post-treatment. Improvement in symptoms was assessed in the study using several different measures, including a pain Likert scale and a patient global assessment. Subjects receiving RP-G28 had greater improvement in most of their symptoms (cramps, bloating and gas) following lactose challenge compared to placebo, but the differences were not statistically significant given the small cohort size. However, a clinically meaningful reduction in abdominal pain was seen in subjects receiving RP-G28 compared to placebo. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; An analysis ofundefined &#8220;responders&#8221; for abdominal pain (defined as subjects who reported a score of zero in abdominal pain severity following a lactose challenge at Day 36/Hour 6 and Day 66/Hour 6) was performed. In the 55 subjects who noted abdominal pain following the baseline (Day 0) lactose challenge, 50% of RP-G28-treated subjects reported no abdominal pain compared to 17% of the placebo-treated subjects. This difference was statistically significant (p = 0.0190). See Figure 2 below. &#160; 

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; An analysis ofundefined &#8220;responders&#8221; for abdominal pain (defined as subjects who reported a greater than 50% decrease in abdominal pain severity following lactose challenge between Day 0/Hour 6 and Day 36/Hour 6) was performed. In the 55 subjects who noted abdominal pain following the baseline (Day 0) lactose challenge, 72.2% of RP-G28-treated subjects reported a &#62;50% reduction in abdominal pain severity compared to 42.1% of the placebo-treated subjects. This difference was also statistically significant (p=0.0288). &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; To better explore a meaningful benefit to patients, a global assessment was explored. Six times as many patients in the treatment group versus the placebo group described themselves as lactose tolerant and did not report symptoms associated with lactose intolerance on Day 66. After completion of study treatment at Day 36, subjects were encouraged to re-introduce dairy foods into their diet. Thirty days later (Day 66), subjects were asked to provide an assessment of their symptom status, i.e., whether they considered themselves still lactose intolerant compared with subjects receiving placebo (Yes/No). As seen below in Figure 2 below, in the 58 subjects providing responses, a significantly larger percentage of subjects receiving RP-G28 (30%) considered themselves no longer lactose intolerant compared with subjects receiving placebo (5.6%); this result was statistically significant (p=0.0389). &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; The reduction in total symptoms following a post-treatment lactose challenge was consistent with the improvement in post-treatment hydrogen breath test results as compared to baseline (pre-treatment) results. Although rarely used in clinical practice and primarily used to identify lactase deficiency, hydrogen measurements were used as an eligibility criterion as well as an outcome measure in our Phase 2a proof-of-concept study. Our intent was to better understand how lactose intolerant symptoms and hydrogen values correlated and whether a treatment effect could be detected by hydrogen production. In the RP-G28 group, the median peak hydrogen production was 113 ppm on Day 0 and 110 ppm on Day 36. In the placebo group, the median peak hydrogen production was 94 ppm at Day 0 and 113 on day 36. At Day 0 and Day 36, the median total hydrogen production was 385 ppm and 367 ppm, respectively, for the RP-G28 group and 347 and 436 ppm, respectively, for the placebo group. Comparison of the hydrogen breath test results between RP-G28 and placebo shows that median hydrogen production was generally similar between the two treatment groups at Day 0 while at Day 36, median hydrogen production was lower in the RP-G28 group compared to placebo at the peak time points of 2 to 4 hours. While the differences were not large, the RP-G28 group had consistently lower levels of breath hydrogen production from Hours 2 to 6 following lactose challenge, but the results did not correlate with clinical symptoms. In the Placebo group, differences in hydrogen production following lactose challenge were not apparent. &#160;

In the Phase 2a study, changes in the fecal microbiome were investigated using both Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms (TRFLP), a molecular biology technique for profiling microbial communities based on the position of a restriction site closest to a labeled end of an amplified gene, and microme analysis of 16S rRNA genex by pyrosequencing, a method of DNA sequencing (determining the order of nucleotides in DNA).

In addition, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a multivariate method that helps transform a number of possibly correlated variables into a smaller number of uncorrelated variables called principal components, thereby reducing the dimensions of a complex dataset, showed statistically significant shifts in the microbiome of subjects fed RP-G28, compared to placebo, at 66 days. Specifically, RP-G28 significantly altered the microbiomes of 82% of the study participants who received the treatment. See Figure 3 above. 

&#160; 

Pre-treatment, three distinct clusters were identified, whereas post-treatment (Day 66) two distinct clusters were identified, showing a clear shift in certain species represented before and after treatment. 

&#160; 

Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA), a multivariate method that helps visualize similarities and dissimilarities in large datasets, was also utilized to analyze the microbiome data. For analysis of 16S amplicon sequencing data, we created Unweighted Unifrac similarity matrices (that is we conducted PCoA) and applied ANOSIM (Analysis of Similarities) and PERMANOVA (Permutational Analysis of Variance) statistical analyses. Our analysis showed a significant association between Day (day 0 or baseline, and day 36 and 66 as categories) and microbiome composition (ANOSIM R = 0.218, P = 0.0001, PERMANOVA Pseudo-F = 3.4318, P = 0.0001). These data indicate that RP-G28 and subsequent introduction of lactose into the diet had impacted the fecal microbiome of participants. Further, lactose metabolizing bacteria were shown to increase in the treatment group. 

&#160; 

The results of our Phase 2a study were published in Nutrition Journal in a manuscript entitled &#8220; Improving lactose digestion and symptoms of lactose intolerance with a novel galacto-oligosaccharide (RP-G28): a randomized, double-blind clinical trial .&#8221; 

&#160; 

We held a Type C meeting with the FDA&#8217;s Division of Gastroenterology and Inborn Errors Products on February 20, 2013. The purpose of the meeting was to obtain the FDA&#8217;s feedback on the planned Phase 2 program and Phase 3 programs, inform the FDA of our ongoing development plans, gain feedback on relevant clinical trial design and end points related to patient meaningful benefits, and to inform the FDA of the status of our product characterization. We believe that this meeting was a significant step forward in streamlining the pathway to initial U.S. approval of RP-G28 to reduce symptoms and frequency of symptomatic episodes associated with lactose intolerance. The meeting and official meeting minutes provided valuable guidance on the development path of RP-G28: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; The FDA agreed with our decision to develop and validate a new analytical assay for RP-G28 drug substance and drug product. This adjustment will provide additional information about GOS components and non-GOS impurities, which the FDA agrees should be in place before we prepare batches of the drug substance for use in any pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Based on our plan to conduct ICH-compliant GLP embryo-fetal development toxicology studies (in two species) and the ICH standard battery of genotoxicity tests using RP-G28, the FDA agreed that no additional nonclinical studies are needed at this time to support Phase 3 studies. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; The FDA advised us on potential end points and clinical trial design. &#160; 

&#160; 12 &#160; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; We addressed the FDA&#8217;s recommendation in its June 28, 2010 advice letter that we include a pharmacokinetic study in the Phase 2b study to assess the extent of systemic exposure of RP-G28. We explained to the FDA that we did not collect serum samples for pharmacokinetic measurement in the Phase 2a study because at the time assays for measuring RP-G28 were not available and significant systemic absorption was not anticipated. We then informed the FDA of our plan to evaluate alternatives, as a surrogate for RP-G28 systemic exposure as part of our Phase 2b program. The FDA agreed with this approach. &#160; 

Following analysis of the Phase 2a clinical trial, discussions with the FDA in 2013 about our clinical development plan, and further discussions with our regulatory consultants, we initiated a Phase 2b/3 clinical trial of RP-G28 in March 2016. We believe this trial could serve as one of two pivotal trials should the resulting data and the FDA be supportive of this trial as a pivotal trial. We did not discuss the Phase 2b/3 study design and development plan with the FDA, though we did submit a supplement to the IND detailing the protocols for the adaptive study. See below for further discussion of our Phase 2b/3 study. 

&#160; 

Nonclinical Safety Plans 

&#160; 

Given the established safety profile of GOS in humans and the lack of significant safety concerns with RP-G28 administered to subjects in the Phase 2a study, no additional non-clinical safety studies are planned to support continued evaluation of RP-G28 in the Phase 2 program. 

&#160; 

Guidelines adopted by the FDA and established by ICH require nonclinical studies that specifically address female fertility to be completed before the inclusion of women of child bearing potential in large-scale or long-duration clinical trials (e.g., Phase 3 trials). In the United States, such assessments of embryo-fetal development can be deferred until before Phase 3 using precautions to prevent pregnancy in clinical trials. As the FDA recommended in their June 28, 2010 advice letter, we will continue to evaluate females of child-bearing potential who are willing to use appropriate contraception throughout the duration of any study. In addition, to support Phase 3 studies, we plan to perform ICH-compliant embryo-fetal development toxicology studies of RP-G28. We will then confirm any negative findings from these toxicology studies in a standard battery of ICH-compliant genotoxicity tests using RP-G28. 

&#160; 

Phase 2b/3 Study 

&#160; 

The Phase 2b/3 clinical trial of RP-G28 was initiated in March 2016. This study is designed as a multi-center double-blinded, placebo controlled clinical trial of approximately 350 subjects to determine the maximum tolerated dose and optimal dose-escalation schedule for RP-G28. The trial will assess patients with moderate to severe abdominal pain as measured by a pain Likert scale after a lactose challenge. The Phase 2b/3 clinical trial is designed to measure additional lactose intolerance symptoms (gas, bloating, diarrhea, cramps) as secondary endpoints. Entry criteria in the Phase 2b/3 study will include a hydrogen breath test to validate lactase deficiency. The Phase 2b/3 study design includes a screening phase; a 30-day course treatment phase and a 30-day post-treatment evaluation phase. The study is designed to gradually escalate the dose beyond the 15 gm/day dose level evaluated in the Phase 2a study. Study subjects will abstain from lactose containing food products and then be randomized evenly (1:1:1:1) to receive one of three doses of RP-G28 or placebo for 30 days. Subjects will then be followed post-treatment for an additional 30 days while lactose containing food products are re-introduced into their diets. The primary endpoint for the Phase 2b/3 clinical study will be a durable reduction in abdominal pain, with secondary endpoints measuring changes in individual lactose intolerance symptoms (gas, bloating, diarrhea, cramps). The Phase 2b/3 study is also designed to include collection of blood samples to assess systemic exposure to RP-G28 using measurement of serum concentrations of a trisaccharide. This is will be monitored as a surrogate to assess the systemic bioavailability of orally administered RP-G28. Additionally, the study will require the collection of fecal samples from patients enrolled to evaluate the baseline and changes to the patient&#8217;s microbiome that correlate to symptom reduction and lactose tolerance. 

&#160; 

In order to gather long-term data on subjects exposed to RP-G28, we also intend for subjects completing the Phase 2b/3 protocol to be offered enrollment in an observational extension study, G28-004. As RP-G28 is expected to provide extended relief from lactose intolerance symptoms beyond the initial 30-day treatment phase, this extension study for the Phase 2b/3 program is going to assess the long-term treatment effect. We intend for the results from this study to guide the need to evaluate an additional 30-day course of treatment in Phase 3 in subjects who experience the return of lactose intolerance symptoms after an initial course of RP-G28. 

&#160; 

Adaptive seamless phase 2b/3 designs, such as the Phase 2b/3 pivotal clinical trial for RP-G28, are aimed at interweaving the two phases of full development by combining them into one single, uninterrupted study conducted in two steps. Adaptive seamless phase 2b/3 designs enable a clinical trial to be conducted in steps with the sample size calculation selected on the basis of data observed in the first step to continue along to the second step. The main statistical challenge in such a design is ensuring control of the type I error rate. Most methodology for such trials is based on the same endpoint being used for interim and final analyses. A type I error is one in which the adaptation process leads to design, analysis, or conduct flaws that introduce bias that increases the chance of a false conclusion that a treatment is effective (a type I error). Controlling type I error can be accomplished by prospectively specifying and including in the statistical analysis plan all possible adaptation plans that may be considered during the course of the trial. We are working with Covance, Inc., a contract research organization (&#8220;CRO&#8221;) to control type I error in our Phase 2b/3 study.

Research and Development Agreement with Kolu Pohaku Technologies and Kolu Pohaku Management, LLC 

&#160; 

On November 30, 2010, we entered into a Research and Development Agreement &#38; License (the &#8220;R&#38;D Agreement&#8221;) with Kolu Pohaku Technologies, LLC (&#8220;KPT&#8221;) and Kolu Pohaku Management, LLC (&#8220;KPM&#8221;). The R&#38;D Agreement called for KPT to make a series of payments to us totaling $1,750,000 in exchange for us performing certain research and development activities in Hawaii for the benefit of KPT (referred to herein as the &#8220;KP Research&#8221;), from the effective date of the agreement through December 31, 2014. The KP Research consisted of the initial phase of research, including the conduct of Phase 2 clinical trials in Hawaii for RP-G28. Under the terms of the R&#38;D Agreement, we maintained sole and exclusive control over the manner in which we and our employees and contractors performed the KP Research and ownership of the results of our ongoing research related to RP-G28, although KPT maintained ownership of the results of the KP Research. Inventions, developments, and improvements arising out of the KP Research were owned by KPT. Under the terms of the R&#38;D Agreement we would bear any costs involved in obtaining patents for any inventions, developments or improvements resulting from the KP Research. In exchange for the irrevocable, perpetual, exclusive, worldwide right and license to the results of the KP Research, we agreed to pay a quarterly royalty payment to KPT ofundefined $32,000 commencing March 31, 2015 and continuing through December 31, 2035 or until such time as the KPM Option (described below) was exercised. The license included, without limitation, our right to sublicense the KP Research and to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale and import products based, in whole or in part, on the KP Research. The R&#38;D Agreement was subsequently amended on, July 6, 2011, September 30, 2011, February 6, 2012 and November 4, 2013 to increase the funding to be received by us thereunder and to add royalty payments made by us for years subsequent to the original agreement. 

&#160; 

In connection with the R&#38;D Agreement, we also granted an option (the &#8220;KPM Option&#8221;) to KMP. Pursuant to the terms of the KPM Option Agreement, we had the right to put to KPM and KPM had the right to call from us 1,469,994 shares of our then authorized Series B preferred stock at any time after December 31, 2014. The number of shares was determined by dividing the $1,750,000 of payments made by KPT to us under the R&#38;D Agreement by the Series B preferred stock original issue price ofundefined$1.19 per share. On March 26, 2015, we exercised our right to put the KPM Option and issued 1,469,994 shares of Series B preferred stock to KPM (the &#8220;KPM Shares&#8221;). Pursuant to the terms of the KPM Option Agreement, our issuance of the KPM Shares to KPM resulted in the full satisfaction of our obligation to make royalty payments to KPT under the R&#38;D Agreement and also resulted in the termination of the R&#38;D Agreement and therefore KPM&#8217;s and KPT&#8217;s right, title, and interest in the KP Research under the R&#38;D Agreement was assigned to Ritter. 

&#160; 

Master Service Agreement 

&#160; 

On December 30, 2015, we entered into a Master Service Agreement with Covance, Inc. (&#8220;Covance&#8221;), with an effective date of December 29, 2015. Pursuant to the terms of the Master Service Agreement, Covance (or one or more of its affiliates) will provide Phase 1, 2, 3, and 4 clinical services for a clinical study or studies to us, and, at our request, assist us with the design of such studies, in accordance with the terms of separate individual project agreements to be entered into by the parties. The term of the agreement is for three years and will renew automatically for successive one year periods unless Covance is no longer providing services under the agreement or either party has terminated the agreement upon written notice. We may terminate the Master Service Agreement or any individual project agreement entered into under the Master Service Agreement prior to the applicable study&#8217;s completion at any time for any reason upon 30 days written notice to Covance, except when the reason for termination is the safety of subjects, in which case it may be terminated immediately. Covance may not terminate any individual project agreement without cause, except when the reason for the termination is the safety of subjects, in which case it may be terminated immediately. In the event of a termination of the Master Service Agreement, Covance will be entitled to full payment for (i) work performed on the applicable project upon through the date work on such project is concluded and (ii) reimbursement for all non-cancellable and non-refundable expenses and financial obligations which Covance (or an affiliate) has incurred or undertaken on our behalf. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing 

&#160; 

We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of any of our product candidates, nor do we have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. In December 2009, we entered into a Clinical Supply and Cooperation Agreement (the &#8220;Supply Agreement&#8221;), with Ricerche Sperimentali Montaleor (&#8220;RSM&#8221;) and Inalco SpA (&#8220;Inalco&#8221;). Pursuant to the terms of the Supply Agreement, RSM has exclusively manufactured for us, and will continue to manufacture for us in connection with our Phase 2b/3 study, an improved form of GOS (higher purity) (referred to as &#8220;Improved GOS&#8221;). RSM also agreed that it will not, except as necessary for RSM to perform its obligations under the Supply Agreement, market or sell Improved GOS, or any galacto-oligosaccharides that are of greater purity to any third party. In addition to our payments to RSM for the GOS manufactured or to be manufactured by RSM for us in connection with our clinical trials, we agreed to pay RSM certain milestone payments including a payment ofundefined $50,000 as consideration for its assistance in seeking the necessary regulatory approvals for RP-G28 (consisting of a payment ofundefined $25,000 upon the effective date of the Supply Agreement and a payment ofundefined $25,000 upon completion to our satisfaction of the drug master file submission to the FDA related to RP-G28 or another product using Improved GOS). We also agreed to pay a monthly fee ofundefined$7,000 in consideration for the services provided by RSM under the agreement, which became payable 30 days after our initial public offering, and will continue until such time as the parties agree that RSM&#8217;s support for regulatory approval is no longer required, which is expected to be after the completion of our Phase 3 studies. Pursuant to the terms of the Supply Agreement, we also agreed to reimburse RSM for its reasonable costs actually incurred in purchasing certain equipment required to perform its analysis methods for Improved GOS, which equipment we will own upon payment. 

&#160; 

&#160; 14 &#160; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the terms of the Supply Agreement, RSM granted us an exclusive worldwide option to the assignment of all right, title and interest to the Improved GOS (the &#8220;Improved GOS IP&#8221;), which we could exercise by paying RSM $1,000,000, within 10 days of a Financing Receipt (as defined in the Supply Agreement), which included our initial public offering. As additional consideration for the assignment of the Improved GOS IP, we agreed to pay RSM an additional $1,000,000 within 10 days of the approval by the FDA of the new drug application (&#8220;NDA&#8221;) for our first product containing Improved GOS. Under the terms of the Supply Agreement, we would continue to make the monthly payments to RSM until such time as the parties agree that RSM&#8217;s support for regulatory approval is no longer required. See the section below entitled &#8220;Intellectual Propertyundefined&#8212;undefinedPatents and Proprietary Rights Covering Our Drug Candidates&#8221; for additional information regarding the Improved GOS IP. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the terms of the Supply Agreement, the parties agreed that in the event we were able to obtain a Financing Receipt, the parties would enter into a further agreement (the &#8220;Proposed Agreement), for the purpose of clarifying future manufacturing services to be provided by RSM to us regarding Improved GOS and payment by us for such services. The Supply Agreement sets forth certain terms and conditions that the parties to the agreement agreed would be included in the Proposed Agreement, including, among other things, a provision that calls for certain milestone payments to be paid to RSM by us in the event we receive approval from the FDA to market RP-G28 or another product using Improved GOS, which milestone payments will be based upon the number ofundefined&#8220;units&#8221; sold by us containing Improved GOS. The Proposed Agreement will terminate upon the expiration of the first patent filed by RSM regarding Improved GOS. 

&#160; 

The Supply Agreement was amended in September 2010. Pursuant to the terms of this amendment, we have paid all obligations to RSM in satisfaction of the payment due to RSM upon completion to our satisfaction of the drug master file submission to the FDA related to RP-G28 (as described above). The amendment also further defined the terms and conditions of the supply of Improved GOS by RSM to us to ensure adequate and timely delivery of Improved GOS to us. 

&#160; 

The Supply Agreement was further amended on July 24, 2015 to adopt certain provisions contemplated by the Proposed Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the second amendment to the Supply Agreement, the provisions related to the exclusive worldwide option to the assignment of all right, title and interest to the Improved GOS IP were amended to provide that we could exercise the option by paying RSM $800,000 within ten days after the effective date of the second amendment to the Supply Agreement. We exercised this option on July 30, 2015 and RSM transferred the Improved GOS IP to us. Under the terms of the Supply Agreement, as amended, if we fail to make any future option payment required under the terms of the Supply Agreement, we may be required to return the Improved GOS IP to RSM. The terms of the second amendment to the Supply Agreement require us to pay RSM $400,000 within 10 days following FDA approval of a new drug application for the first product owned or controlled by us using Improved GOS as its active pharmaceutical ingredient and to pay RSM the sum of $250 per kilo for clinical supply of Improved GOS instead of $2,000 per kilo as was previously required. 

&#160; 

In consideration for RSM entering into the second amendment to the Supply Agreement, we issued 100,000 shares of our common stock to RSM pursuant to a stock purchase agreement. The shares issued to RSM are subject to a lock-up agreement, pursuant to which RSM has agreed that it will not sell these shares for a period ending on the earlier of (i) the public release by us of the final results of our Phase 2b/3 clinical trial of RP-G28 and (ii) the filing of a Form 10-Q with the SEC for the fiscal quarter in which we receive the results of our Phase 2b/3 clinical trial of RP-G28. 

&#160; 

Commercialization 

&#160; 

Given our stage of development, we have not yet established a commercial organization or distribution capabilities. RP-G28, if approved, is intended to be prescribed to patients suffering from lactose intolerance. These patients are normally under the care of a gastroenterologist and/or a primary care physician. Our current plan is to evaluate a possible partnership to commercialize RP-G28 for the reduction of symptoms associated with lactose intolerance in patients in the United States and Europe if it is approved. We may also build our own commercial infrastructure or utilize contract reimbursement specialists, sales people and medical education specialists, and take other steps to establish the necessary commercial infrastructure at such time as we believe that RP-G28 is approaching marketing approval. Outside of the United States and Europe, subject to obtaining necessary marketing approvals, we will likely seek to commercialize RP-G28 through distribution or other collaboration arrangements for patients suffering from lactose intolerance. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense competition and rapid innovation. Although we know of no drug candidate, other than RP-G28, in advanced clinical trials for treating lactose intolerance, other biopharmaceutical companies may be able to develop compounds or drugs that are able to achieve similar or better results. Our potential competitors include major multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and universities and other research institutions. Some of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies we expect to compete with include microbiome-based development companies such as Second Genome, Inc., Seres Health, Inc., Enterome SA, Vedanta Biosciences, Inc., and Microbiome Therapeutics, LLC. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. We will also compete with providers of a wide variety of lactase supplements (the most widely used supplement in the United States being Lactaid &#174; ), probiotic/dietary supplements, and lactose-free and dairy-free products. We believe the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates are efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement. 

&#160; 

&#160; 15 &#160; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

The proprietary nature of, and protection for, our product candidates and our discovery programs, processes and know-how are important to our business. We have sought patent protection in the United States and internationally for uses of RP-G28 and our discovery programs, and any other inventions to which we have rights, where available and when appropriate. Our policy is to pursue, maintain and defend patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties, and to protect the technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business. We do not have composition of matter patent protection in the United States for RP-G28, which may result in competitors being able to offer and sell products so long as these competitors do not infringe any other patents that we hold, including patents directed to methods of manufacturing and purified RP-G28 or directed to methods of using RP-G28. 

&#160; 

Our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and trade secret protection of our current and future product candidates and the methods used to develop and manufacture them, as well as successfully defending these patents against third-party challenges. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products depends on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our product candidates, discovery programs and processes from commercial competition. Furthermore, we cannot be sure that issued patents will not be challenged in court as invalid or in the Patent Office as unpatentable. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our intellectual property, please see &#8220;Risk Factorsundefined&#8212;undefinedRisks Relating to Our Intellectual Property.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Patents and Proprietary Rights Covering Our Drug Candidates 

&#160; 

We strive to protect our product candidates and exclusivity rights, as well as both maintain and fortify our position in the field of reduction of symptoms associated with lactose intolerance. We believe our intellectual property portfolio consists of early and broad filings in the area. We have focused on patents and patent applications relating to use of our products in disease treatment. We have sought and continue to seek the strongest possible intellectual property protection available to us in order to prevent others from directly competing with us, as well as to exclude competition around our products, their manufacture, and methods for use of the products in disease treatment. Our intellectual property portfolio related to RP-G28 contains four issued patents relating to RP-G28 and its uses. That portfolio also includes at least 15 other related, pending patent applications in the United States and worldwide. We also own a patent family, including claims generally directed to processes for producing an improved form of galactoologosaccharides (GOS) mixtures (higher purity); this family includes issued patents in United States (not expiring until 2030), Italy (not expiring until 2029), Germany, and the Netherlands (not expiring until 2030), as well as applications pending in the United States, China, India, and other jurisdictions that, if issued, will not expire until 2030. 

&#160; 

This portfolio includes patents and proprietary rights related to: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; U.S. Patent No. 8,486,668, which has a current expiry date of February 17, 2030, includes claims generally directed to methods for treating lactose intolerance comprising administering, for a predetermined number of days, a high purity galactooligosaccharides (GOS) pharmaceutical composition, and wherein the administration leads to a persistent decrease in at least one symptom of lactose intolerance; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; U.S. Patent No. 8,492,124, which has a current expiry date of February 17, 2030, includes claims generally directed to methods for treating lactose intolerance comprising administering, for a predetermined number of days, a controlled release pharmaceutical composition that contains galoctooligosaccharides (GOS), but does not contain a probiotic; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; U.S. Patent No. 8,785,160, which has a current expiry date of February 17, 2030, includes claims generally directed to methods for treating lactose intolerance comprising administering a hydrogen breath test, diagnosing lactose intolerance based upon the hydrogen breath test, and administering a high purity galactooligosaccharides (GOS) pharmaceutical composition; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; U.S. Patent No. 9,200,303, which has a current expiry date of August 6, 2030 (subject to the payment of maintenance fee), includes claims generally directed to the processes for producing ultra-pure galactooligosaccharides (GOS) pharmaceutical compositions by utilizing sequential microbiological purifications; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; United Kingdom Patent No. GB2480042, which has a current expiry date of February 16, 2030, includes claims generally directed to a solid oral unit-dosage form of a high purity galactoologosaccharides (GOS); &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; European Patent No. EP 2,462,234, validated in six European countries, including Germany, Great Britain, and France, which has a current expiry date of August 6, 2030 (subject to payment of annuities), includes claims generally directed to the processes for producing preparing ultra-pure galactooligosaccharides (GOS) pharmaceutical compositions by utilizing sequential microbiological purifications; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Italian Patent No. IT 1,395,068, which has a current expiry date of August 7, 2029 (subject to the payment of annuities), includes claims generally directed to the production of ultra-pure galactooligosaccharides (GOS) pharmaceutical compositions by utilizing sequential microbiological purifications; and &#160; 

&#160; 16 &#160; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Chinese Patent No. ZL 201080035013.2, which has a current expiry date of August 6, 2030 (subject to payment of annuities), includes claims generally directed to the production of ultra-pure galactooligosaccharides (GOS) pharmaceutical compositions by utilizing sequential microbiological purifications. &#160; 

We are pursuing patent applications. These applications are pending in the United States, Europe, Japan and other jurisdictions, and, if they issue as patents, will not expire until at least 2030, and include claims generally directed to (i) oral dosage forms of a higher purity galactoologosaccharides (GOS), (ii) use of galactoologosaccharides (GOS) for treating lactose intolerance, and (iii) methods of preventing or reducing certain symptoms of lactose intolerance using galactoologosaccharides (GOS) dosage forms. 

&#160; 

Trade Secrets 

&#160; 

In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. Trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and commercial partners. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data, trade secrets and know-how by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation and Product Approval 

&#160; 

Governmental authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, packaging, promotion, storage, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the European Medicines Agency (the &#8220;EMA&#8221;) through the Marketing Authorization Application (&#8220;MAA&#8221;) process before they may be legally marketed in Europe. Our product candidates will be subject to similar requirements in other countries prior to marketing in those countries. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 

&#160; 

United States Government Regulation 

&#160; 

NDA Approval Processes 

&#160; 

In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the &#8220;FDCA&#8221;) and implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process or approval process, or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. These sanctions could include: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; refusal to approve pending applications; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; withdrawal of an approval; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; imposition of a clinical hold; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; warning letters; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; product seizures and/or condemnation and destruction; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; total or partial suspension of production or distribution; or &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; injunctions, fines, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. &#160; 

The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; completion of nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies conducted according to Good Laboratory Practices (&#8220;GLPs&#8221;) or other applicable regulations; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to Good Clinical Practices (&#8220;GCPs&#8221;), to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; submission to the FDA of a NDA; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (&#8220;cGMPs&#8221;) to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug&#8217;s identity, strength, quality and purity; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; FDA review and approval of the NDA. &#160; 

&#160; 17 &#160; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical or nonclinical testing stage. Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. In addition to including the results of the nonclinical studies, the IND will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the first phase lends itself to an efficacy determination. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the IND on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin. A clinical hold may occur at any time during the life of an IND, and may affect one or more specific studies or all studies conducted under the IND. 

&#160; 

All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs. They must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, research subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and progress reports detailing the status of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA annually. Sponsors also must timely report to FDA serious and unexpected adverse reactions, any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigation brochure, or any findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug. An institutional review board, or IRB, at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the protocol before a clinical trial commences at that institution and must also approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each research subject or the subject&#8217;s legal representative, monitor the study until completed and otherwise comply with IRB regulations. 

&#160; 

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Phase 1 . The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and elimination. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product may be inherently too toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Phase 2 . Clinical trials are performed on a limited patient population intended to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. Although there are no statutory or regulatory definitions for Phase 2a and Phase 2b, Phase 2a is commonly used to describe a Phase 2 clinical trial designed to evaluate efficacy, adverse effects and safety risks and Phase 2b is commonly used to describe a subsequent Phase 2 clinical trial that also evaluates dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Phase 3 . Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These studies are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. &#160; 

Adaptive seamless phase 2b/3 designs, such as the Phase 2b/3 pivotal clinical trial for RP-G28 that we are contemplating, are aimed at interweaving the two phases of full development by combining them into one single, uninterrupted study conducted in two steps. Adaptive seamless phase 2b/3 designs enable a clinical trial to be conducted in steps with the sample size calculation selected on the basis of data observed in the first step to continue along to the second step. The main statistical challenge in such a design is ensuring control of the type I error rate. Most methodology for such trials is based on the same endpoint being used for interim and final analyses. A type I error is one in which the adaptation process leads to design, analysis, or conduct flaws that introduce bias that increases the chance of a false conclusion that a treatment is effective (a type I error). Controlling type I error can be accomplished by prospectively specifying and including in the statistical analysis plan all possible adaptation plans that may be considered during the course of the trial. We intend to work with a CRO to determine how best to control type I error in our Phase 2b/3 study. 

&#160; 

Human clinical trials are inherently uncertain and Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be successfully completed. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time for a variety of reasons, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB&#8217;s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 

&#160; 

During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to the submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2 and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. For instance, we held a Type C meeting with the FDA&#8217;s Division of Gastroenterology and Inborn Errors Products on February 20, 2013. The purpose of the meeting was to obtain the FDA&#8217;s feedback on the planned clinical development program and future necessary clinical studies, inform the FDA of our ongoing development plans, gain feedback on relevant clinical trial design and end points related to patient meaningful benefits, and to inform the FDA of the status of our product characterization. At the time of our meeting, we were not contemplating an adaptive design Phase 2b/3 clinical trial. Based on RP-G28&#8217;s mechanism of action, data from the Phase 2a clinical study, and further research conducted after the Type C Meeting in early 2013, however, we now intend to conduct our next clinical trial as an adaptive design Phase 2b/3 clinical trial. We do not intend to request an additional meeting to seek FDA guidance about this specific clinical development plan although we will submit a supplement to the IND detailing the protocols for the adaptive study. 

&#160; 

FDA meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date and for the FDA to provide advice on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meeting at the end of Phase 2 to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial that they believe will support the approval of the new drug. If a Phase 2 clinical trial is the subject of discussion at the end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, a sponsor may be able to request a Special Protocol Assessment (&#8220;SPA&#8221;), the purpose of which is to reach agreement with the FDA on the Phase 3 clinical trial protocol design and analysis that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim. 

&#160; 

&#160; 18 &#160; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

According to published guidance on the SPA process, a sponsor which meets the prerequisites may make a specific request for a SPA and provide information regarding the design and size of the proposed clinical trial. The FDA is supposed to evaluate the protocol within 45 days of the request to assess whether the proposed trial is adequate, and that evaluation may result in discussions and a request for additional information. A SPA request must be made before the proposed trial begins, and all open issues must be resolved before the trial begins. If a written agreement is reached, it will be documented and made part of the record. The agreement will be binding on the FDA and may not be changed by the sponsor or the FDA after the trial begins except with the written agreement of the sponsor and the FDA or if the FDA determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or efficacy of the drug was identified after the testing began. 

&#160; 

Concurrent with clinical trials, sponsors usually complete additional animal safety studies and also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing commercial quantities of the product in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug and the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the quality, purity and potency of the drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its proposed shelf-life. 

&#160; 

The results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests and other control mechanisms, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of user fees, but a waiver of such fees may be obtained under specified circumstances. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency&#8217;s threshold determination of whether it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. It may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. 

&#160; 

Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. NDAs receive either standard or priority review. A drug representing a significant improvement in treatment, prevention or diagnosis of disease may receive priority review. The FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or other data. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant. The FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured and tested. 

&#160; 

Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 

&#160; 

Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA marketing approval of RP-G28, one of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product&#8217;s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND, and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for extension must be made prior to expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration date, depending on the expected length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the submission of the relevant NDA. 

&#160; 

Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (&#8220;ANDA&#8221;), or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an approved NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 

&#160; 

&#160; 19 &#160; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

Pediatric Exclusivity and Pediatric Use 

&#160; 

Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (&#8220;BPCA&#8221;), certain drugs may obtain an additional six months of exclusivity, if the sponsor submits information requested in writing by the FDA (a Written Request) relating to the use of the active moiety of the drug in children. The FDA may not issue a Written Request for studies on unapproved or approved indications or where it determines that information relating to the use of a drug in a pediatric population, or part of the pediatric population, may not produce health benefits in that population. 

&#160; 

We have not received a Written Request for such pediatric studies, although we may ask the FDA to issue a Written Request for such studies in the future. To receive the six-month pediatric market exclusivity, we would have to receive a Written Request from the FDA, conduct the requested studies in accordance with a written agreement with the FDA or, if there is no written agreement, in accordance with commonly accepted scientific principles, and submit reports of the studies. A Written Request may include studies for indications that are not currently in the labeling if the FDA determines that such information will benefit the public health. The FDA will accept the reports upon its determination that the studies were conducted in accordance with and are responsive to the original Written Request or commonly accepted scientific principles, as appropriate, and that the reports comply with the FDA&#8217;s filing requirements. 

&#160; 

In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act (&#8220;PREA&#8221;) requires all applications (or supplements to an application) submitted under section 505 of the FDCA (21 U.S.C. &#167;355) for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration to contain a pediatric assessment unless the applicant has obtained a waiver or deferral. It also authorizes the FDA to require holders of approved NDAs for marketed drugs to conduct pediatric studies under certain circumstances. In general, PREA applies only to those drugs developed for diseases and/or conditions that occur in both the adult and pediatric populations. Products intended for pediatric-specific indications will be subject to the requirements of PREA only if they are initially developed for a subset of the relevant pediatric population. 

&#160; 

As part of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, Congress reauthorized both BPCA and PREA, which were slated to expire on September 30, 2012, and made both laws permanent. 

&#160; 

Orphan Drugs 

&#160; 

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a disease or condition with a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 individuals in the United States and when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug or biologic in the United States will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. 

&#160; 

If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for a particular active ingredient for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA, to market the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee. 

&#160; 

A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. Orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States also may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. 

&#160; 

We intend to explore orphan drug designation for RP-G28 for any orphan indication in which there is a medically plausible basis for treatment of the indication through colonic adaptation of gut bacteria. 

&#160; 

Post-approval Requirements 

&#160; 

Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. In addition, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products that have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. 

&#160; 

&#160; 20 &#160; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

Any drug products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; compliance with current good manufacturing practices; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; record-keeping requirements; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; reporting of adverse experiences with the drug; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; drug sampling and distribution requirements; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; notifying the FDA and gaining its approval of specified manufacturing or labeling changes; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. &#160; 

Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and some state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. 

&#160; 

We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. 

&#160; 

From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. 

&#160; 

Regulation Outside of the United States 

&#160; 

In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to regulations of other countries governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside of the United States before we can commence clinical trials in such countries and approval of the regulators of such countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, before we may market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. 

&#160; 

Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which is compulsory for medicines produced by biotechnology or those medicines intended to treat AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders or diabetes and optional for those medicines which are highly innovative, provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states. Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessments report, each member state must decide whether to recognize approval. If a member state does not recognize the marketing authorization, the disputed points are eventually referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states. 

&#160; 

Reimbursement 

&#160; 

Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, they may not cover our products after approved as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. 

&#160; 

The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (the &#8220;MMA&#8221;) imposed new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for our products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors. 

&#160; 

&#160; 21 &#160; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. A plan for the research will be developed by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures will be made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of any product, if any such product or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a study. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor&#8217;s product could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates. If third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. 

&#160; 

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the &#8220;ACA&#8221;), enacted in March 2010, is expected to have a significant impact on the health care industry. The ACA is expected to expand coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, the ACA is expected to expand and increase industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs and make changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare Part D program. We cannot predict the impact of the ACA on pharmaceutical companies, as many of the ACA reforms require the promulgation of detailed regulations implementing the statutory provisions which has not yet occurred. In addition, some members of the U.S. Congress have been seeking to overturn at least portions of the legislation and we expect they will continue to review and assess this legislation and alternative health care reform proposals. Any legal challenges to the ACA, as well as Congressional efforts to repeal the ACA, add to the uncertainty of the legislative changes enacted as part of the ACA. 

&#160; 

In addition, in some non-U.S. jurisdictions, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to be significantly lower. 

&#160;
