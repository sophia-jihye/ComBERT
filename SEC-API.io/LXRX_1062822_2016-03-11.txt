Overview 

&#160; 

Lexicon Pharmaceuticals is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of breakthrough treatments for human disease. We have advanced multiple drug candidates into clinical development and are presently devoting most of our resources to the development of our two most advanced drug candidates: 

&#8226; 

We are developing telotristat etiprate, or LX1032, an orally-delivered small molecule drug candidate, as a treatment for carcinoid syndrome. We have reported positive top-line data from both our pivotal TELESTAR Phase 3 clinical trial and its companion TELECAST Phase 3 clinical trial of telotristat etiprate in carcinoid syndrome patients. We are presently preparing an application for regulatory approval to market telotristat etiprate in the United States and, if approved, for the commercial launch of telotristat etiprate in the United States. We have granted Ipsen Pharma SAS an exclusive, royalty-bearing right to commercialize telotristat etiprate outside of the United States and Japan. 

&#8226; 

We are developing sotagliflozin, or LX4211, an orally-delivered small molecule drug candidate, as a treatment for type 1 and type 2 diabetes. We have reported positive data from a Phase 2 clinical trial of sotagliflozin in type 1 diabetes patients and two additional Phase 2 clinical trials of sotagliflozin in type 2 diabetes patients. We have granted Sanofi an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing right to develop, manufacture and commercialize sotagliflozin. We are presently conducting Phase 3 development of sotagliflozin for type 1 diabetes and preparing with Sanofi for Phase 3 development of sotagliflozin in type 2 diabetes. 

Our most advanced drug candidates, as well as compounds from a number of additional drug discovery and development programs that we have advanced into various stages of clinical and preclinical development, originated from our own internal drug discovery efforts. These efforts were driven by a systematic, target biology-driven approach in which we used gene knockout technologies and an integrated platform of advanced medical technologies to systematically study the physiological and behavioral functions of almost 5,000 genes in mice and assessed the utility of the proteins encoded by the corresponding human genes as potential drug targets. We have identified and validated in living animals, or in vivo , more than 100 targets with promising profiles for drug discovery. 

We are working both independently and through strategic collaborations and alliances with third parties to capitalize on our drug target discoveries and drug discovery and development programs. We seek to retain exclusive or co-exclusive rights to the benefits of certain drug discovery and development programs by developing and commercializing drug candidates from those programs internally, particularly in the United States for indications treated by specialist physicians. We seek to collaborate with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, such as Ipsen, Sanofi and Bristol-Myers Squibb, with respect to drug discovery or the development and commercialization of certain of our drug candidates, particularly with respect to commercialization in territories outside the United States, commercialization in the United States for indications treated by primary care physicians, or when the collaboration may otherwise provide us with access to expertise and resources that we do not possess internally or are complementary to our own. 

&#160;

Our Drug Programs 

&#160; 

We have advanced multiple drug candidates into clinical development. We are presently devoting most of our resources to the development of our two most advanced drug candidates, telotristat etiprate for carcinoid syndrome and sotagliflozin for type 1 and type 2 diabetes. We have also advanced a number of additional compounds into various stages of clinical and preclinical development. 

&#32;1 

Telotristat etiprate (LX1032 ) 

&#160; 

Telotristat etiprate, or LX1032, is an orally-delivered small molecule compound that we are developing for the treatment of carcinoid syndrome. Telotristat etiprate was internally generated by our medicinal chemists and inhibits tryptophan hydroxylase, or TPH, the rate-limiting enzyme for serotonin production found primarily in enterochromaffin, or EC, cells of the gastrointestinal tract. Our scientists found that mice lacking the non-neuronal form of this enzyme, TPH1, have virtually no serotonin in the gastrointestinal tract, but maintain normal levels of serotonin in the brain. Telotristat etiprate was specifically designed to achieve systemic exposure to address disorders such as carcinoid syndrome that require regulation of serotonin levels beyond the EC cells in the gastrointestinal tract without impacting brain serotonin production. 

We reported top-line data in August 2015 from our pivotal TELESTAR Phase 3 clinical trial of telotristat etiprate evaluating the safety and tolerability of telotristat etiprate and its activity in carcinoid syndrome. The trial enrolled 135 patients with inadequately controlled carcinoid syndrome on background somatostatin analog therapy, the current standard of care, in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 250mg three times daily and 500mg three times daily doses of telotristat etiprate over a 12-week treatment period, followed by a 36-week, open-label extension where all patients receive 500mg three times daily doses of telotristat etiprate. The primary efficacy endpoint under evaluation in the trial was the number of daily bowel movements, with secondary efficacy endpoints including changes in urinary 5-HIAA, the primary metabolite of serotonin and a biomarker for serotonin synthesis, flushing episodes, abdominal pain and quality of life measures. Top-line data from the study showed that patients who added telotristat etiprate to the standard of care at both the 250mg and 500mg doses experienced a statistically significant reduction from baseline compared to placebo in the average number of daily bowel movements over the 12-week study period, meeting the study&#8217;s primary endpoint. A substantially greater proportion of patients on telotristat etiprate achieved a durable response (44 percent and 42 percent in the 250mg and 500mg treatment arms, respectively), defined as at least a 30 percent reduction in daily bowel movements over at least half the days of the study period, as compared to 20 percent response on placebo (p&#60;0.040). Patients who received 250mg of telotristat etiprate experienced a 29 percent reduction in the average number of daily bowel movements during the final week (week 12) of the study period compared to baseline, and those in the 500mg arm experienced a 35 percent reduction, while the placebo group showed a 17 percent reduction. The proportion of patients with treatment-emergent adverse events, serious adverse events and discontinuation due to adverse events were generally similar in all three treatment arms. The tolerability profile of the 250mg dose appeared similar to placebo and somewhat better than the 500mg dose with respect to gastrointestinal discomfort and mood. The overall incidence and nature of adverse events in TELESTAR were consistent with those reported in previous studies. 

We reported top-line data in November 2015 from our additional TELECAST Phase 3 clinical trial of telotristat etiprate, which was designed as a companion to our pivotal TELESTAR Phase 3 clinical trial to provide additional safety exposure while further evaluating telotristat etiprate&#8217;s activity in carcinoid syndrome. The trial enrolled 76 patients in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 250mg three times daily and 500mg three times daily doses of telotristat etiprate over a 12-week treatment period. Patients qualified for the trial based on at least one symptom of carcinoid syndrome, such as at least two episodes of flushing per day, elevated urinary 5-HIAA at baseline or nausea present on at least one out of five days at baseline. Most enrolled patients were on background somatostatin analog therapy. Patients who were not on background somatostatin analog therapy could also qualify for the trial based on experiencing at least four bowel movements per day as their symptom of carcinoid syndrome. The primary efficacy endpoint under evaluation in the trial was the change in urinary 5-HIAA, with secondary endpoints including the number of daily bowel movements. Top-line data from the study showed that patients treated with telotristat etiprate at both the 250mg and 500mg doses experienced a statistically significant reduction from baseline compared to placebo in urinary 5-HIAA at week 12, (p&#60;0.001), meeting the study&#8217;s primary efficacy endpoint. Patients treated with telotristat etiprate at both the 250mg and 500mg doses also experienced a statistically significant percent reduction from baseline compared to placebo in the average number of daily bowel movements over the 12-week study period (p=0.004 and p&#60;0.001 for the 250mg and 500mg arms, respectively). The proportion of patients with treatment-emergent adverse events, serious adverse events and discontinuation due to adverse events were generally similar in all three treatment arms, with patients receiving telotristat etiprate experiencing a slightly higher rate of treatment-emergent adverse events. In general, the tolerability profile of both doses of telotristat etiprate appeared similar to placebo and the overall incidence and nature of adverse events in TELECAST were consistent with those reported in previous studies. 

We previously completed two Phase 2 clinical trials in carcinoid syndrome patients, in which telotristat etiprate provided evidence of efficacy across multiple endpoints, including bowel movement frequency, stool consistency and decreased levels of urinary 5-HIAA. Telotristat etiprate was well tolerated in the studies, with no dose-limiting toxicity observed. 

We are presently preparing an application for regulatory approval to market telotristat etiprate in the United States and, if approved, for the commercial launch of telotristat etiprate in the United States. We have entered into a license and 

&#32;2 

collaboration agreement with Ipsen Pharma SAS under which we granted Ipsen an exclusive, royalty-bearing right and license to commercialize telotristat etiprate outside of the United States and Japan. 

Telotristat etiprate has received Fast Track status and Orphan Drug designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for the treatment of gastrointestinal symptoms associated with carcinoid syndrome in patients who no longer respond to the standard care. Telotristat etiprate has also received Orphan Drug designation from the Committee for Orphan Medical Products of the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of carcinoid tumors. 

Sotagliflozin (LX4211) 

&#160; 

Sotagliflozin, or LX4211, is an orally-delivered small molecule compound that we are developing for the treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Sotagliflozin was internally generated by our medicinal chemists and inhibits both sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2, or SGLT2, a transporter responsible for most of the glucose reabsorption performed by the kidney, and sodium-glucose cotransporter type 1, or SGLT1, a transporter responsible for glucose and galactose absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. Our scientists identified mice lacking SGLT1, SGLT2 or both as having potent anti-diabetic phenotypes across multiple measures of glucose control and metabolism, and found that compounds inhibiting both targets had a favorable preclinical profile relative to compounds selective for SGLT2. 

Type 1 Diabetes . 

We are conducting two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating the safety and tolerability of sotagliflozin and its effects on glycemic parameters associated with type 1 diabetes. Each of the pivotal Phase 3 trials are expected to enroll approximately 750 patients with type 1 diabetes in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of 200mg and 400mg once daily doses of sotagliflozin over 24-week treatment periods, followed by 28-week extensions. The primary efficacy endpoint under evaluation in both pivotal Phase 3 trials is the reduction of hemoglobin A1c, or A1C, versus placebo on optimized insulin treatment at 24 weeks, with secondary endpoints including percentage of patients achieving A1C levels of less than 7%, reduction in meal-time, or bolus, insulin use and weight loss. We are also conducting a third Phase 3 clinical trial of sotagliflozin, which is expected to enroll approximately 1,400 patients with type 1 diabetes in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of a 400mg once daily dose of sotagliflozin over a 24-week treatment period. The primary efficacy endpoint under evaluation in the third Phase 3 trial is the proportion of patients on optimized insulin treatment achieving A1C levels of less than 7% at 24 weeks, with secondary endpoints including the reduction of A1C, weight loss and systolic blood pressure levels. We are also concurrently conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial of sotagliflozin in a younger adult type 1 diabetes population in collaboration with JDRF and a dose-ranging study of sotagliflozin in patients with type 1 diabetes. 

We previously completed a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the safety and tolerability of sotagliflozin and its effects on glycemic parameters associated with type 1 diabetes. The Phase 2 trial enrolled 36 patients with type 1 diabetes. An initial cohort consisted of three patients treated with a 400 mg once daily dose of sotagliflozin for a period of four weeks. A subsequent cohort of 33 patients were enrolled in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled portion of the study and were treated with a 400mg once daily dose of sotagliflozin or placebo for a period of four weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint under evaluation in the trial was reduction in bolus insulin use. Secondary endpoints included multiple parameters of glycemic control, basal and total insulin use and other metabolic, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic parameters. Data from the study showed that treatment with sotagliflozin demonstrated statistically significant benefits in the primary and multiple secondary endpoints. Patients treated with sotagliflozin experienced a reduction in their total daily mealtime bolus insulin dose of 32% compared to 6% for patients who received placebo (p=0.007). We also observed a significant improvement in glycemic control, with a mean A1C reduction of 0.55% in the sotagliflozin-treated group compared to a reduction of 0.06% in the placebo-treated group (p=0.002). These observations were also accompanied by significant improvement in the time spent in a glucose range of 70-180 mg/dl, a significant reduction in time in hyperglycemic range (&#62;180 mg/dl) and no increase in time in hypoglycemic range (&#60;70mg/dl). Multiple measures also indicated that patients treated with sotagliflozin experienced reduced variability in blood glucose levels. Sotagliflozin was well tolerated with no discontinuations of study medication due to adverse events. 

&#32;3 

Type 2 Diabetes. 

We and Sanofi are presently preparing for the initiation of Phase 3 development of sotagliflozin in type 2 diabetes patients. We previously completed two Phase 2 clinical trials evaluating the safety and tolerability of sotagliflozin and its effects on glycemic parameters associated with type 2 diabetes. 

The Phase 2b clinical trial enrolled 299 patients with type 2 diabetes who were not adequately controlled on metformin monotherapy in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of 75mg once daily, 200mg once daily, 200mg twice daily and 400mg once daily doses of sotagliflozin, each administered in combination with standard metformin therapy over a 12&#8209;week treatment period. The primary efficacy endpoint under evaluation in the trial was the change in A1C from baseline to week 12. Secondary efficacy endpoints included percentage of patients achieving A1C levels of less than 7%, as well as changes in fasting plasma glucose levels, weight, blood pressure and triglyceride levels. Data from the study showed that treatment with sotagliflozin demonstrated statistically significant benefits in the primary and multiple secondary endpoints. Patients in each of the 75mg once daily, 200mg once daily, 200mg twice daily and 400mg once daily sotagliflozin treatment arms had mean A1C reductions from baseline of 0.43, 0.52, 0.79 and 0.92 percent, respectively (p&#60;0.001 for all treatment arms), while in patients randomized to placebo, A1C decreased by 0.09 percent. We also observed that patients treated with sotagliflozin showed significant reductions in body weight and blood pressure. Sotagliflozin was well tolerated and adverse events were generally mild to moderate, with the overall incidence of adverse events with sotagliflozin being similar to placebo. 

The Phase 2a clinical trial enrolled 36 patients with non-insulin dependent type 2 diabetes in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of 150mg and 300mg doses of sotagliflozin, each administered once daily over a four-week treatment period. The efficacy endpoints under evaluation in the trial included urinary glucose excretion, fasting plasma glucose, response to oral glucose tolerance testing, and change in A1C. Data from the study showed that treatment with 150mg and 300mg of sotagliflozin provided improvements in glycemic control and demonstrated statistically significant benefits in the primary and multiple secondary efficacy endpoints. A marked and statistically significant decrease in fasting plasma glucose was observed at each measurement point throughout the treatment period in both treatment arms relative to placebo. After four weeks of dosing, patients in both dose groups exhibited statistically significant reductions in A1C as compared to patients receiving placebo (p=0.001 and p&#60;0.001 for the 150mg and 300mg treatment arms, respectively). Patients in both treatment arms also exhibited statistically significant improvements in glucose tolerance in response to oral glucose tolerance testing (p&#60;0.001 for both treatment arms). Consistent with the mechanism of action of sotgliflozin, there was also a significant, dose-dependent increase in 24-hour urinary glucose excretion in both treatment arms at each measurement point throughout the study period relative to placebo (p&#60;0.001 at all time points measured). Patients in both treatment arms also showed positive trends in broader metabolic and cardiovascular parameters, including weight reduction, decreased blood pressure and lower triglyceride levels. Sotagliflozin was well tolerated in the trial, with no dose-limiting toxicities observed and adverse events being generally mild and equally distributed across all treatment groups, including the placebo group. 

In addition, we previously completed a clinical trial evaluating the safety and tolerability of sotagliflozin and its effects on glycemic parameters associated with type 2 diabetes in patients with moderate renal impairment. The clinical trial enrolled 30 patients with type 2 diabetes and moderate to severe renal impairment in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of a 400mg once daily dose of sotagliflozin over a seven-day treatment period. The primary efficacy endpoint under evaluation in the trial was the change in postprandial glucose from baseline to day seven, with secondary endpoints including a variety of glycemic control parameters. Data from the study showed that treatment with sotagliflozin provided clinically meaningful and statistically significant reductions (p&#60;0.05) in post-prandial glucose and produced significant elevations in GLP-1, a hormone involved in control of glucose and appetite. Sotagliflozin was well tolerated and adverse events were generally mild to moderate, with the overall incidence of adverse events with sotagliflozin being similar to placebo. 

We have entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Sanofi under which we granted Sanofi an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing right and license to develop, manufacture and commercialize sotagliflozin. 

Other Development Programs 

&#160; 

LX2761. &#32;&#32;LX2761 is an orally-delivered small molecule compound for the treatment of diabetes. LX2761 was internally generated by our medicinal chemists and is designed to inhibit SGLT1 locally in the gastrointestinal tract without any significant inhibition of SGLT2 in the kidney. We have completed IND-enabling studies of LX2761 and are presently preparing to submit an IND and commence clinical development. We have granted Sanofi certain rights of first negotiation with respect to the future development and commercialization of LX2761. 

&#32;4 

LX9211. &#32;&#32;LX9211 is an orally-delivered small molecule compound for the treatment of neuropathic pain. LX9211 is included in our drug discovery alliance with Bristol-Myers Squibb and we and Bristol-Myers Squibb are presently conducting IND-enabling studies in preparation for the commencement of clinical development. 

Other Programs . We have advanced small molecule compounds from a number of additional drug programs into various stages of preclinical and clinical development, including LX1033, an orally-delivered small molecule compound for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome, LX2931, an orally-delivered small molecule compound for the treatment of autoimmune disease and LX7101, a topically-delivered small molecule compound for the treatment of glaucoma. 

Drug Target Discoveries 

Our internal drug discovery efforts were driven by a systematic, target biology-driven approach in which we used gene knockout technologies and an integrated platform of advanced medical technologies to systematically study the physiological and behavioral functions of almost 5,000 genes in mice and assessed the utility of the proteins encoded by the corresponding human genes as potential drug targets. We have identified and validated in living animals, or in vivo , more than 100 targets with promising profiles for drug discovery. 

Our Commercialization Strategy 

&#160; 

We are working both independently and through strategic collaborations and alliances with third parties to capitalize on our drug target discoveries and drug discovery and development programs. Consistent with this approach, we seek to retain exclusive rights to the benefits of certain drug discovery and development programs by developing and commercializing drug candidates from those programs internally. We seek to collaborate with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, such as Ipsen and Sanofi, with respect to the development and commercialization of drug candidates from other programs, particularly when the collaboration may provide us with access to expertise and resources that we do not possess internally or are complementary to our own. We also seek to collaborate with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, research institutes and academic institutions to capitalize on our drug target discoveries. 

&#160; 

Strategic Collaborations 

Sanofi . We entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Sanofi in November 2015 under which we granted Sanofi an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing right and license to develop, manufacture and commercialize sotagliflozin. We received a $300 million upfront payment under the agreement and we are eligible to receive up to $430 million upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones and up to $990 million upon the achievement of specified sales milestones. We are also entitled to tiered, escalating royalties ranging from low double digit percentages to forty percent of net sales of sotagliflozin, based on indication and territory, with royalties for the higher band of such range attributable to net sales for type 1 diabetes in the United States, and subject in each case to customary royalty reduction provisions. Royalties payable with respect to net sales of sotagliflozin for type 1 diabetes in the United States will also be reduced in the event we do not exercise our co-promotion option. 

We are responsible for all clinical development activities relating to type 1 diabetes and retain an exclusive option to co-promote and have a significant role, in collaboration with Sanofi, in the commercialization of sotafliflozin for the treatment of type 1 diabetes in the United States. If we exercise our co-promotion option, we will fund forty percent of the commercialization costs relating to such co-promotion activities. Sanofi is responsible for all clinical development and commercialization of sotagliflozin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes worldwide and is solely responsible for the commercialization of sotagliflozin for the treatment of type 1 diabetes outside the United States. We will share in the funding of a portion of the planned type 2 diabetes development costs over the first three years of the collaboration, up to an aggregate of $100 million. 

Ipsen . We entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Ipsen Pharma SAS in October 2014 under which we granted Ipsen an exclusive, royalty-bearing right and license to commercialize telotristat etiprate outside of the United States, Canada and Japan. The collaboration was expanded in March 2015 to include Canada. We received $24.5 million in upfront payments under the agreement and we are eligible to receive up to approximately $34 million upon the achievement of specified regulatory and commercial launch milestones and up to &#8364;72 million upon the achievement of specified sales milestones. We are also entitled to tiered, escalating royalties ranging from low twenties to mid-thirties percentages of net sales of telotristat etiprate in the licensed territory, subject to a credit for Ipsen&#8217;s payments to us for the manufacture and supply of such units of telotristat etiprate and customary royalty reduction provisions. Our receipt of these payments from Ipsen will trigger our obligation to make certain contingent payments to Symphony Icon Holdings LLC, or Holdings, pursuant to our prior arrangement with Holdings for the financing of the clinical development of telotristat etiprate. 

&#32;5 

Subject to certain exceptions, we are responsible for conducting clinical trials required to obtain regulatory approval for telotristat etiprate in the European Union and will have the first right to conduct most other clinical trials of telotristat etiprate. 

&#160; 

Bristol-Myers Squibb . We established a drug discovery alliance with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company in December 2003 to discover, develop and commercialize small molecule drugs in the neuroscience field. Bristol-Myers Squibb extended the target discovery term of the alliance in May 2006. We initiated the alliance with a number of neuroscience drug discovery programs at various stages of development and used our gene knockout technologies to identify additional drug targets with promise in the neuroscience field. For those targets that were selected for the alliance, we and Bristol-Myers Squibb are working together, on an exclusive basis, to identify, characterize and carry out the preclinical development of small molecule drugs, and share equally both in the costs and in the work attributable to those efforts. As drugs resulting from the alliance enter clinical trials, Bristol-Myers Squibb will have the first option to assume full responsibility for clinical development and commercialization. We received $86 million in upfront payments and research funding under the agreement during the target discovery portion of the alliance, which expired in October 2009. In addition, we are entitled to receive clinical and regulatory milestone payments ranging, depending on the timing and extent of our efforts in the alliance, up to $76 million for each drug developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb under the alliance. We will also earn royalties on sales of drugs commercialized by Bristol-Myers Squibb under the alliance. 

Genentech . We established a drug discovery alliance with Genentech, Inc. in December 2002 to discover novel therapeutic proteins and antibody targets. We and Genentech expanded the alliance in November 2005 for the advanced research, development and commercialization of new biotherapeutic drugs. Under the original alliance agreement, we used our target validation technologies to discover the functions of secreted proteins and potential antibody targets identified through Genentech&#8217;s internal drug discovery research. In the expanded alliance, we conducted additional, advanced research on a broad subset of those proteins and targets. We have exclusive rights to develop and commercialize biotherapeutic drugs for two of these targets, while Genentech has exclusive rights to develop and commercialize biotherapeutic drugs for the other targets. We retain certain other rights to discoveries made in the alliance, including non-exclusive rights, along with Genentech, for the development and commercialization of small molecule drugs addressing the targets included in the alliance. We received $58 million in upfront payments, research funding and research milestone payments under the agreement during the research collaboration term, which expired in November 2008. In addition, we are entitled to receive clinical and regulatory milestone payments ranging, depending on the extent of our efforts in the alliance, up to $25 million for each drug target for which Genentech develops a biotherapeutic drug under the alliance. We will also earn royalties on sales of biotherapeutic drugs commercialized by Genentech under the alliance. Genentech is entitled to receive milestone payments and royalties on sales of biotherapeutic drugs which we develop or commercialize under the alliance. 

Other Collaborations 

We have established collaborations with a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, research institutes and academic institutions under which we have received fees in exchange for generating knockout mice for genes requested by the collaborator, providing phenotypic data with respect to such knockout mice or otherwise granting access to some of our technologies and discoveries. In some cases, we remain eligible to receive milestone or royalty payments on the sale of mice and phenotypic data or on products that our collaborators discover or develop using our technology.

We own patent applications, and in some cases issued patents, covering each of our drug candidates in clinical development, including: 

&#8226; 

worldwide patent applications that claim telotristat etiprate, or LX1032, and associated crystalline forms, pharmaceutical compositions, and methods of manufacture and use, from which patents have granted in multiple jurisdictions, including ten in the United States; and 

&#8226; 

worldwide patent applications that claim sotagliflozin, or LX4211, and associated crystalline forms, pharmaceutical compositions, and methods of manufacture and use, from which patents have granted in multiple jurisdictions, including four in the United States. 

Additionally, we hold rights to a number of patents and patent applications under license agreements with third parties. Many of these licenses are nonexclusive, although some are exclusive in specified fields. Most of the licenses have terms that extend for the life of the licensed patents. 

&#160; 

Patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country 

&#32;7 

to country, depends on the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. We have filed patent applications and hold issued patents covering each of our drug candidates in clinical development. No United States patent that has issued or may issue based on a patent application we have filed relating to one of our drug candidates in clinical development has a normal expiration date earlier than 2026. 

All of our employees, consultants and advisors are required to execute a proprietary information agreement upon the commencement of employment or consultation. In general, the agreement provides that all inventions conceived by the employee or consultant, and all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the term of the agreement, shall be our exclusive property and shall be kept confidential, with disclosure to third parties allowed only in specified circumstances. We cannot assure you, however, that these agreements will provide useful protection of our proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information. 

Our patent and intellectual property rights are subject to certain rights and uncertainties. See &#8220;Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property&#8221; under &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change. We face significant competition in each of the aspects of our business from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as academic research institutions, clinical reference laboratories and governmental agencies that are pursuing research or development activities similar to ours. Many of our competitors have substantially greater research, development and commercialization capabilities and financial, scientific, marketing and human resources than we do. As a result, our competitors may succeed in developing products earlier than we do, obtaining approvals from the FDA or other regulatory agencies for those products more rapidly than we do, developing products that are more effective than those we develop or commercializing products more effectively and profitably than we do. Similarly, our collaborators face similar competition from other competitors who may succeed in developing products more quickly, developing products that are more effective than those developed by our collaborators or commercialize products more effectively and profitably than our collaborators. Any products that we or our collaborators develop or discover are likely to be in highly competitive markets. 

The competition for our drug candidates includes both marketed products and drug candidates that are being developed by others, including pharmaceutical products that are currently in a more advanced stage of clinical development or commercialization than are our own drug candidates. These competitive marketed products and drug candidates include compounds that employ different mechanisms of action in addressing diseases and conditions for which we are developing our own drug candidates and, in some cases such as sotagliflozin, that employ the same or similar mechanisms of action. 

&#160; 

We believe that our ability to successfully compete with these potentially competitive drug candidates and other competitive products currently on the market will depend on, among other things: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

the efficacy, safety and reliability of our drug candidates; 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

our ability, and the ability of our collaborators, to complete preclinical and clinical development and obtain regulatory approvals for our drug candidates; 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

the timing and scope of regulatory approvals for our drug candidates; 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

our ability, and the ability of our collaborators, to obtain product acceptance by physicians and other health care providers and secure coverage and adequate reimbursement for product use in approved indications; 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

our ability, and the ability of our collaborators, to manufacture and sell commercial quantities of our products; 

&#8226; 

the skills of our employees and our ability to recruit and retain skilled employees; 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

protection of our intellectual property; and 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

the availability of substantial capital resources to fund development and commercialization activities. 

&#160; 

&#32;8 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

Regulation of Pharmaceutical Products 

&#160; 

The development, manufacture and sale of any pharmaceutical products developed by us or our collaborators will be subject to extensive regulation by United States and foreign governmental authorities, including federal, state and local authorities. In the United States, new drugs are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder, or the FDC Act. The FDA and comparable governmental authorities regulate, among other things, the development, preclinical and clinical testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, record keeping, reporting, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale, distribution and export of pharmaceutical products. 

&#160; 

The standard process required by the FDA before a drug candidate may be marketed in the United States generally includes the following: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

preclinical laboratory and animal tests performed under the FDA&#8217;s current Good Laboratory Practices regulations; 

&#8226; 

submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may commence; 

&#8226; 

adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug candidate for its intended use; 

&#8226; 

pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and selected clinical investigators for their compliance with FDA&#8217;s current Good Manufacturing Practices and Good Clinical Practices regulations; 

&#8226; 

submission and FDA approval of a New Drug Application, or NDA, for commercial marketing and sale, or of an NDA supplement, for approval of a new indication if the product is already approved for another indication. 

This process for the testing and approval of drug candidates requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. Preclinical development of a drug candidate can take from one to several years to complete, with no guarantee that an IND based on those studies will become effective to even permit clinical testing to begin. Before commencing the first clinical trial of a drug candidate in the United States, we must submit an IND to the FDA. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial. In such a case, we and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial may begin. Submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development, and the FDA must grant permission for each clinical trial to start and continue. Further, an independent institutional review board for each medical center proposing to participate in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that center. Regulatory authorities or an institutional review board or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. 

&#160; 

For purposes of NDA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap. 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Phase 1 clinical trials are conducted in a limited number of healthy human volunteers or, in some cases, patients, to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion of the drug candidate; 

&#8226; 

Phase 2 clinical trials are conducted in groups of patients afflicted with a specified disease or condition to obtain preliminary data regarding efficacy as well as to further evaluate safety and optimize dosing of the drug candidate. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials; and 

&#8226; 

Phase 3 clinical trials are conducted in larger patient populations at multiple clinical trial sites to obtain statistically significant evidence of the efficacy of the drug candidate for its intended use and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population. 

In addition, the FDA may require, or companies may pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved. These so-called Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to be satisfied after a drug receives approval. Failure to satisfy such post-marketing commitments can result in FDA enforcement action, up and to including withdrawal of NDA 

&#32;9 

approval. The results of phase 4 studies can confirm the effectiveness of a drug candidate and can provide important safety information to augment the FDA&#8217;s adverse drug reaction reporting system. 

After completion of clinical trials, FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before a new drug may be marketed in the United States. The submission of an NDA requires payment of a substantial user fee to the FDA. An NDA must contain, among other things, information on chemistry, manufacturing controls and potency and purity, non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology, human pharmacokinetics and bioavailability and clinical data. There can be no assurance that the FDA will accept an NDA for filing and, even if accepted for filing, that approval will be granted. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on NDA review questions. Among other things, the FDA reviews an NDA to determine whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to assure the product&#8217;s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may deny approval of an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or it may require additional clinical data or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory standards are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products which have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Limited indications for use or other conditions on labeling, marketing and distribution could also be placed on any approvals that could restrict the commercial applications of a product or impose costly procedures in connection with the commercialization or use of the product. 

In addition to obtaining FDA approval for each product, each drug manufacturing establishment must be inspected and approved by the FDA. All manufacturing establishments are subject to inspections by the FDA and by other federal, state and local agencies and must comply with current Good Manufacturing Practices requirements. Non-compliance with these requirements can result in, among other things, total or partial suspension of production, failure of the government to grant approval for marketing and withdrawal, suspension or revocation of marketing approvals. 

Satisfaction of FDA requirements typically takes many years, with the actual time required varying substantially based on, among other things, the nature and complexity of the drug candidate and of the disease or condition. Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of drug candidates or new diseases for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon our activities. Success in earlier-stage clinical trials does not ensure success in later-stage clinical trials. Targets and pathways identified in vitro may be determined to be less relevant in clinical studies and results in animal model studies may not be predictive of human clinical results. Furthermore, data obtained from clinical activities is not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Even if a drug candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific disease states, patient populations and dosages. Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. 

&#160; 

Once the FDA approves a product, a manufacturer must provide certain updated safety and efficacy information. Product changes as well as certain changes in a manufacturing process or facility would necessitate additional FDA review and approval. Other post-approval changes may also necessitate further FDA review and approval. Additionally, a manufacturer must meet other requirements including those related to adverse event reporting and record keeping. 

&#160; 

Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including record-keeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences with the drug. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with GMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. 

The FDA closely regulates the marketing and promotion of drugs. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may, in their independent medical judgment, prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the product&#8217;s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturers&#8217; communications on the subject of off-label use. Additionally, a significant number of pharmaceutical companies have been the target of inquiries and investigations by various United States federal and state regulatory, investigative, prosecutorial and administrative entities in connection with the promotion of products for off-label uses and other sales practices. These investigations have alleged violations of various United States federal and state laws and regulations, including claims asserting antitrust violations, 

&#32;10 

violations of the FDC Act, false claims laws, the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, anti-kickback laws, and other alleged violations in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses, pricing and Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement. 

&#160; 

In addition to regulatory approvals that must be obtained in the United States, drugs are also subject to regulatory approval in other countries in which they are marketed. The conduct of clinical trials of drugs in countries other than the United States is likewise subject to regulatory oversight in such countries. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing, and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. No action can be taken to market any drug in a country until the regulatory authorities in that country have approved an appropriate application. FDA approval does not assure approval by other regulatory authorities. The current approval process varies from country to country, and the time spent in gaining approval varies from that required for FDA approval. In some countries, the sale price of a drug or biologic product must also be approved. The pricing review period often begins after marketing approval is granted. Even if a foreign regulatory authority approves a drug, it may not approve satisfactory prices for the product. 

&#160; 

Healthcare Regulation 

Federal and state healthcare laws, including fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security laws, also apply to our business. If we fail to comply with those laws, we could face substantial penalties and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to: the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits. among other things, soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; and federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent. Additionally, we are subject to state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, which may be broader in scope and apply regardless of payer, and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, further complicate compliance efforts. 

Numerous federal and state laws, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. Other countries also have, or are developing, laws governing the collection, use and transmission of personal information. In addition, most healthcare providers who are expected to prescribe our products and from whom we obtain patient health information, are subject to privacy and security requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HIPPA. Although we are not directly subject to HIPPA, we could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain individually identifiable health information from a HIPAA-covered entity, including healthcare providers, in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing amount of focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business, including recently enacted laws in a majority of states requiring security breach notification. These laws could create liability for us or increase our cost of doing business. International laws regulate the processing of personal data within Europe and between European countries and the United States. Failure to provide adequate privacy protections and maintain compliance with safe harbor mechanisms could jeopardize business transactions across borders and result in significant penalties. 

In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, or the PPACA, created a federal requirement under the federal Open Payments program, that requires certain manufacturers to track and report to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, annually certain payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals made in the previous calendar year. In addition, there are also an increasing number of state laws that require manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information. These laws may affect our sales, marketing, and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state, and soon federal, authorities. 

Other Regulations 

&#160; 

In addition to the foregoing, our business is subject to regulation under various state and federal environmental laws, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in and wastes generated by our operations. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that our continued compliance with these laws will not have a material adverse effect on our 

&#32;11 

business. We cannot predict, however, whether new regulatory restrictions will be imposed by state or federal regulators and agencies or whether existing laws and regulations will adversely affect us in the future. 

&#160;
