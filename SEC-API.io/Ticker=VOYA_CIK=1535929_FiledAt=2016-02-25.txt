 Item 1. &#32; Business &#32; 

For the purposes of this discussion, the term Voya Financial, Inc. refers to Voya Financial, Inc. and the terms "Company," "we," "our," and "us" refer to Voya Financial, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 

We are a premier retirement, investment and insurance company serving the financial needs of approximately 13 million &#32;individual and institutional customers in the United States as of December 31, 2015 . Our vision is to be America&#8217;s Retirement Company&#8482;. Our approximately 7,000 &#32;employees (as of December 31, 2015 ) are focused on executing our mission to make a secure financial future possible&#8212;one person, one family and one institution at a time. Through our retirement, investment management and insurance businesses, we help our customers save, grow, protect and enjoy their wealth to and through retirement. We offer our products and services through a broad group of financial intermediaries, independent producers, affiliated advisors and dedicated sales specialists throughout the United States. 

Our extensive scale and breadth of product offerings are designed to help Americans achieve their retirement savings, investment income and protection goals. Our strategy is centered on preparing customers for "Retirement Readiness"&#8212;being emotionally and economically secure and ready for their retirement. We believe that the rapid aging of the U.S. population, weakening of traditional social safety nets, shifting of responsibility for retirement planning from institutions to individuals and growth in total retirement account assets will drive significant demand for our products and services going forward. We believe that we are well positioned to deliver on this Retirement Readiness need. 

We believe that we help our customers achieve three essential financial goals, as they plan for, invest for and protect their retirement years. 

&#8226; 

Plan . Our products enable our customers to save for retirement by establishing investment accounts through their employers or individually. 

&#8226; 

Invest . We provide advisory programs, individual retirement accounts ("IRAs"), fixed annuities, brokerage accounts, mutual funds and accumulation insurance products to help our customers achieve their financial objectives. Our income products such as target date funds, guaranteed income funds, fixed annuities, IRAs, mutual funds and accumulation insurance products enable our customers to meet income needs through retirement and achieve wealth transfer objectives. 

&#8226; 

Protect . Our specialized retirement and insurance products, such as universal life ("UL"), indexed universal life ("IUL"), variable life, term life and stable value products, allow our customers to protect against unforeseen life events and mitigate market risk. 

We tailor our products to meet the unique needs of our individual and institutional customers. Our individual businesses are primarily focused on the middle and mass affluent markets; however we serve customers across the full income spectrum, especially in our Institutional Retirement Plans business, Retail and Alternative Fund businesses, and Employee Benefits segment. Similarly, our institutional businesses serve a broad range of customers, with customized offerings to the small-mid, large and mega market segments across all industries. 

We operate our principal businesses through two business lines: Retirement and Investment Solutions; and Insurance Solutions. We refer to these business lines as our "ongoing business". In addition, we also have Closed Blocks and Corporate reporting segments. Closed Blocks consists of two segments which we have placed in run-off&#8212;Closed Block Variable Annuity ("CBVA") and Closed Block Other. Our Corporate segment includes our corporate activities and corporate-level assets and financial obligations.

Retirement and Investment Solutions. &#32; Our Retirement and Investment Solutions business comprises three reporting segments: Retirement, Annuities and Investment Management. Our Retirement and Annuities segments provide an extensive product range addressing both the accumulation and income distribution needs of customers, through a broad distribution footprint of over 2,100 &#32;affiliated representatives and thousands of non-affiliated brokers and agents as well as third-party administrators ("TPAs") and banks as of December 31, 2015 , and our Investment Management segment is a prominent full-service asset manager that delivers client-oriented investment solutions and advisory services, serving both individual and institutional customers. 

&#8226; 

Retirement &#32; is a leading provider of retirement services and products in the United States, offering tax-deferred, employer-sponsored retirement savings plans and administrative services to approximately 47,000 &#32;plan sponsors covering approximately 4.5 million &#32;plan participant accounts in corporate, education, healthcare, other non-profit and government entities as of December 31, 2015 . Stable Value and pension risk transfer solutions are also offered to institutional plan sponsors where we may or may not be providing defined contribution plans. Retirement also provides IRAs and other retail financial products as well as comprehensive financial planning and advisory services to individual customers. We serve a broad spectrum of employers ranging from small companies to the very largest corporations and government entities. Retirement had $291.8 billion &#32;of AUM and AUA as of December 31, 2015 , of which $96.7 billion &#32;was full service business, $191.8 billion &#32;was recordkeeping, stable value and pension risk transfer business and $3.3 billion &#32;was Retail Wealth Management business. 

&#8226; 

Annuities &#32; provides fixed and indexed annuities, tax-qualified mutual fund custodial and other investment-only products and payout annuities for pre-retirement wealth accumulation and post-retirement income management sold through multiple channels, and had $27.0 billion &#32;of AUM as of December 31, 2015 . 

&#8226; 

Investment Management. &#32; We are a prominent full-service asset manager with approximately $200.7 billion &#32;of AUM and $48.8 billion &#32;of AUA as of December 31, 2015 , delivering client-oriented investment solutions and advisory services. We serve both individual and institutional customers, offering them domestic and international fixed income, equity, multi-asset and alternative investment products and solutions across a range of geographies, investment styles and capitalization spectrums. 

&#8226; 

As of December 31, 2015 , we managed $122.5 billion &#32;in our commercial business (comprising $77.7 billion &#32; for third-party institutions and individual investors, and $44.8 billion &#32; in separate account assets for our Retirement and Investment Solutions, Insurance Solutions and Closed Block businesses) and $78.2 billion &#32;in general account assets for Voya Financial. 

&#8226; 

&#32;As of December 31, 2015 , 89.0% , 93.0% , and 71.0% &#32;of fixed income assets, 61.0% , 73.0% , and 63.0% &#32;of equity assets, and 95%, 95% and 42% of Multi-Asset Strategies and Solutions ("MASS") assets outperformed benchmark or peer median returns on a 3-year , 5-year , and 10-year &#32;basis, respectively. Our retail mutual fund portfolio assets totaled $24.9 billion &#32;as of December 31, 2015 . 

Insurance Solutions. &#32; We are a top-tier provider of life insurance in the United States, providing universal, variable and term life insurance products. Based on the LIMRA survey as of September 30, 2015, for premiums sold, our universal and term life products ranked seventeenth and twenty-fourth, respectively. The rankings reflect our recent focus on selling more capital efficient products, such as IUL. We are also a top ten ranked provider of stop-loss coverage in the United States as reported by MyHealthguide in January 2016 and provide stop-loss, group life and voluntary employee-paid and disability products to large businesses covering 5.4 million &#32;individuals. Our Insurance Solutions business comprises two reporting segments: Individual Life and Employee Benefits. 

&#8226; 

Individual Life &#32; provides wealth protection and transfer opportunities through universal, variable and term products, distributed primarily through a network of independent general agents and managing directors ("Aligned Distributors") to meet the needs of a broad range of customers from the middle-market through affluent market segments. As of December 31, 2015 , the Individual Life distribution model is supported by approximately 100 &#32;Aligned Distributors with access to over 55,000 &#32;producers who are committed to promoting Voya products. 

&#8226; 

Employee Benefits &#32; provides stop loss, group life, voluntary employee-paid and disability products to mid-sized and large businesses. As of December 31, 2015 , the Company has 60 &#32;employee benefits sales representatives, across 19 &#32;sales offices, with average industry experience of 18 &#32;years. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , approximately two-thirds of Employee Benefits sales were attributable to stop loss products while the remaining one-third was primarily related to life and voluntary products. 

&#160; 

Closed Blocks . &#32;We have separated our CBVA and Closed Block Other segments from our other operations, as part of a strategic decision to run-off, divest, or cease actively writing certain lines of business. Accordingly, these segments have been classified as closed blocks and are managed separately from our ongoing business. 

&#8226; 

CBVA . In 2009, we decided to stop actively writing new retail variable annuity products with substantial guarantee features (the last policies were issued in early 2010) and placed this portfolio in run-off. Subsequently, we refined our hedge program to seek to dynamically protect regulatory and rating agency capital of the variable annuities block for adverse equity market movements. In addition, since 2010, we have increased statutory reserves considerably, added significant interest rate risk protection and have more closely aligned our policyholder behavior assumptions with experience. Our focus in managing our CBVA segment is on protecting regulatory and rating agency capital from market movements via hedging and judiciously looking for opportunities to accelerate the run-off of the block, where possible. We believe that our hedge program, combined with an estimated $5.7 billion of assets available to support the guarantees in the variable annuity block (including assets which back our statutory reserves of $5.1 billion &#32; as of December 31, 2015 ) provide adequate resources to fund a wide range of, but not all, possible market scenarios as well as a margin for adverse policyholder behavior. For additional information, see "Part I. Item 1A. &#32; Risk Factors &#8212;Risks Related to our CBVA Segment." 

&#8226; 

Closed Block Other . In 2009, we also placed guaranteed investment contracts ("GICs") and funding agreements that were issued, with the proceeds invested to earn a spread, in run-off. As of December 31, 2015 , remaining assets in the GICs and funding agreements portfolio had an amortized cost of $1.2 billion , down from a peak of $14.3 billion &#32;in 2008. Also included in the Closed Block Other segment is residual activity on other closed or divested businesses including our group reinsurance and individual reinsurance businesses. 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had $452.4 billion &#32;in total AUM and AUA and total shareholders&#8217; equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income/loss ("AOCI") and noncontrolling interests, of $12.0 billion . In the year ended December 31, 2015 , we generated $584.5 million &#32;of Income (loss) before income taxes, $408.3 million &#32;of Net income (loss) available to Voya Financial, Inc.&#8217;s common shareholders and $977.5 million &#32;of Operating earnings before income taxes. Operating earnings before income taxes is a non-GAAP financial measure. For a reconciliation of Operating earnings before income taxes to Income (loss) before income taxes, see " Item 7. &#32; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212;Results of Operations&#8212; Company Consolidated." 

ORGANIZATIONAL HISTORY AND STRUCTURE 

Our History 

Prior to our initial public offering in May 2013, we were a wholly owned subsidiary of ING Groep N.V. ("ING Group"), a global financial institution based in the Netherlands. 

Through ING Group, we entered the United States life insurance market in 1975 through the acquisition of Wisconsin National Life Insurance Company, followed in 1976 with ING Group's acquisition of Midwestern United Life Insurance Company and Security Life of Denver Insurance Company in 1977. ING Group significantly expanded its presence in the United States in the late 1990s and 2000s with the acquisitions of Equitable Life Insurance Company of Iowa (1997), Furman Selz, an investment advisory company (1997), ReliaStar Life Insurance Company (including Pilgrim Capital Corporation) (2000), Aetna Life Insurance and Annuity Company (including Aeltus Investment Management) (2000) and CitiStreet (2008). As of March 2015, ING Group has completely divested its ownership of Voya Financial, Inc. common stock, although it continues to hold warrants to acquire a certain number of our shares. 

For additional information on the separation from ING Group, see the " Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies " section in Part II, Item 7. &#32;of this Annual Report on Form 10-K &#32;.

OUR BUSINESSES 

Retirement and Investment Solutions 

Our Retirement and Investment Solutions business provides its products and services through three reporting segments: Retirement, Annuities and Investment Management. 

Retirement 

Our Retirement segment is focused on meeting the needs of individuals in preparing for and sustaining a secure retirement through employer-sponsored plans and services, as well as through individual account rollover plans and comprehensive financial product offerings and planning and advisory services. We are well positioned in the marketplace, with our industry-leading Institutional Retirement Plans business and our Retail Wealth Management business having a combined $291.8 billion &#32;of AUM and AUA as of December 31, 2015 , of which $61.9 billion &#32;were in proprietary assets. 

Our Institutional Retirement Plans business offers tax-deferred employer-sponsored retirement savings plan and administrative services to corporations of all sizes, public and private school systems, higher education institutions, state and local governments, hospitals and healthcare facilities and not-for-profit organizations. We also offer stable value products and pension risk transfer 

&#160; 

solutions to institutional plan sponsors where we may or may not be providing defined contribution products and services. This broad-based institutional business crosses many sectors of the economy, which provides diversification that helps insulate us from downturns in particular industries . In the defined contribution market, we provide services to approximately 47,000 &#32;plan sponsors covering approximately 4.5 million &#32;plan participant accounts as of December 31, 2015 . 

Our Retail Wealth Management business, which focuses on the rapidly expanding retiree market as well as on pre-retirees and our defined contribution plan participants, offers retail financial products and comprehensive advice services to help individuals manage their retirement savings and income needs. While AUM and AUA for our Retail Wealth Management business were only a small portion of our overall AUM and AUA, amounting to $3.3 billion &#32;as of December 31, 2015 , it is a key area of future growth for our Retirement segment. 

Our Retirement segment earns revenue principally from asset and participant-based advisory and recordkeeping fees. Retirement generated operating earnings before income taxes of $470.6 million &#32;for the year ended December 31, 2015 . Our Investment Management segment also earns arm&#8217;s-length market-based fees from the management of the general account and mutual fund assets supporting Institutional Retirement Plans and Retail Wealth Management rollover products . Distribution of Investment Management products and services using the Retirement segment continues to present a growth opportunity for our Retirement and Investment Management segments that we are actively pursuing. 

We will continue to focus on growing our retirement platform by driving increases in our Institutional Retirement Plans business through focused sales and retention efforts, and by further developing our Retail Wealth Management business with a particular focus on expanding relationships with our Institutional Retirement Plan participants. We will also continue to place a strong emphasis on capital and cost management while also growing our distribution platform and achieving a diversified retirement product mix. 

An important element of our Retirement strategy is to leverage the extensive customer base to which we have access through our Institutional Retirement Plans business in order to grow our Retail Wealth Management and Investment Management businesses. We are therefore focused on building long-term relationships with our plan participants, especially when initiated through service touch points such as plan enrollments and rollovers, which will go beyond such participant's participation in our Institutional Retirement Plans and enable us to offer such participant's individual retirement and investment management solutions both during and after the term of their plan participation. 

Institutional Retirement Plans 

Products and Services &#32; 

We are one of only a few providers that offer tax-deferred institutional retirement savings plans (utilizing U.S. tax-advantaged savings vehicles for tax-advantaged retirement savings), services and support to the full spectrum of businesses, ranging from small to mega-sized plans and across all markets. These plans may either be offered as full service or recordkeeping only service products. We also offer stable value investment options and pension risk transfer solutions to institutional clients. 

Full-service retirement products provide recordkeeping and plan administration services, tailored award-winning participant communications and education programs, innovative myOrangeMoney&#8482; digital capabilities for sponsors and plan participants (plus mobile capabilities for participants), trustee services and institutional and retail investments. These include a wide variety of investment and administrative products for defined contribution plans for tax-advantaged retirement savings, as well as nonqualified executive benefit plans and employer stock option plans. Plan sponsors may select from a variety of investment structures and products, such as general account, separate account, mutual funds, stable value or collective investment trusts and a variety of underlying asset types (including their own employer stock) to best meet the needs of their employees. A broad selection of funds is available for our products in all asset categories from over 100 &#32;fund companies, including the Voya family of mutual funds managed by our Investment Management segment. Our full-service retirement plan offerings are also supported by financial planning and investment advisory services offered through our Retail Wealth Management business or through third parties (e.g., Morningstar) to help prepare individuals for retirement through customer-focused personalized and objective investment advice. 

Recordkeeping only service products provide administration support for plan sponsors seeking integrated recordkeeping services for defined contribution, defined benefit and non-qualified plans. Our plan sponsor base spans the entire range of corporate plan sponsors as well as state and local governments. Our recordkeeping retirement plan offerings are also supported by award-winning participant communications and education programs, innovative myOrangeMoney&#8482; digital capabilities for sponsors and plan participants (plus mobile capabilities for participants), as well as investment advisory services offered through our Retail Wealth Management business. 

&#160; 

Stable value investment options are offered with a particular focus on cross-selling products utilizing proprietary investment management to our largest institutional recordkeeping plans. Our product offering includes both separate account GICs and synthetic GICs managed by either proprietary or outside investment managers. 

Pension risk transfer solutions are offered to institutional plan sponsors looking to transfer their defined benefit plan obligations to us. We first entered this market in 2014, and we believe it offers a growth opportunity that is aligned with our expertise in servicing institutional group annuity plans and individual plan participants.

Markets and Distribution 

Our Institutional Retirement Plans business can be categorized into two primary markets: Corporate and Tax Exempt. A brief description of each, including sub segments and strengths are as follows: 

Corporate Markets: 

&#8226; 

Small-Mid Corporate Market . In this growth market we offer full service solutions to defined contribution plans of small-mid-sized corporations (i.e., typically less than 3,000 &#32;employees). Our comprehensive product offering (including flexible investment choices), highly competitive fiduciary solutions, dedicated and proactive service teams and product and service innovations leveraged from our expertise in the Large Corporate market make us one of a small group of providers who can service small-mid corporate plans as they continue to grow. Furthermore, we offer a unique enrollment experience through our myOrangeMoney&#8482; digital capabilities, plus a broad suite of financial planning, guidance and advisors products, tools and services to help plan participants better prepare for retirement. 

&#8226; 

Large Corporate Market . In this market we offer recordkeeping services to defined contribution plans of large to mega-sized corporations. Our solutions and capabilities support the most complex retirement plans with a special focus on client relationship management and participant retirement readiness support through a broad suite of financial planning, guidance and advisory products, tools and services. We are dedicated to providing engaging education, innovative technology-based tools and award winning print materials to help plan participants achieve a secure and dignified retirement. 

Tax Exempt Markets: 

&#8226; 

Education Market . We offer comprehensive full service offerings to both public and private K-12 educational entities as well as public and private higher education institutions, which we believe are attractive growth segments. In the United States, we rank third in the K-12 education market and fourth in higher education by assets as of September 30, 2015. Our innovative solutions to reduce administrative burden, deep technical and regulatory expertise, strong on-site service teams, and broad suite of retirement readiness products, tools and services for participants, continue to support our position as one of the top providers in this market. 

&#8226; 

Healthcare Market . In this market we service hospitals and healthcare organizations by offering full service solutions for a variety of plan types. Like the education market, we have solutions to reduce administrative burdens, deep technical and fiduciary expertise and on-site service teams to assist healthcare plan sponsors. Additionally, we provide customized communications, education and enrollment support plus a broad suite of retirement readiness products, tools and services in order to better prepare plan participants for retirement. 

&#8226; 

Government Market . We provide both full service and recordkeeping only offerings to small and large governmental entities (e.g., state and local government) with a client base that spans all 50 states. For large governmental sponsors, we offer recordkeeping services that meet even the most complex needs of each client, plus offer extensive participant communication and retirement education support, including a broad suite of retirement readiness products, tools and services. We also offer a broad range of proprietary, non-proprietary and stable value investments. Our flexibility and expertise help make us the fourth ranked provider in this market in the United States based on AUM and AUA as of September 30, 2015. 

Products for Institutional Retirement Plans are distributed nationally through multiple unaffiliated channels or via affiliated distribution including direct sales teams. We offer localized support to these groups and their clients during and after the sales 

&#160; 

process, a broad selection of investment options and flexibility of choice and top-tier fiduciary solutions to help their clients meet or exceed plan guidelines and responsibilities. 

Unaffiliated Distribution: 

&#8226; 

Independent Representatives . As of December 31, 2015 , we work with more than 6,000 &#32;sales agents who primarily sell fixed annuity products from multiple vendors in the education market. Activities by these representatives are centered on increasing participant enrollments and deferral amounts in our existing plans. 

&#8226; 

Independent Producers . Over 12,000 &#32;wirehouse and independent producers (as of December 31, 2015 ) are the primary distributors of our small-mid corporate market products, but they also distribute products to the education, healthcare and government markets. These producers typically present their clients (i.e., employers seeking a defined contribution plan for their employees) with plan options from multiple vendors for comparison and may also help with employee enrollment and education. 

&#8226; 

TPAs . As of December 31, 2015 , we have long-standing relationships with approximately 1,600 &#32;TPAs who are selling and/or service partners for our small-mid corporate markets business, working with a variety of vendors. While TPAs typically focus on providing plan services only (such as administration and compliance testing), some also initiate and complete the sales process. TPAs also play a vital role as the connecting point between our wholesale team and unaffiliated producers who seek references for determining which providers they should recommend to their clients. 

Affiliated Distribution: 

&#8226; 

Affiliated Representatives . Voya Financial Advisors, our retail broker-dealer, is one of the top twelve broker-dealers in the United States as determined by total number of licensed and producing representatives. As of December 31, 2015 , we had over 2,100 &#32;affiliated representatives. These representatives support sales of products for the Retirement segment as well as other segments, with a subset that are primarily focused on driving sales in education, healthcare and government market plans (full service) through increasing enrollments for existing plans, educating existing participants and selling new plans. 

&#8226; 

Direct Sold by Field Force. While we typically rely on third-party distribution partners for the majority of sales for our Institutional Retirement Plans business, certain members of our wholesale team also interact directly with plan sponsors primarily in the education, healthcare and government markets. Typically, this direct interaction is with a consultant hired by the plan sponsor. In order to present our offerings to these large plan clients, we work with numerous consultants at approximately 60 &#32;different consulting firms focused on these markets. 

&#8226; 

Direct Sold by Dedicated Voya Sales Teams. We have sales teams that work directly with large plan corporate market, stable value and pension risk transfer clients. The stable value investment only business can occur in either our recordkeeping only plans or within other vendors&#8217; plans. Pension risk transfer solutions may be sold to our existing clients or to new clients that need a solution for de-risking their defined benefit plan. For large corporate plans, stable value products and pension risk transfer solutions, the majority of our direct interaction occurs with approximately 20 &#32;different consulting firms focused on these offerings for their clients. 

&#160; 

Competition &#32; 

Our Institutional Retirement Plans business competes with other large, well-established insurance companies, asset managers, record keepers and diversified financial institutions. Competition varies in all market segments as very few institutions are able to compete across all markets as we do. The following chart presents a summary of the current competitive landscape in the markets where we offer our Institutional Retirement Plans, stable value and pension risk transfer products:

Our full-service Institutional Retirement Plans business competes primarily based on pricing, the breadth of our service and investment offerings, technical/regulatory expertise, industry experience, local enrollment and financial planning support, investment performance and our ability to offer industry tailored product features to meet the retirement income needs of our clients. Additionally, Voya's myOrangeMoney&#8482; digital and mobile capabilities provide competitive advantage in the market. Regarding the large plan recordkeeping only business, we have seen consolidation among industry providers in recent years seeking to increase scale, improve cost efficiencies and enter new market segments. As a result, we emphasize our strong sponsor relationships, flexible value-added services, and technical and regulatory expertise as our competitive strengths. Additionally, we compete across all institutional markets with our broad suite of retirement readiness products, tools and services that help employers support the retirement preparedness needs of their employees. Finally, we have seen new insurance company competitors enter the stable value space because demand from participant and plan sponsors remains strong for these products. The pension risk transfer business has also seen a few new competitors enter the market to provide defined benefit de-risking solutions for institutional clients. Our long standing experience in the retirement market underscored by strong stable value expertise allows us to effectively compete against existing and new providers. 

Defined Benefit Recordkeeping Business Transition . In 2014 , after reviewing our goals for our Retirement segment and considering the trends we see in the employee retirement benefit market, the Company made a strategic decision to transition, in an orderly fashion, out of the market for defined benefit plan administration recordkeeping services. As a result, we are gradually exiting our existing contracts that support defined benefit plan administration recordkeeping. We expect this transition to be completed by the end of 2016 and do not expect this transition to have a material impact on our future results. 

&#160; 

Underwriting and Pricing 

We price our institutional and individual retirement products based on long-term assumptions that include investment returns, mortality, persistency and operating costs. We establish target returns for each product based upon these factors and the expected amount of regulatory and rating agency capital that we must hold to support these contracts over their projected lifetime. We monitor and manage pricing and sales mix to achieve target returns. It may take new business several years before it is profitable, depending on the nature and life of the product, and returns are subject to variability as actual results may differ from pricing assumptions. We seek to mitigate investment risk by actively managing market and credit risks associated with investments and through asset/liability matching portfolio management. 

Retail Wealth Management 

Products and Services 

Our Retail Wealth Management business offers simple, easy-to-understand products, along with holistic advice and guidance delivered through affiliated brokers and by online capabilities. Our current investment solutions include a variety of mutual fund custodial IRA products and managed accounts and advisory programs, plus brokerage accounts. 

The primary focus of our Retirement segment is to serve approximately 4.5 million &#32;defined contribution plan participant accounts (as of December 31, 2015 ). We also seek to capitalize on our access to these individuals through our Institutional Retirement Plans business by developing long-term relationships and providing individual retail solutions. We believe that our ability to offer a seamless and integrated approach to an individual customer&#8217;s entire financial picture, while saving for or living in retirement, presents a compelling reason for our Institutional Retirement Plans participants to use us as their principal investment and retirement plan provider. Through our broad range of advisory programs, our financial advisers have access to a wide set of solutions for our customers for building investment portfolios, including stocks, bonds and mutual funds, as well as managed accounts. These experienced advisers work with customers to select a program to meet their financial needs that takes into consideration each individual&#8217;s time horizon, goals and attitudes towards risk. 

Markets and Advisory Services 

Retail Wealth Management advisory services and product solutions are primarily sold through our affiliated distribution group of over 2,100 &#32;Voya Financial Advisors representatives as well as online via Voya websites. The affiliated representatives help provide cohesiveness between our Institutional Retirement Plans and Retail Wealth Management businesses and they are grouped into two primary categories: affiliated field-based representatives and home office phone-based representatives. Affiliated field-based representatives are registered sales and investment advisory representatives in our retail broker dealer that drive both fee-based and commissioned sales. They provide face-to-face interaction with individuals seeking financial advice and retail investment products (e.g., rollover products) as well as retirement and financial planning solutions. Home office phone-based representatives primarily focus on our growth opportunity of assisting participants in our large recordkeeping plans. They offer the same broad suite of products and services as the affiliated field-based representatives, but are highly trained in providing financial advice that helps customers transition through life stage and job-related changes. 

In an effort to develop a path for affiliated representatives to offer holistic retirement planning solutions to participants in our Institutional Retirement Plans, we partner with our institutional clients to engage, educate, advise and motivate their employees to take action that will better prepare them for successful retirement outcomes. 

Competition 

Our Retail Wealth Management advisory services and product solutions compete for rollover and other asset consolidation opportunities against integrated financial services companies and independent broker-dealers who also offer individual retirement products, all of which currently have more market share than insurance-based providers in this space. Primary competitors to our Retail Wealth Management business are, in the investor channel, Fidelity, Schwab, Vanguard and Merrill Edge, and in the field channel, LPL Financial, Ameriprise, Commonwealth, Cambridge, Cetera, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney and Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 

Our Retail Wealth Management advisory services and product solutions compete based on our consultative approach, simplicity of design and a fund and investment selection process that includes proprietary and non-proprietary investment options. The advisory services and product solutions are primarily targeted towards existing participants, which allow us to benefit from our 

&#160; 

extensive relationships with large corporate and tax-exempt plan sponsors, our small and mid-corporate market plan sponsors and other qualified plan segments in healthcare, higher education and K-12 education. 

Underwriting and Pricing 

We price our institutional and individual retirement products based on long-term assumptions that include investment returns, mortality, persistency and operating costs. We establish target returns for each product based upon these factors and the expected amount of regulatory and rating agency capital that we must hold to support these contracts over their projected lifetime. We monitor and manage pricing and sales mix to achieve target returns. It may take new business several years before it is profitable, depending on the nature and life of the product, and returns are subject to variability as actual results may differ from pricing assumptions. We seek to mitigate investment risk by actively managing market and credit risks associated with investments and through asset/liability matching portfolio management. 

Annuities 

The Annuities segment provides fixed and indexed annuities, tax-qualified mutual fund custodial and other investment-only products and payout annuities for pre-retirement wealth accumulation and postretirement income management, sold through multiple channels. Revenues are generated from fees and from margins based on the difference between income earned on the investments supporting the liability and interest credited to customers. Our Annuities segment generated operating earnings before income taxes of $243.0 million &#32;for the year ended December 31, 2015 . 

We intend to achieve our risk-adjusted return objectives in Annuities through a disciplined approach, balancing profitability with growth, with a focus on preserving margins in low interest rate environments. As a result, we expect to opportunistically grow our Fixed Indexed Annuities ("FIA") business when margins are attractive and to reduce growth but maintain distribution access when margins are less attractive. Our mutual fund custodial products business is not sensitive to interest rate conditions and, as such, is focused on growth. While we still offer traditional fixed annuities, we are prepared to allow the existing business to decline in volume due to low margins and less attractive returns. We intend to meet our risk management objectives by continuing to hedge market risks associated with the indexed crediting strategies selected by clients on our FIA contracts. See "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk&#8212;Risk Management." 

Products and Services 

Our Annuities segment product offerings include immediate and deferred fixed annuities designed to address customer needs for tax-advantaged savings and retirement income and their wealth-protection concerns. New sales comprise primarily FIAs and tax-qualified mutual fund custodial accounts. 

FIAs . FIAs are marketed principally based on underlying interest-crediting guarantee features coupled with the potential for increased returns based on the performance of market indices. For an FIA, the principal amount of the annuity is guaranteed to be no less than a minimum value based on non-forfeiture regulations that vary by state. Interest on FIAs is credited based on allocations selected by a customer in one or more of the strategies we offer and upon policy parameters that we set. The strategies include a fixed interest rate option, as well as several options based upon performance of various external financial market indices. Such indices may include equity indices, such as Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s 500 Index (the "S&#38;P 500"), or an interest rate benchmark, such as the change in London Interbank Offered Rates ("LIBOR"). The parameters (such as "caps," "participation rates," and "spreads") are periodically declared by us for both initial and following periods. Our existing FIAs contain death benefits as required by non-forfeiture regulations. Some FIAs contain guaranteed withdrawal benefit features at an additional cost. These living benefits guarantee a minimum annual withdrawal amount for life. The amount of the guaranteed annual withdrawal may vary by age at first withdrawal. 

Annual Reset and Multi-Year Guarantee Annuities ("MYGAs") . Our in-force block includes Annual Reset and MYGA products, which provide guaranteed minimum rates of up to 4.5% &#32;and with crediting rate terms from one year to 10 years . These products are running off, with net outflows of $0.7 billion &#32;in 2015 , compared with $1.7 billion &#32;in 2014 &#32;and $1.2 billion &#32;in 2013. The run-off of these Annual Reset and MYGA contracts is expected to continue to enhance the margin of our Annuities segment in future periods. 

Although not currently a significant portion of new sales, we also offer other fixed annuities with a guaranteed interest rate or a periodic annuity payment schedule suitable for clients seeking a stable return. 

&#160; 

Investment-Only Products . Our Annuities segment offers tax-qualified mutual fund custodial products, which provide flexible investment options across mutual fund families on a no-load basis. We charge a recordkeeping fee based on the amount of assets invested in the account, and we are paid asset-based fees by the managers of the mutual funds within the account. This product is designed to be a streamlined, simple rollover solution providing continued tax deferral on retirement assets. No minimum guarantees are offered for this product. 

Although not currently a significant portion of new sales, we also offer an investment-only non-qualified complement, which provides flexible investment options across mutual fund families on a no-load basis. Similar to our mutual fund custodial product, we charge a recordkeeping fee based on the amount of assets invested in the account, and we are paid asset-based fees by the managers of the mutual funds within the account. No minimum guarantees are offered for this product.

Our investment-only products are distributed nationally, primarily through relationships with independent brokers, financial planners and agents. New sales are obtained from either a "rollover" from an existing retirement account, a 1035-exchange or funded through non-qualified after-tax dollars. 

Since December 2013, we have been engaged in a strategic alliance with The Allstate Corporation under which Allstate offers a full suite of our fixed annuity product offerings to Allstate customers. These fixed annuity products are issued by VIAC and VRIAC. In addition, during 2015, we engaged in a strategic alliance with Farmers Financial Solutions, a part of the Farmers Insurance Group of Companies, under which we will be the exclusive provider of indexed annuity products to Farmers customers. 

Competition 

Our Annuities segment faces competition from traditional insurance carriers, as well as banks, mutual fund companies and other investment managers such as Allianz, Athene, American Equity, Lincoln and Great American. Principal competitive factors for fixed annuities are initial crediting rates, reputation for renewal crediting action, product features, brand recognition, customer service, cost, distribution capabilities and financial strength ratings of the provider. Competition may affect, among other matters, both business growth and the pricing of our products and services. 

Investment-only products compete with brokerage accounts and other financial service and asset allocation offerings. 

&#160; 

Underwriting and Pricing 

We generally do not underwrite individual lives in our Annuities segment. Instead, we price our products based upon our expected investment returns and our expectations for mortality, longevity and persistency for the group of our contract holders as a whole, taking into account our historical experience. We price annuities by analyzing longevity and persistency risk, volatility of expected earnings on our AUM and the expected time to retirement. Our product pricing models also take into account capital requirements, hedging costs and operating expenses. 

Our investment-only products are fee-based recordkeeping products for which the recordkeeping fees, combined with estimated mutual fund revenue sharing, are priced to cover acquisition and operating costs over the life of the account. These investment-only products do not generate investment margins, do not expose us to significant mortality risk and no hedging is required. 

Investment Management 

We offer domestic and international fixed income, equity, multi-asset and alternatives products and solutions across market sectors, investment styles and capitalization spectrums through our actively managed, full-service investment management business. Multiple investment platforms are backed by a fully integrated business support infrastructure that lowers expense and creates operating efficiencies and business leverage and scalability at low marginal cost. As of December 31, 2015 , our Investment Management segment managed $77.7 billion &#32;for third-party institutions and individual investors, $44.8 billion &#32;in separate account assets for our Retirement Solutions and Insurance Solutions businesses and our Closed Block segments and $78.2 billion &#32;in general account assets. 

We are committed to reliable and responsible investing and delivering research-driven, risk-adjusted, client-oriented investment strategies and solutions and advisory services across asset classes, geographies and investment styles. We serve a variety of institutional clients, including public, corporate and Taft-Hartley Act defined-benefit and defined-contribution retirement plans, endowments and foundations, and insurance companies through our institutional distribution channel and through affiliates. We also serve individual investors by offering our mutual funds and separately managed accounts through an intermediary-focused distribution platform or through affiliate and third-party retirement platforms. 

Investment Management&#8217;s primary source of revenue is management fees collected on the assets we manage. These fees typically are based upon a percentage of AUM. In certain investment management fee arrangements, we may also receive performance-based incentive fees when the return on AUM exceeds certain benchmark returns or other performance hurdles. In addition, and to a lesser extent, Investment Management collects administrative fees on outside managed assets that are administered by our mutual fund platform, and distributed primarily by our Retirement Solutions business. Investment Management also receives fees as the primary investment manager of our general account, which is managed on an arm&#8217;s-length pricing basis. Investment Management generated operating earnings before income taxes of $181.9 million &#32;for the year ended December 31, 2015 . 

We are driving Investment Management profitability by leveraging continued strong investment performance across all asset classes to accelerate growth in AUM. We are also increasing scale in our primary capabilities and our share of proprietary funds in affiliate products, principally through leveraging our access to approximately 47,000 &#32;defined contribution plan sponsors and nearly 4.5 million &#32;plan participant accounts through our Retirement business as of December 31, 2015 . We are focused on capitalizing on Retirement Solutions&#8217; leading market position and Investment Management&#8217;s broad investment capabilities and strong investment track records. To that end we have established dedicated retirement resources within our Investment Management intermediary-focused distribution team to work with Retirement Solutions and have enhanced our MASS investment platform (described below) to increase focus on retirement products such as our target date and target risk portfolios, which we believe will capture an increased proportion of retirement flows going forward. 

We are also growing our third-party affiliated and non-affiliated investment management business through continued strength of investment performance as well as a number of key strategic initiatives, including: improved distribution productivity; increased focus on client "solutions" and income and outcome oriented products such as target date funds; pursuit of investment only mandates on non-affiliate retirement platforms; replacement of sub-advised Voya Mutual Funds where Investment Management now offers stronger investment performance; sub-advisory mandates for Investment Management capabilities on others&#8217; platforms; leveraging partnerships with financial intermediaries and consultants; long -term expansion of our international investment capabilities; opportunistic launching of capital markets products such as Collateralized loan obligations ("CLOs") and Closed End Mutual Funds; and prudent expansion of our private equity business. 

&#160; 

Products and Services 

Investment Management delivers products and services that are manufactured by traditional and specialty investment platforms. The traditional platforms are fixed income, equities and MASS. The specialty investment platforms are senior bank loans and alternatives. 

Fixed Income. Investment Management&#8217;s fixed income platform manages assets for our general account, as well as for domestic and international institutional and retail investors. As of December 31, 2015 , there were $116.1 billion &#32;in AUM on the fixed income platform, of which $78.2 billion &#32;were general account assets. Through the fixed income platform clients have access to money market funds, investment-grade corporate debt, government bonds, residential mortgage-backed securities ("RMBS"), commercial mortgage-backed securities ("CMBS"), asset-backed securities ("ABS"), high yield bonds, private and syndicated debt instruments, commercial mortgages and preferred securities. Each sector within the platform is managed by seasoned investment professionals supported by significant credit, quantitative and macro research and risk management capabilities. 

Equities. The equities platform is a multi-cap and multi-style research-driven platform comprising both fundamental and quantitative equity strategies for institutional and retail investors. As of December 31, 2015 , there were $56.1 billion &#32;in AUM on the equities platform covering both domestic and international markets including Real Estate. Our fundamental equity capabilities are bottom-up, research driven and cover growth, value and core strategies in the large, mid and small cap spaces. Our quantitative equity capabilities are used to create quantitative and enhanced indexed strategies, support other fundamental equity analysis and create extension products. 

MASS. Investment Management&#8217;s MASS platform offers a variety of investment products and strategies that combine multiple asset classes with asset allocation techniques. The objective of the MASS platform is to develop customized solutions that meet the specific, and often unique, goals of investors with products that change dynamically over time in response to changing markets and client needs. Utilizing core capabilities in asset allocation, manager selection, asset/liability modeling, risk management and financial engineering, the MASS team has developed a suite of target date and target risk funds that are distributed through our Retirement Solutions business and to institutional and retail investors. These funds can incorporate multi-manager funds. The MASS team also provides pension risk management, strategic and tactical asset allocation, liability-driven investing solutions and investment strategies that hedge out specific market exposures (e.g., portable alpha) for clients. 

Senior Bank Loans. Investment Management&#8217;s senior bank loan group is an experienced manager of below-investment grade floating-rate loans, actively managing diversified portfolios of loans made by major banks around the world to non-investment grade corporate borrowers. Senior in the capital structure, these loans have a first lien on the borrower&#8217;s assets, typically giving them stronger credit support than unsecured corporate bonds. The platform offers institutional, retail and structured products (e.g., CLOs), including on-shore and off-shore vehicles with assets of $19.8 billion &#32;as of December 31, 2015 . 

Alternatives. Investment Management&#8217;s primary alternatives platform is Pomona Capital. Pomona Capital specializes in investing in private equity funds in three ways: by purchasing secondary interests in existing partnerships; by investing in new partnerships; and by co-investing alongside buyout funds in individual companies. As of December 31, 2015 , Pomona Capital managed assets totaling $7.3 billion &#32;across a suite of eight limited partnerships and the Pomona Investment Fund, a new registered investment fund launched in May, 2015 that is available to accredited investors. In addition, Investment Management offers select alternative and hedge funds leveraging our core debt and equity investment capabilities.

Markets and Distribution 

We serve our institutional clients through a dedicated sales and service platform consisting of direct- and consultant-focused sales professionals. We serve individual investors through an intermediary-focused distribution platform, consisting of business development and wholesale forces which partner with banks, broker-dealers and independent financial advisers, as well as our affiliate and third-party retirement platforms. 

With the exception of Pomona Capital, the different products and strategies associated with our investment platforms are distributed and serviced by these Retail and Institutional client-focused segments as follows: 

&#8226; 

Retail client segment: Open- and closed-end funds through affiliate and third-party distribution platforms, including wirehouses, brokerage firms, and independent and regional broker-dealers. As of December 31, 2015 , total AUM from these channels was $66.7 billion . 

&#8226; 

Institutional client segment: Individual and pooled accounts, targeting defined benefit, defined contribution recordkeeping and retirement plans, Taft Hartley and endowments and foundations. As of December 31, 2015 , Investment Management had approximately 265 institutional clients, representing $55.9 billion &#32;of AUM primarily in separately managed accounts, collective investment trusts and structured vehicles. 

Investment Management manages a variety of variable portfolio, mutual fund and stable value assets, sold through our Retirement, Annuities, and Insurance Solutions businesses. As of December 31, 2015 , total AUM from these channels and CBVA was $54.4 billion &#32;with the majority of the assets gathered through our Retirement segment. 

&#160; 

Competition 

Investment Management competes with a wide array of asset managers and institutions in the highly fragmented U.S. investment management industry. In our key market segments, Investment Management competes on the basis of, among other things, investment performance, investment philosophy and process, product features and structure and client service. Our principal competitors in the Investment Management business include insurance-owned asset managers such as Principal Global Investors (Principal Financial Group), Prudential and Ameriprise, bank-owned asset managers such as J.P. Morgan Asset Management, as well as "pure-play" asset managers including PIMCO, Invesco, Wellington, Legg Mason, T. Rowe Price, Franklin Templeton and Fidelity. 

Insurance Solutions 

Our Insurance Solutions business comprises two reporting segments: Individual Life and Employee Benefits. Our strategy is based on a broad and effective distribution model, fueled by a manufacturing capability that provides a stream of competitive product solutions, all supported by an efficient operations and underwriting model. 

Individual Life 

Our Individual Life segment has a broad independent distribution footprint and manufactures a wide range of competitive products, with a focus on indexed universal life. We offer fixed, indexed and variable universal life insurance products targeted to more affluent markets, and low-cost term life insurance designed to serve the middle market. We have re-priced certain products and will continue to monitor changes to the product portfolio to align with market conditions. As of September 30, 2015, we were the seventeenth largest writer of universal life in the United States based on premiums sold or written. As of September 30, 2015, we were the twenty-fourth largest writer of term life in the United States. Our strong market positions have allowed us to properly scale our business to achieve greater profitability. As of December 31, 2015 , Individual Life&#8217;s in-force book comprised over 0.9 million &#32;policies and gross premiums and deposits of approximately $1.9 billion . 

The Individual Life segment generates revenue on its products from premiums, investment income, expense load, mortality charges and other policy charges, along with some asset-based fees. Profits are driven by the spread between investment income earned and interest credited to policyholders, plus the difference between premiums and mortality charges collected and benefits and expenses paid. Our Individual Life segment generated operating earnings before income taxes of $172.7 million &#32;for the year ended December 31, 2015 . 

We intend to achieve our earnings growth in our Individual Life segment by focusing on growing our earnings drivers. Our earnings drivers include growing our in-force block of business by adding new businesses and entering new markets that meet our profit and capital requirements, combined with effectively managing our in-force block to meet our profitability objectives. They also include focusing on improving our investment margins, growing our mortality profits and fully exploiting our technological capability in order to continue to reduce new business unit costs and underwriting expense. In addition, we will further our financial objectives by continuing to utilize reinsurance to actively manage our risk and capital profile with the goal of controlling exposure to losses, reducing volatility and protecting capital. We aim to maximize earnings and capital efficiency in part by relieving the reserve strain for certain of our term and universal life products by means of reinsurance arrangements and other financing transactions. We also look to transfer certain blocks of business through reinsurance in order to more effectively manage our capital. For example, in 2015 and 2014 we reinsured two in-force blocks comprising approximately 325,000 &#32;term life insurance policies, representing approximately $190 billion &#32;of life insurance in-force and backed by over $2.7 billion &#32;in statutory reserves, to a third-party reinsurer. 

In addition, we have completed the introduction of re-priced offerings for term and universal life products, both of which are high capital consuming products. We expect these actions to slow the sale of the high-capital products while we simultaneously grow sales in the low capital, cash accumulation and current assumption type products. 

Products and Services 

Our Individual Life segment currently offers products that include UL, IUL, variable universal life and term life, insurance. These offerings are designed to address customer needs for death benefit protection, tax-advantaged wealth transfer and accumulation, premium financing, business planning, executive benefits and supplemental retirement income. We believe that our combination of product solutions is well-suited for the middle-market through the mass-affluent and makes us a full service provider to our independent distribution partners. 

&#160; 

UL . Accumulation-focused universal life products feature the opportunity to build tax-deferred cash value that can be accessed by customers via loans and withdrawals for future needs. This money grows income tax-deferred, meaning no federal or state income taxes apply while it accumulates. The compounding tax-deferred interest can be an attractive feature to policyholders. These products help policyholders meet longer-range goals like college funding, supplemental retirement income and leaving a legacy for heirs. Other features include flexible premium payments that can change to meet policyholders&#8217; evolving financial needs. 

IUL . For customers looking for an opportunity for a higher return in a low rate environment, we offer IUL products, which, along with death benefit protection, provide customers the opportunity for growth through potentially stronger surrender values than traditional UL products. These IUL products link to both fixed and indexed crediting strategies and offer protection from downside risk through a minimum interest guarantee, helping customers who seek solutions that would be advantageous for providing supplemental retirement income, payment of college costs or executive benefits. One of the IUL products we offer provides up to a lifetime death benefit guarantee coupled with significant long term surrender value potential through the ability to earn an index credit linked, in part, to any increases in the S&#38;P 500. In October 2013, we introduced a re-priced Index Universal Life-Guaranteed Death Benefit ("IUL-GDB") which focuses on providing a death benefit for the customer wanting a guarantee but also wanting cash value for future flexibility. Indexed products are the fastest growing new product segment and are a major focus of our product and distribution effort as they are less capital intensive and provide attractive returns. 

Variable Universal Life . For customers seeking greater growth potential and more control over their investments, we offer an individual variable universal life insurance product designed to provide long-term cash accumulation potential with the ability to add optional riders that provide guarantees and more flexibility. We offer customers the ability to choose from individual variable investment options, which range from conservative to aggressive stock and bond investments managed by respected investment management firms in the industry or from diverse asset allocation solutions designed to match a customer&#8217;s risk tolerance. 

Term Life . Term life insurance provides basic, economical life insurance for consumers, and we market term life insurance primarily on competitive pricing and service models. Our term products, basic life and return-of-premium, offer flexible coverage for periods spanning ten to thirty years. Our term model provides us with added scale for expense coverage and opportunity for mortality profit.

The goal of our Individual Life distribution model is to be a full-service provider of life insurance products with a broad footprint, offering customers multiple ways to purchase products from our diverse portfolio. Achieving this goal has allowed us to penetrate affluent markets with our non-term portfolio, while building scale through policy count with sales of term and lower face non-term products in the middle market. 

Competition 

The Individual Life segment competes with large, well-established life insurance companies in a mature market, where price and service are key drivers. Primary competitors include Lincoln, MetLife, Prudential, American General, Principal Financial Group, John Hancock, Transamerica and Pacific Life. Individual Life primarily competes based on service and distribution channel relationships, price, brand recognition, financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries and financial stability. We have strong capabilities to monitor competition and we utilize advanced models to benchmark our product offerings against others in the industry. 

Factors that could influence our ability to competitively price products while achieving targeted returns include the cost and availability of statutory reserve financing required for certain term and universal life insurance policies, internal capital funding requirements and an extended low interest rate environment. 

Underwriting and Pricing 

We set prices for many of our insurance products based upon expected mortality over the life of the product. We base the pricing of our life insurance products in part upon expected persistency of these products, which is the probability that a policy will remain in force from one period to the next. We base premiums and policy charges for individual life insurance on expected death benefits, surrender benefits, expenses and required reserves. We use assumptions for mortality, interest, expenses, policy persistency and premium payment pattern in pricing policies. In addition, certain of our insurance products that include guaranteed returns or crediting rates underwrite equity market or interest rate risks. We seek to maintain a spread between the return on our general account invested assets and the interest we credit on our policyholder accounts. Our underwriting and risk management functions adhere to prescribed underwriting guidelines, while maintaining a competitive suite of products priced consistent with our mortality assessment. We generally manage mortality risks by enforcing strict underwriting standards and maintaining sufficient scale so that the incidence of risk occurrence is likely to match statistical modeling. 

With respect to our universal life secondary guarantee business, we seek to mitigate risk by pricing conservatively to recognize the interest rate risk and are willing to forgo sales in order to maintain our profit and risk profile. 

Reinsurance 

In general, our reinsurance strategy is designed to limit our mortality risk and volatility. We partner with highly rated, well regarded reinsurers and set up pools to share our excess mortality risk. 

As of January 1, 2013, we revised the amount of risk we retain on a life for new business issued after January 1, 2013. For term business, we continue to retain the first $3 million &#32;of risk and the excess risk is shared among a pool of reinsurers. For most of our universal life product portfolio, we retain the first $5 million &#32;of risk and reinsure 100% &#32;of the excess over $5 million &#32;among a pool of reinsurers. Our maximum overall retained risk on any one life is $5 million . 

Prior to January 1, 2013, for term business, we retained the first $3 million &#32;of risk and the excess risk was shared among a pool of reinsurers. For most of our universal life product portfolio, we retained the first $5 million &#32;of risk and reinsured a portion of 

&#160; 

the excess over $5 million &#32;into a pool until we reached our limit of $10 million &#32;of risk. 100% &#32;of the excess over $10 million &#32;then went into the pool. Our maximum overall retained risk on any one life was $10 million . 

Currently, reinsurance for new business is on a monthly renewable term basis, which only transfers mortality risk and limits our counterparty risk exposure. See " Item 7A. &#32; Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk &#8212;Risk Management". 

Employee Benefits 

Our Employee Benefits segment provides group insurance products to mid-size and large corporate employers and professional associations. In addition, our Employee Benefits segment serves the voluntary worksite market by providing individual and payroll-deduction products to employees of our clients. Our Employee Benefits segment is among the largest writers of stop loss coverage in the United States, currently ranking sixth on a premium basis with approximately $824 million &#32;of in-force premiums. We also hold top 20 &#32;positions in the group life and voluntary benefits markets on a premium basis as of September 30, 2015. As of December 31, 2015 , Employee Benefits total in-force premiums were $1.5 billion . 

The Employee Benefits segment generates revenue from premiums, investment income, mortality and morbidity income and policy and other charges. Profits are driven by the spread between investment income and credited rates to policyholders on voluntary universal life and whole life products, along with the difference between premiums and mortality charges collected and benefits and expenses paid for group life, stop loss and voluntary health benefits. Our Employee Benefits segment generated operating earnings before income taxes of $146.1 million &#32;for the year ended December 31, 2015 . 

The Employee Benefits segment offers attractive growth opportunities with much less capital strain. For example, we believe there are significant opportunities through expansion in the voluntary benefits market as employers shift benefits costs to their employees. We have a number of new products and initiatives that we believe will help us drive growth in this market. While expanding these lines, we also intend to continue to focus on profitability in our well established group life and stop loss product lines, by adding profitable new business to our in-force block, improving our persistency by retaining more of our best performing groups, and managing our loss ratios to below 80% , particularly on stop loss policies. 

Products and Services 

Our Employee Benefits segment offers stop loss insurance, group life, voluntary benefits, and group disability products. These offerings are designed to meet the financial needs of both employers and employees by helping employers attract and retain employees and control costs, as well as provide ease of administration and valuable protection for employees. 

Stop Loss. Our stop loss insurance provides coverage for mid-sized to large employers that self-insure their medical claims. These employers provide a health plan to their employees and generally pay all plan-related claims and administrative expenses. Our stop loss product helps these employers contain their health expenses by reimbursing specified claim amounts above certain deductibles and by reimbursing claims that exceed a specified limit. We offer this product via two types of protection&#8212;individual stop loss insurance and aggregate stop loss insurance. The primary difference between these two types is a varying deductible; both coverages are re-priced and renewable annually. 

Group Life . Group life products span basic and supplemental term life insurance as well as accidental death and dismemberment for mid-sized to large employers and affinity groups. These products offer employees guaranteed issue coverage, convenient payroll deduction, affordable rates and conversion options. 

Voluntary Benefits. Our voluntary benefits business involves the sale of universal life insurance, whole life insurance, critical illness, accident insurance and short-term disability income through the workplace. This product lineup is 100% &#32;employee-paid through payroll deduction. New products have been introduced that focus on group-like structures that address the cost-shifting trend. 

Group Disability. Group disability includes group long term disability, short term disability, telephonic short term disability, voluntary long term disability and voluntary short term disability products for mid-sized to large employers. This product offering is typically packaged for sale with group life products, especially in the middle-market.

Markets and Distribution 

Our Employee Benefits segment works primarily with national and regional benefits consultants, brokers, TPAs, enrollment firms and technology partners. Our tenured distribution organization provides local sales and account management support to offer customized solutions to mid-sized to large employers backed by a national accounts team. We offer innovative and flexible solutions to meet the varying and changing needs of our customers and distribution partners. We have many years of experience providing unique stop loss solutions and products for our customers. In addition, we are an experienced multi-line employee benefits insurance carrier (group life, disability, stop loss and elective benefits). 

We primarily use three distribution channels to market and sell our employee benefits products. Our largest channel works through hundreds of brokers and consultant firms nationwide and markets our entire product portfolio. Our Voluntary sales team focuses on marketing elective benefits to complement an employer&#8217;s overall benefit package. Our Affinity sales team specializes in working with TPAs to market to members of association and affinity groups. Voya Employee Benefits breadth of distribution gives us access to and the products to meet the needs of employers and their employees. 

Our Employee Benefits segment primarily targets mid-sized and large corporate employers through brokers, consultants, TPAs and private exchanges. In addition, we market stop loss coverage to employer sponsors of self-funded employee health benefits plans. 

Employee Benefits products are marketed to employers and professional associations through major brokerage operations, benefits consulting firms and direct sales. In the voluntary benefits market, policies are marketed to employees at the worksite through enrollment firms, technology partners and brokers. When combined with distribution channels used by our Individual Life segment, we are able to provide complete access to our products through worksite-based sales.

Competition 

The group insurance market is mature and, due to the large number of participants in this segment, price and service are key competitive drivers. Our principal competitors include MetLife, Prudential and Minnesota Life in group life, Tokio Marine HCC (formerly Houston Casualty), Symetra and Sun Life in Stop Loss, and Unum, Allstate and Transamerica in voluntary benefits. 

For group life insurance products, rate guarantees have become the industry norm, with rate guarantee duration periods trending upward in general. Technology is also a competitive driver, as employers and employees expect technology solutions to streamline their administrative costs. 

&#160; 

Underwriting and Pricing 

Group insurance and disability pricing reflects the employer group&#8217;s claims experience and the risk characteristics of each employer group. The employer&#8217;s group claims experience is reviewed at time of policy issuance and periodically thereafter, resulting in ongoing pricing adjustments. The key pricing and underwriting criteria are morbidity and mortality assumptions, the employer group&#8217;s demographic composition, the industry, geographic location, regional and national economic trends, plan design and prior claims experience. 

Stop loss insurance pricing reflects the risk characteristics and claims experience for each employer group. The product is annually renewable and the underwriting information is reviewed annually as a result. The key pricing and underwriting criteria are medical cost trends, morbidity assumptions, the employer group&#8217;s demographic composition, the industry, geographic location, plan design and prior claims experience. Pricing in the stop loss insurance market is generally cyclical. 

Reinsurance 

Our Employee Benefits reinsurance strategy seeks to limit our exposure to any one individual which will help limit and control risk. Group Life, which includes Accidental Death and Dismemberment, cedes the excess over $750,000 &#32;of each coverage to a reinsurer. Group Long Term Disability cedes substantially all of the risk including the claims servicing, to a TPA and reinsurer. Excess Stop Loss has a reinsurance program in place that limits our exposure (after an overall $5 million &#32;aggregate deductible that we must meet before reinsurance coverage begins) to any one specific claim to $1.25 million &#32;and there is an aggregate stop loss unit that limits our exposure to $2.0 million &#32;over the Policyholders Aggregate Excess Retention. See " Item 7A. &#32; Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk &#8212;Risk Management". We also use an annually renewable reinsurance transaction which lowers required capital of the Employee Benefits segment. 

Closed Blocks 

We have separated our CBVA and Closed Block Other segments from our other operations, placing them in run-off, and have made a strategic decision to stop actively writing new retail variable annuity products with substantial guarantee features and to run-off the activities within the Closed Block Other segment over time. Accordingly, these segments have been classified as closed blocks and are managed separately from our ongoing business. 

We continue to focus on the controlled run-off of our Closed Block segments and look for opportunities to accelerate this run-off, where possible. 

CBVA 

Our CBVA segment consists of retail variable annuity insurance policies with substantial guarantee features sold primarily from 2001 to early 2010, when the block entered run-off. These policies are long-term savings vehicles in which customers (policyholders) made deposits that are primarily maintained in separate accounts established by the Company and registered with the SEC as unit investment trusts. The deposits were invested, largely at the customer&#8217;s direction, in a variety of U.S. and international equity, fixed income, real estate and other investment options. 

Many of these policies include living benefit riders, including guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits for life ("GMWBL"), guaranteed minimum income benefits ("GMIB"), guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits ("GMAB") and guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits ("GMWB"). All deferred variable annuity contracts included guaranteed minimum death benefits ("GMDB"). 

The financial crisis of 2008-09 resulted in substantial market volatility, low interest rates and depressed equity market levels. Our variable annuity profitability declined markedly in 2009 and 2010 under these adverse market conditions, as customer account values fell below guaranteed levels and therefore our liabilities with respect to the underlying guarantees increased. Moreover, significant reduction in earnings from reduced mutual fund fees and increased hedging costs exacerbated the decline in profitability. 

We have taken numerous actions since the financial crisis to strengthen our balance sheet, increase transparency and improve the risk profile of the block, including the following: 

&#8226; 

in 2009, we made a strategic decision to stop actively writing new retail variable annuity products with substantial guarantee features. The products were fully closed to new sales in early 2010 and the management of the block shifted to run-off; 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

in 2010, we also refined our capital hedge overlay ("CHO") program to dynamically protect regulatory and rating agency capital levels in down equity market scenarios; 

&#8226; 

in early 2011, we began hedging the interest rate risk of our GMWBL book of business; 

&#8226; 

in late 2011, we refined our policyholder behavior assumptions to more closely align with experience resulting in U.S. GAAP and gross U.S. statutory reserve increases of $741 million &#32;and $2,776 million &#32;in the fourth quarter of 2011, respectively; and 

&#8226; 

in late 2014, we continued to refine our CHO program to also protect regulatory and rating agency capital from increased volatility as well as credit spread widening scenarios. 

U.S. GAAP accounting differs from the methods used to determine regulatory and rating agency capital measures. Therefore our hedge programs may create material earnings volatility for U.S. GAAP financial statements. 

Our risk management program is focused on balancing key factors including regulatory reserves, rating agency capital, risk-based capital ("RBC"), liquidity, earnings, and economic value. There is significant operational scale (approximately 360,000 &#32;variable policy holders and $35.6 billion &#32;in AUM in our CBVA segment, excluding contracts in payout status, as of December 31, 2015 ) which ensures ongoing hedging, financial reporting and information technology maintenance expense efficiencies. 

The block continues to generate revenue from asset-based fees. On a U.S. GAAP basis, we continue to amortize capitalized acquisition costs over estimated gross revenues and we incur operating costs and benefit expenses in support of the segment. 

Our focus in managing our CBVA segment is on protecting regulatory and rating agency capital from market movements via hedging and judiciously looking for opportunities to accelerate the run-off of the block, where possible. For example, we have offered enhanced income for certain eligible GMIB policyholders which allowed them to annuitize prior to the end of their 10-year waiting period. 

Nature of Liabilities 

Substantially all of our CBVA segment products were issued by one of our operating subsidiaries, VIAC. 

Each of our CBVA segment deferred variable annuity products include some combination of the following features which the customer elected when purchasing the product: 

Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefits (GMDB) 

&#8226; 

Standard . Guarantees that, upon the death of the individual specified in the policy, the death benefit will be no less than the premiums paid by the customer, adjusted for withdrawals. 

&#8226; 

Ratchet . Guarantees that, upon the death of the individual specified in the policy, the death benefit will be no less than the greater of (1) Standard or (2) the maximum policy anniversary (or quarterly) value of the variable annuity, adjusted for withdrawals. 

&#8226; 

Rollup . Guarantees that, upon the death of the individual specified in the policy, the death benefit will be no less than the aggregate premiums paid by the contract owner, with interest at the contractual rate per annum, adjusted for withdrawals. The Rollup may be subject to a maximum cap on the total benefit. 

&#8226; 

Combo . Guarantees that, upon the death of the individual specified in the policy, the death benefit will be no less than the greater of (1) Ratchet or (2) Rollup. 

Guaranteed Minimum Living Benefits 

&#8226; 

Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit (GMIB) . Guarantees a minimum income payout, exercisable only on a contract anniversary on or after a specified date, in most cases 10 years &#32;after purchase of the GMIB rider. The income payout is determined based on contractually established annuity factors multiplied by the benefit base. The benefit base equals the premium paid at the time of product issue and may increase over time based on a number of factors, including a rollup 

&#160; 

percentage (mainly 7% &#32;or 6% &#32;depending on the version of the benefit) and ratchet frequency subject to maximum caps which vary by product version ( 200% , 250% &#32;or 300% &#32;of initial premium). 

&#8226; 

Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit and Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit for Life (GMWB/GMWBL) . Guarantees an annual withdrawal amount for a specified period of time (GMWB) or life (GMWBL) that is calculated as a percentage of the benefit base that equals premium paid at the time of product issue and may increase over time based on a number of factors, including a rollup percentage (mainly 7% , 6% &#32;or 0% , depending on versions of the benefit) and ratchet frequency (primarily annually or quarterly, depending on versions). The percentage used to determine the guaranteed annual withdrawal amount may vary by age at first withdrawal and depends on versions of the benefit. A joint 

life-time withdrawal benefit option was available to include coverage for spouses. Most versions of the withdrawal benefit included reset and/or step-up features that may increase the guaranteed withdrawal amount in certain conditions. Earlier versions of the withdrawal benefit guarantee that annual withdrawals of up to 7% &#32;of eligible premiums may be made until eligible premiums previously paid by the contract owner are returned, regardless of account value performance. Asset allocation requirements apply at all times where withdrawals are guaranteed for life. 

&#8226; 

Guaranteed Minimum Accumulation Benefit (GMAB) . Guarantees that the account value will be at least 100% &#32;of the eligible premiums paid by the customer after 10 years , adjusted for withdrawals. We offered an alternative design that guaranteed the account value to be at least 200% &#32;of the eligible premiums paid by contract owners after 20 years . 

Reserves for Future Policy Benefits 

We establish and carry actuarially-determined reserves that are calculated to meet our future obligations. The principal assumptions used to establish liabilities for future policy benefits are based on our experience and periodically reviewed against industry standards. These assumptions include mortality, policy lapse, investment returns, inflation, benefit utilization and expenses. Changes in, or deviations from, the assumptions used can significantly affect our reserve levels and related future operations. 

The determination of future policy benefit reserves is dependent on actuarial assumptions set by us in determining policyholder behavior, as described above. 

Reserves for variable annuity GMDB and GMIB are determined by estimating the value of expected benefits in excess of the projected account balance and recognizing the excess ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments. Expected assessments are based on a range of scenarios. The reserve for the GMIB guarantee incorporates an assumption for the percentage of the contracts that will annuitize. In general, we assume that GMIB annuitization rates will be higher for policies with more valuable (more "in the money") guarantees. We periodically evaluate estimates used and adjust the additional liability balance, with a related charge or credit to benefit expense, if actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier assumptions should be revised. Changes in reserves for GMDB and GMIB are reported in Policyholder benefits in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

Variable annuity GMAB, GMWB, and GMWBL are considered embedded derivatives, which are measured at estimated fair value separately from the host annuity contract, along with attributed fees collected or payments made, and reported in Other net realized capital gains (losses) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

At inception of the GMAB, GMWB, and GMWBL contracts, we project fees to be attributed to the embedded derivative portion of the guarantee equal to the present value of projected future guaranteed benefits. Any excess or deficient fee is attributed to the host contract and reported in Fee income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

The estimated fair value of the GMAB, GMWB, and GMWBL contracts is determined based on the present value of projected future guaranteed benefits, minus the present value of projected attributed fees. A risk neutral valuation methodology is used under which the cash flows from the guarantees are projected under multiple capital market scenarios using observable risk free rates. The projection of future guaranteed benefits and future attributed fees require the use of assumptions for capital markets (e.g., implied volatilities, correlation among indices, risk-free swap curve, etc.) and policyholder behavior (e.g., lapse, benefit utilization, mortality, etc.). The projection also includes adjustments for nonperformance risk and margins for non-capital market risks, or policyholder behavior assumptions. Risk margins are established to capture uncertainties related to policyholder behavior assumptions. The margin represents additional compensation a market participant would require in order to assume these risks.

Capital Management Considerations 

The focus of the management of the CBVA segment is on regulatory reserve and capital requirements. As of December 31, 2015 , we held regulatory reserves, net of third-party reinsurance, of $5.1 billion &#32;supporting variable annuities guarantees, which included $4.1 billion &#32;supporting living benefit guarantees. 

Both market movements and changes in actuarial assumptions (including policyholder behavior and mortality) can result in significant changes to the regulatory reserve and rating agency capital requirements of this segment. The section below on "Variable Annuity Hedge Program and Reinsurance" describes the Variable Annuity CHO program, which is designed to mitigate the effect of adverse market movements on our regulatory capital and rating agency capital positions. Additionally, the section on "CBVA Risks and Risk Management" discusses the risk of adverse developments in policyholder behavior and its potential impact on the regulatory reserves and rating agency capital position. 

We believe that our hedge program combined with an estimated $5.7 billion of assets available to support the guarantees in the variable annuity block provide adequate resources to fund a wide range of, but not all, possible market scenarios as well as a margin for adverse policyholder behavior. 

Variable Annuity Hedge Program and Reinsurance 

Variable Annuity Guarantee Hedge Program. We primarily mitigate CBVA market risk exposures through hedging. Market risk arises primarily from the minimum guarantees within the CBVA products, whose economic costs are primarily dependent on future equity market returns, interest rate levels, equity volatility levels and policyholder behavior. The Variable Annuity Guarantee Hedge Program is used to mitigate our exposure to equity market and interest rate changes and seeks to ensure that the required assets are available to satisfy future death benefit and living benefit obligations. While the Variable Annuity Guarantee Hedge Program does not explicitly hedge statutory or U.S. GAAP reserves, as markets move up or down, in aggregate the returns generated by the Variable Annuity Guarantee Hedge Program will significantly offset the statutory and U.S. GAAP reserve changes due to market movements. 

The objective of the Variable Annuity Guarantee Hedge Program is to offset changes in equity market returns for most minimum guaranteed death benefits and all guaranteed living benefits, while also providing interest rate protection for certain minimum guaranteed living benefits. We hedge the equity market exposure using a hedge target set using market consistent valuation techniques for all guaranteed living benefits and most death benefits. We also hedge a portion of the interest rate risk in our GMWB/GMAB/GMWBL blocks using a market consistent valuation hedge target. The Variable Annuity Guarantee Hedge Program does not hedge interest rate risks for our GMIB or GMDB, however, interest rate risk is fully hedged to our targets with inclusion of the CHO program, which is discussed below. These hedge targets may change over time with market movements, changes in regulatory and rating agency capital, available collateral and our risk tolerance. 

&#160; 

Equity index futures on various equity indices are used to mitigate the risk of the change in value of the policyholder-directed separate account funds underlying the variable annuity contracts with minimum guarantees. A dynamic trading program is utilized to seek replication of the performance of targeted fund groups (i.e., the fund groups that can be covered by indices where liquid futures markets exist). 

Total return swaps are also used to mitigate the risk of the change in value of certain policyholder-directed separate account funds. These include fund classes such as emerging markets and real estate. They may also be used instead of futures of more liquid indices where it may be deemed advantageous. This hedging strategy is employed at our discretion based on current risk exposures and related transaction costs. 

Interest rate swaps are used to match a portion of the hedge targets on GMWB/GMAB/GMWBL as described above. 

Variance swaps and equity options were used to mitigate the impact of changes in equity volatility on the economic liabilities associated with certain minimum guaranteed living benefits. In the second quarter of 2015, we chose to cease this program because of the limited benefit of it covering a small block of business. 

Foreign exchange forwards are used to mitigate the impact of policyholder-directed investments in international funds with exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates of certain foreign currencies. Rebalancing is performed based on pre-determined notional exposures to the specific currencies. 

Variable Annuity Capital Hedge Overlay Program. CBVA guaranteed benefits are hedged based on their economic or fair value; however, the statutory reserves and rating agency required assets are not based on a market value. When equity markets decrease, the statutory reserve and rating agency required assets for the CBVA guaranteed benefits can increase more quickly than the value of the derivatives held under the Variable Annuity Guarantee Hedge Program. This causes regulatory reserves to increase and rating agency capital to decrease. The CHO program is intended to mitigate market risk to the regulatory and rating agency capital of the Company . The hedge is executed through the purchase and sale of equity index derivatives, variance and credit default swaps, and is designed to limit the uncovered reserve and rating agency capital increases and certain rebalancing costs in an immediate down equity market, credit spread widening, or increased volatility scenario to an amount we believe prudent for a company of our size and scale. This amount will change over time with market movements, changes in regulatory and rating agency capital, available collateral and our risk tolerance. 

The following table summarizes the estimated net impacts to funding our regulatory reserves to our CBVA segment, after giving effect to our CHO program and the Variable Annuity Guarantee Hedge Program for various shocks in equity markets and interest rates. This reflects the hedging we had in place as well as any collateral (in the form of a letter of credit ("LOC") and/or available assets) or change in underlying asset values that would be used to achieve credit for reinsurance for the segment of liabilities reinsured to our captive reinsurance subsidiary domiciled in Arizona (referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as "our Arizona captive") at the close of business on December 31, 2015 &#32;in light of our determination of risk tolerance and available collateral at that time, which, as noted above, we assess periodically. As part of our risk management approach, we may use LOCs to meet regulatory requirements in our Arizona captive even when capital requirements may be met in aggregate without LOCs. We assess and determine appropriate capital use in various scenarios including a combination of LOCs and available assets. See table below.

The foregoing sensitivities illustrate the estimated impact of the indicated shocks beginning on the first market trading day following December 31, 2015 &#32;and give effect to rebalancing over the course of the shock event. The estimates of equity market shocks reflect 

&#160; 

a shock to all equity markets, domestic and global, of the same magnitude. The estimates of interest rate shocks reflect a shock to rates at all durations (a "parallel" shift in the yield curve). Decrease / (increase) in regulatory reserves includes statutory reserves for policyholder account balances, NAIC Actuarial Guideline 43 ("AG43") reserves and additional cash flow testing reserves related to the CBVA segment. Hedge Gain / (Loss) includes both the Variable Annuity Guarantee Hedge Program and the CHO program and assumes that hedge positions can be rebalanced during the market shock and that the performance of the derivative contracts reasonably matches the performance of the contract owners&#8217; variable fund returns. Increase / (decrease) in LOCs and/or available assets indicates the change in the amount of LOCs and/or available assets used to provide credit for reinsurance at those times when the assets backing the reinsurance liabilities may be less than the statutory reserve requirement. Increase / (decrease) in Market Value of Assets is the estimated potential change in market value of assets supporting the segment of liabilities reinsured to our Arizona captive from 100 basis point upward and downward shifts in interest rates. 

Results of an actual shock to equity markets or interest rates will differ from the above illustration for reasons such as variance in market volatility versus what is assumed, &#8216;basis risk&#8217; (differences in the performance of the derivative contracts versus the contract owner variable fund returns), equity shocks not occurring uniformly across all equity markets, combined effects of interest rates and equities, additional impacts from rebalancing of hedges and/or the effects of time and changes in assumptions or methodology that affect reserves or hedge targets. Additionally, estimated net impact sensitivities vary over time as the market and closed book of business evolve or if assumptions or methodologies that affect reserves or hedge targets are refined. 

As stated above, the primary focus of the hedge program is to protect regulatory and rating agency capital from market movements. Hedge ineffectiveness, along with other aspects not directly hedged (including unexpected policyholder behavior), may cause losses of regulatory or rating agency capital. Regulatory and rating agency capital requirements may move disproportionately (i.e., they may change by different amounts as market conditions and other factors change), and, therefore, this could also cause our hedge program to not realize its key objective of protecting both regulatory and rating agency capital from market movements. 

For VIAC, our hedge resources related to equity movements (which include guarantee and overlay equity hedges, as well as other assets) increased by approximately $300.0 million &#32;for the year ended December 31, 2015 . In addition, there was approximately no equity market change in AG43 reserves in excess of reserves for cash surrender value for the year ended December 31, 2015 . Changes in statutory reserves due to equity and equity hedges for VIAC include the effects of non-affiliated reinsurance for variable annuity policies, but exclude the effect of the affiliated reinsurance transaction associated with the GMIB and GMWBL riders. Substantially all of the CBVA business was written by VIAC. In addition to equity hedge results and change in reserves due to the impact of equity market movements, statutory income includes fee income, investment income and other income offset by benefit payments, operating expenses and other costs as well as impacts to reserves and hedges due to effects of time and other market factors. 

As U.S. GAAP accounting differs from the methods used to determine regulatory reserves and rating agency capital requirements, our hedge programs may result in immediate impacts that may be lower or higher than the regulatory impacts illustrated above. The following table summarizes the estimated net impacts to U.S. GAAP earnings pre-tax in our CBVA segment, which is the sum of the increase or decrease in U.S. GAAP reserves and the hedge gain or loss from our CHO program and the Variable Annuity Guarantee Hedge Program for various shocks in both equity markets and interest rates. This reflects the hedging we had in place at the close of business on December 31, 2015 &#32;in light of our determination of risk tolerance at that time, which, as noted above, we assess periodically.

The foregoing sensitivities illustrate the impact of the indicated shocks on the first market trading day following December 31, 2015 &#32;and give effect to dynamic rebalancing over the course of the shock events. The estimates of equity market shocks reflect a shock to all equity markets, domestic and global, of the same magnitude. The estimates of interest rate shocks reflect a shock to rates at all durations (a "parallel" shift in the yield curve). We regularly monitor and refine our hedge program targets in line with our primary goal of protecting regulatory and rating agency capital. It is possible that further changes to our hedge program will be made and those changes may either increase or decrease earnings sensitivity. Liabilities are based on U.S. GAAP reserves and embedded derivatives, with the latter excluding the effects of nonperformance risk. Deferred acquisition cost ("DAC") is amortized over estimated gross revenues, which we do not expect to be volatile. Volatility could be driven by loss recognition, however. Hedge Gain / (Loss) impacting the above estimated earnings sensitivity includes both the Variable Annuity Guarantee Hedge 

&#160; 

Program and the CHO program and assumes that hedge positions can be rebalanced during the market shock and that the performance of the derivative contracts reasonably matches the performance of the contract owners&#8217; variable fund returns. 

Actual results will differ from the estimates above for reasons such as variance in market volatility versus what is assumed, &#8216;basis risk&#8217; (differences in the performance of the derivative contracts versus the contract owner variable fund returns), changes in nonperformance spreads, equity shocks not occurring uniformly across all equity markets, combined effects of interest rates and equities, additional impacts from rebalancing of hedges, and/or the effects of time and changes in assumptions or methodology that affect reserves or hedge targets. Additionally, estimated net impact sensitivities vary over time as the market and closed block of business evolves, or if changes in assumptions or methodologies that affect reserves or hedge targets are refined. As the closed block of business evolves, actual net impacts are realized, or if changes are made to the target of the hedge program, the sensitivities may vary over time. Additionally, actual results will differ from the above due to issues such as basis risk, market volatility, changes in implied volatility, combined effects of interest rates and equities, rebalancing of hedges in the future, or the effects of time and other variations from the assumptions in the above table. 

In addition to equity market and interest rate changes, movements in other market variables that are not explicitly hedged can also cause U.S. GAAP earnings volatility. This includes changes in implied equity market volatility (implied from the market prices of equity options) that affects the valuation of our fair value liabilities. We do not fully hedge for equity implied volatility given that such hedging introduces volatility in our regulatory reserves and rating agency capital which are not as sensitive to this market variable. 

As of December 31, 2015 , the U.S. GAAP sensitivity (exclusive of our nonperformance spread) of the GMAB / GMWB and GMWBL liabilities to a 1 percentage point move in implied volatility was approximately $49 million , excluding the impact of hedge offsets. 

Hedging instruments 

&#8226; 

Guarantee Hedge . In order to mitigate equity risk associated with non-reinsured GMDBs and non-reinsured guaranteed living benefits, we enter into futures positions and total return swaps on various public market equity indices chosen to closely replicate contract owner variable fund returns. We also mitigate most of the foreign currency risk arising from its international fund exposure using forward contracts. We use market consistent valuation techniques to establish our derivative positions and to rebalance the derivative positions in response to market fluctuations. We also administer a hedge program that mitigates not only equity risk, but also the interest rate risk associated with our GMWB, GMWBL and GMAB riders. This component of the hedge primarily involves entering into interest rate swaps. 

&#8226; 

Capital Hedge Overlay . The Variable Annuity CHO program is an overlay to the Variable Annuity Guarantee Hedge Program that mitigates the impact of potential declines in markets and their impact on regulatory reserves and rating agency capital. The program&#8217;s hedge strategy involves using equity index derivatives, variance and credit default swaps.

Reinsurance. For contracts issued prior to January 1, 2000, most contracts with enhanced death benefit guarantees were reinsured to third-party reinsurers to mitigate the risk produced by such guaranteed death benefits. For contracts issued on or after January 1, 2000, the Company instituted a Variable Annuity Guarantee Hedge Program in lieu of reinsurance. We utilized indemnity reinsurance agreements prior to January 1, 2000 to reduce our exposure to large losses from GMDBs in our CBVA segment. Reinsurance permits recovery of a portion of losses from reinsurers, although it does not discharge our primary liability as direct insurer of the risks. We evaluate the financial strength of potential reinsurers and continually monitor the financial strength and 

credit ratings of our reinsurers. 

CBVA Risks and Risk Management 

The amounts ultimately due to policyholders under GMDB and guaranteed minimum living benefits, and the reserves required to support these liabilities, are driven by a variety of factors, including equity market performance, interest rate conditions, policyholder behavior, including exercise of various contract options, and policyholder mortality. We actively monitor each of these factors and implement a variety of risk management and financial management techniques to optimize the value of the block. Such techniques include hedging, use of affiliate reinsurance, external reinsurance, and experience studies. For more information on the reinsurance arrangements, see the Reinsurance Note in our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Market Risk Related to Equity Market Price and Interest Rates. Our variable products, FIA products and general account equity securities are significantly influenced by global equity markets. Increases or decreases in equity markets impact certain assets and liabilities related to our variable annuity products and our earnings derived from those products. Our variable products include variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance. A decrease in the equity markets may cause a decrease in the account values, thereby increasing the possibility that we may be required to pay amounts to contract owners due to guaranteed death and living benefits. An increase in the value of the equity markets may increase account values for these contracts, thereby decreasing our risk associated with guaranteed death and living benefits. 

We are also subject to interest rate risk in our CBVA segment, as a sustained decline in interest rates or a prolonged period of low interest rates may subject us to higher cost of guaranteed benefits and increased hedging costs. 

In addition, in scenarios of equity market declines, sustained periods of low interest rates, rapidly rising interest rates or credit spread widening, the amount of additional statutory reserves that an insurance subsidiary is required to hold for variable annuity guarantees may increase. This increase in reserves would decrease the statutory surplus available for use in calculating its RBC ratios. In addition, collateral posting requirements for the hedge program could also pressure liquidity. 

&#160; 

Periods of significant and sustained downturns in equity markets, increased equity volatility, reduced interest rates or a prolonged period of low interest rates could result in an increase in the valuation of the future policy benefit or account balance liabilities associated with such products, resulting in a reduction to net income (loss). Although a certain portion of our guaranteed benefits is reinsured or covered under our Variable Annuity Guarantee Hedge Program, for those guarantees not covered by these programs, we are exposed to the risk of increased costs and/or liabilities for benefits guaranteed in excess of account values during periods of adverse economic market conditions. Our risk management program is constantly re-evaluated to respond to changing market conditions and achieve the optimal balance and trade-offs among several important factors, including regulatory reserves, rating agency capital, RBC, earnings and other factors. A certain portion of these strategies could focus our emphasis on the protection of regulatory and rating agency capital, RBC, liquidity, earnings and other factors and less on the earnings impact of guarantees, resulting in materially lower or more volatile U.S. GAAP earnings in periods of changing equity market levels. While we believe that our risk management program is effective in balancing numerous critical metrics, we are subject to the risk that our strategies and other management procedures prove ineffective or that unexpected policyholder experience, combined with unfavorable market events, produces losses beyond the scope of the risk management strategies employed, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We are also subject to the risk that the cost of hedging these guaranteed minimum benefits increases as implied volatilities increase and/or interest rates decrease, resulting in adverse impact to net income (loss). 

Risk Related to Hedging. Our risk management program attempts to balance a number of important factors including regulatory reserves, rating agency capital, RBC, underlying economics, earnings and other factors. As discussed above, to reduce the risk associated with guaranteed living benefits, non-reinsured GMDB and fees related to these benefits, we enter derivative contracts on various public market indices chosen to closely replicate contract owner variable fund returns. 

The Company&#8217;s risk management program is constantly re-evaluated to respond to changing market conditions and manage trade-offs among capital preservation, earnings and underlying economics. 

Hedging instruments we use to manage risks might not perform as intended or expected, which could result in higher realized losses and unanticipated cash needs to collateralize or settle such transactions. Adverse market conditions can limit the availability and increase the costs of hedging instruments, and such costs may not be recovered in the pricing of the underlying products being hedged. In addition, hedging counterparties may fail to perform their obligations resulting in unhedged exposures and losses on positions that are not collateralized. 

Risk Related to Policyholder Behavior Assumptions. Our CBVA segment is subject to risks associated with the future behavior of policyholders and future claims payment patterns, using assumptions for mortality experience, lapse rates, GMIB annuitization rates and GMWBL withdrawal rates. We are required to make assumptions about these behaviors and patterns, which may not reflect the actual behaviors and patterns we experience in the future. It is possible that future assumption changes could produce reserve changes that could be material. Any such increase to reserves could require us to make material additional capital contributions to one or more of our insurance company subsidiaries or could otherwise be material and adverse to the results of operations or financial condition of the Company. 

In particular, we have only minimal experience regarding the long-term implications of policyholder behavior for our GMIB, and, as a result, future experience could lead to significant changes in our assumptions. Our GMIB contracts, most of which were issued during the period from 2004 to 2006, have a ten-year waiting period before annuitization is available. These contracts first become eligible to annuitize during the period from 2014 through 2016, but contain significant incentives to delay annuitization beyond the first eligibility date. In addition, during 2014 and 2015, we made two income enhancement offers to holders of particular series of GMIB contracts, under which policy holders were offered an incentive to annuitize prior to the end of the waiting period, and we have waived the remaining waiting period on these GMIB contracts. As a result, although we have increased experience on policyholder behavior for the first opportunity to annuitize, including from the acceptance rates of the income enhancement offers, we continue to have only a statistically small sample of experience used to set annuitization rates beyond the first eligibility date. Therefore, we anticipate that observable experience data will become statistically credible later in this decade, when a large volume of GMIB benefits begin to reach their maximum benefit over the four-year period from 2019 to 2022. 

Similarly, most of our GMWBL contracts are still in the first seven to nine policy years, so our assumptions for withdrawal from contracts with GMWBL benefits may change as experience emerges. In addition, many of our GMWBL contracts contain significant incentives to delay withdrawal. Our experience for GMWBL contracts has recently become more credible, however it is possible that policyholders may choose to withdraw sooner or later than the current best estimate assumes. We expect customer decisions on withdrawal will be influenced by their financial plans and needs as well as by interest rate and market conditions over time and by the availability and features of competing products. 

&#160; 

We also make estimates of expected lapse rates, which represent the probability that a policy will not remain in force from one period to the next, for contracts in the CBVA segment. Lapse rates of our variable annuity contracts may be significantly impacted by the value of guaranteed minimum benefits relative to the value of the underlying separate accounts (account value or account balance). In general, policies with guarantees that are "in the money" are assumed to be less likely to lapse. Conversely, "out of the money" guarantees are assumed to be more likely to lapse as the policyholder has less incentive to retain the policy. Lapse rates could also be adversely affected generally by developments that affect customer perception of us. 

Our variable annuity lapse rate experience has varied significantly over the period from 2006 to the present, reflecting among other factors, both pre-and post-financial crisis experience. Relative to our current expectations, actual lapse rates have generally demonstrated a declining trend over the period from 2006 to the present. We analyze actual experience over that entire period, as we believe that over the duration of the variable annuity policies we may experience the full range of policyholder behavior and market conditions. However, management&#8217;s current best estimate of variable annuity policyholder lapse behavior is weighted more heavily toward more recent experience, as the last three years of data have shown a more consistent trend of lapse behavior. Actual lapse rates that are lower than our lapse assumptions could have an adverse effect on profitability in the later years of a block of business because the anticipated claims experience may be higher than expected in these later years, and, as discussed above, future reserve increases in connection with experience updates could be material and adverse to the results of operations or financial condition of the Company. 

We review overall policyholder experience at least annually (including lapse, annuitization, withdrawal and mortality), and update these assumptions when deemed necessary based on additional information that becomes available. As customer experience continues to materialize, we may adjust our assumptions. We increased reserves in the fourth quarter of 2011 after a comprehensive review of our assumptions relating to lapses, mortality, annuitization of income benefits and utilization of withdrawal benefits. The review in 2011 included an analysis of a larger body of actual experience than was previously available, including a longer period with low equity markets and interest rates, which we believe provided greater insight into anticipated policyholder behavior for contracts that are in the money. This resulted in an increase of U.S. GAAP reserves of $741 million &#32;and gross U.S. statutory reserves of $2,776 million &#32;in the fourth quarter of 2011. 

In our most recent annual review of assumptions related to our CBVA contracts in the third quarter of 2015, annual assumption changes and revisions to projection model inputs implemented resulted in loss of $86.0 million. This $86.0 million loss included an unfavorable $43.0 million resulting from policyholder behavior assumption changes primarily related to an update to lapse assumptions, partially offset by a favorable $27.4 million resulting from changes to mortality assumptions. The loss also included an unfavorable $70.4 million as a result of updates we have made to other assumptions, principally relating to expected earned rates on certain investment options available to variable annuity contractholders, discount rates applicable to future cash flows from variable annuity contracts and long-term volatility. Annual assumption changes and revisions to projection model inputs implemented during 2014 resulted in a gain of $102.3 million (excluding a gain of $37.9 million due to changes in the technique used to estimate nonperformance risk). This $102.3 million gain included a favorable $170.2 million resulting from policyholder behavior assumption changes partially offset by an unfavorable $40.5 million resulting from changes to mortality assumptions. The gain from policyholder behavior assumption changes was primarily due to an update to the utilization assumption on GMWBL contracts, partially offset by an unfavorable result from an update to lapse assumptions. The 2013 result included a loss of $185.3 million (excluding a gain of $144.6 million due to changes in the technique used to estimate nonperformance risk) due to annual assumption changes. This $185.3 million loss included an unfavorable $117.9 million resulting from changes to mortality assumptions and unfavorable $85.5 million resulting from policyholder behavior assumption changes primarily related to an update to lapse assumptions. 

As discussed above, our recent changes in lapse assumptions moved our assumptions to be in line with lapse experience over the last three years. Also as described above, future reserve increases in connection with experience updates could be material and adverse to the results of operations or financial condition of the Company. 

We will continue to monitor the emergence of experience. If adjustments to policyholder behavior assumptions (e.g., lapse, annuitization and withdrawal) are necessary, which is ordinary course for interest-sensitive long-dated liabilities, we anticipate that the financial impact of such a change (either under U.S. GAAP or due to increases or decreases in gross U.S. statutory reserves) will likely be in a range, either up or down, that is generally consistent with the impact experienced in the past two years. 

Other Risks. Despite the closure of new product sales, some new policy amounts continue to be deposited as additional premium to existing contracts . Benefit designs do limit the attractiveness of additional premium, but in some cases these additional premiums may increase the guarantee available to the policyholder . The volume of additional premiums has diminished since we ceased new product sales in 2010 . 

&#160; 

On June 2, 2014 we entered into an agreement to outsource the actuarial valuation, modeling and hedging functions of our CBVA segment to Milliman, Inc. ("Milliman"). Under this agreement, Milliman performs the calculation of financial reporting and risk metrics, along with the analytics used to determine hedge positions. We will continue to oversee and manage the CBVA segment and retain full accountability for assumptions and methodologies, as well as the setting of the hedge objectives and the execution of hedge positions. This agreement allows us to create a more variable cost structure for the CBVA segment. 

Closed Block Other 

Closed Block Other includes a GIC and funding agreement spread lending business that is in run-off, as well as continuing obligations and assets connected with the group reinsurance and individual reinsurance businesses we sold between 2004 and 2009. 

Prior to 2009, we operated a spread lending business funded by a block of GICs and funding agreements. However, following the financial crisis in 2008, investor appetite for uncollateralized liabilities not rated "AAA" and collateralized funding became constrained causing funding spreads on new liabilities to widen. We shifted the focus of the business strategy from growing assets and earnings to running off the business over time. As of December 31, 2015 , remaining assets in the GICs and funding agreements portfolio had an amortized cost of $1.2 billion , down from a peak of $14.3 billion &#32;in 2008. We continue to reduce the block by allowing the assets and liabilities to mature or by finding opportunities to sell assets at prices deemed attractive. New liability contracts may be issued from time to time or be terminated early in order to better match the run-off of the asset portfolio. As the business is in run-off, it is actively managed to limit liquidity risk and capital requirements. 

In addition, we wrote super senior credit default swap ("CDS") contracts of which, as of December 31, 2015 , approximately $1 billion &#32;of notional amount remained outstanding. 

Effective January 2009, we sold our group reinsurance business, ING Reinsurance U.S., to RGA. The transaction was accounted for as a reinsurance transaction. To effect this sale, we entered into coinsurance agreements with various subsidiaries of RGA. Between 2004 and 2009, we entered into several reinsurance transactions with Scottish Re and Hannover Re pursuant to which we ceded all liabilities related to our individual life reinsurance block. In 2015, we divested of, via reinsurance, an in-force block of retained group reinsurance policies, backed by approximately $290 million of statutory reserves to a third party reinsurer. For more information on these reinsurance arrangements, see the Reinsurance &#32; Note in our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. &#32;in this Annual Report on Form 10-K &#32;and in " Item 7. &#32; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Reinsurance" below. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 7,000 &#32;employees, with most working in one of our ten major sites in nine states. 

REGULATION 

Our operations and businesses are subject to a significant number of Federal and state laws, regulations, administrative determinations and similar legal constraints. Such laws and regulations are generally designed to protect our policyholders, contract owners and other customers and not our stockholders or holders of our other securities. Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject are regularly re-examined and existing or future laws and regulations may become more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations. Following is a description of certain legal and regulatory frameworks to which we or our subsidiaries are or may be subject. 

We are a holding company for all of our business operations, which we conduct through our subsidiaries. We, as an insurance holding company, are not licensed as an insurer, investment advisor, broker-dealer, or other regulated entity. However, because we own regulated insurers, we are subject to regulation as an insurance holding company. 

Insurance Regulation 

Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision under U.S. state and federal laws. Each U.S. state, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories and possessions have insurance laws that apply to companies licensed to carry on an insurance business in the jurisdiction. The primary regulator of an insurance company, however, is located in its state of domicile. Each of our insurance subsidiaries is licensed and regulated in each state where it conducts insurance business. 

&#160; 

State insurance regulators have broad administrative powers with respect to all aspects of the insurance business including: licensing to transact business, licensing agents, admittance of assets to statutory surplus, regulating premium rates for certain insurance products, approving policy forms, regulating unfair trade and claims practices, establishing reserve requirements and solvency standards, establishing credit for reinsurance requirements, fixing maximum interest rates on life insurance policy loans and minimum accumulation or surrender values and other matters. State insurance laws and regulations include numerous provisions governing the marketplace conduct of insurers, including provisions governing the form and content of disclosures to consumers, product illustrations, advertising, product replacement, suitability, sales and underwriting practices, complaint handling and claims handling. State regulators enforce these provisions through periodic market conduct examinations. State insurance laws and regulations regulating affiliate transactions, the payment of dividends and change of control transactions are discussed in greater detail below. 

Our four principal insurance subsidiaries (SLD, VRIAC, VIAC and RLI, and collectively, the "Principal Insurance Subsidiaries") are domiciled in Colorado, Connecticut, Iowa and Minnesota, respectively. Our other U.S. insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in Indiana and New York. Our insurance subsidiaries domiciled in Colorado, Connecticut, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota and New York are collectively referred to as "our insurance subsidiaries" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for purposes of discussions of U.S. insurance regulatory matters. In addition, we have special purpose life reinsurance captive insurance company subsidiaries domiciled in Missouri that provide reinsurance to our insurance subsidiaries in order to facilitate the financing of statutory reserve requirements associated with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") Model Regulation entitled "Valuation of Life Insurance Policies" (commonly known as "Regulation XXX" or "XXX"), or NAIC Actuarial Guideline 38 (commonly known as "AG38" or "AXXX"), and to fund statutory Stable Value reserves in excess of the economic reserve level. Our special purpose life reinsurance captive insurance company subsidiaries domiciled in Missouri are collectively referred to as "captive reinsurance subsidiaries" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For more information on our use of captive reinsurance structures, see " Item 7. &#32; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Credit Facilities and Subsidiary Credit Support Arrangements". We also have a captive reinsurance subsidiary domiciled in Arizona that primarily provides reinsurance to our insurance subsidiaries. Our captive reinsurance subsidiary domiciled in Arizona is referred to as "our Arizona captive" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K . 

State insurance laws and regulations require our insurance subsidiaries to file financial statements with state insurance regulators everywhere they are licensed and the operations of our insurance subsidiaries and accounts are subject to examination by those regulators at any time. Our insurance subsidiaries prepare statutory financial statements in accordance with accounting practices and procedures prescribed or permitted by these regulators. The NAIC has approved a series of uniform statutory accounting principles ("SAP") that have been adopted, in some cases with minor modifications, by all state insurance regulators. 

As a basis of accounting, SAP was developed to monitor and regulate the solvency of insurance companies. In developing SAP, insurance regulators were primarily concerned with assuring an insurer&#8217;s ability to pay all its current and future obligations to policyholders. As a result, statutory accounting focuses on conservatively valuing the assets and liabilities of insurers, generally in accordance with standards specified by the insurer&#8217;s domiciliary state. The values for assets, liabilities and equity reflected in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP are usually different from those reflected in financial statements prepared under SAP. 

The insurance laws and regulations of the State of Missouri, which govern our captive reinsurance subsidiaries, require such entities to file financial statements with the Missouri Insurance Department, including statutory financial statements. The insurance laws and regulations of the State of Arizona, which govern our Arizona captive, require that entity to file financial statements with the Arizona Department of Insurance ("ADOI") and permit the filing of such financial statements on either a statutory basis or a U.S. GAAP basis. The ADOI has agreed to permit our Arizona captive to prepare its financial statements on a U.S. GAAP basis, modified for certain prescribed practices outlined in the Arizona insurance statutes. In addition, our Arizona captive obtained approval from the ADOI for certain permitted practices, including taking reinsurance credit for certain ceded reserves where the trust assets backing the liabilities are held by one of our wholly owned insurance companies. Our Arizona captive has recorded a receivable for these assets held in trust by its affiliate. 

State insurance regulators conduct periodic financial examinations of the books, records, accounts and business practices of insurers domiciled in their states, generally every three to five years. Financial examinations are generally carried out in cooperation with the insurance regulators of other states under guidelines promulgated by the NAIC. State and federal insurance and securities regulatory authorities and other state law enforcement agencies and attorneys general also from time to time make inquiries and conduct examinations or investigations regarding the compliance by our company, as well as other companies in our industry, with, among other things, insurance laws and securities laws. 

&#160; 

Our captive reinsurance subsidiaries and our Arizona captive are subject to periodic financial examinations by their respective domiciliary state insurance regulators. 

Captive Reinsurer Regulation 

State insurance regulators, the NAIC and other regulatory bodies are also investigating the use of affiliated captive reinsurers and offshore entities to reinsure insurance risks, and the NAIC has made recent advances in captives reform. 

In June 2014, the NAIC adopted a new regulatory framework for captives assuming business governed by Regulations XXX or AXXX, called the "Rector Framework". In December 2014, the NAIC adopted Actuarial Guideline 48 ("AG48") which established a new regulatory requirement applicable to XXX and AG38 reserves ceded to reinsurers, including affiliated reinsurers, as the first step in implementing the Rector framework. AG48 limits the type of assets that may be used as collateral to cover the XXX and AG38 statutory reserves and is applied prospectively to existing reinsurance transactions that reinsure policies issued on or after January 1, 2015 and new reinsurance transactions entered into on or after January 1, 2015. The NAIC has charged multiple working groups with the responsibility to prepare regulations that would codify the Rector framework and that work continues at the NAIC. In 2014, the NAIC also considered a proposal to require states to apply NAIC accreditation standards, applicable to traditional insurers, to captive reinsurers. In 2015, the NAIC adopted such a proposal, in the form of a revised preamble to the NAIC accreditation standards (the "Standard"), with an effective date of January 1, 2016 for application of the Standard to captives that assume XXX or AXXX business. Under the Standard, a state will be deemed in compliance as it relates to XXX or AXXX captives if the applicable reinsurance transaction satisfies AG48. In addition, the Standard applies prospectively, so that XXX or AXXX captives will not be subject to the Standard if reinsured policies were issued prior to January 1, 2015 and ceded so that they were part of a reinsurance arrangement as of December 31, 2014. The NAIC left for future action application of the Standard to captives that assume variable annuity business. As drafted, it appears that the Standard would apply to our Arizona captive. 

During 2015, the NAIC Financial Conditions (E) Committee (the "E Committee") established the Variable Annuities Issues (E) Working Group ("VAIWG") to oversee the NAIC's effort's to study and address, as appropriate, regulatory issues resulting in variable annuity captive reinsurance transactions. The VAIWG retained Oliver Wyman to study the industry's use of variable annuity captive reinsurance and to develop a set of recommended changes to address the issues involving variable annuity captives. In September 2015, Oliver Wyman issued an initial report, which was adopted by the VAIWG, outlining its preliminary findings and making recommendations for enhancements to the variable annuity statutory framework. In November 2015, upon the recommendation of the VAIWG, the E Committee adopted a Variable Annuities Framework for Change (the "VA Framework for Change") which recommends charges for NAIC working groups to adjust the variable annuity statutory framework applicable to all insurers that have written or are writing variable annuity business. The VA Framework for Change contemplates a holistic set of reforms that would improve the current reserve and capital framework and address root cause issues that result in the use of captive arrangements. Although the VA Framework for Change recommends an effective date of January 1, 2017, the timing of these proposals remains uncertain. In November 2015, the NAIC also approved funding for a quantitative impact study, to be conducted by Oliver Wyman and involving industry participants including the Company, of various reforms outlined in the VA Framework for Change (the "QIS Study"). 

We cannot predict what revisions, if any, will be made to the Rector framework or the Standard for application to captives that assume XXX or AXXX business, as multiple NAIC working groups undertake their implementation, to the VA Framework for Change proposal as a result of the QIS Study and ongoing NAIC deliberations, or to the Standard, if adopted for variable annuity captives. It is also unclear whether these or other proposals will be adopted by the NAIC, or what additional actions and regulatory changes will result from the continued captives scrutiny and reform efforts by the NAIC and other regulatory bodies. Like many life insurance companies, we utilize captive reinsurers to satisfy certain reserve requirements related to certain of our policies. If state insurance regulators determine to restrict our use of captive reinsurers, it could require us to increase statutory reserves, incur higher operating or tax costs or reduce sales. See "Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Regulation&#8212;Our insurance businesses are heavily regulated, and changes in regulation in the United States, enforcement actions and regulatory investigations may reduce profitability". 

Insurance Holding Company Regulation 

Voya Financial, Inc. and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to the insurance holding companies laws of the states in which such insurance subsidiaries are domiciled. These laws generally require each insurance company directly or indirectly owned by the holding company to register with the insurance regulator in the insurance company&#8217;s state of domicile and to furnish annually financial and other information about the operations of companies within the holding company system. Generally, all transactions affecting the insurers in the holding company system must be fair and reasonable and, if material, require prior notice and approval 

&#160; 

or non-disapproval by the state&#8217;s insurance regulator. Our captive reinsurance subsidiaries and our Arizona captive are not subject to insurance holding company laws. 

Change of Control . State insurance holding company regulations generally provide that no person, corporation or other entity may acquire control of an insurance company, or a controlling interest in any parent company of an insurance company, without the prior approval of such insurance company&#8217;s domiciliary state insurance regulator. Under the laws of each of the domiciliary states of our insurance subsidiaries, any person acquiring, directly or indirectly, 10% &#32;or more of the voting securities of an insurance company is presumed to have acquired "control" of the company. This statutory presumption of control may be rebutted by a showing that control does not exist in fact. The state insurance regulators, however, may find that "control" exists in circumstances in which a person owns or controls less than 10% &#32;of voting securities. 

To obtain approval of any change in control, the proposed acquirer must file with the applicable insurance regulator an application disclosing, among other information, its background, financial condition, the financial condition of its affiliates, the source and amount of funds by which it will effect the acquisition, the criteria used in determining the nature and amount of consideration to be paid for the acquisition, proposed changes in the management and operations of the insurance company and other related matters. 

Any purchaser of shares of common stock representing 10% &#32;or more of the voting power of our capital stock will be presumed to have acquired control of our insurance subsidiaries unless, following application by that purchaser in each insurance subsidiary&#8217;s state of domicile, the relevant insurance commissioner determines otherwise. 

The licensing orders governing our captive reinsurance subsidiaries provide that any change of control requires the approval of such company&#8217;s domiciliary state insurance regulator. For our Arizona captive, a change of control requires the approval of the ADOI. Although our captive reinsurance subsidiaries and our Arizona captive are not subject to insurance holding company laws, their domiciliary state insurance regulators may use all or a part of the holding company law framework described above in determining whether to approve a proposed change of control. 

NAIC Amendments. In 2010, the NAIC adopted significant changes to the insurance holding company model act and regulations (the "NAIC Amendments") . The NAIC Amendments include a requirement that an insurance holding company system&#8217;s ultimate controlling person submit annually to its lead state insurance regulator an "enterprise risk report" that identifies activities, circumstances or events involving one or more affiliates of an insurer that, if not remedied properly, are likely to have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition or liquidity of the insurer or its insurance holding company system as a whole . The NAIC Amendments also include a provision requiring a controlling person to submit prior notice to its domiciliary insurance regulator of a divestiture of control . Each of the states of domicile for our insurance subsidiaries has adopted its version of the NAIC Amendments. 

In addition, the NAIC has proposed a "Solvency Modernization Initiative" which focuses on: (1) capital requirements; (2) corporate governance and risk management; (3) group supervision; (4) statutory accounting and financial reporting; and (5) reinsurance . This initiative has resulted in the adoption by the NAIC in September 2012 of the Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Model Act ("ORSA"), which has been enacted by our insurance subsidiaries&#8217; domiciliary states. ORSA requires that insurers maintain a risk management framework and conduct an internal own risk and solvency assessment of the insurer&#8217;s material risks in normal and stressed environments. The assessment must be documented in a confidential annual summary report, a copy of which must be made available to regulators as required or upon request. Voya Financial prepared and submitted its first ORSA summary report in 2015. This initiative also resulted in the adoption by the NAIC in August 2014 of the Corporate Governance Annual Filing Model Act, which requires insurers to make an annual confidential filing regarding their corporate governance policies. This new model has been enacted by one of our insurance subsidiaries' domiciliary regulator and the first filing must be made in 2016. 

Dividend Payment Restrictions. As a holding company with no significant business operations of our own, we will depend on dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries as the principal source of cash to meet our obligations, including the payment of interest on, and repayment of principal of, our outstanding debt obligations . The states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled impose certain restrictions on such subsidiaries&#8217; ability to pay dividends to us . These restrictions are based in part on the prior year&#8217;s statutory income and surplus . In general, dividends up to specified levels are considered ordinary and may be paid without prior approval . Dividends in larger amounts, or extraordinary dividends, are subject to approval by the insurance commissioner of the state of domicile of the insurance subsidiary proposing to pay the dividend . &#32;In addition, under the insurance laws applicable to our insurance subsidiaries domiciled in the states of Connecticut, Iowa and Minnesota, no dividend or other distribution exceeding an amount equal to an insurance company's earned surplus may be paid without the domiciliary insurance regulator's prior approval (the "positive earned surplus requirement"). 

&#160; 

Our captive reinsurance subsidiaries may not declare or pay dividends in any form to us other than in accordance with their respective insurance securitization transaction agreements and their respective governing licensing orders. Likewise, our Arizona captive may not declare or pay dividends in any form to us other than in accordance with its annual capital and dividend plan as approved by the ADOI which includes a minimum capital requirement. In addition, in no event may the dividends decrease the capital of the captive below the minimum capital requirement applicable to it, and, after giving effect to the dividends, the assets of the captive paying the dividend must be sufficient to satisfy its domiciliary insurance regulator that it can meet its obligations. 

Approval by a captive&#8217;s domiciliary insurance regulator of an ongoing plan for the payment of dividends or other distribution is conditioned upon the retention, at the time of each payment, of capital or surplus equal to or in excess of amounts specified by, or determined in accordance with formulas approved for the captive by its domiciliary insurance regulator. 

In March and April of 2013, in connection with our IPO recapitalization activities, our Principal Insurance Subsidiaries received approvals or notices of non-objection, as the case may be, from their respective domiciliary regulators to make extraordinary distributions to Voya Financial, Inc. or Voya Holdings Inc. (our subsidiary that is also a holding company) in the aggregate amount of $1,434.0 million. These distributions were paid on May 8, 2013, the day following completion of our IPO. 

Prior to our IPO, our Principal Insurance Subsidiaries domiciled in Colorado, Iowa and Minnesota each had negative earned surplus accounts, and therefore did not have capacity to make ordinary dividend payments without regulatory approval. In order to obtain dividends or distributions from these insurance companies, we historically obtained approval from the insurance companies&#8217; respective state regulators, which could be granted or withheld at the regulators&#8217; discretion, for extraordinary dividends or distributions. On May 8, 2013, in connection with the completion of our IPO and payment of $1,434.0 million of extraordinary distributions, these insurance companies each were permitted to reset their respective negative unassigned funds account as of December 31, 2012 (as reported in their respective 2012 statutory annual statements) to zero (with an offsetting reduction in gross paid-in capital and contributed surplus). These resets were made pursuant to permitted practices in accordance with statutory accounting practices granted by their respective domiciliary insurance regulators. 

This reset allowed our Principal Insurance Subsidiaries domiciled in Colorado, Iowa and Minnesota to more readily build up ordinary dividend capacity to the extent their operating results subsequent to December 31, 2012 generated positive earned surplus. Based on legislative amendments adopted by the Colorado legislature in 2014, from and after July 1, 2014, our insurance subsidiary domiciled in Colorado is no longer subject to the positive earned surplus requirement, although it did generate sufficient positive earned surplus to pay an ordinary dividend in 2014. Under applicable domiciliary insurance regulations, our Principal Insurance Subsidiaries must deduct any distributions or dividends paid in the preceding twelve months in calculating dividend capacity. 

Our Principal Insurance Subsidiaries domiciled in Iowa and Minnesota had sufficient positive earned surplus to pay ordinary dividends in 2014 and 2015. VRIAC had ordinary dividend capacity in December 2013 and also in 2014 and 2015. In 2015, our Principal Insurance Subsidiaries domiciled in Colorado, Iowa and Minnesota generated capital in excess of our target combined RBC ratio of 425% &#32;and our individual insurance company ordinary dividend limits, and they sought and received domiciliary insurance regulatory approval for, and paid, extraordinary distributions in the aggregate amount of $508.0 million. Our Principal Insurance Subsidiaries domiciled in Colorado, Connecticut and Iowa each have ordinary dividend capacity for 2016. However, as a result of the extraordinary dividend it paid in 2015, our Principal Insurance Subsidiary domiciled in Minnesota currently has negative earned surplus and therefore does not have capacity at this time to make ordinary dividend payments to Voya Holdings without domiciliary insurance regulatory approval which can be granted or withheld in the discretion of the regulator. 

If any of our Principal Insurance Subsidiaries do not succeed in building up sufficient positive earned surplus to have ordinary dividend capacity in future years, such subsidiary would be unable to pay dividends or distributions to our holding companies absent prior approval of our domiciliary insurance regulators, which can be granted or withheld in the discretion of the regulator. In addition, if our Principal Insurance Subsidiaries generate capital in excess of our target combined estimated RBC ratio of 425% &#32;and our individual insurance company ordinary dividend limits in future years, then we may also seek extraordinary dividends or distributions. There can be no assurance that our Principal Insurance Subsidiaries will receive approval for extraordinary distribution payments in the future. 

See " Item 7. &#32; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Restrictions on Dividends and Returns of Capital from Subsidiaries" for a discussion of dividends and distributions from our insurance subsidiaries. 

&#160; 

Financial Regulation 

Policy and Contract Reserve Sufficiency Analysis. Under the laws and regulations of their states of domicile, our insurance subsidiaries are required to conduct annual analyses of the sufficiency of their life and annuity statutory reserves . Other jurisdictions in which these subsidiaries are licensed may have certain reserve requirements that differ from those of their domiciliary jurisdictions . In each case, a qualified actuary must submit an opinion that states that the aggregate statutory reserves, when considered in light of the assets held with respect to such reserves, are sufficient to meet the insurer&#8217;s contractual obligations and related expenses . If such an opinion cannot be rendered, the affected insurer must set up additional statutory reserves by moving funds from available statutory surplus . Our insurance subsidiaries submit these opinions annually to applicable insurance regulatory authorities. 

Recent actions by the NAIC . The NAIC has begun a process of redefining the reserve methodology for certain of our insurance liabilities under a framework known as Principles-Based Reserving ("PBR"). Under PBR, an insurer&#8217;s reserves are still required to be conservative, since a primary focus of SAP is the protection of policyholders, however, greater credence is given to the insurer&#8217;s realized past experience and anticipated future experience as well as to current economic conditions. An important part of the PBR framework was the adoption of AG43 as of December 31, 2009 for variable annuity guaranteed benefits. Another significant development was the adoption of the new Valuation Manual ("VM"), which defines PBR for life insurance policies. The full NAIC membership adopted the new VM in December 2012. The model law that enables the new VM will become effective on the January 1st after it has been adopted by at least 42 &#32;of the 55 &#32;jurisdictions that make up the NAIC, with the further provision that the 42 &#32;adopting jurisdictions must also account for 75% &#32;of the premium by U.S. life insurance companies (measured as of 2008). The new VM is expected to become effective no earlier than January 1, 2017, and we anticipate that its provisions will require us to make changes to certain of our term and universal life insurance policies, in particular, those policies with guaranteed features and may result in more volatility in our financial results given the greater weight it places on current economic conditions. 

Surplus and Capital Requirements. Insurance regulators have the discretionary authority, in connection with the ongoing licensing of our insurance subsidiaries, to limit or prohibit the ability of an insurer to issue new policies if, in the regulators&#8217; judgment, the insurer is not maintaining a minimum amount of surplus or is in hazardous financial condition. Insurance regulators may also limit the ability of an insurer to issue new life insurance policies and annuity contracts above an amount based upon the face amount and premiums of policies of a similar type issued in the prior year. We do not currently believe that the current or anticipated levels of statutory surplus of our insurance subsidiaries present a material risk that any such regulator would limit the amount of new policies that our Principal Insurance Subsidiaries may issue. 

Risk-Based Capital. The NAIC has adopted RBC requirements for life, health and property and casualty insurance companies . The requirements provide a method for analyzing the minimum amount of adjusted capital (statutory capital and surplus plus other adjustments) appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations, taking into account the risk characteristics of the company&#8217;s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items . State insurance regulators use the RBC requirements as an early warning tool to identify possibly inadequately capitalized insurers . An insurance company found to have insufficient statutory capital based on its RBC ratio may be subject to varying levels of additional regulatory oversight depending on the level of capital inadequacy . As of December 31, 2015 , the RBC of each of our insurance subsidiaries exceeded statutory minimum RBC levels that would require any regulatory or corrective action. 

The NAIC is currently working with the American Academy of Actuaries as they consider possible updates to the asset factors that are used to calculate the RBC requirements for investment portfolio assets. The NAIC review may lead to an expansion in the number of NAIC asset class categories for factor-based RBC requirements and the adoption of new factors, which could increase capital requirements on some securities and decrease capital requirements on others. We cannot predict what, if any, changes may result from this review or their potential impact on the RBC ratios of our insurance subsidiaries that are subject to RBC requirements. We will continue to monitor developments in this area. 

IRIS Tests. The NAIC has developed a set of financial relationships or tests known as the Insurance Regulatory Information System ("IRIS") to assist state regulators in monitoring the financial condition of U.S. insurance companies and identifying companies requiring special attention or action. For IRIS ratio purposes, our Principal Insurance Subsidiaries submit data to the NAIC on an annual basis. The NAIC analyzes this data using prescribed financial data ratios. A ratio falling outside the prescribed "usual range" is not considered a failing result. Rather, unusual values are viewed as part of the regulatory early monitoring system. In many cases, it is not unusual for financially sound companies to have one or more ratios that fall outside the usual range. 

Regulators typically investigate or monitor an insurance company if its IRIS ratios fall outside the prescribed usual range for four or more of the ratios, but each state has the right to inquire about any ratios falling outside the usual range . The inquiries made by state insurance regulators into an insurance company&#8217;s IRIS ratios can take various forms . 

&#160; 

Management does not anticipate regulatory action as a result of the 2015 &#32;IRIS ratio results. In all instances in prior years, regulators have been satisfied upon follow-up that no regulatory action was required. It is possible that similar results may not occur in the future. 

Insurance Guaranty Associations . Each state has insurance guaranty association laws that require insurance companies doing business in the state to participate in various types of guaranty associations or other similar arrangements. The laws are designed to protect policyholders from losses under insurance policies issued by insurance companies that become impaired or insolvent. Typically, these associations levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on member insurers on the basis of the member insurer&#8217;s proportionate share of the business in the relevant jurisdiction in the lines of business in which the impaired or insolvent insurer is engaged. Some jurisdictions permit member insurers to recover assessments that they paid through full or partial premium tax offsets, usually over a period of years. 

Marketing and Sales 

State insurance regulators are becoming more active in adopting and enforcing suitability standards with respect to sales of fixed, indexed and variable annuities. In particular, the NAIC has adopted a revised Suitability in Annuity Transactions Model Regulation ("SAT"), which will, if enacted by the states, place new responsibilities upon issuing insurance companies with respect to the suitability of annuity sales, including responsibilities for training agents. Several states have already enacted laws based on the SAT. 

Securities Regulation Affecting Insurance Operations 

Certain of our insurance subsidiaries sell variable life insurance and variable annuities that are registered with and regulated by the SEC as securities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). These products are issued through separate accounts that are registered as investment companies under the Investment Company Act, and are regulated by state law. Each separate account is generally divided into sub-accounts, each of which invests in an underlying mutual fund which is itself a registered investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Investment Company Act"). Our mutual funds, and in certain states, our variable life insurance and variable annuity products, are subject to filing and other requirements under state securities laws. Federal and state securities laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investors and generally grant broad rulemaking and enforcement powers to regulatory agencies. 

Federal Initiatives Affecting Insurance Operations 

The U.S. federal government generally does not directly regulate the insurance business. However, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act") established the Federal Stability Oversight Council ("FSOC"), which is authorized to designate non-bank financial companies as systemically significant and accordingly subject such companies to regulation and supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve") if the FSOC determines that material financial distress at the company or the scope of the company&#8217;s activities could pose a threat to the financial stability of the U.S. See " &#8212;Financial Reform Legislation and Initiatives&#8211;Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act " below. 

The Dodd-Frank Act also established FIO within the United States Department of the Treasury ("Treasury Department"). While not having a general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance, the director of this office performs various functions with respect to insurance, including serving as a non-voting member of the FSOC, making recommendations to the FSOC regarding insurers to be designated for more stringent regulation as a non-bank financial entity supervised by the Federal Reserve and representing the U.S. in the negotiation of international insurance agreements with foreign insurance regulators. The Dodd-Frank Act also required the director of FIO to conduct a study on how to modernize and improve the system of insurance regulation in the United States. The director issued that report in December 2013, recommending increased federal involvement in certain areas of insurance regulation to improve uniformity, and setting out recommendations in areas of near-term reform for the states, including capital and marketplace oversight. The report also recommended that states develop a uniform and transparent solvency oversight regime for the transfer of risk to reinsurance captives, and adopt a uniform capital requirement for reinsurance captives, including a prohibition on transactions that do not constitute legitimate risk transfer. FIO has an ongoing charge to monitor all aspects of the insurance industry and will monitor state regulatory developments, including those called for in its modernization report and present options for federal involvement if deemed necessary. 

Federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas can significantly and adversely affect insurance companies. These areas include federal health care regulation, pension regulation, financial services regulation, federal tax laws relating to life 

&#160; 

insurance companies and their products and the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the "Patriot Act") requiring, among other things, the establishment of anti-money laundering monitoring programs. 

In this regard, from time to time, federal measures are proposed which may significantly affect the insurance business, including measures that would limit antitrust immunity, change the tax treatment of insurance products relative to other financial products, simplify tax-advantaged or tax-exempt savings and retirement vehicles, restructure the corporate income tax provisions, or modify or eliminate the estate tax as well as proposals related to an optional federal charter for insurance companies. In addition, various forms of direct federal regulation of insurance have been proposed in recent years. 

Regulation of Investment and Retirement Products and Services 

Our investment, asset management and retirement products and services are subject to federal and state tax, securities, fiduciary (including the Employment Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA")), insurance and other laws and regulations. The SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA"), the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC"), state securities commissions, state banking and insurance departments and the Department of Labor ("DOL") and the Treasury Department are the principal regulators that regulate these products and services. The Dodd-Frank Act may also impact our investment, asset management, retirement and securities operations. See "&#8212;Financial Reform Legislation and Initiatives&#8212;Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act" below. 

Federal and state securities laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investors in the securities markets and generally grant regulatory agencies broad enforcement and rulemaking powers, including the power to limit or restrict the conduct of business in the event of non-compliance with such laws and regulations. Federal and state securities regulatory authorities and FINRA from time to time make inquiries and conduct examinations regarding compliance by us and our subsidiaries with securities and other laws and regulations. 

Securities Regulation with Respect to Certain Insurance and Investment Products and Services 

Our variable life insurance, variable annuity and mutual fund products are generally "securities" within the meaning of, and registered under, the federal securities laws, and are subject to regulation by the SEC and FINRA. Our mutual funds, and in certain states our variable life insurance and variable annuity products, are also "securities" within the meaning of state securities laws. As securities, these products are subject to filing and certain other requirements. Sales activities with respect to these products are generally subject to state securities regulation, which may affect investment advice, sales and related activities for these products. 

Some of our subsidiaries issue certain fixed and indexed annuities supported by the company&#8217;s general account and/or variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies through the company&#8217;s separate accounts. These subsidiaries and their activities in offering and selling variable insurance and annuity products are subject to extensive regulation under the federal securities laws administered by the SEC. Some of our separate accounts, as well as mutual funds that we sponsor, are registered as investment companies under the Investment Company Act, and the units or shares, as applicable, of certain of these investment companies are qualified for sale in some or all states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Each registered separate account is generally divided into sub-accounts, each of which invests in an underlying mutual fund, which is itself a registered investment company under the Investment Company Act. In addition, the variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies issued by the separate accounts and certain fixed and indexed annuities supported by some of our insurance subsidiaries&#8217; general accounts, as well as mutual funds we sponsor, are registered with the SEC under the Securities Act. Certain variable contract separate accounts sponsored by our insurance subsidiaries are exempt from registration, but may be subject to other provisions of the federal securities laws. 

Broker-Dealers and Investment Advisers 

Our securities operations, principally conducted by a number of SEC-registered broker-dealers, are subject to federal and state securities, commodities and related laws, and are regulated principally by the SEC, the CFTC, state securities authorities, FINRA, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board and similar authorities. Agents and employees registered or associated with any of our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") and to regulation and examination by the SEC, FINRA and state securities commissioners. The SEC and other governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations, as well as state securities commissions in the United States, have the power to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fines, cease-and-desist orders or suspension, termination or limitation of the activities of the regulated entity or its employees. 

&#160; 

Broker-dealers are subject to regulations that cover many aspects of the securities business, including, among other things, sales methods and trading practices, the suitability of investments for individual customers, the use and safekeeping of customers&#8217; funds and securities, capital adequacy, recordkeeping, financial reporting and the conduct of directors, officers and employees. The federal securities laws may also require, upon a change in control, re-approval by shareholders in registered investment companies of the investment advisory contracts governing management of those investment companies, including mutual funds included in annuity products. Investment advisory clients may also need to approve, or consent to, investment advisory agreements upon a change in control. In addition, broker-dealers are required to make certain monthly and annual filings with FINRA, including monthly FOCUS reports (which include, among other things, financial results and net capital calculations) and annual audited financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC is authorized to establish a standard of conduct applicable to brokers and dealers whereby they would be required to act in the best interest of the customer without regard to the financial or other interest of the broker or dealer when providing personalized investment advice to retail and other customers. A January 2011 SEC study acknowledges that the offering of proprietary products would not be a per se violation of any such standard of care and that broker-dealers selling proprietary or a limited range of products could be permitted to make certain disclosures about their limited product offerings and obtain customer consents or acknowledgments. The SEC has not yet decided whether to propose rules creating a uniform standard of conduct applicable to broker-dealers and investment advisors. 

As registered broker-dealers and members of various self-regulatory organizations, our registered broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the SEC&#8217;s Uniform Net Capital Rule, which specifies the minimum level of net capital a broker-dealer is required to maintain and requires a minimum part of its assets to be kept in relatively liquid form. These net capital requirements are designed to measure the financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. The uniform net capital rule imposes certain requirements that may have the effect of preventing a broker-dealer from distributing or withdrawing capital and may require that prior notice to the regulators be provided prior to making capital withdrawals. Certain of our broker-dealers are also subject to the net capital requirements of the CFTC and the various securities and commodities exchanges of which they are members. Compliance with net capital requirements could limit operations that require the intensive use of capital, such as trading activities and underwriting, and may limit the ability of our broker-dealer subsidiaries to pay dividends to us. 

Some of our subsidiaries are registered as investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the "Investment Advisers Act") and provide advice to registered investment companies, including mutual funds used in our annuity products, as well as an array of other institutional and retail clients. The Investment Advisers Act and Investment Company Act may require that fund shareholders be asked to approve new investment advisory contracts with respect to those registered investment companies upon a change in control of a fund&#8217;s adviser. Likewise, the Investment Advisers Act may require that other clients consent to the continuance of the advisory contract upon a change in control of the adviser. Further, proposals have been made that the SEC establish a self-regulatory organization with respect to registered investment advisers, which could increase the level of regulatory oversight over such investment advisers. 

The commodity futures and commodity options industry in the United States is subject to regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936, as amended (the "Commodity Exchange Act"). The CFTC is charged with the administration of the Commodity Exchange Act and the regulations adopted under that Act. Some of our subsidiaries are registered with the CFTC as commodity pool operators and commodity trading advisors. Our futures business is also regulated by the National Futures Association. 

Employee Retirement Income Security Act Considerations 

ERISA is a comprehensive federal statute that applies to U.S. employee benefit plans sponsored by private employers and labor unions. Plans subject to ERISA include pension and profit sharing plans and welfare plans, including health, life and disability plans. Among other things, ERISA imposes reporting and disclosure obligations, prescribes standards of conduct that apply to plan fiduciaries and prohibits transactions known as "prohibited transactions," such as conflict-of-interest transactions, self-dealing and certain transactions between a benefit plan and a party in interest. ERISA also provides for a scheme of civil and criminal penalties and enforcement. Our insurance, investment management and retirement businesses provide services to employee benefit plans subject to ERISA, including limited services under specific contract where we may act as an ERISA fiduciary. We are also subject to ERISA&#8217;s prohibited transaction rules for transactions with ERISA plans, which may affect our ability to, or the terms upon which we may, enter into transactions with those plans, even in businesses unrelated to those giving rise to party in interest status. The applicable provisions of ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code are subject to enforcement by the DOL, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") and the U.S. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC"). 

In April 2015, the DOL published a proposed rule that would broaden the definition of "fiduciary" under ERISA and for other purposes. The proposal was subject to public comment and we submitted a comment letter to the DOL on July 16, 2015, expressing 

&#160; 

our views on the proposed rule and participated in a DOL hearing concerning the proposal on August 11, 2015. The DOL's final version of the proposed rule is currently under review by the President's Office of Management and Budget. We currently expect a final rule to be published during the first half of 2016. 

As proposed, the rule would expand the circumstances under which providers of investment advice to small plan sponsors, plan participants and beneficiaries, and IRA investors are deemed to act in a fiduciary capacity. The rule would require such providers to act in their clients' "best interests", not influenced by any conflicts of interest, including due to the direct or indirect receipt of compensation. The DOL concurrently proposed a "best interest contract exemption" intended to enable continuation of certain existing industry practices relating to receipt of commissions and other compensation, but the exemption includes conditions and requirements that may make it costly or difficult to rely upon in practice. Although the final outcome of the DOL rulemaking remains uncertain, the proposed rule, if adopted in its current form, would substantially change the legal framework within which we deliver ERISA plan distribution support and investment education, conduct rollover discussions with plan participants and beneficiaries, and provide investment advice to IRA owners. While these changes, as proposed, would restrict certain advisory practices and compensation arrangements that are common in our industry, we believe our experience providing retirement and investment products and services in a fiduciary environment positions us well to remain competitive as the industry adjusts to any final rulemaking from the DOL. 

The SEC also has indicated that it may propose rules creating a uniform standard of conduct applicable to broker-dealers and investment advisers, which, if adopted may affect the distribution of our products. Should the SEC rules, if adopted, not align with any finalized DOL regulations related to conflicts of interest in the provision of investment advice, the distribution of our products could be further complicated. 

The DOL has also issued a number of regulations recently, and may issue similar additional regulations, that increase the level of disclosure that must be provided to plan sponsors and participants. These ERISA disclosure requirements will likely increase the regulatory and compliance burden on us, resulting in increased costs. 

In November 2015, the DOL published a proposed rule that would exempt certain state-sponsored IRA savings plans from ERISA. This rule, if enacted, would enable the growth of state sponsored IRA savings plans for the currently underserved small-employer market, where there has been limited adoption of workplace retirement savings plans. We do not believe this rule would have a material impact on our business, as the state-sponsored plans would be aimed at workers who do not currently participate in any workplace retirement plan. On January 19, 2016, we submitted a comment letter to the DOL in which we urged the DOL to withdraw this proposed rule entirely, and instead make it easier for small employers to make traditional 401(k) plans available to their workers - an approach that we believe would more effectively address the currently underserved market. 

Trust Activities Regulation 

Voya Institutional Trust Company ("VITC"), our wholly owned subsidiary, was formed in 2014 as a trust bank chartered by the Connecticut Department of Banking and is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Connecticut Department of Banking. VITC is not permitted to, and does not, accept deposits (other than incidental to its trust and custodial activities). VITC&#8217;s activities are primarily to serve as trustee or custodian for retirement plans or IRAs. 

Voya Investment Trust Co., our wholly owned subsidiary, is a limited purpose trust company chartered with the Connecticut Department of Banking. Voya Investment Trust Co. is not permitted to, and does not, accept deposits (other than incidental to its trust activities). Voya Investment Trust Co.&#8217;s activities are primarily to serve as trustee for and manage various collective and common trust funds. Voya Investment Trust Co. is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Connecticut Banking Commissioner and is subject to state fiduciary duty laws. In addition, the collective trust funds managed by Voya Investment Trust Co. are generally subject to ERISA. 

Financial Reform Legislation and Initiatives 

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 

On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act, which effects comprehensive changes to the regulation of financial services in the United States. The Dodd-Frank Act directs existing and newly-created government agencies and bodies to perform studies and promulgate a multitude of regulations implementing the law, a process that is underway and is expected to continue over the next few years. While some studies have already been completed and the rule-making process is well underway, there continues to be significant uncertainty regarding the results of ongoing studies and the ultimate requirements of those 

&#160; 

regulations that have not yet been adopted. We cannot predict with certainty how the Dodd-Frank Act and such regulations will affect the financial markets generally, or impact our business, ratings, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. 

The Dodd-Frank Act created a new agency, the FSOC, which is authorized to subject non-bank financial companies to the supervision of the Federal Reserve if the FSOC determines that, among other matters, material financial distress at the company or the scope of the company&#8217;s activities could pose risks to the financial stability of the United States. If we were designated by the FSOC as a systemically significant non-bank financial company subject to supervision by the Federal Reserve, we would become subject to a comprehensive system of prudential regulation, including minimum capital requirements, liquidity standards, credit exposure requirements, overall risk management requirements, management interlock prohibitions, a requirement to maintain a plan for rapid and orderly dissolution in the event of severe financial distress, stress testing, and additional fees and assessments and restrictions on proprietary trading and certain investments. The exact scope and consequences of these standards and requirements are subject to ongoing rulemaking activity by various federal banking regulators and therefore are currently unclear. However, this comprehensive system of prudential regulation, if applied to the Company, would significantly impact the manner in which we operate and could materially and adversely impact the profitability of one or more of our business lines or the level of capital required to support our activities. In designating non-bank financial companies for heightened prudential regulation by the Federal Reserve, the FSOC considers, among other matters, their scope, size, and potential impact of their activities on the financial stability of the United States. 

In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act contains numerous other provisions, some of which may have an impact on us. These include: 

&#8226; 

The FSOC may recommend that state insurance regulators or other regulators apply new or heightened standards and safeguards for activities or practices we and other insurers or other financial services companies engage in if the FSOC determines that those activities or practices could create or increase the risk that significant liquidity, credit or other problems spread among financial companies. We cannot predict whether any such recommendations will be made or their effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. 

&#8226; 

The Dodd-Frank Act creates a new framework for regulating over-the-counter ("OTC") derivatives, which may increase the costs of hedging and other permitted derivatives trading activity undertaken by us. Under the new regulatory regime and subject to certain exceptions, certain standardized OTC interest rate and credit derivatives must now be cleared through a centralized clearinghouse and executed on a centralized exchange or execution facility, and the CFTC and the SEC may designate additional types of OTC derivatives for mandatory clearing and trade execution requirements in the future. In addition to mandatory central clearing and trade execution of certain OTC derivatives, market participants like us are or will be (directly or indirectly) subject to regulatory requirements which may include reporting and recordkeeping, and capital and margin requirements. The transition to central clearing and the new regulatory regime governing OTC derivatives (especially margin requirements for non-cleared derivatives) presents potentially significant business, liquidity and operational risk for us which could materially and adversely impact both the cost and our ability to effectively hedge various risks, including equity, interest rate, currency and duration risks within many of our insurance and annuity products and investment portfolios. In addition, inconsistencies between the Dodd-Frank Act regime and parallel regimes in other jurisdictions, such as the EU, may increase costs of hedging or inhibit our ability to access market liquidity in those other jurisdictions. 

&#8226; 

The CFTC and SEC jointly adopted final rules, which exempt various products regulated as insurance from the definition of "swap" and "security-based swap". However, the exemption does not extend to certain stable value products issued by insurance companies, which the SEC and CFTC are required to further study to determine whether such products should be regulated as swaps or security-based swaps. Pending such determination, stable value products are not subject to the swap provisions of this legislation. However, until further action by the SEC and CFTC, there is uncertainty whether certain stable value products offered by our insurance subsidiaries will be regulated under the Dodd-Frank Act as swaps or security-based swaps, which could adversely affect the profitability or marketability of such products. 

&#8226; 

The Dodd-Frank Act established FIO within the Treasury Department to be headed by a director appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury. See "&#8212;Insurance Regulation&#8212;Federal Initiatives Affecting Insurance Operations" above. 

&#8226; 

The Dodd-Frank Act includes various securities law reforms that may affect our business practices and the liabilities and/or exposures associated therewith. See "&#8212;Broker-Dealers and Investment Advisers" above. 

Until final regulations are promulgated pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on our businesses, products, results of operation and financial condition will remain unclear. 

&#160; 

Other Laws and Regulations 

USA Patriot Act 

The Patriot Act contains anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws applicable to broker-dealers and other financial services companies, including insurance companies. The Patriot Act seeks to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering. Anti-money laundering laws outside of the United States contain provisions that may be different, conflicting or more rigorous. Internal practices, procedures and controls are required to meet the increased obligations of financial institutions to identify their customers, watch for and report suspicious transactions, respond to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies and share information with other financial institutions. 

We are also required to follow certain economic and trade sanctions programs administered by the Office of Foreign Asset Control that prohibit or restrict transactions with suspected countries, their governments and, in certain circumstances, their nationals. We are also subject to regulations governing bribery and other anti-corruption measures. 

Privacy Laws and Regulation 

U.S. federal and state laws and regulations require financial institutions, including insurance companies, to protect the security and confidentiality of personal information and to notify consumers about their policies and practices relating to their collection and disclosure of consumer information and the protection of the security and confidentiality of that information. The disclosure and security of protected health information is also governed by federal and state laws. In particular, regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services regulate the disclosure and use of protected health information by health insurers and others (including life insurers), the physical and procedural safeguards employed to protect the security of that information and the electronic transmission of such information. Federal and state laws require notice to affected individuals, law enforcement, regulators and others if there is a breach of the security of certain personal information, including social security numbers, and require holders of certain personal information to protect the security of the data. Federal regulations require financial institutions to implement effective programs to detect, prevent and mitigate identity theft. Federal and state laws and regulations regulate the ability of financial institutions to make telemarketing calls and to send unsolicited e-mail or fax messages to consumers and customers. Federal laws and regulations also regulate the permissible uses of certain types of personal information, including consumer report information. Federal and state governments and regulatory bodies may consider additional or more detailed regulation regarding these subjects. 

Environmental Considerations 

Our ownership and operation of real property and properties within our commercial mortgage loan portfolio is subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Risks of hidden environmental liabilities and the costs of any required clean-up are inherent in owning and operating real property. Under the laws of certain states, contamination of a property may give rise to a lien on the property to secure recovery of the costs of clean-up, which could adversely affect the valuation of, and increase the liabilities associated with, the commercial mortgage loans we hold. In several states, this lien has priority over the lien of an existing mortgage against such property. In addition, we may be liable, in certain circumstances, as an "owner" or "operator," for costs of cleaning-up releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances at a property mortgaged to us under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and the laws of certain states. Application of various other federal and state environmental laws could also result in the imposition of liability on us for costs associated with environmental hazards. 

We routinely conduct environmental assessments prior to closing any new commercial mortgage loans or to taking title to real estate. Although unexpected environmental liabilities can always arise, we seek to minimize this risk by undertaking these environmental assessments and complying with our internal environmental policies and procedures. 

Health Care Reform Legislation 

In March 2010, the President signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which was subsequently amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (together, the "Health Care Act"). 

There is significant uncertainty surrounding the impact of the Health Care Act on insurers which may create risks to products we offer, including Stop Loss Insurance sold to employers offering self-insured health plans. In addition, should the Treasury 

&#160; 

Department issue guidance concluding that insurers offering Stop Loss Insurance are considered health care providers, we may face adverse tax or other financial consequences. 

U.S. Supreme Court Decision regarding Same-Sex Marriage 

On June 26, 2015, the United States Supreme Court held in Obergefell v. Hodges &#32;that same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry, and accordingly, marriages between same-sex couples may now be celebrated, and will now be recognized, in all 50 states. We expect this decision to result in changes to the administration of retirement and other benefit plans in various U.S. states, although we cannot predict with certainty how these changes will affect our business. In particular, it is possible that changes to our tax reporting and withholding systems will be required in order to comply with applicable state tax regulations.
